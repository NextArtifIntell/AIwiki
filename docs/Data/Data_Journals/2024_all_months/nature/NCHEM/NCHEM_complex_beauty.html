  abstract     = {The photomodulation of the helical pitch of cholesteric liquid crystals results in dynamic and coloured canvases that can potentially be used in applications ranging from energy-efficient displays to colour filters, anti-counterfeiting tags and liquid crystal (LC) lasers. Here we report on the analysis of a series of photoswitchable chiral dopants that combine the large geometrical change and bistability of hydrazone switches with the efficient helical pitch induction of the chiral motif, triptycene. We elucidate the effects that conformational flexibility, dispersion forces and π–π interactions have on the chirality transfer ability of the dopant. We then use the irradiation time with visible light (442 nm) combined with a simple digital light processing microscope projection set-up to draw numerous stable multi-coloured images on an LC canvas, showcasing the fine control this dopant yields over the LC assembly. Understanding how photoswitchable chiral dopants can control the helical pitch of host liquid crystals will aid the development of smart and adaptive soft materials. Now the molecular-level mechanisms that control the chirality transfer in chiral triptycene-containing bistable hydrazones have been elucidated. This enables the preparation of rewritable multi-coloured liquid crystal canvases.},

  abstract     = {Enzymes are renowned for their catalytic efficiency and selectivity, but many classical transformations in organic synthesis have no biocatalytic counterpart. Aldolases are prodigious C–C bond-forming enzymes, but their reactivity has only been extended past activated carbonyl electrophiles in special cases. To probe the mechanistic origins of this limitation, we use a pair of aldolases whose activity is dependent on pyridoxal phosphate. Our results reveal how aldolases are limited by kinetically favourable proton transfer with solvent, which undermines aldol addition into ketones. We show how a transaldolase can circumvent this limitation, enabling efficient addition into unactivated ketones. The resulting products are highly sought non-canonical amino acids with side chains that contain chiral tertiary alcohols. Mechanistic analysis reveals that transaldolase activity is an intrinsic feature of pyridoxal phosphate chemistry and identifies principles for extending aldolase catalysis beyond its previous limits to enable convergent, enantioselective C–C bond formation from simple starting materials. Aldolases have been a mainstay in synthesis, but their scope has been limited to activated electrophiles. Now carbon–carbon bond formation with ketone electrophiles is enabled by transaldolases, which form a strong nucleophile that is resistant to protonation. This chemistry enables convergent synthesis of non-canonical amino acids bearing tertiary alcohol side chains.},

We demonstrate that Tri17, a promiscuous ATP- and nitrite-dependent enzyme, catalyses organic azide synthesis through sequential N-nitrosation and dehydration of aryl hydrazines. Through biochemical, structural and computational analyses, we further propose a plausible molecular mechanism for azide synthesis that sets the stage for future biocatalytic applications and biosynthetic pathway engineering. Despite widespread use of azides across material science and various areas across chemistry, the underlying biosynthetic pathways for its formation have so far been unknown. Now, a promiscuous ATP-utilizing enzyme, Tri17, capable of synthesizing various azide molecules has been identified.

However, their synthesis relies on specially designed glycosyl donors, which are often unstable and require multi-step synthesis. Furthermore, the catalytic and stereoselective installation of arylated quaternary stereocentres on sugar rings remains a formidable challenge. Here we report a facile and versatile method for the synthesis of diverse C–R (where R is an aryl, heteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl or alkyl) glycosides from readily available and bench-stable 1-deoxyglycosides. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across a broad range of glycosyl units. This protocol can be used to synthesize challenging 2-deoxyglycosides, unprotected glycosides, non-classical glycosides and deuterated glycosides. We further developed the catalyst-controlled site-divergent functionalization of carbohydrates for the synthesis of various unexplored carbohydrates containing arylated quaternary stereocentres that are inaccessible by existing methods. The synthetic utility of this strategy is further demonstrated in the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules and carbohydrates. The synthesis of C-glycosides relies on specially designed glycosyl donors, which are often unstable and require multi-step synthesis. Now a facile method for the synthesis of diverse C-glycosides from readily available and stable 1-deoxyglycosides has been developed.

  abstract     = {Sustainable CO2 conversion is crucial in curbing excess emissions. Molybdenum carbide catalysts have demonstrated excellent performances for catalytic CO2 conversion, but harsh carburization syntheses and poor stabilities make studies challenging. Here an unsaturated Mo oxide (Mo17O47) shows a high activity for the reverse water–gas shift reaction, without carburization pretreatments, and remains stable for 2,000 h at 600 °C. Flame spray pyrolysis synthesis and Ir promoter facilitate the formation of Mo17O47 and its in situ carburization during reaction. The reaction-induced cubic α-MoC with unsaturated Mo oxycarbide (MoOxCy) on the surface serves as the active sites that are crucial for catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the C atom in CO2 inserts itself in the vacancy between two Mo atoms, and releases CO by taking another C atom from the oxycarbide to regenerate the vacancy, following a carbon cycle pathway. The design of Mo catalysts with unsaturated oxycarbide active sites affords new territory for high-temperature applications and provides alternative pathways for CO2 conversion. While Mo carbide catalysts have demonstrated excellent performance for CO2 conversion chemistry, these catalysts require harsh synthetic conditions and have poor reaction stabilities. Here flame-synthesized unsaturated Mo oxides are shown to undergo carburization during the reverse water–gas shift reaction, and reaction-induced Mo oxycarbide active sites provide excellent catalytic performance.},

The impact of these Zn and Mn potentials is analysed for a pair of Ni-catalysed reactions, each showing a preference for one of the two reductants. Ni-catalysed coupling of N-alkyl-2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium reagents (Katritzky salts) with aryl halides are then compared under chemical reaction conditions, using Zn or Mn reductants, and under electrochemical conditions performed at applied potentials corresponding to the Zn and Mn reduction potentials and at potentials optimized to achieve the maximum yield. The collective results illuminate the important role of reductant redox potential in Ni-catalysed XEC reactions. Zinc and manganese are commonly used reductants but their redox potentials in organic solvents have not been studied. Now, these redox potentials have been measured, revealing the impact of solvents and additives. The reductant potential substantially influences the performance of nickel-catalysed cross-electrophile coupling reactions, highlighting the merits of tunable electrochemical reduction.},

This strategy enables the synthesis of biorelevant amine motifs by reductive hydroamination of alkynes with nitroarenes. Using this triple cascade approach, we have achieved exceptional functional group tolerance, enabling the use of bulk chemical feedstocks as coupling partners for the amination of both simple and complex alkynes (&amp;gt;100 examples), including those derived from pharmaceuticals, peptides and natural products (&amp;gt;30 examples). The isolation and full crystallographic characterization of gold hydride and hydride-bridged gold complexes has garnered insights into the catalyst differentiation process of fundamental organometallic gold hydride complexes. Amines are predominant motifs in pharmaceuticals, but complex amines are challenging to generate. Now, enabled by triple Au–H/Au+/Au–H relay catalysis, the synthesis of complex and structurally diverse amines by a direct reductive hydroamination of alkynes with nitroarenes is reported.

We investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, the first steps of charge-transfer processes initiated by prompt ionization in prototype donor–π–acceptor molecules, namely nitroanilines. Time-resolved measurement of this process is performed by combining attosecond XUV-pump/few-femtosecond infrared-probe spectroscopy with advanced many-body quantum chemistry calculations. We show that a concerted nuclear and electronic motion drives electron transfer from the donor group on a sub-10-fs timescale. This is followed by a sub-30-fs relaxation process due to the probing of the continuously spreading nuclear wave packet in the excited electronic states of the molecular cation. These findings shed light on the role played by electron–nuclear coupling in donor–π–acceptor systems in response to photoionization. The first steps of charge transfer in molecules after their interaction with light occur on an ultrafast timescale. Now, by combining attosecond pump/few-femtosecond probe spectroscopy with quantum chemistry calculations, it has been shown that a concerted nuclear and electronic motion drives electron transfer in donor–π–acceptor molecules on a sub-10-fs timescale.},

  abstract     = {Nitriles (R–C≡N) have been investigated since the late eighteenth century and are ubiquitous encounters in organic and inorganic syntheses. In contrast, heavier nitriles, which contain the heavier analogues of carbon and nitrogen, are sparsely investigated species. Here we report the synthesis and isolation of a phosphino-silylene featuring an N-heterocyclic carbene-phosphinidene and a highly sterically demanding silyl group as substituents. Due to its unique structural motif, it can be regarded as a Lewis base-stabilized heavier nitrile. The Si–P bond displays multiple bond character and a bent R–Si–P geometry, the latter indicating fundamental differences between heavier and classical nitriles. In solution, a quantitative unusual rearrangement to a phosphasilenylidene occurs. This rearrangement is consistent with theoretical predictions of rearrangements from heavier nitriles to heavier isonitriles. Our preliminary reactivity studies revealed that both isomers exhibit highly nucleophilic silicon centres capable of oxidative addition and coordination to iron tetracarbonyl. Multiple bonds between heavier main-group elements may exhibit different properties and reactivity compared with their second-row counterparts. Now it has been shown that a NHC-stabilized phosphasilyne, a heavier analogue of nitrile, undergoes thermal isomerization to yield a phosphasilenylidene; this represents a rare example of heavier nitrile–isonitrile isomerization.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization represents a powerful means to convert flat aromatic compounds into stereochemically well-defined three-dimensional molecular scaffolds. Using new-to-nature metalloredox biocatalysis, we describe an enzymatic strategy for catalytic asymmetric dearomatization via a challenging radical mechanism that has eluded small-molecule catalysts. Enabled by directed evolution, new-to-nature radical dearomatases P450rad1–P450rad5 facilitated asymmetric dearomatization of a broad spectrum of aromatic substrates, including indoles, pyrroles and phenols, allowing both enantioconvergent and enantiodivergent radical dearomatization reactions to be accomplished with excellent enzymatic control. Computational studies revealed the importance of additional hydrogen bonding interactions between the engineered metalloenzyme and the reactive intermediate in enhancing enzymatic activity and enantiocontrol. Furthermore, designer non-ionic surfactants were found to significantly accelerate this biotransformation, providing an alternative means to promote otherwise sluggish new-to-nature biotransformations. Together, this evolvable metalloenzyme platform opens up new avenues to advance challenging catalytic asymmetric dearomatization processes involving free radical intermediates. Catalytic asymmetric radical dearomatization has remained a daunting task due to the challenges in exerting stereocontrol over highly reactive radical intermediates. Now, using metalloredox biocatalysis, new-to-nature radical dearomatases P450rad1–P450rad5 have been engineered to facilitate asymmetric dearomatization of a broad spectrum of aromatic substrates, including indoles, pyrroles and phenols.},

  abstract     = {Nitriles are uncommon in nature and are typically constructed from oximes through the oxidative decarboxylation of amino acid substrates or from the derivatization of carboxylic acids. Here we report a third nitrile biosynthesis strategy featuring the cyanobacterial nitrile synthase AetD. During the biosynthesis of the eagle-killing neurotoxin, aetokthonotoxin, AetD transforms the 2-aminopropionate portion of 5,7-dibromo-l-tryptophan to a nitrile. Employing a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical techniques, we characterized AetD as a non-haem diiron enzyme that belongs to the emerging haem-oxygenase-like dimetal oxidase superfamily. High-resolution crystal structures of AetD together with the identification of catalytically relevant products provide mechanistic insights into how AetD affords this unique transformation, which we propose proceeds via an aziridine intermediate. Our work presents a unique template for nitrile biogenesis and portrays a substrate binding and metallocofactor assembly mechanism that may be shared among other haem-oxygenase-like dimetal oxidase enzymes. Nitrile-containing molecules and their biosynthetic enzymes are uncommon in nature. Now, a nitrile-forming diiron enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of aetokthonotoxin—the ‘eagle-killing’ neurotoxin—has been characterized using biochemical, structural and biophysical methods. High-resolution protein crystal structures together with the identification of catalytically relevant tryptophan-based products provide mechanistic insights into this unusual nitrile-forming reaction.},

  abstract     = {The storage of hydrogen is key to its applications. Developing adsorbent materials with high volumetric and gravimetric storage capacities, both of which are essential for the efficient use of hydrogen as a fuel, is challenging. Here we report a controlled catenation strategy in hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (RP-H100 and RP-H101) that depends on multiple hydrogen bonds to guide catenation in a point-contact manner, resulting in high volumetric and gravimetric surface areas, robustness and ideal pore diameters (~1.2–1.9 nm) for hydrogen storage. This approach involves assembling nine imidazole-annulated triptycene hexaacids into a secondary hexagonal superstructure containing three open channels through which seven of the hexagons interpenetrate to form a seven-fold catenated superstructure. RP-H101 exhibits high deliverable volumetric (53.7 g l−1) and gravimetric (9.3 wt%) capacities for hydrogen under a combined temperature and pressure swing (77 K/100 bar → 160 K/5 bar). This work illustrates the virtues of supramolecular crystals as promising candidates for hydrogen storage. The development of materials for efficient hydrogen storage is desirable. Now, hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks exhibiting both high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities have been synthesized; hydrogen-bonding interactions are key to guide the catenation of the structure, effectively minimizing the surface area loss in the supramolecular crystals.},

However, efficient strategies to differentiate and sort such congeneric compounds are lacking, posing daunting challenges for synthetic endeavours aimed at their orderly incorporation. Here we report a dynamic amine-sorting strategy that incorporates the chemoselective formation of the aminomethyl cyclopalladated complex to achieve the efficient differentiation of amine congeners. A series of amines sharing similar three-dimensional structures and properties, as well as possessing notoriously strong binding ability to metals, can be efficiently differentiated, enabling the highly chemo-, regio- and enantioselective multicomponent aminomethylamination of dienes to construct a variety of unsymmetrical chiral diamines. This dynamic amine-sorting strategy tackles the long-standing challenge of precise differentiation and orderly incorporation of aliphatic amines with subtle differences. From a broader perspective, the success demonstrates that meticulously designed metal complexes can provide flexible and general solutions for controlling delicate selectivities in sophisticated synthesis. Efficient strategies to differentiate and sort congeneric compounds are lacking. Now a metal-mediated dynamic amine-sorting strategy has been developed to precisely differentiate and assemble different amine congeners in an orderly manner, facilitating highly chemo-, regio- and enantioselective aminomethylamination of dienes for the construction of unsymmetrical chiral diamines.},

  abstract     = {Fluorescent proteins are indispensable tools in biological and medical research. The fluorophores are typically encoded by the primary amino acid sequence, from which a fluorescent molecular rotor structure forms upon protein folding. Here, inspired by the fluorogenic property exhibited by native fluorophores, we designed a collection of fluorogenic non-canonical amino acids that feature this molecular rotor structure—termed fluorescent molecular rotor amino acids (FMR-AAs)—akin to native fluorescent protein fluorophores. By incorporating FMR-AAs into target proteins through an expanded genetic code, we use them as encoded fluorophore analogues within a confined protein microenvironment, thus readily transforming diverse non-fluorescent proteins into artificial fluorescent proteins. We also use FMR-AAs in selected proteins as sensitive fluorescent probes for monitoring protein–protein interactions and detecting protein conformational changes in vitro and in living cells. This approach enables the generation of artificial fluorescent proteins and the development of biosensors from potentially any protein of interest with minor modifications. The toolbox of artificial fluorescent proteins can be expanded by engineering mimics of the molecular rotor-based fluorophore found in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into diverse protein scaffolds. Now, by genetically encoding mimics of the GFP fluorophore, any protein of interest can be modified to fluoresce either under select circumstances or always (when folded).},

Therefore, the development of synthetic methods for the construction of N-heterocycles is of great importance in the synthetic community. Altering the ring system of these motifs to analogues with different ring sizes by employing molecular editing techniques would be highly appealing in medicinal chemistry. We present herein the direct insertion of glycine derivatives as two-carbon synthons into unstrained five- or six-membered saturated cyclic amines at predictable sites, enabling the construction of synthetically challenging medium-sized azacycles through sequential Ru-catalysed C‒C bond formation, retro-aza-Michael addition and a lactamization process. Upon further derivation, we leverage this homologation platform to realize modular insertion of one- or two-carbon units into the aliphatic rings. The conversion of a single azacycle into up to five others provides a promising toolbox for diversifying existing drug candidates and increasing the prospects for clinical success. Saturated N-heterocycles are ubiquitous structures among natural products and biologically active compounds, but methods to edit the ring size of these substructures are scarce. Now the ring expansion of unactivated cyclic amines has been achieved via sequential Ru-catalysed C‒C bond formation, retro-aza-Michael addition and a lactamization process to construct synthetically challenging medium-sized azacycles.},

  abstract     = {All primary chemical interactions weaken under mechanical stress, which imposes fundamental mechanical limits on the materials constructed from them. Biological materials combine plasticity with strength, for which nature has evolved a unique solution—catch bonds, supramolecular interactions that strengthen under tension. Biological catch bonds use force-gated conformational switches to convert weak bonds into strong ones. So far, catch bonds remain exclusive to nature, leaving their potential as mechanoadaptive elements in synthetic systems untapped. Here we report the design and realization of artificial catch bonds. Starting from a minimal set of thermodynamic design requirements, we created a molecular motif capable of catch bonding. It consists of a DNA duplex featuring a cryptic domain that unfolds under tension to strengthen the interaction. We show that these catch bonds recreate force-enhanced rolling adhesion, a hallmark feature of biological catch bonds in bacteria and leukocytes. This Article introduces catch bonds into the synthetic domain, and could lead to the creation of artificial catch-bonded materials. Whereas bonds that strengthen under mechanical stress occur frequently in nature, all synthetic bonds weaken under force. Now, an artificial supramolecular catch bond has been shown to strengthen the particle–surface interface under increasing shear flow in a rolling adhesion assay, thereby mimicking biological adhesion processes.},

Weaving purely organic molecular threads into flawless two-dimensional patterns remains a formidable challenge, even though its feasibility has been proposed on several occasions. Herein we describe the synthesis of a flawless, purely organic, free-standing two-dimensional woven polymer network driven by dative B−N bonds. Single crystals of this woven polymer network were obtained and its well-defined woven topology was revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Free-standing two-dimensional monolayer nanosheets of the woven polymer network were exfoliated from the layered crystals using Scotch Magic Tape. The surface features of the nanosheets were investigated by integrated low-dose and cryogenic electron microscopy imaging techniques. These findings demonstrate the precise construction of purely organic woven polymer networks and highlight the unique opportunities for the application of woven topologies in two-dimensional organic materials. Weaving purely organic molecular threads into two-dimensional patterns remains a formidable challenge. Now, driven by the formation of dative B–N bonds, a purely organic, two-dimensional and flawless woven polymer network has been prepared. In addition, free-standing monolayers of woven polymer nanosheets have been obtained through mechanical exfoliation.},

There are gaps in our understanding of E3 mechanisms, and here we use protein semisynthesis, chemical rescue, microscale thermophoresis and other biochemical approaches to dissect the role of catalytic base/acid function and conformational interconversion in HECT-domain E3 catalysis. We demonstrate that there is plasticity in the use of the terminal side chain or backbone carboxylate for proton transfer in HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase reactions, with yeast Rsp5 orthologues appearing to be possible evolutionary intermediates. We also show that the HECT-domain ubiquitin covalent intermediate appears to eject the E2 conjugating enzyme, promoting catalytic turnover. These findings provide key mechanistic insights into how protein ubiquitination occurs and provide a framework for understanding E3 functions and regulation. Lysine ubiquitination, catalysed by E3 ubiquitin ligases, is pivotal for regulating protein stability and cell signalling. Using protein semisynthesis, the roles of the C-terminal carboxylate and conformational interconversion in HECT-domain E3 catalysis are now characterized, revealing evolutionary plasticity in side chain versus backbone utilization.},

  abstract     = {Two of nature’s recurring binding motifs in metalloproteins are the CxxxCxxC motif in radical SAM enzymes and the 2-His-1-carboxylate motif found both in zincins and α-ketoglutarate and non-haem iron enzymes. Here we show the confluence of these two domains in a single post-translational modifying enzyme containing an N-terminal radical S-adenosylmethionine domain fused to a C-terminal 2-His-1-carboxylate (HExxH) domain. The radical SAM domain catalyses three-residue cyclophane formation and is the signature modification of triceptides, a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides. The HExxH domain is a defining feature of zinc metalloproteases. Yet the HExxH motif-containing domain studied here catalyses β-hydroxylation and is an α-ketoglutarate non-haem iron enzyme. We determined the crystal structure for this HExxH protein at 2.8 Å, unveiling a distinct structural fold, thus expanding the family of α-ketoglutarate non-haem iron enzymes with a class that we propose to name αKG-HExxH. αKG-HExxH proteins represent a unique family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide modifying enzymes that can furnish opportunities for genome mining, synthetic biology and enzymology. Radical SAM (rSAM) and 2-His-1-carboxylate enzymes are known to co-occur in RiPP biosynthetic pathways. Here we show the fusion of these enzymes in a single protein where the rSAM enzyme catalyzes cyclophane formation. The 2-His-1-carboxylate enzymes—termed αKG-HExxH—are α-ketoglutarate non-haem iron enzymes that harbour a distinct fold and catalyse β-hydroxylation.},

Here, using a crossed-molecular-beam experiment in which individual rotational quantum states of specific conformers of a molecule are separated, we study the chemi-ionization reaction of hydroquinone with metastable neon atoms. We show that collision-induced alignment of the reaction partners caused by geometry-dependent long-range forces influences reaction pathways, which is, however, countered by molecular rotation. The present work provides insights into the conformation-specific stereodynamics of complex polyatomic systems and illustrates the capability of advanced molecule-control techniques to unravel these effects. Molecular geometry can influence chemical reactivity through several opposing effects. By selecting individual conformers of hydroquinone in the chemi-ionization reaction with metastable neon, it is now shown that reaction pathways can be governed by molecular alignment due to geometry-dependent forces that are, however, countered by molecular rotation.},

  abstract     = {Selenium is an essential micronutrient, but its presence in biology has been limited to protein and nucleic acid biopolymers. The recent identification of a biosynthetic pathway for selenium-containing small molecules suggests that there is a larger family of selenometabolites that remains to be discovered. Here we identify a recently evolved branch of abundant and uncharacterized metalloenzymes that we predict are involved in selenometabolite biosynthesis using a bioinformatic search strategy that relies on the mapping of composite active site motifs. Biochemical studies confirm this prediction and show that these enzymes form an unusual C–Se bond onto histidine, thus giving rise to a distinct selenometabolite and potent antioxidant that we have termed ovoselenol. Aside from providing insights into the evolution of this enzyme class and the structural basis of C–Se bond formation, our work offers a blueprint for charting the microbial selenometabolome in the future. Although biosynthetic pathways of selenium-containing macromolecules have been known for decades, pathways for specific incorporation of selenium into small molecules have only recently begun to be uncovered. Now the selenometabolome is expanded further through the discovery and biosynthetic elucidation of ovoselenol, a selenium-containing antioxidant found in marine microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {The photophysical processes of singlet fission and triplet fusion have numerous emerging applications. They involve the separation of a photo-generated singlet exciton into two dark triplet excitons and the fusion of two dark triplet excitons into an emissive singlet exciton, respectively. The role of the excimer state and the nature of the triplet-pair state in these processes have been a matter of contention. Here we analyse the room temperature time-resolved emission of a neat liquid singlet fission chromophore and show that it exhibits three spectral components: two that correspond to the bright singlet and excimer states and a third component that becomes more prominent during triplet fusion. This spectrum is enhanced by magnetic fields, confirming its origins in the recombination of weakly coupled triplet pairs. It is thus attributed to a strongly coupled triplet pair state. These observations unite the view that there is an emissive intermediate in singlet fission and triplet fusion, distinct from the broad, unstructured excimer emission. Singlet fission produces two molecular excitations from one photon and has the potential to boost solar cell efficiencies. Now it has been shown that magnetic fields can reveal the spectral signatures of the multi-excitonic intermediates in this process.},

These species are believed to be key intermediates in the degradation/combustion of organic phosphorus compounds, a class of chemicals that includes chemical warfare agents and flame retardants. Here we describe the isolation of a two-coordinate phosphorus(III) oxide under ambient conditions, enabled by the use of an extremely bulky amine ligand. Reactivity studies reveal that the phosphorus centre can be readily oxidized, and that in doing so, the P–O bond remains intact, an observation that is of interest to the proposed reactivity of transient phosphorus(III) oxides. Phosphinidene oxides are intermediates in the combustion of organic phosphorus compounds; however, they are highly unstable and their observation requires ultralow temperatures. Now it has been shown that a combination of steric bulk and electronic stabilization enables the isolation and manipulation of a two-coordinate phosphorus(III) oxide compound at room temperature.},

Although the facile substitutions of malononitrile can give structurally diverse quaternary carbons, their access to enantioenriched molecules, particularly chiral amines that are prevalent in bioactive compounds, remains rare. Here we report a cobalt-catalysed desymmetric reduction of disubstituted malononitriles to give highly functionalized β-quaternary amines. The pair of cobalt salt and sodium borohydride is proposed to generate a cobalt-hydride intermediate and initiate the reduction. Meanwhile, the enantiocontrol of the dinitrile is achieved through a tailored bisoxazoline ligand with two large flanks that create a narrow gap to host the bystanding nitrile and thus restrict the C(ipso)−C(α) bond rotation of the complexed one. Combined with the extensive derivatization possibilities of all substituents on the quaternary carbon, this asymmetric reduction unlocks pathways from malononitrile as a bulk chemical feedstock to intricate, chiral nitrogen-containing molecules. Malononitriles are widely used precursors for the synthesis of diverse enantioenriched nitrogen-containing molecules, but controlling the stereochemistry of their asymmetric transformations is challenging. Now, the desymmetric reduction of disubstituted malononitriles to chiral amines has been achieved, enabled by a bidentate ligand with extended flanks that can differentiate between the precursor’s nitrile groups through tailored steric pairings.},

  abstract     = {The transport of excess protons in water is central to acid–base chemistry, biochemistry and energy production. However, elucidating its mechanism has been challenging. Recent nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy experiments could not be explained by existing models. Here we use both vibrational spectroscopy calculations and neural-network-based molecular dynamics simulations that account for nuclear quantum effects for all atoms to determine the proton transport mechanism. Our simulations reveal an equilibrium between two stable proton-localized structures with distinct Eigen-like and Zundel-like hydrogen-bond motifs. Proton transport follows a three-step mechanism gated by two successive hydrogen-bond exchanges: the first reduces the proton-acceptor water coordination, leading to proton transfer, and the second, the rate-limiting step, prevents rapid back-transfer by increasing the proton-donor coordination. This sequential mechanism is consistent with experimental characterizations of proton diffusion, explaining the low activation energy and the prolonged intermediate lifetimes in vibrational spectroscopy. These results are crucial for understanding proton dynamics in biochemical and technological systems. Recent vibrational spectroscopy experiments suggested that excess proton transport in water is more complex than previously thought. Now the proton transport mechanism has been explored using neural-network-based simulations and related to experimental measurements through vibrational spectra calculations.

  abstract     = {Sustainable manufacturing that prioritizes energy efficiency, minimal water use, scalability and the ability to generate diverse materials is essential to advance inorganic materials production while maintaining environmental consciousness. However, current manufacturing practices are not yet equipped to fully meet these requirements. Here we describe a flash-within-flash Joule heating (FWF) technique—a non-equilibrium, ultrafast heat conduction method—to prepare ten transition metal dichalcogenides, three group XIV dichalcogenides and nine non-transition metal dichalcogenide materials, each in under 5 s while in ambient conditions. FWF achieves enormous advantages in facile gram scalability and in sustainable manufacturing criteria when compared with other synthesis methods. Also, FWF allows the production of phase-selective and single-crystalline bulk powders, a phenomenon rarely observed by any other synthesis method. Furthermore, FWF MoSe2 outperformed commercially available MoSe2 in tribology, showcasing the quality of FWF materials. The capability for atom substitution and doping further highlights the versatility of FWF as a general bulk inorganic materials synthesis protocol. The scalable, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly production of solid-state materials is crucial for next-generation material synthesis. Now an efficient and gram-scale synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides, group XIV dichalcogenides and non-transition metal dichalcogenides has been achieved using the flash-within-flash heating technique, a non-equilibrium, ultrafast heat conduction method.},

Despite notable advancements in olefination methods, a general strategy for the direct conversion of carboxylic acids, alcohols and alkanes into alkenes remains a formidable challenge owing to their inherent reactivity disparities. Here we demonstrate an integrated photochemical strategy that facilitates a one-pot conversion of these fundamental building blocks into alkenes through a sequential C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond formation–fragmentation process, utilizing an easily accessible and recyclable phenyl vinyl ketone as the ‘olefination reagent’. This practical method not only offers an unparalleled paradigm for accessing value-added alkenes from abundant and inexpensive starting materials but also showcases its versatility through various complex scenarios, including late-stage on-demand olefination of multifunctional molecules, chain homologation of acids and concise syntheses of bioactive molecules. Moreover, initiating from carboxylic acids, alcohols and alkanes, this protocol presents a complementary approach to traditional olefination methods, making it a highly valuable addition to the research toolkit for alkene synthesis. The synthesis of alkenes from carboxylic acids, alcohols and alkanes is a formidable challenge owing to their inherent differences in reactivity.

However, the regulatory network governing triplex DNA dynamics remains poorly understood.

We develop a chemical probe that exhibits exceptional specificity towards triplex DNA. By employing a co-binding-mediated proximity capture strategy, we enrich triplex DNA interactome for quantitative proteomics analysis. This enables the identification of a comprehensive list of proteins that interact with triplex DNA, characterized by diverse binding properties and regulatory mechanisms in their native chromatin context. As a demonstration, we validate DDX3X as an ATP-independent triplex DNA helicase to unwind substrates with a 5′ overhang to prevent DNA damage. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for exploring the biology and translational potential of triplex DNA. The regulatory network governing triplex DNA dynamics remains poorly understood.

Owing to their relatively weaker interactions compared to other chemical bonds, hydrogen bonds alone are generally insufficient to induce substantial changes in electrical properties, thus imposing severe constraints on their applications in related devices. Here we report a metal–insulator transition controlled by hydrogen bonds for an organic–inorganic (1,3-diaminopropane)0.5SnSe2 superlattice that exhibits a colossal on–off ratio of 107 in electrical resistivity. The key to inducing the transition is a change in the amino group’s hydrogen-bonding structure from dynamic to static. In the dynamic state, thermally activated free rotation continuously breaks and forms transient hydrogen bonds with adjacent Se anions. In the static state, the amino group forms three fixed-angle positions, each separated by 120°. Our findings contribute to the understanding of electrical phenomena in organic–inorganic hybrid materials and may be used for the design of future molecule-based electronic materials. Hydrogen bonds impact the chemical, physical and biological properties of molecular materials, but are rarely able to induce significant changes in electrical properties. Now a dynamic-to-static transition of hydrogen bonds in an organic–inorganic superlattice has been shown to yield a metal–insulator transition with an on–off ratio of 107 in electrical resistivity.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates regulate cellular function by compartmentalizing molecules without a surrounding membrane. Condensate function arises from the specific exclusion or enrichment of molecules. Thus, understanding condensate composition is critical to characterizing condensate function. Whereas principles defining macromolecular composition have been described, understanding of small-molecule composition remains limited. Here we quantified the partitioning of ~1,700 biologically relevant small molecules into condensates composed of different macromolecules. Partitioning varied nearly a million-fold across compounds but was correlated among condensates, indicating that disparate condensates are physically similar. For one system, the enriched compounds did not generally bind macromolecules with high affinity under conditions where condensates do not form, suggesting that partitioning is not governed by site-specific interactions. Correspondingly, a machine learning model accurately predicts partitioning using only computed physicochemical features of the compounds, chiefly those related to solubility and hydrophobicity. These results suggest that a hydrophobic environment emerges upon condensate formation, driving the enrichment and exclusion of small molecules. Biomolecular condensates compartmentalize molecules without membranes. Understanding condensate composition is important given that their function relies on the selective exclusion or enrichment of molecules. Now, investigating small-molecule partitioning reveals variations across compounds, yet correlations indicate physical similarities between disparate condensates. Machine learning accurately predicts partitioning on the basis of physicochemical features, demonstrating the role of a hydrophobic environment in driving enrichment and exclusion.},

  abstract     = {The extraordinary advances in carbene (R1–C–R2) chemistry have been fuelled by strategies to stabilize the electronic singlet state via π interactions. In contrast, the lack of similarly efficient approaches to obtain authentic triplet carbenes with appreciable lifetimes beyond cryogenic temperatures hampers their exploitation in synthesis and catalysis. Transition-metal substitution represents a potential strategy, but metallocarbenes (M–C–R) usually represent high-lying excited electronic configurations of the well-established carbyne complexes (M≡C–R). Here we report the synthesis and characterization of triplet metallocarbenes (M–C–SiMe3, M = PdII, PtII) that are persistent beyond cryogenic conditions, and their selective reactivity towards carbene C–H insertion and carbonylation. Bond analysis reveals significant stabilization by spin-polarized push–pull interactions along both π-bonding planes, which fundamentally differs from bonding in push–pull singlet carbenes. This bonding model, thus, expands key strategies for stabilizing the open-shell carbene electromers and closes a conceptual gap towards carbyne complexes. Although strategies to stabilize the singlet state of carbenes are known, obtaining stable triplet electromers remains a challenge. Now it has been shown that transition-metal substitution enables the generation of triplet metallocarbenes stabilized by spin-polarized push–pull interactions; these compounds exhibit appreciable lifetimes beyond cryogenic temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Developing highly effective catalysts for ammonia (NH3) synthesis is a challenging task. Even the current, prevalent iron-derived catalysts used for industrial NH3 synthesis require harsh reaction conditions and involve massive energy consumption. Here we show that anchoring buckminsterfullerene (C60) onto non-iron transition metals yields cluster-matrix co-catalysts that are highly efficient for NH3 synthesis. Such co-catalysts feature separate catalytic active sites for hydrogen and nitrogen. The ‘electron buffer’ behaviour of C60 balances the electron density at catalytic transition metal sites and enables the synergistic activation of nitrogen on transition metals in addition to the activation and migration of hydrogen on C60 sites. As demonstrated in long-term, continuous runs, the C60-promoting transition metal co-catalysts exhibit higher NH3 synthesis rates than catalysts without C60. With the involvement of C60, the rate-determining step in the cluster-matrix co-catalysis is found to be the hydrogenation of *NH2. C60 incorporation exemplifies a practical approach for solving hydrogen poisoning on a wide variety of oxide-supported Ru catalysts. Although ammonia synthesis represents a major chemical industry, developing highly effective non-iron catalysts is a challenging task. Now it has been shown that anchoring fullerene onto non-iron transition metals separates and activates catalytic sites for hydrogen and nitrogen intermediates, boosting ammonia synthesis rates.},

  abstract     = {Molecular electronic devices require precise control over the flow of current in single molecules. However, the electron transport properties of single molecules critically depend on dynamic molecular conformations in nanoscale junctions. Here we report a unique strategy for controlling molecular conductance using shape-persistent molecules. Chemically diverse, charged ladder molecules, synthesized via a one-pot multicomponent ladderization strategy, show a molecular conductance (d[log(G/G0)]/dx ≈ −0.1 nm−1) that is nearly independent of junction displacement, in stark contrast to the nanogap-dependent conductance (d[log(G/G0)]/dx ≈ −7 nm−1) observed for non-ladder analogues. Ladder molecules show an unusually narrow distribution of molecular conductance during dynamic junction displacement, which is attributed to the shape-persistent backbone and restricted rotation of terminal anchor groups. These principles are further extended to a butterfly-like molecule, thereby demonstrating the strategy’s generality for achieving gap-independent conductance. Overall, our work provides important avenues for controlling molecular conductance using shape-persistent molecules. Achieving robust and controllable conductance in single-molecule junctions is challenging due to the dynamic nature of molecular conformations that fluctuate over operational timescales. A strategy using shape-persistent molecules has now been developed that demonstrates nearly junction-displacement-independent conductance, providing a stable solution for single-molecule electronic properties.},

This impact is tempered by the inability to chemically design glasses with precise, well-defined and tunable structures: the literal quest for order in disorder. However, metal–organic or hybrid glasses are now considered to belong to a fourth category of glass chemistry. They have recently been demonstrated upon melt-quenching of coordination polymer, metal–organic framework and hybrid perovskite framework solids. In this Review, we discuss hybrid glasses through the lens of both crystalline metal–organic framework and glass chemistry, physics and engineering, to provide a vision for the future of this class of materials.

  abstract     = {Layered perovskites with Ruddlesden–Popper-type structures are fundamentally important for low-dimensional properties, for example, photovoltaic hybrid iodides and superconducting copper oxides. Many such halides and oxides are known, but analogous nitrides are difficult to stabilize due to the high cation oxidation states required to balance the anion charges. Here we report the high-pressure synthesis of three single-layer Ruddlesden–Popper (K2NiF4 type) nitrides—Pr2ReN4, Nd2ReN4 and Ce2TaN4—along with their structural characterization and properties. The R2ReN4 materials (R = Pr and Nd) are metallic, and Nd2ReN4 has a ferromagnetic Nd3+ spin order below 15 K. Thermal decomposition gives R2ReN3 with a Peierls-type distortion and chains of Re–Re multiply bonded dimers. Ce2TaN4 has a structural transition driven by octahedral tilting, with local distortions and canted magnetic Ce3+ order evidencing two-dimensional Ce3+/Ce4+ charge ordering correlations. Our work demonstrates that Ruddlesden–Popper nitrides with varied structural, electronic and magnetic properties can be prepared from high-pressure synthesis, opening the door to related layered nitride materials. Nitrogen-rich Ruddlesden–Popper nitrides are notoriously difficult to stabilize. Now a high-pressure high-temperature synthesis method has enabled the preparation of Pr2ReN4, Nd2ReN4 and Ce2TaN4. Neutron diffraction analysis reveals fully nitrided materials and intricate magnetic structures.},

  abstract     = {Adding synthetic nucleotides to DNA increases the linear information density of DNA molecules. Here we report that it also can increase the diversity of their three-dimensional folds. Specifically, an additional nucleotide (dZ, with a 5-nitro-6-aminopyridone nucleobase), placed at twelve sites in a 23-nucleotides-long DNA strand, creates a fairly stable unimolecular structure (that is, the folded Z-motif, or fZ-motif) that melts at 66.5 °C at pH 8.5. Spectroscopic, gel and two-dimensional NMR analyses show that the folded Z-motif is held together by six reverse skinny dZ−:dZ base pairs, analogous to the crystal structure of the free heterocycle. Fluorescence tagging shows that the dZ−:dZ pairs join parallel strands in a four-stranded compact down–up–down–up fold. These have two possible structures: one with intercalated dZ−:dZ base pairs, the second without intercalation. The intercalated structure would resemble the i-motif formed by dC:dC+-reversed pairing at pH ≤ 6.5. This fZ-motif may therefore help DNA form compact structures needed for binding and catalysis. Standard DNA is limited by low information density and functional diversity. Now it has been shown that an expanded genetic alphabet—incorporating a synthetic nucleotide, dZ—allows for the creation of stable three-dimensional DNA structures under mild alkaline conditions. Such stable structures enrich our understanding of DNA’s structural diversity and its potential in synthetic biology applications.},

  abstract     = {The 1,2-arylheteroaryl ethane motif stands as a privileged scaffold with promising implications in drug discovery. Conventional de novo syntheses of these molecules have relied heavily on pre-functionalized synthons, entailing harsh conditions and multi-step processes. Here, to address these limitations, we present a modular approach for the direct synthesis of 1,2-arylheteroaryl ethanes using feedstock chemicals, including ethylene, arenes and heteroarenes. We disclosed a photo triplet-energy-transfer-initiated radical cascade process, leveraging homolytic cleavage of C–S bonds in aryl sulfonium salts as the key step to access aryl radicals with excellent regioselectivity. This method allows for rapid structural diversification of bioactive molecules, showcasing excellent functional group tolerance and streamlining the synthesis of bioactive compounds and their derivatives. Furthermore, our approach can be extended to propylene, non-gaseous terminal alkenes and various other electrophilic radical precursors, including heteroaryl radicals, hydroxyl radicals, trifluoromethyl radicals and α-carbonyl alkyl radicals. This study highlights the significance of radical polarity matching in designing selective multi-component couplings. De novo syntheses of 1,2-arylheteroaryl ethanes, key scaffolds in drug discovery, are challenging, typically relying on pre-functionalized synthons, harsh conditions and multi-step processes. Now a modular assembly of arenes, ethylene and heteroarenes yields diverse drug-like 1,2-arylheteroaryl ethanes, highlighting the importance of radical polarity matching in selective multi-component couplings.},

  abstract     = {The most abundant natural collagens form heterotrimeric triple helices. Synthetic mimics of collagen heterotrimers have been found to fold slowly, even compared to the already slow rates of homotrimeric helices. These prolonged folding rates are not understood. Here we compare the stabilities, specificities and folding rates of three heterotrimeric collagen mimics designed through a computationally assisted approach. The crystal structure of one ABC-type heterotrimer verified a well-controlled composition and register and elucidated the geometry of pairwise cation–π and axial and lateral salt bridges in the assembly. This collagen heterotrimer folds much faster (hours versus days) than comparable, well-designed systems. Circular dichroism and NMR data suggest the folding is frustrated by unproductive, competing heterotrimer species and these species must unwind before refolding into the thermodynamically favoured assembly. The heterotrimeric collagen folding rate is inhibited by the introduction of preformed competing triple-helical assemblies, which suggests that slow heterotrimer folding kinetics are dominated by the frustration of the energy landscape caused by competing triple helices. The mechanism of collagen heterotrimer folding is difficult to recapitulate synthetically. Now an ABC collagen mimetic heterotrimer has been designed that employs pairwise amino acid interactions, validated by X-ray crystallography, to promote composition- and register-specific assembly. The high specificity of its assembly leads to an increased rate of folding compared with similar collagen heterotrimers.},

  abstract     = {Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely used for mRNA delivery, with cationic lipids greatly affecting biodistribution, cellular uptake, endosomal escape and transfection efficiency. However, the laborious synthesis of cationic lipids limits the discovery of efficacious candidates and slows down scale-up manufacturing. Here we develop a one-pot, tandem multi-component reaction based on the rationally designed amine–thiol–acrylate conjugation, which enables fast (1 h) and facile room-temperature synthesis of amidine-incorporated degradable (AID) lipids. Structure–activity relationship analysis of a combinatorial library of 100 chemically diverse AID-lipids leads to the identification of a tail-like amine–ring-alkyl aniline that generally affords efficacious lipids. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the embedded bulky benzene ring can enhance endosomal escape and mRNA delivery by enabling the lipid to adopt a more conical shape. The lead AID-lipid can not only mediate local delivery of mRNA vaccines and systemic delivery of mRNA therapeutics, but can also alter the tropism of liver-tropic LNPs to selectively deliver gene editors to the lung and mRNA vaccines to the spleen. A class of cationic—amidine-based degradable—lipids can now be readily synthesized through a tandem multi-component amine–thiol–acrylate conjugation reaction. Mechanistic studies provided key insights, from which the observed lead lipid enabled mRNA delivery to multiple organs, highlighting the potential for developing mRNA vaccines and therapeutics to treat various diseases.},

  abstract     = {The functional properties of organic semiconductors are defined by the interplay between optically bright and dark states. Organic devices require rapid conversion between these bright and dark manifolds for maximum efficiency, and one way to achieve this is through multiexciton generation (S1→1TT). The dark state 1TT is typically generated from bright S1 after optical excitation; however, the mechanistic details are hotly debated. Here we report a 1TT generation pathway in which it can be coherently photoexcited, without any involvement of bright S1. Using &amp;lt;10-fs transient absorption spectroscopy and pumping sub-resonantly, 1TT is directly generated from the ground state. Applying this method to a range of pentacene dimers and thin films of various aggregation types, we determine the critical material properties that enable this forbidden pathway. Through a strikingly simple technique, this result opens the door for new mechanistic insights into 1TT and other dark states in organic materials. The mechanistic details of entangled triplet pair formation in organic materials have been debated over the past decade. Now, the concept of coherent triplet pair formation is revived using a library of pentacene derivatives, invoking charge resonance mixing as a material design principle for harnessing the effect.},

Neutral silynes (R1–C≡Si(L)–R2) and germynes (R1–C≡Ge(L)–R2) stabilized by a Lewis base have achieved sufficient stability for structural characterization at low temperatures. Here we show the isolation of a base-free stannyne (R1–C≡Sn–R2) at room temperature, achieved through the strategic use of a bulky cyclic phosphino ligand in combination with a bulky terphenyl substituent. Despite an allenic structure with strong delocalization of π-electrons, this compound exhibits adjacent ambiphilic carbon and tin centres, forming a carbon–tin multiple bond with ionic character. The stannyne demonstrates reactivity similar to carbenes or stannylenes, reacting with 1-adamantyl isocyanide and 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene. Additionally, its carbon–tin bond can be saturated by Et3N·HCl or cleaved by isopropyl isocyanate. Due to their challenging isolation, stannynes are underexplored and poorly understood. Now, a stannyne has been synthesized and isolated at room temperature using a bulky cyclic phosphino ligand, and it has been shown to exhibit the reactivity characteristics of carbenes, stannylenes and carbon–tin multiply bonded compounds.},

  abstract     = {Growing interest in the use of first-row transition metal complexes in a number of applied contexts—including but not limited to photoredox catalysis and solar energy conversion—underscores the need for a detailed understanding of their photophysical properties. A recent focus on ligand-field photocatalysis using cobalt(III) polypyridyls in particular has unlocked unprecedented excited-state reactivities. Photophysical studies on Co(III) chromophores in general are relatively uncommon, and so here we carry out a systematic study of a series of Co(III) polypyridyl complexes in order to delineate their excited-state dynamics. Compounds with varying ligand-field strengths were prepared and studied using variable-temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Analysis of the data establishes that the ground-state recovery dynamics are operating in the Marcus inverted region, in stark contrast to what is typically observed in other first-row metal complexes. The analysis has further revealed the underlying reasons driving this excited-state behaviour, thereby enabling potential advancements in the targeted use of the Marcus inverted region for a variety of photolytic applications. Expanded use of earth-abundant chromophores for excited-state chemistry requires the ability to increase the energy content of excited states while simultaneously lengthening their lifetimes. It has now been shown that this goal can be achieved in Co(III)-based chromophores by virtue of their photophysical dynamics occurring in the Marcus inverted region.},

The metal-catalysed H-atom transfer reaction (M-HAT) offers an attractive means for hydrofunctionalizing olefins, providing access to terpenoid-like structures. Artificial metalloenzymes offer a promising strategy for introducing M-HAT reactivity into a protein scaffold. Here we report our efforts towards engineering an artificial radical cyclase (ARCase), resulting from anchoring a biotinylated [Co(Schiff-base)] cofactor within an engineered chimeric streptavidin. After two rounds of directed evolution, a double mutant catalyses a radical cyclization to afford bicyclic products with a cis-5-6-fused ring structure and up to 97% enantiomeric excess. The involvement of a histidine ligation to the Co cofactor is confirmed by crystallography. A time course experiment reveals a cascade reaction catalysed by the ARCase, combining a radical cyclization with a conjugate reduction. The ARCase exhibits tolerance towards variations in the dienone substrate, highlighting its potential to access terpenoid scaffolds. Although natural terpenoid cyclases generate polycyclic structures through cationic intermediates, alternative radical cyclization pathways are underexplored. Now an artificial radical cyclase has been prepared by anchoring a biotinylated cobalt Schiff-base complex within a chimeric streptavidin scaffold.

  abstract     = {The selective hetero-dihalogenation of alkenes provides useful building blocks for a broad range of chemical applications. Unlike homo-dihalogenation, selective hetero-dihalogenation reactions, especially fluorohalogenation, are underdeveloped. Current approaches combine an electrophilic halogen source with a nucleophilic halogen source, which necessarily leads to anti-addition, and regioselectivity has only been achieved using highly activated alkenes. Here we describe an alternative, nucleophile–nucleophile approach that adds chloride and fluoride ions over unactivated alkenes in a highly regio-, chemo- and diastereoselective manner. A curious switch in the reaction mechanism was discovered, which triggers a complete reversal of the diastereoselectivity to promote either anti- or syn-addition. The conditions are demonstrated on an array of pharmaceutically relevant compounds, and detailed mechanistic studies reveal the selectivity and the switch between the syn- and anti-diastereomers are based on different active iodanes and which of the two halides adds first. Unlike homo-dihalogenation, selective hetero-dihalogenation reactions are underdeveloped.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic overall water splitting holds great promise for solar-to-hydrogen conversion. Maintaining charge separation is a major challenge but is key to unlocking this potential. Here we discovered a metal–organic framework (MOF) that shows suppressed charge recombination. This MOF features electronically insulated Zn2+ nodes and two chemically equivalent, yet crystallographically independent, linkers. These linkers behave as an electron donor–acceptor pair with non-overlapping band edges. Upon photoexcitation, the MOF undergoes a dynamic excited-state structural twist, inducing orbital rearrangements that forbid radiative relaxation and thereby promote a long-lived charge-separated state. As a result, the MOF achieves visible-light photocatalytic overall water splitting, in the presence of co-catalysts, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 3.09 ± 0.32% at 365 nm and shows little activity loss in 100 h of consecutive runs. Furthermore, the dynamic excited-state structural twist is also successfully extended to other photocatalysts. This strategy for suppressing charge recombination will be applicable to diverse photochemical processes beyond overall water splitting. Solar water splitting holds great promise for hydrogen production but is significantly hindered by rapid recombination of photogenerated charges. Now a metal–organic framework photocatalyst has been shown to undergo, upon photoexcitation, a dynamic excited-state structural twist that greatly suppresses charge recombination to enable efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting.},

Here we present the proton transfer anionic polymerization of methacrylates using acidic C–H bonds as the dormant species that are activated by base catalysts. The polymerization mechanism involves reversible chain transfer or termination of the growing enolate species. A weakly acidic compound, such as an alkyl isobutyrate, serves as the initiator or chain-transfer agent in the presence of a bulky potassium base catalyst to produce a polymer chain and, thereby, diminishes the metal compound per chain ratio. An added alcohol serves as a reversible terminator to tame the propagation. End-functionalized, star, block and graft polymers are easily accessible from compounds with C–H bonds. Living anionic polymerization generally requires stringent conditions and one metal initiator per polymer chain. Now it has been shown that a weakly acidic compound serves as the initiator or chain-transfer agent in the presence of a potassium base catalyst to produce a polymer chain through a proton transfer anionic polymerization mechanism.},

However, simultaneous functionalization of the reactive site and the inert remote C(sp3)–H poses a formidable challenge, as chemical reactions conventionally occur at the most active site. In addition, achieving precise control over site selectivity for remote C(sp3)–H activation presents an additional hurdle. Here we report an alternative modular method for alkene difunctionalization, encompassing radical-triggered translocation of functional groups and remote C(sp3)–H desaturation via photo/cobalt dual catalysis. By systematically combining radical addition, functional group migration and cobalt-promoted hydrogen atom transfer, we successfully effectuate the translocation of the carbon–carbon double bond and another functional group with precise site selectivity and remarkable E/Z selectivity. This redox-neutral approach shows good compatibility with diverse fluoroalkyl and sulfonyl radical precursors, enabling the migration of benzoyloxy, acetoxy, formyl, cyano and heteroaryl groups. This protocol offers a resolution for the simultaneous transformation of manifold sites. Simultaneous functionalization of reactive and inert remote sites presents a powerful approach to access complex molecules, yet it is hindered by precise remote C(sp3)–H activation.

Such assemblies are currently structurally simplistic, comprising spherical capsules or lipid clusters. Given that form and function are intertwined, this lack of architectural complexity restricts the development of more sophisticated properties. To address this, we have devised an engineering strategy combining microfluidics and conjugation chemistry to synthesize nanosized liposomes with two discrete compartments, one within another, which we term concentrisomes. We can control the composition of each bilayer and tune both particle size and the dimensions between inner and outer membranes. We can specify the identity of encapsulated cargo within each compartment, and the biophysical features of inner and outer bilayers, allowing us to imbue each bilayer with different stimuli-responsive properties. We use these particles for multi-stage release of two payloads at defined time points, and as attolitre reactors for triggered in situ biochemical synthesis. Most lipid nanoparticles are structurally simplistic, existing as single-compartment assemblies. Now, a microfluidic technology to create liposomes-in-liposomes—with full control over particle features, such as the composition of each membrane, the intermembrane distance and payload of each compartment—has been developed. These particles are exploited for multi-stage release and in situ enzymatic synthesis within the particle’s attolitre volume.},

Despite decades of biochemical research, however, no synthetic models capable of anammox have been identified. Here we report that a copper sulfide mineral replicates the entire biological anammox pathway catalysed by three metalloenzymes. We identified a copper–nitrosonium {CuNO}10 complex, formed by nitrite reduction, as the oxidant for ammonium oxidation that leads to heterolytic N–N bond formation from nitrite and ammonium. Similar to the biological process, N2 production was mediated by the highly reactive intermediate hydrazine, one of the most potent reductants in nature. We also found another pathway involving N–N bond heterocoupling for the formation of hybrid N2O, a potent greenhouse gas with a unique isotope composition. Our study represents a rare example of non-enzymatic anammox reaction that interconnects six redox states in the abiotic nitrogen cycle. The discovery of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, termed anammox, has changed views on ammonium activation in biology, but no synthetic models of this reaction have been identified. Now biological anammox, catalysed by three metalloenzymes, is shown to be replicable by a single copper sulfide mineral.},

Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) can infer the specific residues modified by electrophilic compounds through competition with broadly reactive probes. However, the extent to which such residue-directed platforms fully assess the protein targets of electrophilic compounds in cells remains unclear. Here we evaluate a complementary protein-directed ABPP method that identifies proteins showing stereoselective reactivity with alkynylated, chiral electrophilic compounds—termed stereoprobes. Integration of protein- and cysteine-directed data from cancer cells treated with tryptoline acrylamide stereoprobes revealed generally well-correlated ligandability maps and highlighted features, such as protein size and the proteotypicity of cysteine-containing peptides, that explain gaps in each ABPP platform. In total, we identified stereoprobe binding events for &amp;gt;300 structurally and functionally diverse proteins, including compounds that stereoselectively and site-specifically disrupt MAD2L1BP interactions with the spindle assembly checkpoint complex leading to delayed mitotic exit in cancer cells. The ligandability of the human proteome can be expanded using covalent chemistry.

  abstract     = {Halides of the family Li3MX6 (M = Y, In, Sc and so on, X = halogen) are emerging solid electrolyte materials for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. They show greater chemical stability and wider electrochemical stability windows than existing sulfide solid electrolytes, but have lower room-temperature ionic conductivities. Here we report the discovery that the superionic transition in Li3YCl6 is triggered by the collective motion of anions, as evidenced by synchrotron X-ray and neutron scattering characterizations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Based on this finding, we used a rational design strategy to lower the transition temperature and thus improve the room-temperature ionic conductivity of this family of compounds. We accordingly synthesized Li3YClxBr6−x and Li3GdCl3Br3 and achieved very high room-temperature conductivities of 6.1 and 11 mS cm−1 for Li3YCl4.5Br1.5 and Li3GdCl3Br3, respectively. These findings open new routes to the design of room-temperature superionic conductors for high-performance solid batteries. While solid-state lithium-ion batteries offer promising energy densities for safe energy storage, typical solid electrolytes show poor room-temperature ionic conduction. Now the origin of the superionic transition observed in Li3YCl6-type Li-ion conductors is revealed by in-depth crystal structure characterizations and improved ionic conductivities achieved by lowering the transition temperature.},

This seeming paradox led to the understanding that sorting entails thermodynamic work, a foundational concept of information theory. In the past centuries, many systems analogous to Maxwell’s demon have been introduced in the form of molecular information, molecular pumps and ratchets. Here we report a functional example of a Maxwell’s demon that pumps material over centimetres, whereas previous examples operated on a molecular scale. In our system, this demon drives directional transport of o-fluoroazobenzene between the arms of a U-tube apparatus upon light irradiation, transiting through an aqueous membrane containing a coordination cage. The concentration gradient thus obtained is further harnessed to drive naphthalene transport in the opposite direction. In the original Maxwell’s demon thought experiment, a potential gradient of particles between two neighbouring compartments is created without the apparent use of work. Now a functional example of this experiment where material is pumped over centimetres has been reported—o-fluoroazobenzene is transported unidirectionally under light stimulation between two arms of a U-tube across an aqueous layer containing coordination cages.},

Although histidine is an attractive candidate due to its importance in enzymatic catalysis, metal binding and protein–protein interaction, its moderate nucleophilicity poses challenges. Its modification is frequently influenced by cysteine and lysine, which results in poor selectivity and narrow proteome coverage. Here we report a singlet oxygen and chemical probe relay labelling method that achieves high selectivity towards histidine. Libraries of small-molecule photosensitizers and chemical probes were screened to optimize histidine labelling, enabling histidine profiling in live cells with around 7,200 unique sites. Using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, we characterized the reaction mechanism and the structures of the resulting products. We then applied this method to discover unannotated histidine sites key to enzymatic activity and metal binding in select metalloproteins. This method also revealed the accessibility change of histidine mediated by protein–protein interaction that influences select protein subcellular localization, underscoring its capability in discovering functional histidines. Chemical probes that selectively react with histidine could afford functional insight for those located in vital protein regions, but the moderate nucleophilicity of histidine and interference from other residues pose challenges. A singlet oxygen and chemical probe relay labelling approach demonstrates high selectivity, enabling comprehensive histidine profiling and providing crucial functional insights.},

  abstract     = {Electrophilic halogenation is a widely used tool employed by medicinal chemists to either pre-functionalize molecules for further diversity or incorporate a halogen atom into drugs or drug-like compounds to solve metabolic problems or modulate off-target effects. Current methods to increase the power of halogenation rely on either the invention of new reagents or activating commercially available reagents with various additives such as Lewis or Brønsted acids, Lewis bases and hydrogen-bonding activators. There is a high demand for new reagents that can halogenate otherwise unreactive compounds under mild conditions. Here we report the invention of a class of halogenating reagents based on anomeric amides, taking advantage of the energy stored in the pyramidalized nitrogen of N–X anomeric amides as a driving force. These robust halogenating methods are compatible with a variety of functional groups and heterocycles, as exemplified on over 50 compounds (including 13 gram-scale examples and 1 flow chemistry scale-up). Electrophilic halogenation approaches often suffer from low reactivity and chemoselectivity when it comes to complex compounds. Now a class of halogenating reagents based on anomeric amides that can halogenate complex bioactive molecules with diverse functional groups and heterocycles has been developed. The higher reactivity of these anomeric amide reagents is attributed to the energy stored in the pyramidalized nitrogen.},

  abstract     = {Fusicoccane diterpenoids display intriguing biological activities, including the ability to act as modulators of 14-3-3 protein–protein interactions. However, their innate structural complexity and diverse oxygenation patterns present enormous synthetic challenges. Here we develop a modular chemoenzymatic approach that combines de novo skeletal construction and late-stage hybrid C–H oxidations to achieve the synthesis of ten complex fusicoccanes in 8–13 steps each. A convergent fragment coupling strategy allowed rapid access to a key tricyclic intermediate, which was subjected to chemical and enzymatic C–H oxidations to modularly prepare five oxidized family members. We also conceived a complementary biomimetic skeletal remodelling strategy to synthetically access five rearranged fusicoccanes with unusual bridgehead double bonds. This work may facilitate future investigation into the biological activities of the fusicoccanes and also inspire the implementation of similar hybrid strategies to provide family-level synthetic solutions to other natural product scaffolds. Fusicoccane diterpenoids are complex natural products with intricate tricyclic skeletons and intriguing biological activities. Now a chemoenzymatic strategy has been developed for modularly synthesizing a number of compounds from the family. This approach combines de novo skeletal construction and hybrid C–H oxidations, allowing the synthesis of ten different natural products.},

Here we introduce a supramolecular stabilization approach of a cationic {Bi4} rhomboid within the symmetric charge sphere of two bowl-shaped dianionic calix[4]pyrrolato indinates. Crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization, quantum chemical analysis and magnetically induced ring currents indicate σ-aromaticity in the formally tetracationic 16-valence electron [Bi4]4+ ring. Computational screening for other p-block elements identifies the planar rhomboid as the globally preferred structure for 16-valence electron four-atomic clusters. The aromatic [Bi4]4+ is isoelectronic to the [Al4]4−, a motif previously observed as antiaromatic in Li3[Al4]− in the gas phase. Thus, subtle factors such as charge isotropy seem to decide over aromaticity or antiaromaticity, advising for caution in debates based on the Hückel model—a concept valid for second-row elements but less deterministic for the heavier congeners. The synthesis of cationic all-metal aromatic systems without covalent functionalization remains an underexplored area in chemistry. Now a tetracationic [Bi4]4+ featuring all-metal σ-aromaticity has been stabilized through a supramolecular approach relying on dianionic calix[4]pyrrolato indiumbromide shells. This planar rhomboid represents the global minimum for 16 valence electron systems.},

  abstract     = {The importance of constructing Csp2–Csp3 bonds has motivated the development of electrochemical, photochemical and thermal activation methods to reductively couple abundant aryl and alkyl electrophiles. However, these methodologies are limited to couplings of very specific substrate classes and require specialized sets of catalysts and reaction set-ups. Here we show a consolidation of these myriad strategies into a single set of conditions that enable reliable alkyl–aryl couplings, including those that were previously unknown. These reactions rely on the discovery of unusually persistent organonickel complexes that serve as stoichiometric platforms for C(sp2)–C(sp3) coupling. Aryl, heteroaryl or vinyl complexes of Ni can be inexpensively prepared on a multigram scale by mild electroreduction from the corresponding C(sp2) electrophile. Organonickel complexes can be isolated and stored or telescoped directly to reliably diversify drug-like molecules. Finally, the procedure was miniaturized to micromole scales by integrating soluble battery chemistries as redox initiators, enabling a high-throughput exploration of substrate diversity. A robust organometallic platform is developed for stoichiometric cross-couplings of common aryl and alkyl electrophiles under a single set of conditions. Inexpensive and persistent organonickel complexes are prepared by electrolysis and implemented in the diversification of drug-like molecules with high reliability from a diverse set of alkyl precursors.},

  abstract     = {Halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) are causing a significant environmental and human health crisis due to their high levels of toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. Urgent action is required to develop effective approaches for the reduction and reuse of HOPs. Whereas current strategies focus primarily on the degradation of HOPs, repurposing them is an alternative approach, albeit a challenging task. Here we discover that alkyl bromide can act as a catalyst for the transfer of chlorine using alkyl chloride as the chlorine source. We demonstrate that this approach has a wide substrate scope, and we successfully apply it to reuse HOPs that include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, hexabromocyclododecane, chlorinated paraffins, chloromethyl polystyrene and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). Moreover, we show that the synthesis of essential non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be achieved using PVC and hexabromocyclododecane, and we demonstrate that PVC waste can be used directly as a chlorinating agent. Overall, this methodology offers a promising strategy for repurposing HOPs. The presence of halogens in halogenated organic pollutants has negative impacts on the environment; however, they serve as valuable sources for halogenation reactions. Now it has been shown that transfer chlorination reactions enable the repurposing of halogenated organic pollutants for the synthesis of chlorides and bromides.},

However, the structural information that explains its reaction mechanism has remained elusive. Here we determine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of SOI bound to a single-domain antibody with and without the competitive inhibitor benzylamine, and elucidate the catalytic mechanism using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional assays, biophysical methods and docking experiments. We find ferric haem b bound at the subunit interface of the trimeric enzyme through H58, where Fe(III) acts as the Lewis acid by binding to the epoxide oxygen. Y103 and N64 and a hydrophobic pocket binding the oxygen of the epoxide and the aryl group, respectively, position substrates in a manner that explains the high regio-selectivity and stereo-specificity of SOI. Our findings can support extending the range of epoxide substrates and be used to potentially repurpose SOI for the catalysis of new-to-nature Fe-based chemical reactions. Understanding how membrane-bound styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyses the Meinwald rearrangement—a Lewis-acid-catalysed isomerization of an epoxide to a carbonyl compound—can be useful as SOI represents a green alternative to chemical synthesis.

High-valent neptunium generally requires stabilization from at least one metal–ligand multiple bond, and departing from this structural motif poses a considerable challenge. Here we report a tetrahedral molecular neptunium(V) complex ([Np5+(NPC)4][B(ArF5)4], 1-Np) (NPC = [NPtBu(pyrr)2]−; tBu = C(CH3)3; pyrr = pyrrolidinyl (N(C2H4)2); B(ArF5)4 = tetrakis(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluourophenyl)borate). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction, solution-state spectroscopy and density functional theory studies of 1-Np and the product of its proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction, 2-Np, demonstrate the unique bonding that stabilizes this reactive ion and establishes the thermochemical and kinetic parameters of PCET in a condensed-phase transuranic complex. The isolation of this four-coordinate, neptunium(V) complex reveals a fundamental reaction pathway in transuranic chemistry. The number of known high-oxidation-state transuranic compounds remains limited, and these typically feature high coordination numbers and/or multiply-bonded donor atoms. Now, a tetrahedral, pentavalent neptunium complex supported by four monoanionic ligands has been isolated and characterized. This complex is stable in the solid state and undergoes a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction in solution.},

Alternative enzymatic approaches for internal protein labelling require bulky recognition motifs or non-proteinogenic reaction partners, potentially restricting which proteins can be modified or the types of modification that can be installed. Here we report a strategy for labelling lysine side chain ε-amines by repurposing an engineered asparaginyl ligase, which naturally catalyses peptide head-to-tail cyclization, for versatile isopeptide ligations that are compatible with peptidic substrates. We find that internal lysines with an adjacent leucine residue mimic the conventional N-terminal glycine–leucine substrate. This dipeptide motif enables efficient intra- or intermolecular ligation through internal lysine side chains, minimally leaving an asparagine C-terminally linked to the lysine side chain via an isopeptide bond. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated by the chemoenzymatic synthesis of peptides with non-native C terminus-to-side chain topology and the conjugation of chemically modified peptides to recombinant proteins. Plant asparaginyl endopeptidases that function preferentially as transpeptidases naturally catalyse the head-to-tail cyclization of plant peptides. Using substrate mimicry and reaction optimization, their function has now been repurposed to catalyse intermolecular isopeptide bond formation on diverse peptide and protein substrates.},

  abstract     = {Calcium fluoride is the ultimate source of all fluorochemicals. Current synthetic approaches rely on the use of HF, generated from naturally occurring fluorspar and sulfuric acid. Methods for constructing E–F bonds directly from CaF2 have long been frustrated by its high lattice energy, low solubility and impaired fluoride ion nucleophilicity. Little fundamental understanding of the reactivity of Ca–F moieties is available to guide methodology development; well-defined molecular species containing Ca–F bonds are extremely rare, and existing examples are strongly aggregated and evidence no nucleophilic fluoride delivery. Here, by contrast, we show that by targeting anionic systems of the type [Ln(X)2CaF]−, monomeric calcium fluoride complexes containing single Ca–F bonds can be synthesized, including via routes involving fluoride abstraction from existing C–F bonds. Comparative structural and spectroscopic studies of mono- and dinuclear systems allow us to define structure–activity relationships for E–F bond formation from molecular calcium fluorides. Calcium difluoride is a source of fluorochemicals, but the reactivity of Ca–F moieties is not well understood. Now a library of molecular Ca–F complexes featuring unique structural motifs has been synthesized, including via fluorochemical defluorination. Studies of mono- and dinuclear systems provided structure–activity relationships for E–F bond formation.},

Here we report a class of allosteric inhibitors of DNA gyrase with antibacterial activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. Screening of a small-molecule library revealed an initial isoquinoline sulfonamide hit, which was optimized via medicinal chemistry efforts to afford the more potent antibacterial LEI-800. Target identification studies, including whole-genome sequencing of in vitro selected mutants with resistance to isoquinoline sulfonamides, unanimously pointed to the DNA gyrase complex, an essential bacterial topoisomerase and an established antibacterial target. Using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the gyrase–LEI-800–DNA complex. The compound occupies an allosteric, hydrophobic pocket in the GyrA subunit and has a mode of action that is distinct from the clinically used fluoroquinolones or any other gyrase inhibitor reported to date. LEI-800 provides a chemotype suitable for development to counter the increasingly widespread bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. Global antibiotic scarcity looms owing to bacterial resistance. Now the discovery of a class of allosteric inhibitors targeting DNA gyrase—essential for bacteria—yields a compound LEI-800 that exhibits activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli. The compound’s unique mode of action, revealed through cryo-EM, makes it a promising candidate for countering bacterial resistance.},

Due to the difficulty in characterizing these buried and (probably) disordered heterointerfaces, the interfacial structure in most systems remains a mystery. Here we demonstrate a synthetic strategy to design and control model interfaces, enabling their detailed study in isolation from the bulk material. This is achieved by the synthesis of a polymer in which a non-fullerene acceptor moiety is covalently bonded to a donor polymer backbone using dual alkyl chain links, constraining the acceptor and donor units in a through space co-facial arrangement. The constrained geometry of the acceptor relative to the electron-rich and -poor moieties in the polymer backbone can be tuned to control the kinetics of charge separation and the energy of the resultant charge-transfer state giving insight into factors that govern charge generation at organic heterojunctions. The molecular interactions at an organic heterointerface govern the performance of many optoelectronic devices.

Cross-coupling reactions are among the most efficient and widely used reactions to construct molecules, with reactions enabling the retention or installation of chirality as recent additions to this powerful toolbox. Sulfones are robust, accessible organic electrophiles that have many attractive features as cross-coupling partners; however, since the first example of their use in 1979, there have been no examples of their use in enantioselective, enantiospecific or entantioconvergent cross-couplings. The high acidity of sulfones makes it unclear whether this transformation is even possible outside tertiary systems. Here we report the enantiospecific cross-coupling of cyclic sulfones and Grignard reagents. Up to 99% chirality transfer is observed despite the strong basicity of the Grignard components. In situ monitoring reveals that the cross-coupling is kinetically competitive with competing deprotonation, resulting in a highly enantioselective transformation. Cross-coupling reactions are among the most important carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions. Now the nickel-catalysed cross-coupling of chiral sulfones with Grignard reagents has been achieved with up to 99% retention of chirality. The speed of the cross-coupling relative to sulfone deprotonation and racemization is critical to enabling this enantiospecific process.},

Candidates must have high potency at both receptors, but it is unclear whether the limited experimental data available can be used to train models that accurately predict the activity at both receptors of new peptide variants. Here we use peptide sequence data labelled with in vitro potency at human GCGR and GLP-1R to train several models, including a deep multi-task neural-network model using multiple loss optimization. Model-guided sequence optimization was used to design three groups of peptide variants, with distinct ranges of predicted dual activity. We found that three of the model-designed sequences are potent dual agonists with superior biological activity. With our designs we were able to achieve up to sevenfold potency improvement at both receptors simultaneously compared to the best dual-agonist in the training set. Engineering new ligands that specifically target multiple G protein-coupled receptors with desired activity profiles requires time-consuming and expensive cycles of design-make-test-analyse work. Now it has been shown that limited experimental data can be used to train sophisticated machine learning models to accurately predict the activity of previously uncharacterized peptide ligand variants.},

  abstract     = {Ideal rechargeable lithium battery electrolytes should promote the Faradaic reaction near the electrode surface while mitigating undesired side reactions. Yet, conventional electrolytes usually show sluggish kinetics and severe degradation due to their high desolvation energy and poor compatibility. Here we propose an electrolyte design strategy that overcomes the limitations associated with Li salt dissociation in non-coordinating solvents to enable fast, stable Li chemistries. The non-coordinating solvents are activated through favourable hydrogen bond interactions, specifically Fδ−–Hδ+ or Hδ+–Oδ−, when blended with fluorinated benzenes or halide alkane compounds. These intermolecular interactions enable a dynamic Li+–solvent coordination process, thereby promoting the fast Li+ reaction kinetics and suppressing electrode side reactions. Utilizing this molecular-docking electrolyte design strategy, we have developed 25 electrolytes that demonstrate high Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies and promising capacity retentions in both full cells and pouch cells. This work supports the use of the molecular-docking solvation mechanism for designing electrolytes with fast Li+ kinetics for high-voltage Li batteries. Conventional Li-ion battery electrolytes often show sluggish kinetics and severe degradation due to high Li+ desolvation energies and poor compatibility. Now, a molecular-docking strategy between solvents and inducers has been shown to enable dynamic Li+ coordination that promotes fast, stable and high-voltage lithium battery chemistries.},

  abstract     = {Natural gap junctions are a type of channel protein responsible for intercellular signalling and mass communication. However, the scope of applications for these proteins is limited as they cannot be prepared at a large scale and are unable to spontaneously insert into cell membranes in vitro. The construction of artificial gap junctions may provide an alternative strategy for preparing analogues of the natural proteins and bottom–up building blocks necessary for the synthesis of artificial cells. Here we show the construction of artificial gap junction channels from unimolecular tubular molecules consisting of alternately arranged positively and negatively charged pillar[5]arene motifs. These molecules feature a hydrophobic–hydrophilic–hydrophobic triblock structure that allows them to efficiently insert into two adjacent plasma membranes and stretch across the gap between the two membranes to form gap junctions. Similar to natural gap junction channels, the synthetic channels could mediate intercellular signal coupling and reactive oxygen species transmission, leading to cellular activity. The construction of analogues of natural gap junctions would provide a bottom–up strategy for building intercellular communication pathways for synthetic cells. Now artificial intercellular gap junctions have been prepared from unimolecular tubular channels by mimicking the hydrophobic–hydrophilic–hydrophobic triblock structure of natural junction channels.},

  abstract     = {Biological systems often rely on topological transformation to reconfigure connectivity between nodes to guide the flux of molecular information. Here we develop a topology-programmed DNA origami system that encodes signal propagation at the nanoscale, analogous to topologically efficient information processing in cellular systems. We present a systematic molecular implementation of topological operations involving ‘glue–cut’ processes that can prompt global conformational change of DNA origami structures, with demonstrated major topological properties including genus, number of boundary components and orientability. By spatially arranging reactive DNA hairpins, we demonstrate signal propagation across transmission paths of varying lengths and orientations, and curvatures on the curved surfaces of three-dimensional origamis. These DNA origamis can also form dynamic scaffolds for regulating the spatial and temporal signal propagations whereby topological transformations spontaneously alter the location of nodes and boundary of signal propagation network. We anticipate that our strategy for topological operations will provide a general route to manufacture dynamic DNA origami nanostructures capable of performing global structural transformations under programmable control. Constructing artificial structures that can imitate complex topological transformation with sophisticated functions is challenging. Now, using topological operations involving ‘glue–cut’ processes, the global conformational change of topology-programmed DNA origami has been demonstrated. The reconfigurable DNA origami system developed here can encode signal propagation at the nanoscale.},

Such layered materials with ultrathin morphologies and extreme aspect ratios currently display a vast range of properties; however, until recently a conspicuously missing property of 2D materials was global chirality. The situation has changed over the past few years with the implementation of several distinct types of ultrathin chiral 2D crystals. Here we offer a forward-looking perspective on this field to comprehend the fundamentals of global chirality in two dimensions and develop new directions. We specifically discuss the experimental achievements of the emerging chiral 2D materials with a focus on their design strategy, synthesis, structural characterization, fundamental physical properties and possible applications. We will highlight how the molecular-scale local chirality could be significantly transmitted and amplified throughout ultrathin single-crystalline 2D structures, resulting in distinctive global chirality that brings more sophisticated functions. Chirality in extended 2D structures exhibits fundamental differences from molecular-level chirality. This Perspective discusses how local molecular chirality is transmitted and amplified to form distinctive global chirality within ultrathin, single-crystalline 2D materials; it also explores the future challenges and potential of this field.},

Past research has typically focused on generating rigid frameworks where structural and optoelectronic properties are static. Here we report dynamic two-dimensional (2D) COFs that can open and close their pores upon uptake or removal of guests while retaining their crystalline long-range order. Constructing dynamic, yet crystalline and robust frameworks requires a well-controlled degree of flexibility. We have achieved this through a ‘wine rack’ design where rigid π-stacked columns of perylene diimides are interconnected by non-stacked, flexible bridges. The resulting COFs show stepwise phase transformations between their respective contracted-pore and open-pore conformations with up to 40% increase in unit-cell volume. This variable geometry provides a handle for introducing stimuli-responsive optoelectronic properties. We illustrate this by demonstrating switchable optical absorption and emission characteristics, which approximate ‘null-aggregates’ with monomer-like behaviour in the contracted COFs. This work provides a design strategy for dynamic 2D COFs that are potentially useful for realizing stimuli-responsive materials. Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) enable the construction of bespoke functional materials, but designing dynamic 2D COFs is challenging. Now it has been shown that perylene-diimide-based COFs can open and close their pores upon uptake or removal of guests, while fully retaining their crystalline long-range order. Moreover, the variable COF geometry enables stimuli-responsive optoelectronic properties.},

It is known that macroscopic materials, such as ropes, are substantially weakened by the presence of knots, but until now it has been unclear whether similar behaviour occurs on a molecular level. Here we show that the presence of a well-defined overhand knot in a polymer chain substantially increases the rate of scission of the polymer under tension (≥2.6× faster) in solution, because deformation of the polymer backbone induced by the tightening knot activates otherwise unreactive covalent bonds. The fragments formed upon severing of the knotted chain differ from those that arise from cleavage of a similar, but unknotted, polymer. Our solution studies provide experimental evidence that knotting can contribute to higher mechanical scission rates of polymers. It also demonstrates that entanglement design can be used to generate mechanophores that are among the most reactive described to date, providing opportunities to increase the reactivity of otherwise inert functional groups. Knots reduce the tensile strength of macroscopic threads and fibres. Now it has been shown that the presence of a well-defined overhand knot in a polymer chain can substantially increase the rate of scission of the polymer under tension, as deformation of the polymer backbone induced by the tightening knot activates otherwise unreactive covalent bonds.},

  abstract     = {The selective synthesis of ultrahigh-molar-mass (UHMM, &amp;gt;2 million Da) cyclic polymers is challenging as an exceptional degree of spatiotemporal control is required to overcome the possible undesired reactions that can compete with the desired intramolecular cyclization. Here we present a counterintuitive synthetic methodology for cyclic polymers, represented here by polythioesters, which proceeds via superbase-mediated ring-opening polymerization of gem-dimethylated thiopropiolactone, followed by macromolecular cyclization triggered by protic quenching. This proton-triggered linear-to-cyclic topological transformation enables selective, linear polymer-like access to desired cyclic polythioesters, including those with UHMM surpassing 2 MDa. In addition, this method eliminates the need for stringent conditions such as high dilution to prevent or suppress linear polymer contaminants and presents the opposite scenario in which protic-free conditions are required to prevent cyclic polymer formation, which is capitalized to produce cyclic polymers on demand. Furthermore, such UHMM cyclic polythioester exhibits not only much enhanced thermostability and mechanical toughness, but it can also be quantitatively recycled back to monomer under mild conditions due to its gem-disubstitution. The selective synthesis of ultrahigh-molar-mass (UHMM) cyclic polymers from direct polymerization is elusive. Using a chemically recyclable polythioester as a model, it has now been shown that a common superbase mediates living linear-chain growth, followed by proton-triggered linear-to-cyclic topological transformation, producing UHMM cyclic polymers with a narrow dispersity.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy-induced prodrug activation provides an ideal solution to reduce the systemic toxicity of chemotherapy in cancer therapy, but the scope of the radiation-activated protecting groups is limited. Here we present that the well-established photoinduced electron transfer chemistry may pave the way for developing versatile radiation-removable protecting groups. Using a functional reporter assay, N-alkyl-4-picolinium (NAP) was identified as a caging group that efficiently responds to radiation by releasing a client molecule. When evaluated in a competition experiment, the NAP moiety is more efficient than other radiation-removable protecting groups discovered so far. Leveraging this property, we developed a NAP-derived carbamate linker that releases fluorophores and toxins on radiation, which we incorporated into antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs). These designed ADCs were active in living cells and tumour-bearing mice, highlighting the potential to use such a radiation-removable protecting group for the development of next-generation ADCs with improved stability and therapeutic effects. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) occurs in many chemical processes and has various applications. Here ionizing radiation was used to trigger PET for controlled drug release from an antibody–drug conjugate using a picolinium cage. The radiotherapy-activated prodrug system demonstrated high antitumour efficacy and minimal side effects.},

Here we engineered fatty acid photodecarboxylases to catalyse unnatural photoredox radical C–C bond formation by leveraging the strongly oxidizing excited-state flavoquinone cofactor. Through genome mining, rational engineering and directed evolution, we developed a panel of radical photocyclases to facilitate decarboxylative radical cyclization with excellent chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivities. Our high-throughput experimental workflow allowed for the directed evolution of fatty acid photodecarboxylases. An orthogonal set of radical photocyclases was engineered to access all four possible stereoisomers of the stereochemical dyad, affording fully diastereo- and enantiodivergent biotransformations in asymmetric radical biocatalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations show that our evolved radical photocyclases allow near-attack conformations to be easily accessed, enabling chemoselective radical cyclization. The development of stereoselective radical photocyclases provides unnatural C–C-bond-forming activities in natural photoenzyme families, which can be used to tame the stereochemistry of free-radical-mediated reactions.

The design of artificial light-driven molecular motors operating with high efficiency and selectivity constitutes an ongoing fundamental challenge. Here we present a highly versatile synthetic approach based on Rieche formylation that boosts the quantum yield of the forward photoisomerization reaction while reaching near-perfect selectivity in the steps involved in the unidirectional rotary cycle and drastically reducing competing photoreactions. This motor is readily accessible in its enantiopure form and operates with nearly quantitative photoconversions. It can easily be functionalized further and outperforms its direct predecessor as a reconfigurable chiral dopant in cholesteric liquid crystal materials. Overcrowded alkene-derived molecular motors convert light and heat into chirality-directed unidirectional rotary motion, but the efficiency of their photochemical isomerization remains limited. Now formylation of the motor core has been shown to boost all aspects of motor photochemistry by improving photochemical efficiency, diminishing competing processes and redshifting absorption.},

However, RiPPs are rarely reported as hybrid molecules incorporating biosynthetic machinery from other natural product families. Here we report lipoavitides, a class of RiPP/fatty-acid hybrid lipopeptides that display a unique, putatively membrane-targeting 4-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylpentanoyl (HMP)-modified N terminus. The HMP is formed via condensation of isobutyryl-coenzyme A (isobutyryl-CoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA catalysed by a 3-ketoacyl-(acyl carrier protein) synthase III enzyme, followed by successive tailoring reactions in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. The HMP and RiPP substructures are then connected by an acyltransferase exhibiting promiscuous activity towards the fatty acyl and RiPP substrates. Overall, the discovery of lipoavitides contributes a prototype of RiPP/fatty-acid hybrids and provides possible enzymatic tools for lipopeptide bioengineering. Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) can have vast structural diversity and biological functions enabled by disparate post-translational modifications (PTMs). However, unconventional PTMs derived from non-RiPP biosynthesis are rarely reported.

However, as a promising isostere of naphthalene, the chiral version of 1,2-benzazaborine has rarely been explored due to the lack of efficient synthetic methods. Here we describe a copper-catalysed enantioselective hydroboration of alkenes with 1,2-benzazaborines. The method provides a general platform for the atom-economic and efficient construction of diverse chiral 1,2-benzazaborine compounds (more than 60 examples) that bear a 2-carbon-stereogenic centre or allene skeleton in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Three 1,2-benzazaborine analogues of bioactive chiral naphthalene-containing molecules have been prepared, and a series of transformations around chiral 1,2-benzazaborines have also been developed. Notably, the hydroboration process of this study reveals that the identity of 1,2-benzazaborine plays an essential role in the rate-determining step and catalyst resting state. Chiral 1,2-benzazaborines are promising isosteres of naphthalene, but rarely explored due to the lack of efficient synthetic methods.

While the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinate esters with stereogenic-at-sulfur(IV) centres is well developed, the synthesis of chiral sulfinamides remains challenging, which has primarily been attributed to the high nucleophilicity and competing reactions of amines. In this study, we have developed an efficient methodology for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral sulfinamides and sulfinate esters by the sulfinylation of diverse nucleophiles, including aromatic amines and alcohols, using our bifunctional chiral 4-arylpyridine N-oxides as catalysts. The remarkable results are a testament to the efficiency, versatility and broad applicability of the developed synthetic approach, serving as a valuable tool for the synthesis of sulfur pharmacophores. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations revealed that the initiation and stereocontrol of this reaction are induced by an acyl transfer catalyst. Our research provides an efficient approach for the construction of optically pure sulfur(IV) centres. Chiral sulfur pharmacophores are crucial in drug discovery, but the controlled synthesis of sulfinamides with stereogenic-at-sulfur(IV) centres is a long-standing challenge.

  abstract     = {Owing to its high toxicity, the chemistry of element number four, beryllium, is poorly understood. However, as the lightest elements provide the basis for fundamental models of chemical bonding, there is a need for greater insight into the properties of beryllium. In this context, the chemistry of the homo-elemental Be–Be bond is of fundamental interest. Here the ligand metathesis chemistry of diberyllocene (1; CpBeBeCp)—a stable complex with a Be–Be bond—has been investigated. These studies yield two complexes with Be–Be bonds: Cp*BeBeCp (2) and [K{(HCDippN)2BO}2]BeBeCp (3; Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl). Quantum chemical calculations indicate that the Be–Be bond in 3 is polarized to such an extent that the complex could be formulated as a mixed-oxidation state Be0/BeII complex. Correspondingly, it is demonstrated that 3 can transfer the ‘beryllyl’ anion, [BeCp]−, to an organic substrate, by analogy with the reactivity of sp2–sp3 diboranes. Indeed, this work reveals striking similarities between the homo-elemental bonding linkages of beryllium and boron, despite the respective metallic and non-metallic natures of these elements. The chemistry of beryllium, one of the periodic table’s lightest elements, remains poorly understood. Now, a nucleophilic beryllium complex with a highly polarized Be–Be bond has been prepared—this compound could be seen as a mixed-oxidation state Be(0)/Be(II) complex. The Be–Be bond is cleaved upon reaction with an organic substrate.},

It is challenging to predict the catalytic activities of OPCs from first principles, either by expert knowledge or by using a priori calculations, as catalyst activity depends on a complex range of interrelated properties. Organic photocatalysts and other catalyst systems have often been discovered by a mixture of design and trial and error. Here we report a two-step data-driven approach to the targeted synthesis of OPCs and the subsequent reaction optimization for metallophotocatalysis, demonstrated for decarboxylative sp3–sp2 cross-coupling of amino acids with aryl halides. Our approach uses a Bayesian optimization strategy coupled with encoding of key physical properties using molecular descriptors to identify promising OPCs from a virtual library of 560 candidate molecules. This led to OPC formulations that are competitive with iridium catalysts by exploring just 2.4% of the available catalyst formulation space (107 of 4,500 possible reaction conditions). Organic photoredox catalysts enable diverse chemical transformations, but predicting their activity is challenging due to complex properties. Now, a two-step data-driven approach is introduced for targeted organic photoredox catalysts synthesis and reaction optimization. Using Bayesian optimization, promising catalysts can be efficiently identified, yielding competitive results with iridium catalysts.},

Electron microscopy makes it possible to characterize the local structure and composition but is limited by insufficient contrast, electron beam sensitivity and the requirement for ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, which prevent the investigation of dynamic aspects. Here we show that, by exploiting high-quality graphene liquid cells, we can overcome these limitations and investigate the structure of the ligand shell around gold nanoparticles and at the ligand–gold interface in a liquid environment. Using this graphene liquid cell, we visualize the anisotropy, composition and dynamics of ligand distribution on gold nanorod surfaces. Our results indicate a micellar model for surfactant organization. This work provides a reliable and direct visualization of ligand distribution around colloidal nanoparticles.

  abstract     = {The identification of readers, an important class of proteins that recognize modified residues at specific sites, is essential to uncover the biological roles of post-translational modifications. Photoreactive crosslinkers are powerful tools for investigating readers. However, existing methods usually employ synthetically challenging photoreactive warheads, and their high-energy intermediates generated upon irradiation, such as nitrene and carbene, may cause substantial non-specific crosslinking. Here we report dimethylsulfonium as a methyllysine mimic that binds to specific readers and subsequently crosslinks to a conserved tryptophan inside the binding pocket through single-electron transfer under ultraviolet irradiation. The crosslinking relies on a protein-templated σ–π electron donor–acceptor interaction between sulfonium and indole, ensuring excellent site selectivity for tryptophan in the active site and orthogonality to other methyllysine readers. This method could escalate the discovery of methyllysine readers from complex cell samples. Furthermore, this photo crosslinking strategy could be extended to develop other types of microenvironment-dependent conjugations to site-specific tryptophan. Tryptophan plays important biological roles in aromatic cages, such as methyllysine recognition, but the development of site-selective crosslinking to tryptophan is challenging. Now sulfonium can be used as a methyllysine mimic that binds to reader proteins and crosslinks tryptophan inside a pocket through single-electron transfer. This strategy enables the identification of methyllysine readers from the proteome.},

Main-group compounds that can mimic the behaviour of the transition-metal complexes are of great interest due to their potential to substitute or complement transition metals in catalysis. While a few main-group molecular centres were shown to activate dihydrogen via the oxidative addition process, catalytic hydrogenation using these species has remained challenging. Here we report the synthesis, isolation and full characterization of the geometrically constrained phosphenium cation with the 2,6-bis(o-carborano)pyridine pincer-type ligand. Notably, this cation can activate the H–H bond by oxidative addition to a single PIII cationic centre, producing a dihydrophosphonium cation. This phosphenium cation is also capable of catalysing hydrogenation reactions of C=C double bonds and fused aromatic systems, making it a main-group compound that can both activate H2 at a single molecular main-group centre and be used for catalytic hydrogenation. This finding shows the potential of main-group compounds, in particular phosphorus-based compounds, to serve as metallomimetic hydrogenation catalysts. The oxidative addition of the H–H bond to a single main-group centre in a metallomimetic fashion and its further use in catalysis is challenging.

  abstract     = {Providing affordable, safe drinking water and universal sanitation poses a grand societal challenge. Here we developed atomically dispersed Au on potassium-incorporated polymeric carbon nitride material that could simultaneously boost photocatalytic generation of ·OH and H2O2 with an apparent quantum efficiency over 85% at 420 nm. Potassium introduction into the poly(heptazine imide) matrix formed strong K–N bonds and rendered Au with an oxidation number close to 0. Extensive experimental characterization and computational simulations revealed that the low-valent Au altered the materials’ band structure to trap highly localized holes produced under photoexcitation. These highly localized holes could boost the 1e− water oxidation reaction to form highly oxidative ·OH and simultaneously dissociate the hydrogen atom in H2O, which greatly promoted the reduction of oxygen to H2O2. The photogenerated ·OH led to an efficiency enhancement for visible-light-response superhydrophilicity. Furthermore, photo-illumination in an onsite fixed-bed reactor could disinfect water at a rate of 66 L H2O m−2 per day. Hydroxyl radicals are reactive species capable of water purification and disinfection, although their generation, particularly through renewable approaches, is challenging. Now, low-valent Au on potassium-incorporated carbon nitride has been shown to produce hydroxyl radicals upon solar illumination and to provide high water disinfection rates.},

  abstract     = {One of science’s greatest challenges is determining how life can spontaneously emerge from a mixture of molecules. A complicating factor is that life and its molecules are inherently unstable—RNA and proteins are prone to hydrolysis and denaturation. For the de novo synthesis of life or to better understand its emergence at its origin, selection mechanisms are needed for unstable molecules. Here we present a chemically fuelled dynamic combinatorial library to model RNA oligomerization and deoligomerization and shine new light on selection and purification mechanisms under kinetic control. In the experiments, oligomers can only be sustained by continuous production. Hybridization is a powerful tool for selecting unstable molecules, offering feedback on oligomerization and deoligomerization rates. Moreover, we find that templation can be used to purify libraries of oligomers. In addition, template-assisted formation of oligomers within coacervate-based protocells changes its compartment’s physical properties, such as their ability to fuse. Such reciprocal coupling between oligomer production and physical properties is a key step towards synthetic life. Selection mechanisms were critical at the emergence of life and will also be important for the synthesis of life. Now, it has been shown that template-based copying controls the selection of unstable molecules in a chemically fuelled dynamic combinatorial library. Moreover, when encapsulated inside coacervate droplets, these mechanisms change the coacervate’s physical properties.},

  abstract     = {The bottom-up engineering of artificial cells requires a reconfigurable cytoskeleton that can organize at distinct locations and dynamically modulate its structural and mechanical properties. Here, inspired by the vast array of actin-binding proteins and their ability to reversibly crosslink or bundle filaments, we have designed a library of peptide–DNA crosslinkers varying in length, valency and geometry. Peptide filaments conjoint through DNA hybridization give rise to tactoid-shaped bundles with tunable aspect ratios and mechanics. When confined in cell-sized water-in-oil droplets, the DNA crosslinker design guides the localization of cytoskeletal structures at the cortex or within the lumen of the synthetic cells. The tunable spatial arrangement regulates the passive diffusion of payloads within the droplets and complementary DNA handles allow for the reversible recruitment and release of payloads on and off the cytoskeleton. Heat-induced reconfiguration of peptide–DNA architectures triggers shape deformations of droplets, regulated by DNA melting temperatures. Altogether, the modular design of peptide–DNA architectures is a powerful strategy towards the bottom-up assembly of synthetic cells. Advances in the development of cytoskeletal-like materials with modular structures and mechanics are pivotal for the engineering of synthetic cells. Now actin-mimetic supramolecular peptide networks have been designed using programmable peptide–DNA crosslinkers, giving rise to tunable tactoid-shaped bundles and mechanical properties that control spatial localization, the diffusion of payloads and shape changes within artificial cells.},

  abstract     = {The ability of unevolved amino acid sequences to become biological catalysts was key to the emergence of life on Earth. However, billions of years of evolution separate complex modern enzymes from their simpler early ancestors. To probe how unevolved sequences can develop new functions, we use ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidics to screen for phosphoesterase activity amidst a library of more than one million sequences based on a de novo designed 4-helix bundle. Characterization of hits revealed that acquisition of function involved a large jump in sequence space enriching for truncations that removed &amp;gt;40% of the protein chain. Biophysical characterization of a catalytically active truncated protein revealed that it dimerizes into an α-helical structure, with the gain of function accompanied by increased structural dynamics. The identified phosphodiesterase is a manganese-dependent metalloenzyme that hydrolyses a range of phosphodiesters. It is most active towards cyclic AMP, with a rate acceleration of ~109 and a catalytic proficiency of &amp;gt;1014 M−1, comparable to larger enzymes shaped by billions of years of evolution. Evolution separates complex modern enzymes from their hypothetical simpler early ancestors, which raises the question of how unevolved sequences can develop new functions. Here a library of non-natural protein sequences was subjected to ultrahigh-throughput screens in microfluidic droplets, leading to the isolation of a phosphodiesterase enzyme capable of hydrolysing the biological second messenger, cyclic AMP.},

  abstract     = {Phenols and their derivatives are ubiquitous in nature and critically important industrial chemicals. Their properties are intimately linked to the relative substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, reflecting well-known electronic effects of the OH group. Because of these ortho-, para-directing effects, meta-substituted phenols have historically been more difficult to synthesize. Here we describe a procedure to transpose phenols that hinges on a regioselective diazotization of the corresponding ortho-quinone. The procedure affords the meta-substituted phenol directly from its more common and accessible para-substituted isomer, and demonstrates good chemoselectivity that enables its application in late-stage settings. By changing the electronic effect of the OH group and its trajectory of hydrogen bonding, our transposition can be used to diversify natural products and existing chemical libraries, and potentially shorten the length and cost of producing underrepresented arene isomers. Phenols and their derivatives are ubiquitous in nature and important within the chemical industry. Their properties are linked to their substitution patterns, but meta-isomers are underrepresented due to the difficulty of their synthesis. Now we address this challenge by describing a 1,2-transposition of phenols that enables a formal para- to meta-isomerization.},

  abstract     = {Polymers that degrade on demand have the potential to facilitate chemical recycling, reduce environmental pollution and are useful in implant immolation, drug delivery or as adhesives that debond on demand. However, polymers made by radical polymerization, which feature all carbon-bond backbones and constitute the most important class of polymers, have proven difficult to render degradable. Here we report cyclobutene-based monomers that can be co-polymerized with conventional monomers and impart the resulting polymers with mechanically triggered degradability. The cyclobutene residues act as mechanophores and can undergo a mechanically triggered ring-opening reaction, which causes a rearrangement that renders the polymer chains cleavable by hydrolysis under basic conditions. These cyclobutene-based monomers are broadly applicable in free radical and controlled radical polymerizations, introduce functional groups into the backbone of polymers and allow the mechanically gated degradation of high-molecular-weight materials or cross-linked polymer networks into low-molecular-weight species. Radical polymerizations yield polymers that cannot easily be degraded. The co-polymerization of cyclobutene-based monomers with conventional vinyl monomers has now been shown to result in co-polymers with cyclobutane mechanophores in their backbone, which facilitate on-demand degradation through a combination of mechanical activation and hydrolysis. This approach offers a promising avenue for the degradation of all-carbon-bond-backbone polymers.},

  abstract     = {Enantioconvergent reactions are pre-eminent in contemporary asymmetric synthesis as they convert both enantiomers of a racemic starting material into a single enantioenriched product, thus avoiding the maximum 50% yield associated with resolutions. All currently known enantioconvergent processes necessitate the loss or partial loss of the racemic substrate’s stereochemical information, thus limiting the potential substrate scope to molecules that contain labile stereogenic units. Here we present an alternative approach to enantioconvergent reactions that can proceed with full retention of the racemic substrate’s configuration. This uniquely stereo-economic approach is possible if the two enantiomers of a racemic starting material are joined together to form one enantiomer of a non-meso product. Experimental validation of this concept is presented using two distinct strategies: (1) a direct asymmetric coupling approach, and (2) a multicomponent approach, which exhibits statistical amplification of enantiopurity. Thus, the established dogma that enantioconvergent reactions require substrates that contain labile stereogenic units is shown to be incorrect. Enantioconvergent reactions convert both enantiomers of a racemic starting material into a single enantioenriched product. All currently known enantioconvergent processes necessitate the loss or partial loss of the racemic substrate’s stereochemical information. Now, an alternative approach has been developed that proceeds with full retention of the racemic substrate’s configuration.},

  abstract     = {Visible-light-driven photoredox catalysis is known to be a powerful tool for organic synthesis. Its occurrence critically depends on the twice exothermic single-electron transfer processes of photosensitizers, which are governed by the redox properties of the species involved. Hence, the inherently narrow range of redox potentials of photosensitizers inevitably constrains their further availability. Sensitization-initiated electron transfer has recently been found to effectively overcome this substantial challenge. However, feasible and practical strategies for designing such complicated catalytic systems are rather scarce. Herein we report an elaborate dual-catalyst platform, with dicyanopyrazine as a visible light photosensitizer and a pyrenyl-incorporated chiral phosphoric acid as a co-sensitizer, and we demonstrate the applicability of this sensitization-initiated electron transfer strategy in an asymmetric formal de Mayo-type reaction. The catalysis platform enables otherwise thermodynamically unfavourable electron transfer processes to close the redox cycle and allows for precise access to valuable enantioenriched 1,5-diketones with a wide substrate range. The redox properties of visible-light-absorbing photosensitizers are limited by the energy of visible photons, but methods using sensitization-initiated electron transfer have recently been developed to address these challenges. Now a multiphoton dual-catalyst strategy has been used to enable the enantioselective de Mayo reaction for the synthesis of enantioenriched 1,5-diketones.},

  abstract     = {Carbon capture, utilization and storage is a key yet cost-intensive technology for the fight against climate change. Single-component water-lean solvents have emerged as promising materials for post-combustion CO2 capture, but little is known regarding their mechanism of action. Here we present a combined experimental and modelling study of single-component water-lean solvents, and we find that CO2 capture is accompanied by the self-assembly of reverse-micelle-like tetrameric clusters in solution. This spontaneous aggregation leads to stepwise cooperative capture phenomena with highly contrasting mechanistic and thermodynamic features. The emergence of well-defined supramolecular architectures displaying a hydrogen-bonded internal core, reminiscent of enzymatic active sites, enables the formation of CO2-containing molecular species such as carbamic acid, carbamic anhydride and alkoxy carbamic anhydrides. This system extends the scope of adducts and mechanisms observed during carbon capture. It opens the way to materials with a higher CO2 storage capacity and provides a means for carbamates to potentially act as initiators for future oligomerization or polymerization of CO2. Carbon capture, utilization and storage is key for climate change mitigation and developing more environmentally friendly technologies. Now it has been shown that CO2 capture in single-component water-lean solvents is accompanied by the self-assembly of reverse-micelle-like tetrameric clusters in solution that enable the formation of various CO2-containing compounds.},

For productive onward reaction to occur, the oxidized donor and the reduced acceptor must escape from that solvent cage before they undergo spontaneous reverse electron transfer. Here we show the decisive role that cage escape plays in three benchmark photocatalytic reactions, namely, an aerobic hydroxylation, a reductive debromination and an aza-Henry reaction. Using ruthenium(II)- and chromium(III)-based photocatalysts, which provide inherently different cage escape quantum yields, we determined quantitative correlations between the rates of photoredox product formation and the cage escape quantum yields. These findings can be largely rationalized within the framework of Marcus theory for electron transfer. The spontaneous recombination of photogenerated radicals surrounded by solvent molecules is an important energy-wasting elementary step in photoredox reactions. Now the decisive role that cage escape plays in these reactions is shown in three benchmark photocatalytic reactions, with quantitative correlations observed between photoredox product formation rates and cage escape quantum yields.},

Here we present a highly reactive air- and moisture-stable ruthenium precatalyst [(tBuCN)5Ru(H2O)](BF4)2, featuring a key exchangeable water ligand. This versatile precatalyst drives an array of transformations, including late-stage C(sp2)–H arylation, primary/secondary alkylation, methylation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, C(sp3)–H oxidation, alkene isomerization and oxidative cleavage, consistently outperforming conventionally used ruthenium (pre)catalysts. The generality and applicability of this precatalyst is exemplified through the potential for rapid screening and optimization of photocatalytic reactions with a suite of in situ generated ruthenium photocatalysts containing hitherto unknown complexes, and through the rapid discovery of reactivities previously unreported for ruthenium. The diverse applicability observed is suggestive of a generic platform for reaction simplification and accelerated synthetic discovery that will enable broader applicability and accessibility to state-of-the-art ruthenium catalysis. Despite the widespread utility of ruthenium catalysts, many protocols for their use require high temperatures or light irradiation. Now, the synthesis of an air- and moisture-stable ruthenium precatalyst has been reported. This versatile catalyst drives an array of transformations and enables rapid screening and optimization of reactions, revealing previously unknown in situ generated ruthenium complexes.},

Many GNRs have been reported, yet no scalable strategies are known for synthesizing GNRs with metal atoms and heteroaromatic units at precisely defined positions in the conjugated backbone, which would be valuable for tuning their optical, electronic and magnetic properties. Here we report the solution-phase synthesis of a porphyrin-fused graphene nanoribbon (PGNR). This PGNR has metalloporphyrins fused into a twisted fjord-edged GNR backbone; it consists of long chains (&amp;gt;100 nm), with a narrow optical bandgap (~1.0 eV) and high local charge mobility (&amp;gt;400 cm2 V–1 s–1 by terahertz spectroscopy). We use this PGNR to fabricate ambipolar field-effect transistors with appealing switching behaviour, and single-electron transistors displaying multiple Coulomb diamonds. These results open an avenue to π-extended nanostructures with engineerable electrical and magnetic properties by transposing the coordination chemistry of porphyrins into graphene nanoribbons. The insertion of metal atoms and heteroaromatic units provides a way to tune the optical, electronic and magnetic properties of graphene nanoribbons. Now the synthesis of a porphyrin-fused graphene nanoribbon with a narrow bandgap and high charge mobility has been achieved, and this material used to fabricate field-effect and single-electron transistors.},

Many synthetic methods have been developed to access rare or unnatural variants by controlling the installation of the α-stereocentre. By contrast, and despite their importance, α-amino acids possessing β-stereocentres are much harder to synthesize. Here we demonstrate an iridium-catalysed protocol that allows the direct upconversion of simple alkenes and glycine derivatives to give β-substituted α-amino acids with exceptional levels of regio- and stereocontrol. Our method exploits the native directing ability of a glycine-derived N–H unit to facilitate Ir-catalysed enolization of the adjacent carbonyl. The resulting stereodefined enolate cross-couples with a styrene or α-olefin to install two contiguous stereocentres. The process offers very high levels of regio- and stereocontrol and occurs with complete atom economy. In broader terms, our reaction design offers a unique directing-group-controlled strategy for the direct stereocontrolled α-alkylation of carbonyl compounds, and provides a powerful approach for the synthesis of challenging contiguous stereocentres. α-Amino acids possessing β-stereocentres are difficult to synthesize.

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between a polypeptide sequence and its phase separation has important implications for analysing cellular function, treating disease and designing novel biomaterials. Several sequence features have been identified as drivers for protein liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), schematized as a ‘molecular grammar’ for LLPS. Here we further probe how sequence modulates phase separation and the material properties of the resulting condensates, targeting sequence features previously overlooked in the literature. We generate sequence variants of a repeat polypeptide with either no charged residues, high net charge, no glycine residues or devoid of aromatic or arginine residues. All but one of 12 variants exhibited LLPS, albeit to different extents, despite substantial differences in composition. Furthermore, we find that all the condensates formed behaved like viscous fluids, despite large differences in their viscosities. Our results support the model of multiple interactions between diverse residue pairs—not just a handful of residues—working in tandem to drive the phase separation and dynamics of condensates. Key molecular features that drive protein liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) for biomolecular condensate have been reported. A spectrum of additional interactions that influence protein LLPS and material properties have now been characterized. These interactions extend beyond a limited set of residue types and can be modulated by environmental factors such as temperature and salt concentration.},

However, a large population of endogenous condensates and their candidate phase-separating proteins have yet to be discovered in a quantitative and high-throughput manner. Here we demonstrate that endogenously expressed biomolecular condensates can be identified across a cell’s proteome by sorting proteins across varying oligomeric states. We employ volumetric compression to modulate the concentrations of intracellular proteins and the degree of crowdedness, which are physical regulators of cellular biomolecular condensates. The changes in degree of the partition of proteins into condensates or phase separation led to varying oligomeric states of the proteins, which can be detected by coupling density gradient ultracentrifugation and quantitative mass spectrometry. In total, we identified 1,518 endogenous condensate proteins, of which 538 have not been reported before. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our strategy can identify condensate proteins that respond to specific biological processes. High-throughput proteome-wide methods for identifying endogenous proteins that phase separate or partition into condensates during certain physiological events are needed but remain a challenge. Now, a high-throughput, unbiased and quantitative strategy can identify endogenous biomolecular condensates and screen proteins involved in phase separation on a proteome-wide scale.},

The Al–Li bond features a high ionic character and profits from attractive dispersion interactions between the isopropyl groups of the cyclopentadienyl ligands. A key synthetic step is the isolation of a cyclopentadienylaluminylene monomer, which also enables the structural characterization of this species. In addition to their structural authentication by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, both compounds were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state. Furthermore, reactivity studies of the lithium–aluminium heterobimetallic dimetallocene with an N-heterocyclic carbene and different heteroallenes were performed and show that the Al–Li bond is easily cleaved. Dimetallocenes are a narrow class of compounds represented by the homobimetallic examples dizincocene and diberyllocene.

  abstract     = {Carbenes (R1R2C:) like radicals, arynes and nitrenes constitute an important family of neutral, high-energy, reactive intermediates—fleeting chemical entities that undergo rapid reactions. An alkyne (R3C≡CR4) is a fundamental functional group that houses a high degree of potential energy; however, the substantial kinetic stability of alkynes renders them conveniently handleable as shelf-stable chemical commodities. The ability to generate metal-free carbenes directly from alkynes, fuelled by the high potential (that is, thermodynamic) energy of the latter, would constitute a considerable advance. We report here that this can be achieved simply by warming a mixture of a 2-alkynyl iminoheterocycle (a cyclic compound containing a nucleophilic nitrogen atom) with an electrophilic alkyne. We demonstrate considerable generality for the process: many shelf-stable alkyne electrophiles engage many classes of (2-alkynyl)heterocyclic nucleophiles to produce carbene intermediates that immediately undergo many types of transformations to provide facile and practical access to a diverse array of heterocyclic products. Key mechanistic aspects of the reactions are delineated. Thermal generation of free carbenes with 100% atom economy is rare. Now, it has been shown that this can be achieved by the net [3+2] cycloaddition between many classes of 2-alkynyl iminoheterocycles and electrophilic alkynes. Together with a host of carbene trapping reactions, this method provides facile and versatile access to diverse heterocycle scaffolds.},

  abstract     = {Endogenous biomolecular condensates, composed of a multitude of proteins and RNAs, can organize into multiphasic structures with compositionally distinct phases. This multiphasic organization is generally understood to be critical for facilitating their proper biological function. However, the biophysical principles driving multiphase formation are not completely understood. Here we use in vivo condensate reconstitution experiments and coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate how oligomerization and sequence interactions modulate multiphase organization in biomolecular condensates. We demonstrate that increasing the oligomerization state of an intrinsically disordered protein results in enhanced immiscibility and multiphase formation. Interestingly, we find that oligomerization tunes the miscibility of intrinsically disordered proteins in an asymmetric manner, with the effect being more pronounced when the intrinsically disordered protein, exhibiting stronger homotypic interactions, is oligomerized. Our findings suggest that oligomerization is a flexible biophysical mechanism that cells can exploit to tune the internal organization of biomolecular condensates and their associated biological functions. The biomolecular principles underlying the formation of multiphasic condensates have been difficult to elucidate owing to a paucity of tools, especially within living cells. In this work synthetic orthogonal protein scaffolds alongside molecular simulations are used to highlight how the oligomerization of disordered proteins can asymmetrically drive miscibility–immiscibility transitions.},

  abstract     = {Cells harbour numerous mesoscale membraneless compartments that house specific biochemical processes and perform distinct cellular functions. These protein- and RNA-rich bodies are thought to form through multivalent interactions among proteins and nucleic acids, resulting in demixing via liquid–liquid phase separation. Proteins harbouring intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) predominate in membraneless organelles. However, it is not known whether IDR sequence alone can dictate the formation of distinct condensed phases. We identified a pair of IDRs capable of forming spatially distinct condensates when expressed in cells. When reconstituted in vitro, these model proteins do not co-partition, suggesting condensation specificity is encoded directly in the polypeptide sequences. Through computational modelling and mutagenesis, we identified the amino acids and chain properties governing homotypic and heterotypic interactions that direct selective condensation. These results form the basis of physicochemical principles that may direct subcellular organization of IDRs into specific condensates and reveal an IDR code that can guide construction of orthogonal membraneless compartments. Cells spatially organize biochemical reactions within membrane-bound and membraneless compartments. The extent to which intrinsically disordered proteins themselves can form discrete compartments or condensed phases is poorly understood. Now a pair of model IDRs that display orthogonality in condensation and the chain features governing selective assembly have been identified.},

  abstract     = {Several RNA binding proteins involved in membraneless organelles can form pathological amyloids associated with neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms of how this aggregation is modulated remain elusive. Here we investigate how heterotypic protein–RNA interactions modulate the condensation and the liquid to amyloid transition of hnRNPA1A, a protein involved in amyothropic lateral sclerosis. In the absence of RNA, formation of condensates promotes hnRNPA1A aggregation and fibrils are localized at the interface of the condensates. Addition of RNA modulates the soluble to amyloid transition of hnRNPA1A according to different pathways depending on RNA/protein stoichiometry. At low RNA concentrations, RNA promotes both condensation and amyloid formation, and the catalytic effect of RNA adds to the role of the interface between the dense and dilute phases. At higher RNA concentrations, condensation is suppressed according to re-entrant phase behaviour but formation of hnRNPA1A amyloids is observed over longer incubation times. Our findings show how heterotypic nucleic acid–protein interactions affect the kinetics and molecular pathways of amyloid formation. The underlying mechanism for how heterotypic protein–RNA interactions modulate the liquid to amyloid transition of hnRNPA1A, a protein involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has so far remained elusive. Now characterization of hnRNPA1A condensate formation and aggregation in vitro reveals that the RNA/protein stoichiometry affects the molecular pathways leading to amyloid formation.},

Here we report the fabrication of hydrogel assemblies with these features by reversibly gluing hydrogel units using a photocontrolled metallopolymer adhesive. The metallopolymer adhesive firmly attached individual hydrogel units via metal–ligand coordination and polymer chain entanglement. Hydrogel assemblies containing temperature- and pH-responsive hydrogel units showed controllable shape changes and motions in response to these external stimuli. To reconfigure their structures, the hydrogel assemblies were disassembled by irradiating the metallopolymer adhesive with light; the disassembled hydrogel units were then reassembled using the metallopolymer adhesive with heating. The shape change and structure reconfiguration abilities allow us to reprogramme the functions of hydrogel assemblies. The development of reconfigurable hydrogel assemblies using reversible adhesives provides a strategy for designing intelligent materials and soft robots with user-defined functions. Although hydrogels with complex, heterogeneous and reconfigurable structures are promising materials for use in intelligent systems, fabricating such hydrogels is challenging. Now it has been shown that they can be fabricated by reversibly gluing different hydrogel units using a photocontrolled metallopolymer adhesive.

  abstract     = {The development of surface-immobilized molecular redox catalysts is an emerging research field with promising applications in sustainable chemistry. In electrocatalysis, paramagnetic species are often key intermediates in the mechanistic cycle but are inherently difficult to detect and follow by conventional in situ techniques. We report a new method, operando film-electrochemical electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (FE-EPR), which enables mechanistic studies of surface-immobilized electrocatalysts. This technique enables radicals formed during redox reactions to be followed in real time under flow conditions, at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Detailed insight into surface-immobilized catalysts, as exemplified here through alcohol oxidation catalysis by a surface-immobilized nitroxide, is possible by detecting active-site paramagnetic species sensitively and quantitatively operando, thereby enabling resolution of the reaction kinetics. Our finding that the surface electron-transfer rate, which is of the same order of magnitude as the rate of catalysis (accessible from operando FE-EPR), limits catalytic efficiency has implications for the future design of better surface-immobilized catalysts. Although surface-bound molecular catalysts offer well-defined active sites on heterogeneous supports, it is challenging to identify key radical intermediates in the reaction mechanism. Now, a characterization method has been developed that combines film electrochemistry and EPR spectroscopy to track radical intermediates in real time, exemplified by alcohol oxidation with a surface-immobilized nitroxide.},

A natural product’s framework can be modified, but only if it is abundant and contains suitably modifiable functional groups. Here we introduce a programmable strategy for concise synthesis of precisely altered scaffolds of scarce bridged polycyclic alkaloids. Central to our approach is a scalable catalytic multi-component process that delivers diastereo- and enantiomerically enriched tertiary homoallylic alcohols bearing differentiable alkenyl moieties. We used one product to launch progressively divergent syntheses of a naturally occurring alkaloid and its precisely expanded, contracted and/or distorted framework analogues (average number of steps/scaffold of seven). In vitro testing showed that a skeleton expanded by one methylene in two regions is cytotoxic against four types of cancer cell line. Mechanistic and computational studies offer an account for several unanticipated selectivity trends. New drug leads can be developed through modification of a natural product’s framework, but this is possible only if the compound is abundant and contains modifiable moieties. Now a strategy is introduced for accessing a scarce indole alkaloid and several expanded, contracted and distorted analogues, one of which shows anti-cancer activity.},

  abstract     = {π-Conjugated macrocycles behave differently from analogous linear chains because their electronic wavefunctions resemble a quantum particle on a ring, leading to aromaticity or anti-aromaticity. [18]Annulene, (CH)18, is the archetypal non-benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbon. Molecules with circuits of 4n + 2 π electrons, such as [18]annulene (n = 4), are aromatic, with enhanced stability and diatropic ring currents (magnetic shielding inside the ring), whereas those with 4n π electrons, such as the dianion of [18]annulene, are expected to be anti-aromatic and exhibit the opposite behaviour. Here we use 1H NMR spectroscopy to re-evaluate the structure of the [18]annulene dianion. We also show that it can be reduced further to an aromatic tetraanion, which has the same shape as the dianion. The crystal structure of the tetraanion lithium salt confirms its geometry and reveals a metallocene-like sandwich, with five Li+ cations intercalated between two [18]annulene tetraanions. We also report a heteroleptic sandwich, with [18]annulene and corannulene tetraanion decks. A previous investigation of the anti-aromatic dianion of [18]annulene concluded that it consists of a mixture of two isomers. Now it has been shown that this dianion exists as a single isomer, with a different geometry from neutral [18]annulene, and that it can be reduced further to an aromatic tetraanion.},

  abstract     = {Building molecular complexity from simple feedstocks through precise peripheral and skeletal modifications is central to modern organic synthesis. Nevertheless, a controllable strategy through which both the core skeleton and the periphery of an aromatic heterocycle can be modified with a common substrate remains elusive, despite its potential to maximize structural diversity and applications. Here we report a carbene-initiated chemodivergent molecular editing of indoles that allows both skeletal and peripheral editing by trapping an electrophilic fluoroalkyl carbene generated in situ from fluoroalkyl N-triftosylhydrazones. A variety of fluorine-containing N-heterocyclic scaffolds have been efficiently achieved through tunable chemoselective editing reactions at the skeleton or periphery of indoles, including one-carbon insertion, C3 gem-difluoroolefination, tandem cyclopropanation and N1 gem-difluoroolefination, and cyclopropanation. The power of this chemodivergent molecular editing strategy has been highlighted through the modification of the skeleton or periphery of natural products in a controllable and chemoselective manner. The reaction mechanism and origins of the chemo- and regioselectivity have been probed by both experimental and theoretical methods. The rapid generation of molecular complexity from a given molecular scaffold is crucial to drug discovery and development. Now the chemodivergent molecular editing of indoles using fluoroalkyl carbenes has been developed to modularly access four different types of fluorine-containing N-heterocyclic compound with high molecular complexity.},

However, there are few tools available to track the reactions that occur within electrolysers. Here we report an electrolysis optical coherence tomography platform to visualize the chemical reactions occurring in a CO2 electrolyser. This platform was designed to capture three-dimensional images and videos at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We recorded 12 h of footage of an electrolyser containing a porous electrode separated by a membrane, converting a continuous feed of liquid KHCO3 to reduce CO2 into CO at applied current densities of 50–800 mA cm−2. This platform visualized reactants, intermediates and products, and captured the strikingly dynamic movement of the cathode and membrane components during electrolysis. It also linked CO production to regions of the electrolyser in which CO2 was in direct contact with both membrane and catalyst layers. These results highlight how this platform can be used to track reactions in continuous flow electrochemical reactors. Electrolysers can upgrade CO2 into high-value chemicals, but there are few tools capable of tracking the reactions that occur within these devices during operation.

Although image contrast has been shown to improve as longer wavelengths are accessed, the design and synthesis of organic fluorophores that emit in these regions is challenging. Here we synthesize a series of silicon-RosIndolizine (SiRos) fluorophores that exhibit peak emission wavelengths from 1,300–1,700 nm and emission onsets of 1,800–2,200 nm. We characterize the fluorophores photophysically (both steady-state and time-resolved), electrochemically and computationally using time-dependent density functional theory. Using two of the fluorophores (SiRos1300 and SiRos1550), we formulate nanoemulsions and use them for general systemic circulatory SWIR fluorescence imaging of the cardiovascular system in mice. These studies resulted in high-resolution SWIR images with well-defined vasculature visible throughout the entire circulatory system. This SiRos scaffold establishes design principles for generating long-wavelength emitting SWIR and ESWIR fluorophores. Accessing longer-wavelength emitting organic fluorophores is critical for diagnostic imaging. Here a series of silicon-RosIndolizine fluorophores with emission maxima at 1,300 nm, 1,550 nm and 1,700 nm were synthesized. The fluorophores generate high-resolution in vivo fluorescence images in mice and establish design principles for future shortwave-infrared fluorophore designs.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced concerted multiple-bond rotation has been proposed in some biological systems. However, the observation of such phenomena in synthetic systems, in other words, the synthesis of molecules that undergo photoinduced multiple-bond rotation upon photoirradiation, has been a challenge in the photochemistry field. Here we describe a chalcogen-substituted benzamide system that exhibits photoinduced dual bond rotation in heteroatom-containing bonds. Introduction of the chalcogen substituent into a sterically hindered benzamide system provides sufficient kinetic stability and photosensitivity to enable the photoinduced concerted rotation. The presence of two different substituents on the phenyl ring in the thioamide derivative enables the generation of a pair of enantiomers and E/Z isomers. Using these four stereoisomers as indicators of which bonds are rotated, we monitor the photoinduced C–N/C–C concerted bond rotation in the thioamide derivative depending on external stimuli such as temperature and photoirradiation. Theoretical calculations provide insight on the mechanism of this selective photoinduced C–N/C–C concerted rotation. Although photoinduced concerted multiple-bond-rotation processes are known in photoactive biological systems, the synthesis of compounds exhibiting similar behaviour has proven challenging. Now a thioamide-based system featuring chalcogen substituents has been shown to exhibit photoinduced C–N/C–C rotation; the rotation mode can be switched depending on external stimuli such as temperature and light irradiation.},

A diverse PNP collection was synthesized from a common divergent intermediate through developed indole dearomatization methodologies to afford three-dimensional molecular frameworks that could be further diversified via intramolecular coupling and/or carbon monoxide insertion. In total, 154 PNPs were synthesized representing eight different classes. Cheminformatic analyses showed that the PNPs are structurally diverse between classes. Biological investigations revealed the extent of diverse bioactivity enrichment of the collection in which four inhibitors of Hedgehog signalling, DNA synthesis, de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and tubulin polymerization were identified from four different PNP classes. Design strategies that possess both biological relevance and structural diversity may lead to compound collections that are enriched in diverse bioactivities.

  abstract     = {Open-shell nanographenes exhibit unconventional π-magnetism arising from topological frustration or strong electron–electron interaction. However, conventional design approaches are typically limited to a single magnetic origin, which can restrict the number of correlated spins or the type of magnetic ordering in open-shell nanographenes. Here we present a design strategy that combines topological frustration and electron–electron interactions to fabricate a large fully fused ‘butterfly’-shaped tetraradical nanographene on Au(111). We employ bond-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy and spin-excitation spectroscopy to resolve the molecular backbone and reveal the strongly correlated open-shell character, respectively. This nanographene contains four unpaired electrons with both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic interactions, harbouring a many-body singlet ground state and strong multi-spin entanglement, which is well described by many-body calculations. Furthermore, we study the magnetic properties and spin states in the nanographene using a nickelocene magnetic probe. The ability to imprint and characterize many-body strongly correlated spins in polyradical nanographenes paves the way for future advancements in quantum information technologies. The design of open-shell nanographenes is commonly limited to systems featuring a single magnetic origin. Now a strategy that combines topological frustration and electron–electron interactions has been developed to generate a butterfly-shaped nanographene that hosts four highly entangled π-spins and exhibits both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic coupling.},

Classic and recent studies of the oxidative addition of aryl halides to Ni(0)—a common step in widely practised cross-coupling processes—have yielded contradictory conclusions about stepwise, radical versus concerted mechanisms, but such information is crucial to the design of catalysts based on earth-abundant metals. Here we show that the oxidative addition of aryl halides to Ni(0) ligated by monophosphines occurs by both mechanisms and delineate how the branching of radical and non-radical pathways depends on the electronic properties of both the ligand and reactant arene as well as the identity of the halide. The one-electron pathway occurs by outer-sphere electron transfer to form an aryl radical rather than the often-proposed halogen atom transfer. The mechanism for the oxidative addition of aryl halides to nickel(0)–phosphine complexes was proposed over four decades ago. Now, this elementary reaction, which occurs during common cross-coupling reactions, has been re-examined. Both one- and two-electron pathways occur, and their relative contribution depends on the electronic properties of the reaction partners.},

Fluorinated solvents can improve battery longevity by improving LiF content in the solid–electrolyte interphase; however, the high cost and environmental concerns of fluorinated solvents limit battery viability. Here we designed a series of fluorine-free solvents through the methylation of 1,2-dimethoxyethane, which promotes inorganic LiF-rich interphase formation through anion reduction and achieves high oxidation stability. The anion-derived LiF interphases suppress lithium dendrite growth on the lithium anode and minimize cathode cracking under high-voltage operation. The Li+-solvent structure is investigated through in situ techniques and simulations to draw correlations between the interphase compositions and electrochemical performances. The methylation strategy provides an alternative pathway for electrolyte engineering towards high-voltage electrolytes while reducing dependence on expensive fluorinated solvents. Lithium metal batteries are an attractive energy storage technology, but their development relies on the complex interplay between the components’ chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Now, selective methylation of dimethoxyethane ether electrolytes is shown to improve electrolyte, electrode and solid–electrolyte interphase stabilities to enable high-performance 4.3 V lithium metal batteries.},

  abstract     = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) dynamically regulate cellular processes. Lysine undergoes a range of acylations, including malonylation, succinylation (SucK) and glutarylation (GluK). These PTMs increase the size of the lysine side chain and reverse its charge from +1 to −1 under physiological conditions, probably impacting protein structure and function. To understand the functional roles of these PTMs, homogeneously modified proteins are required for biochemical studies. While the site-specific encoding of PTMs and their mimics via genetic code expansion has facilitated the characterization of the functional roles of many PTMs, negatively charged lysine acylations have defied this approach. Here we describe site-specific incorporation of SucK and GluK into proteins via temporarily masking their negative charge through thioester derivatives. We prepare succinylated and glutarylated bacterial and mammalian target proteins, including non-refoldable multidomain proteins. This allows us to study how succinylation and glutarylation impact enzymatic activity of metabolic enzymes and regulate protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions in biological processes from replication to ubiquitin signalling. Negatively charged lysine acylations—malonylation, succinylation and glutarylation—impact protein structure and function, which can affect cellular processes. Now temporarily masked thioester derivatives of succinylation and glutarylation can be used for site-specific modification of diverse bacterial and mammalian proteins, which can facilitate the study of how these lysine modifications impact enzymatic activity and control protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions.},

  abstract     = {Cyclopropenes are the smallest unsaturated carbocycles. Removing one substituent from cyclopropenes leads to cyclopropenium cations (C3+ systems, CPCs). Stable aromatic π-type CPCs were discovered by Breslow in 1957 by removing a substituent on the aliphatic position. In contrast, σ-type CPCs—formally accessed by removing one substituent on the alkene—are unstable and relatively unexplored. Here we introduce electrophilic cyclopropenyl-gold(III) species as equivalents of σ-type CPCs, which can then react with terminal alkynes and vinylboronic acids. With catalyst loadings as low as 2 mol%, the synthesis of highly functionalized alkynyl- or alkenyl-cyclopropenes proceeded under mild conditions. A class of hypervalent iodine reagents—the cyclopropenyl benziodoxoles (CpBXs)—enabled the direct oxidation of gold(I) to gold(III) with concomitant transfer of a cyclopropenyl group. This protocol was general, tolerant to numerous functional groups and could be used for the late-stage modification of complex natural products, bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals. The σ-type cyclopropenium cations (CPCs) are unstable species and currently underdeveloped. Now, an iodine(III)-based cyclopropenyl transfer reagent has been developed, which can generate electrophilic cyclopropenyl-gold(III) species as equivalents of σ-type CPCs. The synthetic potential has been demonstrated by the transfer of σ-type CPCs to terminal alkynes and vinylboronic acids.},

  abstract     = {Metal-free catalysts offer a desirable alternative to traditional metal-based electrocatalysts. However, metal-free catalysts, featuring defined active sites, rarely show activities as promising as metal-based materials. Here we report 2-thiolimidazole as an efficient metal-free catalyst for selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetylene into ethylene. Under alkaline conditions, the sulfhydryl and imino groups of 2-thiolimidazole are spontaneously deprotonated into dianions. Deprotonation thus enriches the negative charges of pyridinic N sites in 2-thiolimidazole to enhance the adsorption of electrophilic acetylene through the σ-configuration. Ethylene partial current densities show a volcano relationship with the negative charges of the pyridinic N sites in various imidazole derivatives. Consequently, the deprotonated 2-thiolimidazole exhibits an ethylene partial current density and faradaic efficiency competitive with metal-based catalysts like Cu and Pd. This work highlights the tunability and promising potential of metal-free molecules in electrocatalysis. Although metal-free catalysts, featuring defined active sites, represent alternatives to scarce or problematic metals, metal-free compounds rarely show activities as promising as metal-based materials. Now deprotonated 2-thiolimidazole is shown to serve as a metal-free electrocatalyst for selective acetylene hydrogenation and achieves competitive performances with metal-based catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Ganglioside glycans are ubiquitous and complex biomolecules that are involved in a wide range of biological functions and disease processes. Variations in sialylation and sulfation render the structural complexity and diversity of ganglioside glycans, and influence protein–carbohydrate interactions. Structural and functional insights into the biological roles of these glycans are impeded due to the limited accessibility of well-defined structures. Here we report an integrated chemoenzymatic strategy for expeditious and systematic synthesis of a comprehensive 65-membered ganglioside glycan library covering all possible patterns of sulfation and sialylation. This strategy relies on the streamlined modular assembly of three common sialylated precursors by highly stereoselective iterative sialylation, modular site-specific sulfation through flexible orthogonal protecting-group manipulations and enzymatic-catalysed diversification using three sialyltransferase modules and a galactosidase module. These diverse ganglioside glycans enable exploration into their structure–function relationships using high-throughput glycan microarray technology, which reveals that different patterns of sulfation and sialylation on these glycans mediate their unique binding specificities. Deciphering the sulfation and sialylation codes of ganglioside glycans is impeded by the limited accessibility of well-defined structures. Now, an integrated chemoenzymatic strategy has been developed for efficient synthesis of a comprehensive 65-membered ganglioside glycan library, enabling an extensive exploration into their structure–function relationships using glycan microarray technology.},

  abstract     = {Conversion of plastic wastes to valuable carbon resources without using noble metal catalysts or external hydrogen remains a challenging task. Here we report a layered self-pillared zeolite that enables the conversion of polyethylene to gasoline with a remarkable selectivity of 99% and yields of &amp;gt;80% in 4 h at 240 °C. The liquid product is primarily composed of branched alkanes (selectivity of 72%), affording a high research octane number of 88.0 that is comparable to commercial gasoline (86.6). In situ inelastic neutron scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and isotope-labelling experiments reveal that the activation of polyethylene is promoted by the open framework tri-coordinated Al sites of the zeolite, followed by β-scission and isomerization on Brönsted acids sites, accompanied by hydride transfer over open framework tri-coordinated Al sites through a self-supplied hydrogen pathway to yield selectivity to branched alkanes. This study shows the potential of layered zeolite materials in enabling the upcycling of plastic wastes. The development of new methodologies to convert plastics into fuels without relying on noble metal-based catalysts is desirable. Now it is shown that a layered self-pillared zeolite enables the conversion of polyethylene to gasoline with a selectivity of 99% and yields of &amp;gt;80% without the need to use external hydrogen.},

  abstract     = {Many systemic cancer chemotherapies comprise a combination of drugs, yet all clinically used antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) contain a single-drug payload. These combination regimens improve treatment outcomes by producing synergistic anticancer effects and slowing the development of drug-resistant cell populations. In an attempt to replicate these regimens and improve the efficacy of targeted therapy, the field of ADCs has moved towards developing techniques that allow for multiple unique payloads to be attached to a single antibody molecule with high homogeneity. However, the methods for generating such constructs—homogeneous multi-payload ADCs—are both numerous and complex owing to the plethora of reactive functional groups that make up the surface of an antibody. Here, by summarizing and comparing the methods of both single- and multi-payload ADC generation and their key preclinical and clinical results, we provide a timely overview of this relatively new area of research. The methods discussed range from branched linker installation to the incorporation of unnatural amino acids, with a generalized comparison tool of the most promising modification strategies also provided. Finally, the successes and challenges of this rapidly growing field are critically evaluated, and from this, future areas of research and development are proposed. Multi-payload antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics. Comprising a monoclonal antibody with multiple unique payloads attached, these constructs have the potential to produce synergistic anticancer effects with reduced therapeutic resistance. In this Review, methods for generating multi-payload ADCs are discussed, highlighting some key preclinical results.},

  abstract     = {Highly reducing or oxidizing photocatalysts are a fundamental challenge in photochemistry. Only a few transition metal complexes with Earth-abundant metal ions have so far advanced to excited state oxidants. All these photocatalysts require high-energy light for excitation, and their oxidizing power has not been fully exploited due to energy dissipation before reaching the photoactive state. Here we demonstrate that the complex [Mn(dgpy)2]4+, based on Earth-abundant manganese and the tridentate 2,6-diguanidylpyridine ligand (dgpy), evolves to a luminescent doublet ligand-to-metal charge transfer (2LMCT) excited state (1,435 nm, 0.86 eV) with a lifetime of 1.6 ns after excitation with low-energy near-infrared light. This 2LMCT state oxidizes naphthalene to its radical cation. Substrates with extremely high oxidation potentials up to 2.4 V enable the [Mn(dgpy)2]4+ photoreduction via a high-energy quartet 4LMCT excited state with a lifetime of 0.78 ps, proceeding via static quenching by the solvent. This process minimizes free energy losses and harnesses the full photooxidizing power, and thus allows oxidation of nitriles and benzene using Earth-abundant elements and low-energy light. The design of highly oxidizing Earth-abundant transition metal complexes for photochemical applications is desirable, but progress in this area remains limited. Now a manganese(IV) diguanidylpyridine complex has been shown to photooxidize naphthalene, benzene and acetonitrile to their radical cations after excitation with near-infrared light. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate the presence of two distinct ligand-to-metal charge transfer excited states.},

  abstract     = {Catalysis with engineered enzymes has provided more efficient routes for the production of active pharmaceutical agents. However, the potential of biocatalysis to assist in early-stage drug discovery campaigns remains largely untapped. In this study, we have developed a biocatalytic strategy for the construction of sp3-rich polycyclic compounds via the intramolecular cyclopropanation of benzothiophenes and related heterocycles. Two carbene transferases with complementary regioisomer selectivity were evolved to catalyse the stereoselective cyclization of benzothiophene substrates bearing diazo ester groups at the C2 or C3 position of the heterocycle. The detailed mechanisms of these reactions were elucidated by a combination of crystallographic and computational analyses. Leveraging these insights, the substrate scope of one of the biocatalysts could be expanded to include previously unreactive substrates, highlighting the value of integrating evolutionary and rational strategies to develop enzymes for new-to-nature transformations. The molecular scaffolds accessed here feature a combination of three-dimensional and stereochemical complexity with ‘rule-of-three’ properties, which should make them highly valuable for fragment-based drug discovery campaigns. The use of biocatalysis to support early-stage drug discovery campaigns remains largely untapped. Here, engineered biocatalysts enable the synthesis of sp3-rich polycyclic compounds through an intramolecular cyclopropanation of benzothiophenes, affording a class of complex scaffolds potentially useful for fragment-based drug discovery campaigns.},

  abstract     = {Nanoporous materials have attracted great attention for gas storage, but achieving high volumetric storage capacity remains a challenge. Here, by using neutron powder diffraction, volumetric gas adsorption, inelastic neutron scattering and first-principles calculations, we investigate a magnesium borohydride framework that has small pores and a partially negatively charged non-flat interior for hydrogen and nitrogen uptake. Hydrogen and nitrogen occupy distinctly different adsorption sites in the pores, with very different limiting capacities of 2.33 H2 and 0.66 N2 per Mg(BH4)2. Molecular hydrogen is packed extremely densely, with about twice the density of liquid hydrogen (144 g H2 per litre of pore volume). We found a penta-dihydrogen cluster where H2 molecules in one position have rotational freedom, whereas H2 molecules in another position have a well-defined orientation and a directional interaction with the framework. This study reveals that densely packed hydrogen can be stabilized in small-pore materials at ambient pressures. Although hydrogen gas could serve as a promising future fuel, its high-capacity storage is a challenge. Now, a nanoporous magnesium borohydride framework is shown to store hydrogen as densely packed penta-dihydrogen clusters having well-defined orientations and directional interactions with the framework.},

  abstract     = {Cryo-electron microscopy has delivered a resolution revolution for biological self-assemblies, yet only a handful of structures have been solved for synthetic supramolecular materials. Particularly for chromophore supramolecular aggregates, high-resolution structures are necessary for understanding and modulating the long-range excitonic coupling. Here, we present a 3.3 Å structure of prototypical biomimetic light-harvesting nanotubes derived from an amphiphilic cyanine dye (C8S3-Cl). Helical 3D reconstruction directly visualizes the chromophore packing that controls the excitonic properties. Our structure clearly shows a brick layer arrangement, revising the previously hypothesized herringbone arrangement. Furthermore, we identify a new non-biological supramolecular motif—interlocking sulfonates—that may be responsible for the slip-stacked packing and J-aggregate nature of the light-harvesting nanotubes. This work shows how independently obtained native-state structures complement photophysical measurements and will enable accurate understanding of (excitonic) structure–function properties, informing materials design for light-harvesting chromophore aggregates. Chromophore supramolecular assemblies have long been studied for their exotic photophysical properties arising from their local geometry and long-range sensitive excitonic couplings. Now a high-resolution structure of a model nanotubular system has revealed a uniform brick-layer molecular arrangement and a non-biological supramolecular motif—interlocking sulfonates—enabling clear understanding of supramolecular structure–excitonic property relationships.},

  abstract     = {Asymmetric Suzuki–Miyaura cross-couplings with aryl boronic acids and allylic electrophiles are a powerful method to convert racemic mixtures into enantioenriched products. Currently, enantioconvergent allylic arylations are limited to substrates that are symmetrical about the allylic unit, and the absence of strategies to control regio-, E/Z- and enantioselectivity in acyclic allylic systems is a major restriction. Here, using a system capable of either conjugate addition or allylic arylation, we have discovered the structural features and experimental conditions that allow an acyclic system to undergo chemo- and regioselective, enantioconvergent allylic Suzuki–Miyaura-type arylation. A wide variety of boronic acid coupling partners can be used, and both alkyl and aromatic substituents are tolerated on the allylic unit so that a wide variety of structures can be obtained. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the chelating ability of the ester group is crucial to obtaining high regio- and enantioselectivity. Using this method, we were able to synthesize the natural products (S)-curcumene and (S)-4,7-dimethyl-1-tetralone and the clinically used antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft). Achieving selectivity control in allylic arylations is a long-standing challenge in catalysis. Now a rhodium-catalysed system demonstrates chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity, enabling Suzuki–Miyaura-type arylation with racemic, non-symmetrical, acyclic allylic systems; chelation is speculated to facilitate oxidative addition and enable both enantiomers of the starting material to converge onto a single product.},

  abstract     = {There is continued burgeoning interest in metal–metal multiple bonding to further our understanding of chemical bonding across the periodic table. However, although polar covalent metal–metal multiple bonding is well known for the d and p blocks, it is relatively underdeveloped for actinides. Homometallic examples are found in spectroscopic or fullerene-confined species, and heterometallic variants exhibiting a polar covalent σ bond supplemented by up to two dative π bonds are more prevalent. Hence, securing polar covalent actinide double and triple metal–metal bonds under normal experimental conditions has been a fundamental target. Here we exploit the protonolysis and dehydrocoupling chemistry of the parent dihydrogen-antimonide anion, to report one-, two- and three-fold thorium–antimony bonds, thus introducing polar covalent actinide–metal multiple bonding under normal experimental conditions between some of the heaviest ions in the periodic table with little or no bulky-substituent protection at the antimony centre. This provides fundamental insights into heavy element multiple bonding, in particular the tension between orbital-energy-driven and overlap-driven covalency for the actinides in a relativistic regime. Actinide–metal multiple bonds are relatively rare, with isolable examples under normal experimental conditions typically restricted to complexes containing a polar covalent σ bond supplemented by up to two dative π bonds. Now complexes featuring polar covalent double and triple bonds between thorium and antimony have been synthesized.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of functionalized nitrogen heterocycles is integral to discovering, manufacturing and evolving high-value materials. The availability of effective strategies for heterocycle synthesis often biases the frequency of specific ring systems over others in the core structures of bioactive leads. For example, while the six- and five-membered piperidine and pyrrolidine are widespread in medicinal chemistry libraries, the seven-membered azepane is essentially absent and this leaves open a substantial area of three-dimensional chemical space. Here we report a strategy to prepare complex azepanes from simple nitroarenes by photochemical dearomative ring expansion centred on the conversion of the nitro group into a singlet nitrene. This process is mediated by blue light, occurs at room temperature and transforms the six-membered benzenoid framework into a seven-membered ring system. A following hydrogenolysis provides the azepanes in just two steps. We have demonstrated the utility of the strategy with the synthesis of several azepane analogues of piperidine drugs. While saturated N-heterocycles are widespread motifs in drug discovery, the seven-membered ring azepane is highly underrepresented. Now nitroarenes have been validated as competent substrates for azepane synthesis through conversion into singlet nitrenes for ring enlargement via N insertion and hydrogenolysis. This enables a highly versatile access towards polysubstituted azepanes in just two steps.},

However, quantifying lipidomes comprehensively in a high-throughput manner remains challenging owing to the diverse lipid structures. Here we propose a diazobutanone-assisted isobaric labelling strategy as a rapid and robust platform for multiplexed quantitative lipidomics across a broad range of lipid classes, including various phospholipids and glycolipids. The diazobutanone reagent is designed to conjugate with phosphodiester or sulfate groups, while accommodating various functional groups on different lipid classes, enabling subsequent isobaric labelling for high-throughput multiplexed quantitation. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in terms of labelling efficiency, detection sensitivity, quantitative accuracy and broad applicability to various biological samples. Finally, we performed a six-plex quantification analysis of lipid extracts from lean and obese mouse livers. In total, we identified and quantified 246 phospholipids in a high-throughput manner, revealing lipidomic changes that may be associated with obesity in mice. Lipidomics aims to uncover lipid functions in biological systems and disease. Quantifying lipids is challenging due to highly diverse chemical structures. Here a diazobutanone-assisted isobaric labelling method is developed that relies on diazobutanone and isobaric mass tags to target phosphate- and sulfate-containing lipids, enabling multiplexed lipidomic quantification in complex mixtures.},

On bilayer NaCl on Au(111), indeno[1,2-a]fluorene is in the neutral charge state, but it exhibits charge bistability between neutral and anionic states on the lower-workfunction surfaces of bilayer NaCl on Ag(111) and Cu(111). In the neutral state, indeno[1,2-a]fluorene exhibits one of two ground states: an open-shell π-diradical state, predicted to be a triplet by density functional and multireference many-body perturbation theory calculations, or a closed-shell state with a para-quinodimethane moiety in the as-indacene core. We observe switching between open- and closed-shell states of a single molecule by changing its adsorption site on NaCl. Switching the magnetic state of a polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbon in a reversible and controlled manner is challenging. Now, by means of single-molecule scanning probe microscopy, an indenofluorene isomer on ultrathin NaCl films has been shown to adopt both open- and closed-shell states. Furthermore, bidirectional switching between the two states is achieved by changing the adsorption site of the molecule.},

Unlike pure metals, single-atom alloys escape the well-established conceptual framework developed nearly three decades ago for predicting catalytic performance. Although this offers the opportunity to explore so far unattainable chemistries, this leaves us without a simple guide for the design of single-atom alloys able to catalyse targeted reactions. Here, based on thousands of density functional theory calculations, we reveal a 10-electron count rule for the binding of adsorbates on the dopant atoms, usually the active sites, of single-atom alloy surfaces. A simple molecular orbital approach rationalizes this rule and the nature of the adsorbate–dopant interaction. In addition, our intuitive model can accelerate the rational design of single-atom alloy catalysts. Indeed, we illustrate how the unique insights provided by the electron count rule help identify the most promising dopant for an industrially relevant hydrogenation reaction, thereby reducing the number of potential materials by more than one order of magnitude. Single-atom alloys have emerged as highly active and selective catalysts that do not follow the traditional models of heterogeneous catalysis. Now it has been shown that the binding of adsorbates at their surface abides by a simple 10-electron count rule, which can identify promising catalysts for various applications.},

Previously reported skeletal editing of common arenes mainly relies on carbene- or nitrene-type insertion reactions or rearrangements. Although powerful, efficient and applicable to late-stage heteroarene core structure modification, these strategies cannot be used for skeletal editing of pyridines. Here we report the direct skeletal editing of pyridines through atom-pair swap from CN to CC to generate benzenes and naphthalenes in a modular fashion. Specifically, we use sequential dearomatization, cycloaddition and rearomatizing retrocycloaddition reactions in a one-pot sequence to transform the parent pyridines into benzenes and naphthalenes bearing diversified substituents at specific sites, as defined by the cycloaddition reaction components. Applications to late-stage skeletal diversification of pyridine cores in several drugs are demonstrated. Skeletal editing enables diversification of compounds not possible by applying peripheral editing strategies. Now, a catalyst-free atom-pair swap strategy for pyridine editing has been developed via one-pot sequential dearomatization, cycloaddition and rearomative retrocyclization.

The trivalent ions are ubiquitous and are used much more widely than the divalent and tetravalent analogues, which possess vastly different optical and magnetic properties. Hence, alteration of the valence electron count by external stimuli can lead to dramatic changes in materials properties. Compounds exhibiting a temperature-induced complete Ln(III) ⇄ Ln(II) switch, referred to as a valence tautomeric (VT) transition, are rare. Here we present an abrupt and hysteretic VT transition in a lanthanide-based coordination polymer, SmI2(pyrazine)3, driven by the interconversion of Sm(II)–pyrazine(0) and Sm(III)–pyrazine(·−) redox pairs. Alloying SmI2(pyrazine)3 with Yb(II) yields isomorphous Sm1–xYbxI2(pyrazine)3 solid solutions with VT transition critical temperatures ranging widely from 200 K to ∼50 K at ambient pressure. These findings demonstrate a simple strategy to realize thermally switchable magnetic materials with chemically tunable transition temperatures. Valence tautomerism in lanthanide-based materials is rare. Now a one-dimensional samarium–pyrazine polymer has been shown to exhibit a temperature-induced hysteretic Sm(III)-to-Sm(II) reversible switch. The transition temperature is modulated in a 150 K window by alloying with Yb(II), presenting a strategy for developing new materials with chemically tunable magnetic switchability.},

Here we develop a general reactive MLIP (ANI-1xnr) through automated sampling of condensed-phase reactions. ANI-1xnr is then applied to study five distinct systems: carbon solid-phase nucleation, graphene ring formation from acetylene, biofuel additives, combustion of methane and the spontaneous formation of glycine from early earth small molecules. In all studies, ANI-1xnr closely matches experiment (when available) and/or previous studies using traditional model chemistry methods.

  abstract     = {RNA localization is highly regulated, with subcellular organization driving context-dependent cell physiology. Although proximity-based labelling technologies that use highly reactive radicals or carbenes provide a powerful method for unbiased mapping of protein organization within a cell, methods for unbiased RNA mapping are scarce and comparably less robust. Here we develop α-alkoxy thioenol and chloroenol esters that function as potent acylating agents upon controlled ester unmasking. We pair these probes with subcellular-localized expression of a bioorthogonal esterase to establish a platform for spatial analysis of RNA: bioorthogonal acylating agents for proximity labelling and sequencing (BAP-seq). We demonstrate that, by selectively unmasking the enol probe in a locale of interest, we can map RNA distribution in membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles. The controlled-release acylating agent chemistry and corresponding BAP-seq method expand the scope of proximity labelling technologies and provide a powerful approach to interrogate the cellular organization of RNAs. RNA localization is key to regulating cellular function but is challenging to measure in an unbiased manner. Now a combination of enol-masked acylating probes with a bioorthogonal esterase to locally unmask them provides a non-radical RNA proximity labelling platform—termed BAP-seq—that enables the generation of high-resolution spatial maps of RNA.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen evolution is an important fuel-generating reaction that has been subject to mechanistic debate about the roles of monometallic and bimetallic pathways. The molecular iridium catalysts in this study undergo photoelectrochemical dihydrogen (H2) evolution via a bimolecular mechanism, providing an opportunity to understand the factors that promote bimetallic H–H coupling. Covalently tethered diiridium catalysts evolve H2 from neutral water faster than monometallic catalysts, even at lower overpotential. The unexpected origin of this improvement is non-covalent supramolecular self-assembly into nanoscale aggregates that efficiently harvest light and form H–H bonds. Monometallic catalysts containing long-chain alkane substituents leverage the self-assembly to evolve H2 from neutral water at low overpotential and with rates close to the expected maximum for this light-driven water splitting reaction. Design parameters for holding multiple catalytic sites in close proximity and tuning catalyst microenvironments emerge from this work. Although the light-driven generation of hydrogen from water is a promising approach to renewable fuels, the H–H bond formation step represents a persistent mechanistic question. Now light-harvesting molecular catalysts have been shown to self-assemble into nanoscale aggregates that feature improved efficiency for photoelectrochemical H2 evolution.},

  abstract     = {Chlorinated compounds are ubiquitous. However, accumulation of chlorine-containing waste has a negative impact on human health and the environment due to the inapplicability of common disposal methods, such as landfill and incineration. Here we report a sustainable approach to valorize chlorine-containing hydrocarbon waste, including solids (chlorinated polymers) and liquids (chlorinated solvents), based on copper and palladium catalysts with a NaNO3 promoter. In the process, waste is oxidized to release the chlorine in the presence of N-directing arenes to afford valuable aryl chlorides, such as the FDA-approved drug vismodegib. The remaining hydrocarbon component is mineralized to afford CO, CO2 and H2O. Moreover, the CO and CO2 generated could be further utilized directly. Thus, chlorine-containing hydrocarbon waste, including mixed waste, can serve as chlorination reagents that neither generate hazardous by-products nor involve specialty chlorination reagents. This tandem catalytic approach represents a promising method for the viable management of a wide and diverse range of chlorine-containing hydrocarbon wastes. While chlorinated compounds are ubiquitous in chemical synthesis, they have a negative impact on human health and the environment. Now, a sustainable tandem catalytic process has been developed that uses chlorine-containing waste as chlorination reagents. This approach represents a promising way for the viable management of chlorinated compounds.},

  abstract     = {Crystalline systems consisting of small-molecule building blocks have emerged as promising materials with diverse applications. It is of great importance to characterize not only their static structures but also the conversion of their structures in response to external stimuli. Femtosecond time-resolved crystallography has the potential to probe the real-time dynamics of structural transitions, but, thus far, this has not been realized for chemical reactions in non-biological crystals. In this study, we applied time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX), a powerful technique for visualizing protein structural dynamics, to a metal–organic framework, consisting of Fe porphyrins and hexazirconium nodes, and elucidated its structural dynamics. The time-resolved electron density maps derived from the TR-SFX data unveil trifurcating structural pathways: coherent oscillatory movements of Zr and Fe atoms, a transient structure with the Fe porphyrins and Zr6 nodes undergoing doming and disordering movements, respectively, and a vibrationally hot structure with isotropic structural disorder. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using TR-SFX to study chemical systems. Time-resolved femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) is a powerful technique to monitor structural transitions in protein crystals at the atomic level, but its use in non-protein synthetic materials remains limited. Now TR-SFX has been used to visualize the structural dynamics of metal–organic frameworks, showing the potential of this tool to study the dynamic motion of crystalline porous materials.},

  abstract     = {During the past 15 years, an increasing number of research groups have embraced visible-light-mediated synthetic transformations as a powerful strategy for the construction and functionalization of organic molecules. This trend has followed the advent and development of photocatalysis, which often operates under mild visible-light irradiation. Nowadays, the general perception of UV-light photochemistry is often as an out-of-fashion approach that is difficult to perform and leads to unselective reaction pathways. Here we wish to propose an alternative and more realistic point of view to the scientific community. First, we will provide an overview of the use of UV light in modern photochemistry, highlighting the pivotal role it still plays in the development of new, efficient synthetic methods. We will then show how the high levels of mechanistic understanding reached for UV-light-driven processes have been key in the implementation of the related visible-light-driven transformations. Although generally perceived as an old-fashioned and unselective tool to build molecules, the photochemistry community is now re-discovering the power of UV light and is using key mechanistic information to develop new catalytic processes driven by visible light. This Perspective discusses the progress and impact of UV light in organic synthesis.},

In iron-mediated oxidation reactions, O2 binding at an iron(II) centre is often accompanied by an oxidation of the iron centre. Here we demonstrate dioxygen activation by sodium tetraphenylborate and protons in the presence of an iron(II) complex to form a reactive radical species, whereby the iron oxidation state remains unaltered in the presence of a highly oxidizing phenoxyl radical and O2. This complex, containing an unusual iron(II)-phenoxyl radical motif, represents an elusive example of a spectroscopically characterized oxygen-derived iron(II)-reactive intermediate during chemical and biological dioxygen activation at haem and non-haem iron active centres. The present report opens up strategies for the stabilization of a phenoxyl radical cofactor, with its full oxidizing capabilities, to act as an independent redox centre next to an iron(II) site during substrate oxidation reactions. The activation of dioxygen at metal centres, and subsequent functionalization of unactivated C‒H bonds, requires the generation of high-energy radical intermediates that often result in undesirable side reactions. Now an elusive oxygen-derived reactive iron(II)–radical intermediate is spectroscopically characterized as part of a strategy to stabilize phenoxyl radical cofactors during substrate oxidation reactions.},

Although the aromatic triplet state of the [Cp(C6F5)5]+ cation is energetically favoured in the gas phase according to quantum chemical calculations, coordination of the cation by either [Sb3F16]− or C6F6 in the crystal lattice stabilizes the antiaromatic singlet state, which is present in the solid state.

  abstract     = {The distribution of ions at the air/water interface plays a decisive role in many natural processes. Several studies have reported that larger ions tend to be surface-active, implying ions are located on top of the water surface, thereby inducing electric fields that determine the interfacial water structure. Here we challenge this view by combining surface-specific heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation with neural network-assisted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that ions in typical electrolyte solutions are, in fact, located in a subsurface region, leading to a stratification of such interfaces into two distinctive water layers. The outermost surface is ion-depleted, and the subsurface layer is ion-enriched. This surface stratification is a key element in explaining the ion-induced water reorganization at the outermost air/water interface. The organization of electrolytes at the air/water interface affects the structure of interfacial water and therefore numerous natural processes. It has now been demonstrated that the surface of an electrolyte solution is stratified and consists of an ion-depleted outer surface and an ion-enriched subsurface layer, jointly determining the water interfacial structure.},

We improve the HTE data landscape with the disclosure of 39,000+ previously proprietary HTE reactions that cover a breadth of chemistry, including cross-coupling reactions and chiral salt resolutions. The high-throughput experimentation analyser was validated on cross-coupling and hydrogenation datasets, showcasing the elucidation of statistically significant hidden relationships between reaction components and outcomes, as well as highlighting areas of dataset bias and the specific reaction spaces that necessitate further investigation. High-throughput experimentation (HTE) has great utility for chemical synthesis. However, robust interpretation of high-throughput data remains a challenge.

  abstract     = {Charge-transfer reactions in proteins are important for life, such as in photolyases which repair DNA, but the role of structural dynamics remains unclear. Here, using femtosecond X-ray crystallography, we report the structural changes that take place while electrons transfer along a chain of four conserved tryptophans in the Drosophila melanogaster (6-4) photolyase. At femto- and picosecond delays, photoreduction of the flavin by the first tryptophan causes directed structural responses at a key asparagine, at a conserved salt bridge, and by rearrangements of nearby water molecules. We detect charge-induced structural changes close to the second tryptophan from 1 ps to 20 ps, identifying a nearby methionine as an active participant in the redox chain, and from 20 ps around the fourth tryptophan. The photolyase undergoes highly directed and carefully timed adaptations of its structure. This questions the validity of the linear solvent response approximation in Marcus theory and indicates that evolution has optimized fast protein fluctuations for optimal charge transfer. Photoinduced electron transfer forms the basis for photosynthesis and DNA repair. Ultrafast structural changes recorded for a DNA-repairing photolyase now reveal specific and directed protein motions accompanying the electron transfer.},

  abstract     = {Revealing the origins of kinetic selectivity is one of the premier tasks of applied theoretical organic chemistry, and for many reactions, doing so involves comparing competing transition states. For some reactions, however, a single transition state leads directly to multiple products, in which case non-statistical dynamic effects influence selectivity control. The selectivity of photochemical reactions—where crossing between excited-state and ground-state surfaces occurs near ground-state transition structures that interconvert competing products—also should be controlled by the momentum of the reacting molecules as they return to the ground state in addition to the shape of the potential energy surfaces involved. Now, using machine-learning-assisted non-adiabatic molecular dynamics and multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory, these factors are examined for a classic photochemical reaction—the deazetization of 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene—for which we demonstrate that momentum dominates the selectivity for hexadiene versus [2.2.2] bicyclohexane products. Selectivity of photochemical reactions is notoriously difficult to model. Now it has been shown that by employing an analogy to ground-state reactions with post-transition-state bifurcations, selectivity for a complex photochemical denitrogenation reaction can be captured and rationalized, and its dynamical origins understood.},

  abstract     = {Two- or one-electron-mediated difunctionalizations of internal alkenes represent straightforward approaches to assemble molecular complexity by the simultaneous formation of two contiguous Csp3 stereocentres. Although racemic versions have been extensively explored, asymmetric variants, especially those involving open-shell C-centred radical species, are much more limited both in number and scope. Here we describe enantioenriched arylsulfinylamides as all-in-one reagents for the efficient asymmetric, intermolecular aminoarylation of alkenes. Under mild photoredox conditions, nitrogen addition of the arylsulfinylamide onto the double bond, followed by 1,4-translocation of the aromatic ring, produce, in a single operation, the corresponding aminoarylation adducts in enantiomerically enriched form. The sulfinyl group acts here as a traceless chiral auxiliary, as it is eliminated in situ under the mild reaction conditions. Optically pure β,β-diarylethylamines, aryl-α,β-ethylenediamines and α-aryl-β-aminoalcohols, prominent motifs in pharmaceuticals, bioactive natural products and ligands for transition metals, are thereby accessible with excellent levels of regio-, relative and absolute stereocontrol. Single-electron-mediated difunctionalizations of internal olefins allow the simultaneous formation of two contiguous Csp3-stereocentres. Here, we describe enantioenriched arylsulfinylamides as all-in-one reagents for the efficient asymmetric, intermolecular aminoarylation of alkenes. Mechanistic studies revealed an interesting dichotomy in the initiation of the reaction depending on the olefin redox potential.},

  abstract     = {Arylethylamines are popular structural elements in bioactive molecules but are often made through a linear series of synthetic steps. A modular protocol to assemble arylethylamines from alkenes in one step would represent a useful advance in discovery chemistry, though current limitations preclude a generally applicable method. In this work we disclose an aminoarylation of alkenes using aryl sulfinamide reagents as bifunctional amine and arene donors. This reaction features excellent regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity on a variety of activated and unactivated substrates. Using a weakly oxidizing photocatalyst, a nitrogen radical is generated under mild conditions and adds to an alkene to form a new C–N bond. A desulfinylative aryl migration event known as a Smiles–Truce rearrangement follows to form a new C–C bond. In this manner, arylethylamines can be rapidly assembled from abundant alkene feedstocks. Moreover, chiral information from the sulfinamide can be transferred via rearrangement to a new carbon stereocentre in the product, thus advancing the development of traceless asymmetric alkene difunctionalization. Single-step addition of an aryl ring and a protected amine across an alkene is a succinct route to valuable phenethylamine products, but existing methods suffer from limited scope. Now a family of compounds containing a sulfinamide functional group have been developed to react via electrophilic radicals to yield phenethylamines through an aryl migration with precise stereochemical control.},

Here we apply solid-phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation to chemically synthesize a mirror-image version of trypsin, a widely used protease for site-specific protein digestion. Using mirror-image trypsin digestion and LC–MS/MS, we sequence a mirror-image large subunit ribosomal protein (L25) and a mirror-image Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), and distinguish between different mutants of D-Dpo4. We also perform writing and reading of digital information in a long D-peptide of 50 amino acids. Thus, mirror-image trypsin digestion in conjunction with LC–MS/MS may facilitate practical applications of D-peptides and D-proteins as potential therapeutic and informational tools. The lack of effective methods for mirror-image (d-) protein sequencing hampers the development of mirror-image biology systems and related applications.

Implementing multiple functionalities in the form of distinguishable building blocks, however, is difficult without risking narcissistic self-sorting or a statistical mess. Here we report a systematic series of integratively self-assembled heteroleptic cages in which two square-planar PdII cations are bridged by four different bis-pyridyl ligands, A, B, C and D, via synergistic effects to exclusively form a single isomer—the lantern-shaped cage [Pd2ABCD]. This self-sorting goal—forming just one out of 55 possible structures—is reached under full thermodynamic control and can be realized progressively (by combining progenitors, such as [Pd2A2C2] with [Pd2B2D2]), directly from ligands and PdII cations or by mixing all four corresponding homoleptic cages. The rational design of complex multicomponent assemblies that enables the modular incorporation of diverse chemical moieties will advance their applicability in functional nanosystems. Metal-mediated self-assembly of organic building blocks is a powerful strategy to generate complex supramolecular objects. The non-statistical combination of multiple different components, however, has been a major challenge. Now integrative self-sorting of low-symmetry multicomponent cages has been achieved by combining shape complementarity and selective backbone interactions under thermodynamic control.},

However, some catalysts show a positive pressure dependence for propane dehydrogenation, an important reaction for propylene production. Here we show that the positive activity dependence on H2 partial pressure of gallium oxide-based catalysts arises from metastable hydride mediation. Through in situ spectroscopic, kinetic and computational analyses, we demonstrate that under reaction conditions with H2 co-feeding, the dissociative adsorption of H2 on a partially reduced gallium oxide surface produces H atoms chemically bonded to coordinatively unsaturated Ga atoms. These metastable gallium hydride species promote C–H bond activation while inhibiting deep dehydrogenation. We found that the surface coverage of gallium hydride determines the catalytic performance. Accordingly, benefiting from proper H2 co-feeding, the alumina-supported, trace additive-modified gallium oxide catalyst GaOx–Ir–K/Al2O3 exhibited high activity and selectivity at high propane concentrations. The heterogeneous catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons usually suffers from a negative pressure dependence on H2. Now it has been shown that for propane dehydrogenation on gallium oxide-based catalysts, a positive activity dependence on H2 partial pressure arises from a metastable hydride-mediated catalysis in which gallium hydrides promote C–H activation.},

Here we report enzymatically synthesized polymer-based artificial cells with the ability to express proteins. Artificial cells were synthesized using biocatalytic atom transfer radical polymerization-induced self-assembly, in which myoglobin synthesizes amphiphilic block co-polymers that self-assemble into structures such as micelles, worm-like micelles, polymersomes and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). The GUVs encapsulate cargo during the polymerization, including enzymes, nanoparticles, microparticles, plasmids and cell lysate. The resulting artificial cells act as microreactors for enzymatic reactions and for osteoblast-inspired biomineralization. Moreover, they can express proteins such as a fluorescent protein and actin when fed with amino acids. Actin polymerizes in the vesicles and alters the artificial cells’ internal structure by creating internal compartments. Thus, biocatalytic atom transfer radical polymerization-induced self-assembly-derived GUVs can mimic bacteria as they are composed of a microscopic reaction compartment that contains genetic information for protein expression upon induction. Enzyme-initiated polymerization-induced self-assembly has been used to generate various biomimetic structures. Now, myoglobin’s activity is used for biocatalytic polymerization-induced self-assembly to generate vesicular artificial cells.

However, the introduction of radioisotopes into the metabolically stable carbon sites on drugs to probe these features typically requires toxic, radioactive gases such as [14C]CO and [14C]CO2. Here we describe an approach to directly carbon-label carboxylic-acid-containing pharmaceuticals via a metal-catalysed functional group exchange reaction, forming 14C-labelled carboxylic-acid-containing drugs without radioactive gases, in one pot, using an easily available and handled carboxylic acid 14C source. To enable this process, a functional group metathesis of carbon–carbon covalent bonds in acid chloride functionalities is developed, exploiting the ability of nickel catalysts to both reversibly activate carbon–chloride bonds and exchange functionalities between organic molecules. The drug development applicability is illustrated by the direct incorporation of the 14C label or 13C label into an array of complex aryl, alkyl, vinyl and heterocyclic carboxylic acid drugs or drug candidates without gases or a special apparatus, at ambient conditions and without loss of the radiolabel. The preparation of 14C-labelled compounds is a crucial step in pharmaceutical development but typically requires using toxic, radioactive gases. Now a broadly applicable functional group metathesis reaction has been developed that forms 14C-labelled carboxylic acids in one pot, without added gases, via dynamic exchange with an easily handled carboxylic acid 14C source.},

  abstract     = {DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) have become a powerful technology platform in drug discovery. Dual-pharmacophore DELs display two sets of small molecules at the termini of DNA duplexes, thereby enabling the identification of synergistic binders against biological targets, and have been successfully applied in fragment-based ligand discovery and affinity maturation of known ligands. However, dual-pharmacophore DELs identify separate binders that require subsequent linking to obtain the full ligands, which is often challenging. Here we report a protein-templated DEL selection approach that can identify full ligand/inhibitor structures from DNA-encoded dynamic libraries (DEDLs) without the need for subsequent fragment linking. Our approach is based on dynamic DNA hybridization and target-templated in situ ligand synthesis, and it incorporates and encodes the linker structures in the library, along with the building blocks, to be sampled by the target protein. To demonstrate the performance of this method, 4.35-million- and 3.00-million-member DEDLs with different library architectures were prepared, and hit selection was achieved against four therapeutically relevant target proteins. Dual-pharmacophore DNA-encoded chemical libraries enable the identification of two synergistic binders for a biological target, but subsequent linking of this pair is required to obtain a full ligand, which can be challenging. Here we report a protein-templated selection of DNA-encoded dynamic library that can identify full ligands from fragment libraries without the need for subsequent fragment linking.},

  abstract     = {Tryptophan (Trp) plays a critical role in the regulation of protein structure, interactions and functions through its π system and indole N–H group. A generalizable method for blocking and rescuing Trp interactions would enable the gain-of-function manipulation of various Trp-containing proteins in vivo, but generating such a platform remains challenging. Here we develop a genetically encoded N1-vinyl-caged Trp capable of rapid and bioorthogonal decaging through an optimized inverse electron-demand Diels–Alder reaction, allowing site-specific activation of Trp on a protein of interest in living cells. This chemical activation of a genetically encoded caged-tryptophan (Trp-CAGE) strategy enables precise activation of the Trp of interest underlying diverse important molecular interactions. We demonstrate the utility of Trp-CAGE across various protein families, such as catalase-peroxidases and kinases, as translation initiators and posttranslational modification readers, allowing the modulation of epigenetic signalling in a temporally controlled manner. Coupled with computer-aided prediction, our strategy paves the way for bioorthogonal Trp activation on more than 28,000 candidate proteins within their native cellular settings. Developing a generalizable method for blocking and rescuing tryptophan (Trp) interactions would enable the gain-of-function manipulation of various Trp-containing proteins but has so far been challenging.

  abstract     = {Chiral α-tertiary amines and related azacycles are sought-after compounds for drug development. Despite progress in the catalytic asymmetric construction of aza-quaternary stereocentres, enantioselective synthesis of multifunctional α-tertiary amines remains underdeveloped. Enantioenriched α-disubstituted α-ethynylamines are attractive synthons for constructing chiral α-tertiary amines and azacycles, but methods for their catalytic enantioselective synthesis need to be expanded. Here we describe an enantioselective asymmetric Cu(I)-catalysed propargylic amination (ACPA) of simple ketone-derived propargylic carbonates to give both α-dialkylated and α-alkyl–α-aryl α-tertiary ethynylamines. Sterically confined pyridinebisoxazoline (PYBOX) ligands, with a C4 shielding group and relaying groups, play a key role in achieving excellent enantioselectivity. The syntheses of quaternary 2,5-dihydropyrroles, dihydroquinines, dihydrobenzoquinolines and dihydroquinolino[1,2-α]quinolines are reported, and the synthetic value is further demonstrated by the enantioselective catalytic total synthesis of a selective multi-target β-secretase inhibitor. Enantioselective Cu-catalysed propargylic substitutions with O- and C-centred nucleophiles are also realized, further demonstrating the potential of the PYBOX ligand. Enantioenriched α-disubstituted α-ethynylamines are valuable synthons to chiral α-tertiary amines and azacycles, but their facile access remains challenging. Now, sterically confined pyridinebisoxazoline ligands have been developed to facilitate highly enantioselective Cu(I)-catalysed propargylic amination of both aliphatic and aryl ketone-derived propargylic carbonates to give α-tertiary ethynylamines. Related tandem sequences are reported to synthesize quaternary azacycles.},

  abstract     = {Complexes of iron in high oxidation states are captivating research subjects due to their pivotal role as active intermediates in numerous catalytic processes. Structural and spectroscopic studies of well-defined model complexes often provide evidence of these intermediates. In addition to the fundamental molecular and electronic structure insights gained by these complexes, their reactivity also affects our understanding of catalytic reaction mechanisms for small molecule and bond-activation chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis, structural and spectroscopic characterization of a stable, octahedral Fe(VI) nitrido complex and an authenticated, unique Fe(VII) species, prepared by one-electron oxidation. The super-oxidized Fe(VII) nitride rearranges to an Fe(V) imide through an intramolecular amination mechanism and ligand exchange, which is characterized spectroscopically and computationally. This enables combined reactivity and stability studies on a single molecular system of a rare high-valent complex redox pair. Quantum chemical calculations complement the spectroscopic parameters and provide evidence for a diamagnetic (S = 0) d 2 Fe(VI) and a genuine S = 1/2, d 1 Fe(VII) configuration of these super-oxidized nitrido complexes. Complexes of iron in high oxidation states play a pivotal role as active intermediates in numerous catalytic processes. Now, using a multimethod approach on a single molecular system, it has been shown that a stable high-valent Fe(VI) nitride can be converted to a reactive, superoxidized, heptavalent Fe(VII) nitride.},

  abstract     = {Friction determines whether liquid droplets slide off a solid surface or stick to it. Surface heterogeneity is generally acknowledged as the major cause of increased contact angle hysteresis and contact line friction of droplets. Here we challenge this long-standing premise for chemical heterogeneity at the molecular length scale. By tuning the coverage of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), water contact angles change gradually from about 10° to 110° yet contact angle hysteresis and contact line friction are low for the low-coverage hydrophilic SAMs as well as high-coverage hydrophobic SAMs. Their slipperiness is not expected based on the substantial chemical heterogeneity of the SAMs featuring uncoated areas of the substrate well beyond the size of a water molecule as probed by metal reactants. According to molecular dynamics simulations, the low friction of both low- and high-coverage SAMs originates from the mobility of interfacial water molecules. These findings reveal a yet unknown and counterintuitive mechanism for slipperiness, opening new avenues for enhancing the mobility of droplets. Surface heterogeneity is generally acknowledged as the major cause of liquid–solid friction, affecting whether droplets slide off the surface or stick to it. Now, a model surface of self-assembled monolayers has been used to investigate how molecular-scale surface heterogeneity affects water contact angle hysteresis and contact line friction. The high-coverage hydrophobic surface is slippery, as—counter-intuitively—is the low-coverage hydrophilic surface.},

  abstract     = {The light-induced ultrafast switching between molecular isomers norbornadiene and quadricyclane can reversibly store and release a substantial amount of chemical energy. Prior work observed signatures of ultrafast molecular dynamics in both isomers upon ultraviolet excitation but could not follow the electronic relaxation all the way back to the ground state experimentally. Here we study the electronic relaxation of quadricyclane after exciting in the ultraviolet (201 nanometres) using time-resolved gas-phase extreme ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy combined with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. We identify two competing pathways by which electronically excited quadricyclane molecules relax to the electronic ground state. The fast pathway (&amp;lt;100 femtoseconds) is distinguished by effective coupling to valence electronic states, while the slow pathway involves initial motions across Rydberg states and takes several hundred femtoseconds. Both pathways facilitate interconversion between the two isomers, albeit on different timescales, and we predict that the branching ratio of norbornadiene/quadricyclane products immediately after returning to the electronic ground state is approximately 3:2. Light-induced ultrafast switching between the molecular isomers norbornadiene and quadricyclane can reversibly store and release a substantial amount of chemical energy.

This situation ultimately leads to prominent complications such as reproducibility issues and the slow uptake of newly developed synthetic methods for pharmaceutical and agrochemical applications. In recent years, various impactful approaches have been advocated to bridge information gaps and to improve the quality of experimental protocols in synthetic organic publications. Here we provide a critical overview of these strategies and present the reader with a versatile set of tools to augment their standard procedures. We formulate eight principles to improve data management in scientific publications relating to data standardization, reproducibility and evaluation, and encourage scientists to go beyond current publication standards. We are aware that this is a substantial effort, but we are convinced that the resulting improved data situation will greatly benefit the progress of chemistry. Lack of standardization, transparency and interaction creates information gaps in scientific publications. Through strategies such as voluntary information management, standardization of reaction set-ups, and smart screening approaches, this Perspective gives guidelines on how to improve data management in publications reporting chemical reactions, focusing on reproducibility, standardization and evaluation of synthetic transformations.},

Here we demonstrate the use of chiral tridentate anionic ligands in combination with Cu(I) catalysts to enable a biomimetic enantioconvergent radical C(sp3)–S cross-coupling reaction of both racemic secondary and tertiary alkyl halides with highly transformable sulfur nucleophiles. This protocol not only exhibits a broad substrate scope with high enantioselectivity but also provides universal access to a range of useful α-chiral alkyl organosulfur compounds with different sulfur oxidation states, thus providing a complementary approach to known asymmetric C(sp3)–S bond formation methods. Mechanistic results support a biomimetic radical homolytic substitution pathway for the critical C(sp3)–S bond formation step. Methods for transition-metal-catalysed enantioselective C(sp3)–S bond construction are underdeveloped. Now, by taking advantage of the biomimetic radical homolytic substitution manifold, the copper-catalysed enantioconvergent C(sp3)–S cross-coupling of racemic secondary and tertiary alkyl halides with highly transformable sulfur nucleophiles has been realized. This reaction provides access to an array of α-chiral alkyl organosulfur compounds.},

  abstract     = {Through the actuation of vibronic modes in cell-membrane-associated aminocyanines, using near-infrared light, a distinct type of molecular mechanical action can be exploited to rapidly kill cells by necrosis. Vibronic-driven action (VDA) is distinct from both photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy as its mechanical effect on the cell membrane is not abrogated by inhibitors of reactive oxygen species and it does not induce thermal killing. Subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations of VDA-induced mechanical disruption can be achieved using very low concentrations (500 nM) of aminocyanines or low doses of light (12 J cm−2, 80 mW cm−2 for 2.5 min), resulting in complete eradication of human melanoma cells in vitro. Also, 50% tumour-free efficacy in mouse models for melanoma was achieved. The molecules that destroy cell membranes through VDA have been termed molecular jackhammers because they undergo concerted whole-molecule vibrations. Given that a cell is unlikely to develop resistance to such molecular mechanical forces, molecular jackhammers present an alternative modality for inducing cancer cell death. In contrast to photothermal therapy requiring high powers over extended times and photodynamic therapy being abrogated by inhibitors of reactive oxygen species, actuation of vibronic modes in single molecules—molecular jackhammers—can now induce efficient cancer cell death. Here, the mechanical disassembly of cell membranes is characterized as the underlying mechanism by which this vibronic-driven action promotes necrotic cell death.},

  abstract     = {Azobenzene has been widely explored as a photoresponsive element in materials science. Although some studies have investigated the force-induced isomerization of azobenzene, the effect of force on the rupture of azobenzene has not been explored. Here we show that the light-induced structural change of azobenzene can also alter its rupture forces, making it an ideal light-responsive mechanophore. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy and ultrasonication, we found that cis and trans para-azobenzene isomers possess contrasting mechanical properties. Dynamic force spectroscopy experiments and quantum-chemical calculations in which azobenzene regioisomers were pulled from different directions revealed that the distinct rupture forces of the two isomers are due to the pulling direction rather than the energetic difference between the two isomers. These mechanical features of azobenzene can be used to rationally control the macroscopic fracture behaviours of polymer networks by photoillumination. The use of light-induced conformational changes to alter the mechanical response of mechanophores provides an attractive way to engineer polymer networks of light-regulatable mechanical properties. Light-induced azobenzene cis/trans isomerization has been extensively investigated, but the mechanical strength of its cis/trans structure is not well understood. Now it has been shown that cis azobenzene is mechanically less stable than the trans isomer due to its regiochemical structure, as revealed by single-molecule force spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Substitution of a C=C bond by an isoelectronic B–N bond is a well-established strategy to alter the electronic structure and stability of acenes. BN-substituted acenes that possess narrow energy gaps have attractive optoelectronic properties. However, they are susceptible to air and/or light. Here we present the design, synthesis and molecular structures of fully π-conjugated cationic BN-doped acenes stabilized by carbodicarbene ligands. They are luminescent in the solution and solid states and show high air and moisture stability. Compared with their neutral BN-substituted counterparts as well as the parent all-carbon acenes, these species display improved quantum yields and small optical gaps. The electronic structures of the azabora-anthracene and azabora-tetracene cations resemble higher-order acenes while possessing high photo-oxidative resistance. Investigations using density functional theory suggest that the stability and photo-physics of these conjugated systems may be ascribed to their cationic nature and the electronic properties of the carbodicarbene. Borenium ions have traditionally served as main group (pre-)catalysts, and their use in materials-related applications have been limited by their instability. Now, a series of fully π-conjugated azaboraacenium ions derived from carbodicarbene have been developed that exhibit high air and moisture stability with full colour-tunable luminescence. Furthermore, these azaboraacene cations mimic the electronic structures of higher-order carbonaceous acenes while featuring enhanced resistance to photo-oxidation.},

  abstract     = {The appeal of catalytic click chemistry is largely due to the copper-catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) process, which is orthogonal to the more recently introduced sulfur–fluoride exchange (SuFEx). However, the triazole rings generated by CuAAC are not readily modifiable, and SuFEx connectors cannot be selectively functionalized, attributes that would be attractive in a click process. Here we introduce bisphosphine–copper-catalysed phenoxydiazaborinine formation (CuPDF), a link-and-in situ modify strategy for merging a nitrile, an allene, a diborane and a hydrazine. We also present copper- and palladium-catalysed quinoline formation (Cu/PdQNF), which is applicable in aqueous media, involving an aniline as the modifier. CuPDF and Cu/PdQNF are easy to perform and deliver robust, alterable and tunable fluorescent hubs. CuPDF and Cu/PdQNF are orthogonal to SuFEx and CuAAC, despite the latter and CuPDF also being catalysed by an organocopper species. These advantages were applied to protecting group-free syntheses of sequence-defined branched oligomers, a chemoselectively amendable polymer, three drug conjugates and a two-drug conjugate. Orthogonal click reactions enable the rapid assembly of molecules of all sizes. Now, it has been shown that a nitrile, an allene, a diborane and a hydrazine or aniline can be catalytically merged in a click process that is orthogonal to SuFEx and CuAAC, delivering fluorescent linkages.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic olefin hydrogenation is ubiquitous in organic synthesis. In most proposed homogeneous catalytic cycles, reactive M–H bonds are generated either by oxidative addition of H2 to a metal centre or by deprotonation of a non-classical metal dihydrogen (M–H2) intermediate. Here we provide evidence for an alternative H2-activation mechanism that instead involves direct ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) from a metal-bound H2 molecule to a metal-coordinated olefin. An unusual pincer ligand that features two phosphine ligands and a central olefin supports the formation of a non-classical Ni–H2 complex and the Ni(alkyl)(hydrido) product of LLHT, in rapid equilibrium with dissolved H2. The usefulness of this cooperative H2-activation mechanism for catalysis is demonstrated in the semihydrogenation of diphenylacetylene. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations support the central role of LLHT for H2 activation and catalytic semihydrogenation. The product distribution obtained is largely determined by the competition between (E)–(Z) isomerization and catalyst degradation by self-hydrogenation. Activation of H2 by a metal–olefin complex is characterized experimentally and computationally using a nickel pincer complex, showing that the reaction proceeds via a direct ligand-to-ligand hydrogen transfer mechanism. An application of this cooperative H2-activation mechanism is demonstrated in the nickel-catalysed semihydrogenation of diphenylacetylene.},

Strong nucleophiles are often required to react with the N-electrophiles without catalytic and stereochemical control. Here we show an effective strategy to realize umpolung of imines promoted by organocatalytic aromatization. The attachment of strongly electron-withdrawing groups to imines could enhance the umpolung reactivity by both electronegativity and aromatic character, enabling the direct amination of (hetero)arenes with good efficiencies and stereoselectivities. Additionally, the application of chiral Brønsted acid catalyst furnishes (hetero)aryl C–N atropisomers or enantioenriched aliphatic amines via dearomative amination from N-electrophilic aromatic precursors. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations suggest an ionic mechanism for the umpolung reaction of imines. This disconnection expands the options to forge C–N bonds stereoselectively on (hetero)arenes, which represents an important synthetic pursuit, especially in medicinal chemistry. The umpolung functionalization of imines bears vast synthetic potential, but polarity inversion is less efficient compared with the carbonyl counterparts. Now, an alternative strategy exploiting chiral phosphoric acid catalytic aromatization has been developed, affording structures possessing a central chirality or a stereogenic C–N axis with high efficiency and enantiocontrol.},

Even though these advantages also make it an attractive strategy for chemoselective modification of complex biomolecules such as proteins, such applications remain poorly developed. Here we report an electrochemically promoted coupling reaction between 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) and simple aromatic amines—electrochemical labelling of hydroxyindoles with chemoselectivity (eCLIC)—that enables site-specific labelling of full-length proteins under mild conditions. Using genetic code expansion technology, the 5HTP residue can be incorporated into predefined sites of a recombinant protein expressed in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts for subsequent eCLIC labelling. We used the eCLIC reaction to site-specifically label various recombinant proteins, including a full-length human antibody. Furthermore, we show that eCLIC is compatible with strain-promoted alkyne-azide and alkene-tetrazine click reactions, enabling site-specific modification of proteins at two different sites with distinct labels. Current electrochemical-based protein labelling methods suffer from limited site-selectivity and off-target reactivity owing to required radical/electrophilic reagents. Now an electrochemical strategy enables chemoselective labelling of proteins at a site-specifically incorporated 5-hydroxytryptophan residue using aromatic amines as coupling partners. This approach works on various proteins, including a full-length antibody, and is compatible with established click reactions.},

  abstract     = {Cysteine conjugation is an important tool in protein research and relies on fast, mild and chemoselective reactions. Cysteinyl thiols can either be modified with prefunctionalized electrophiles, or converted into electrophiles themselves for functionalization with selected nucleophiles in an independent step. Here we report a bioconjugation strategy that uses a vinyl thianthrenium salt to transform cysteine into a highly reactive electrophilic episulfonium intermediate in situ, to enable conjugation with a diverse set of bioorthogonal nucleophiles in a single step. The reactivity profile can connect several nucleophiles to biomolecules through a short and stable ethylene linker, ideal for introduction of infrared labels, post-translational modifications or NMR probes. In the absence of reactive exogenous nucleophiles, nucleophilic amino acids can react with the episulfonium intermediate for native peptide stapling and protein–protein ligation. Ready synthetic access to isotopologues of vinyl thianthrenium salts enables applications in quantitative proteomics. Such diverse applications demonstrate the utility of vinyl-thianthrenium-based bioconjugation as a fast, selective and broadly applicable tool for chemical biology. Cysteine bioconjugation is an important method to modify biomolecules, but synthetic efforts to diversify reactive warheads and the low reactivity of introducible linchpins often impede application in biological laboratories. Now, a thianthrenium-based reagent permits site-selective installation of episulfonium on biomacromolecules, enabling one-step addition of bioorthogonal nucleophiles and further applications in quantitative proteomics and cross-linking.},

  abstract     = {Photon-driven chemical processes are usually mediated by oxides, nitrides and sulfides whose photo-conversion efficiency is limited by charge carrier recombination. Here we show that lithium hydride undergoes photolysis upon ultraviolet illumination to yield long-lived photon-generated electrons residing in hydrogen vacancies, known as F centres. We demonstrate that photon-driven dehydrogenation and dark rehydrogenation over lithium hydride can be fulfilled reversibly at room temperature, which is about 600 K lower than the corresponding thermal process. As light-driven F centre generation could provide an alternative approach to charge carrier separation to favour chemical transformations that are kinetically or thermodynamically challenging, we show that light-activated lithium hydride cleaves the N≡N triple bond to form a N–H bond under mild conditions. Co-feeding a N2/H2 mixture with low H2 partial pressure leads to photocatalytic ammonia formation at near ambient conditions. This work provides insights into the development of advanced materials and processes for light harvesting and conversion. Photon-driven dinitrogen reduction to ammonia is a promising but challenging reaction. Now it has been shown that lithium hydride undergoes photolysis upon ultraviolet illumination to yield long-lived photon-generated electrons residing in hydrogen vacancies, favouring the activation of the N≡N bond and achieving photocatalytic ammonia synthesis.},

The hexameric complex undergoes substantial conformational changes throughout its catalytic cycle. Here we elucidate the molecular motions that occur at the active site in the temporal window immediately before and after ATP hydrolysis by merging cryo-EM, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. p97 populates a metastable reaction intermediate, the ADP·Pi state, which is poised between hydrolysis and product release. Detailed snapshots reveal that the active site is finely tuned to trap and eventually discharge the cleaved phosphate. Signalling pathways originating at the active site coordinate the action of the hexamer subunits and couple hydrolysis with allosteric conformational changes. Our multidisciplinary approach enables a glimpse into the sophisticated spatial and temporal orchestration of ATP handling by a prototype AAA+ protein.

  abstract     = {Linkage chemistry and functional molecules derived from the stereogenic sulfur(VI) centre have important applications in organic synthesis, bioconjugation, drug discovery, agrochemicals and polymeric materials. However, existing approaches for the preparation of optically active S(VI)-centred compounds heavily rely on synthetic chiral S(IV) pools, and the reported linkers of S(VI) lack stereocontrol. A modular assembly method, involving sequential ligand exchange at the S(VI) centre with precise control of enantioselectivity, is appealing but remains elusive. Here we report an asymmetric three-dimensional sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (3D-SuFEx) reaction based on thionyl tetrafluoride gas (SOF4). A key step involves the chiral ligand-induced enantioselective defluorinative substitution of iminosulfur oxydifluorides using organolithium reagents. The resulting optically active sulfonimidoyl fluorides allow for further stereospecific fluoride-exchange by various nucleophiles, thereby establishing a modular platform for the asymmetric SuFEx ligation and the divergent synthesis of optically active S(VI) functional molecules. Chirality is an intrinsic property in unsymmetric three-dimensional molecular assembly, contributing to the utility of the corresponding process and the resulting scaffolds. Now, on the sulfur(VI) hub, a three-step sequential ligand-exchange method has been established with precise stereocontrol, enabling the enantioselective synthesis of optically active S(VI) functional molecules.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions can proceed via an outer-sphere electron transfer to solution (OS-PCET) or through an inner-sphere mechanism by interfacial polarization of surface-bound active sites (I-PCET). Although OS-PCET has been extensively studied with molecular insight, the inherent heterogeneity of surfaces impedes molecular-level understanding of I-PCET. Herein we employ graphite-conjugated carboxylic acids (GC-COOH) as molecularly well-defined hosts of I-PCET to isolate the intrinsic kinetics of I-PCET. We measure I-PCET rates across the entire pH range, uncovering a V-shaped pH-dependence that lacks the pH-independent regions characteristic of OS-PCET. Accordingly, we develop a mechanistic model for I-PCET that invokes concerted PCET involving hydronium/water or water/hydroxide donor/acceptor pairs, capturing the entire dataset with only four adjustable parameters. We find that I-PCET is fourfold faster with hydronium/water than water/hydroxide, while both reactions display similarly high charge transfer coefficients, indicating late proton transfer transition states. These studies highlight the key mechanistic distinctions between I-PCET and OS-PCET, providing a framework for understanding and modelling more complex multistep I-PCET reactions critical to energy conversion and catalysis. Although interfacial proton-coupled electron transfers are critical reaction steps in chemical and biological processes, studies investigating these reactions are complicated by surface heterogeneity. Now, interfacial proton-coupled electron transfer kinetics are studied and modelled at isolated, well-defined active sites to provide a foundation for understanding complex reactions involved in energy conversion and catalysis.},

  abstract     = {In biological systems, enzymes and transport proteins can bind anions in aqueous media solely by forming hydrogen bonds with charge-neutral motifs. Reproducing this functionality in synthetic systems presents challenges and incurs high costs, particularly when targeting strongly hydrated anions such as sulfate. Here we report a [2.2.2]urea cryptand (cage), synthesized in one pot, that selectively binds sulfate in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and water and in water with affinities in the micromolar to millimolar range. The neutral cage bearing six urea groups donates 12 strong hydrogen bonds to encapsulate a sulfate anion, showing favourable enthalpy even in pure water. Sulfate binding can be further enhanced by using micelles to provide a low-polarity microenvironment. The cage finds utility in analysing divalent anions in water and beverage samples or in removing sulfate. The work demonstrates the achievability of robust and selective anion binding in water with minimal synthetic efforts, by using neutral NH hydrogen bonds akin to those found in biology. Very few charge-neutral synthetic anion receptors can function in water, and those known typically select weakly hydrated anions such as iodide. Now a neutral molecular cage capable of donating 12 hydrogen bonds has been synthesized and found to bind highly hydrated sulfate in water with a strong selectivity over weakly hydrated anions.},

  abstract     = {Modular functionalization enables versatile exploration of chemical space and has been broadly applied in structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies of aromatic scaffolds during drug discovery. Recently, the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motif has increasingly received attention as a bioisosteric replacement of benzene rings due to its ability to improve the physicochemical properties of prospective drug candidates, but studying the SARs of C2-substituted BCPs has been heavily restricted by the need for multistep de novo synthesis of each analogue of interest. Here we report a programmable bis-functionalization strategy to enable late-stage sequential derivatization of BCP bis-boronates, opening up opportunities to explore the SARs of drug candidates possessing multisubstituted BCP motifs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent chemoselectivity exhibited by BCP bis-boronates, enabling highly selective activation and functionalization of bridgehead (C3)-boronic pinacol esters (Bpin), leaving the C2-Bpin intact and primed for subsequent derivatization. These selective transformations of both BCP bridgehead (C3) and bridge (C2) positions enable access to C1,C2-disubstituted and C1,C2,C3-trisubstituted BCPs that encompass previously unexplored chemical space. The bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motif has drawn increasing attention recently in drug discovery. Now, a programmable bis-functionalization strategy has been developed to modularly access bridge-substituted BCP scaffolds, based on the inherent chemoselectivity of BCP bis-boronates (3° &amp;gt; 2°). This strategy should enable further structure–activity relationship studies of BCP-containing drug candidates and open the door to unexplored chemical space.},

  abstract     = {Strategies for achieving asymmetric catalysis with azaarenes have traditionally fallen short of accomplishing remote stereocontrol, which would greatly enhance accessibility to distinct azaarenes with remote chiral centres. The primary obstacle to achieving superior enantioselectivity for remote stereocontrol has been the inherent rigidity of the azaarene ring structure. Here we introduce an ene-reductase system capable of modulating the enantioselectivity of remote carbon-centred radicals on azaarenes through a mechanism of chiral hydrogen atom transfer. This photoenzymatic process effectively directs prochiral radical centres located more than six chemical bonds, or over 6 Å, from the nitrogen atom in azaarenes, thereby enabling the production of a broad array of azaarenes possessing a remote γ-stereocentre. Results from our integrated computational and experimental investigations underscore that the hydrogen bonding and steric effects of key amino acid residues are important for achieving such high stereoselectivities. The inherent rigidity of the azaarene ring structure has made it challenging to achieve remote stereocontrol through asymmetric catalysis on these substrates. Now, through a photoenzymatic process, an ene-reductase system facilitates the production of diverse azaarenes with distant γ-stereocentres, highlighting the potential of biocatalysts for stereoselectivity at remote sites.},

  abstract     = {1,2-Azaborines represent a unique class of benzene isosteres that have attracted interest for developing pharmaceuticals with better potency and bioavailability. However, it remains a long-standing challenge to prepare monocyclic 1,2-azaborines, particularly multi-substituted ones, in an efficient and modular manner. Here we report a straightforward method to directly access diverse multi-substituted 1,2-azaborines from readily available cyclopropyl imines/ketones and dibromoboranes under relatively mild conditions. The reaction is scalable, shows a broad substrate scope, and tolerates a range of functional groups. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the concise syntheses of BN isosteres of a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and pyrethroid insecticide, bifenthrin. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction pathway involves boron-mediated cyclopropane ring-opening and base-mediated elimination, followed by an unusual low-barrier 6π-electrocyclization accelerated by the BN/CC isomerism. This method is anticipated to find applications for the synthesis of BN-isostere analogues in medicinal chemistry, and the mechanistic insights gained here may guide developing other boron-mediated electrocyclizations. Preparation of monocyclic 1,2-azaborines, a unique class of benzene isosteres, has been challenging.

  abstract     = {Many peptide-derived natural products are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) in an assembly-line fashion. Each amino acid is coupled to a designated peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) through two distinct reactions catalysed sequentially by the single active site of the adenylation domain (A-domain). Accumulating evidence suggests that large-amplitude structural changes occur in different NRPS states; yet how these molecular machines orchestrate such biochemical sequences has remained elusive. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we show that the A-domain of gramicidin S synthetase I adopts structurally extended and functionally obligatory conformations for alternating between adenylation and thioester-formation structures during enzymatic cycles. Complementary biochemical, computational and small-angle X-ray scattering studies reveal interconversion among these three conformations as intrinsic and hierarchical where intra-A-domain organizations propagate to remodel inter-A–PCP didomain configurations during catalysis. The tight kinetic coupling between structural transitions and enzymatic transformations is quantified, and how the gramicidin S synthetase I A-domain utilizes its inherent conformational dynamics to drive directional biosynthesis with a flexibly linked PCP domain is revealed. Many natural products are produced by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases in an assembly-line fashion. How these molecular machines orchestrate the biochemical sequences has remained elusive. It is now understood that an extended-conformation ensemble is needed to coordinate chemical-transformation steps whereas the biosynthesis directionality is driven by the enzyme’s innate conformational free energies.},

Here we show how a modular, reagent-based platform can enable the stereocontrolled and scalable synthesis of a library of such molecules.

However, the chemical complexity of drug molecules often makes late-stage diversification challenging. To address this problem, a late-stage functionalization platform based on geometric deep learning and high-throughput reaction screening was developed. Considering borylation as a critical step in late-stage functionalization, the computational model predicted reaction yields for diverse reaction conditions with a mean absolute error margin of 4–5%, while the reactivity of novel reactions with known and unknown substrates was classified with a balanced accuracy of 92% and 67%, respectively. The regioselectivity of the major products was accurately captured with a classifier F-score of 67%. When applied to 23 diverse commercial drug molecules, the platform successfully identified numerous opportunities for structural diversification. The influence of steric and electronic information on model performance was quantified, and a comprehensive simple user-friendly reaction format was introduced that proved to be a key enabler for seamlessly integrating deep learning and high-throughput experimentation for late-stage functionalization. Late-stage functionalization of complex drug molecules is challenging. To address this problem, a discovery platform based on geometric deep learning and high-throughput experimentation was developed.

  abstract     = {Detecting genetic mutations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is necessary to prescribe effective cancer therapies, perform genetic analyses and distinguish similar viral strains. Traditionally, SNP sensing uses short oligonucleotide probes that differentially bind the SNP and wild-type targets. However, DNA hybridization-based techniques require precise tuning of the probe’s binding affinity to manage the inherent trade-off between specificity and sensitivity. As conventional hybridization offers limited control over binding affinity, here we generate heteromultivalent DNA-functionalized particles and demonstrate optimized hybridization specificity for targets containing one or two mutations. By investigating the role of oligo lengths, spacer lengths and binding orientation, we reveal that heteromultivalent hybridization enables fine-tuned specificity for a single SNP and dramatic enhancements in specificity for two non-proximal SNPs empowered by highly cooperative binding. Capitalizing on these abilities, we demonstrate straightforward discrimination between heterozygous cis and trans mutations and between different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our findings indicate that heteromultivalent hybridization offers substantial improvements over conventional monovalent hybridization-based methods. Detecting genetic mutations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is essential for disease diagnostics but can be difficult using homomultivalent DNA hybridization-based approaches. Now, heteromultivalent hybridization is used to fine-tune binding specificity for the detection of one or two SNPs in a single target, enabling straightforward discrimination between adjacent and distant mutations and different viral strains.},

Pomalidomide, a widely used E3 ligase recruiter in PROTACs, can independently degrade other proteins, including zinc-finger (ZF) proteins, with vital roles in health and disease. This off-target degradation hampers the therapeutic applicability of pomalidomide-based PROTACs, requiring development of PROTAC design rules that minimize off-target degradation. Here we developed a high-throughput platform that interrogates off-target degradation and found that reported pomalidomide-based PROTACs induce degradation of several ZF proteins. We generated a library of pomalidomide analogues to understand how functionalizing different positions of the phthalimide ring, hydrogen bonding, and steric and hydrophobic effects impact ZF protein degradation. Modifications of appropriate size on the C5 position reduced off-target ZF degradation, which we validated through target engagement and proteomics studies. By applying these design principles, we developed anaplastic lymphoma kinase oncoprotein-targeting PROTACs with enhanced potency and minimal off-target degradation. Current proteolysis-targeting chimeras can promote the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of both target and off-target proteins by inducing their respective proximity with the cereblon ubiquitin ligase. Now, by developing and deploying an off-target profiling platform, ‘bumped proteolysis-targeting chimeras’ can maintain on-target degradation efficacy with reduced off-targets.},

  abstract     = {Microscopic sequences of synthetic polymers play crucial roles in the polymer properties, but are generally unknown and inaccessible to traditional measurements. Here we report real-time optical sequencing of single synthetic copolymer chains under living polymerization conditions. We achieve this by carrying out multi-colour imaging of polymer growth by single catalysts at single-monomer resolution using CREATS (coupled reaction approach toward super-resolution imaging). CREATS makes a reaction effectively fluorogenic, enabling single-molecule localization microscopy of chemical reactions at higher reactant concentrations. Our data demonstrate that the chain propagation kinetics of surface-grafted polymerization contains temporal fluctuations with a defined memory time (which can be attributed to neighbouring monomer interactions) and chain-length dependence (due to surface electrostatic effects). Furthermore, the microscopic sequences of individual copolymers reveal their tendency to form block copolymers, and, more importantly, quantify the size distribution of individual blocks for comparison with theoretically random copolymers. Such sequencing capability paves the way for single-chain-level structure–function correlation studies of synthetic polymers. Sequences of synthetic polymers are generally heterogeneous and dictate many of their physiochemical properties, but are challenging to determine. Now an imaging method, termed CREATS (coupled reaction approach toward super-resolution imaging), can count, localize and identify each monomer of single polymer chains during (co)polymerization.},

However, it is difficult to control the nucleation, growth and orientation of two distinct components. Here we report the combination of two methods—liquid-phase growth and vapour-phase growth—to synthesize 2D OLHs from perylene and a perylenecarboxaldehyde derivative, with a lateral size of ~20 μm and a tunable thickness ranging from 20 to 400 nm. The screw dislocation growth behaviour of the 2D crystals shows the spiral arrangement of atoms within the crystal lattice, which avoids volume expansion and contraction of OLH, thereby minimizing lateral connection defects. Selective control of the nucleation and sequential growth of 2D crystals leads to structural inversion of the 2D OLHs by the vapour-phase growth method. The resulting OLHs show good light-transport capabilities and tunable spatial exciton conversion, useful for photonic applications. This synthetic strategy can be extended to other families of organic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as demonstrated with other pyrene and perylene derivatives. The synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) organic lateral heterostructures with desirable properties from organic single crystals remains challenging. Now, 2D organic lateral heterostructures have been produced by using a liquid-phase growth approach and vapour-phase growth method, enabling the structural inversion of organic lateral heterostructures via a two-step strategy.},

As they become longer, they evolve towards carbyne, the 1D allotrope of carbon, and they become increasingly unstable. It has been anticipated that long polyynes could be stabilized by supramolecular encapsulation, by threading them through macrocycles to form polyrotaxanes—but, until now, polyyne polyrotaxanes with many threaded macrocycles have been synthetically inaccessible. Here we show that masked alkynes, in which the C≡C triple bond is temporarily coordinated to cobalt, can be used to synthesize polyrotaxanes, up to the C68 [5]rotaxane with 34 contiguous triple bonds and four threaded macrocycles. This is the length regime at which the electronic properties of polyynes converge to those of carbyne. Cyclocarbons constitute a related family of molecular carbon allotropes, and cobalt-masked alkynes also provide a route to [3]catenanes and [5]catenanes built around cobalt complexes of cyclo[40]carbon and cyclo[80]carbon, respectively. Long polyynes have fascinating properties but they are difficult to synthesize as a consequence of their high reactivity. Now, it has been shown that cobalt carbonyl complexes can be used as masked alkyne equivalents, enabling the preparation of stable polyyne polyrotaxanes with up to 34 contiguous triple bonds.},

  abstract     = {An increased interest to expand three-dimensional chemical space for the design of new materials and medicines has created a demand for isosteric replacement groups of commonly used molecular functionality. The structural and chemical properties of chiral S(VI) functional groups provide unique spatial and electronic features compared with their achiral sulfur- and carbon-based counterparts. Manipulation of the S(VI) centre to introduce structural variation with stereochemical control has remained a synthetic challenge. The stability of sulfonimidoyl fluorides and the efficiency of sulfur fluorine exchange chemistry has enabled the development of the enantiopure bifunctional S(VI) transfer reagent t-BuSF to overcome current synthetic limitations. Here, we disclose a reagent platform that serves as a chiral sulfur fluorine exchange template for the rapid asymmetric synthesis of over 70 sulfoximines, sulfonimidoyl fluorides and sulfonimidamides with excellent enantiomeric excess and good overall yields. Furthermore, the practical utility of the bifunctional S(VI) transfer reagent was demonstrated in the syntheses of enantiopure pharmaceutical intermediates and analogues. The stereochemical control and bifunctional manipulation of chiral sulfur functional groups is a long-standing challenge. Now, an enantiopure bench-stable S(VI) fluoride exchange reagent enables the asymmetric synthesis of sulfoximines, sulfonimidamides and sulfonimidoyl fluorides. The bifunctional nature of this reagent provides a practical method for the introduction of S(VI) functionality.},

  abstract     = {Even in the genomic era, microbial natural product discovery workflows can be laborious and limited in their ability to target molecules with specific structural features. Here we leverage an understanding of biosynthesis to develop a workflow that targets the discovery of alkyl halide-derived natural products by depleting halide anions, a key biosynthetic substrate for enzymatic halogenation, from microbial growth media. By comparing the metabolomes of bacterial cultures grown in halide-replete and deficient media, we rapidly discovered the nostochlorosides, the products of an orphan halogenase-encoding gene cluster from Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. We further found that these products, a family of unusual chlorinated glycolipids featuring the rare sugar gulose, are polymerized via an unprecedented enzymatic etherification reaction. Together, our results highlight the power of leveraging an understanding of biosynthetic logic to streamline natural product discovery. Natural products discovery remains an ongoing challenge. Now, halide depletion offers a complementary approach to discover natural products whose biosynthesis requires halides, including products of cryptic halogenation. Halide depletion reveals that nostochlorosides, the products of an orphan biosynthetic gene cluster in Nostoc punctiforme, are polymerized by a halide-displacing etherifying enzyme.},

Here we report the synthesis of a molecular Ra2+ complex using 226Ra and the organic ligand dibenzo-30-crown-10, and its characterization in the solid state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The crystal structure of the Ra2+ complex shows an 11-coordinate arrangement comprising the 10 donor O atoms of dibenzo-30-crown-10 and that of a bound water molecule. Under identical crystallization conditions, barium (Ba2+) yielded a 10-coordinate ‘Pac-Man’-shaped structure lacking water. Furthermore, the bond distance between the Ra centre and the O atom of the coordinated water is substantially longer than would be predicted from the ionic radius of Ra2+ and by analogy with Ba2+, supporting greater water lability in Ra2+ complexes than in their Ba2+ counterparts. Barium often serves as a non-radioactive surrogate for radium, but our findings show that Ra2+ chemistry cannot always be predicted using Ba2+. Radium complexes are of interest for use as cancer therapeutic agents, but the structure and bonding are poorly understood.

Here we develop an interactive binary population of coacervate microdroplets that spontaneously self-sort into chain-like protocell networks with an alternating sequence of structurally and compositionally dissimilar microdomains with hemispherical contact points. The protocell superstructures exhibit macromolecular self-sorting, spatially localized enzyme/ribozyme biocatalysis and interdroplet molecular translocation. They are capable of topographical reconfiguration using chemical or light-mediated stimuli and can be used as a micro-extraction system for macroscale biomolecular sorting. Our methodology opens a pathway towards the self-assembly of multicomponent protocell networks based on selective processes of coacervate droplet–droplet adhesion and fusion, and provides a step towards the spontaneous orchestration of protocell models into artificial tissues and colonies with ordered architectures and collective functions. Bottom-up assembly of protocells into networking superstructures represents a further key step towards rudimentary formation of life. Now it has been shown that a pool of biomolecules can self-organize into an interactive binary population of protocell coacervates with a self-sorting chain-like configuration, allowing for biomolecular extraction, translocation and macroscale separation.},

Here we reveal a previously unexplored form of non-aryl atropisomerism by linking a sterically congested olefin to a sulfoxonium ylide. A streamlined synthetic approach to these novel molecules was developed through the hydrofunctionalization of alkynyl sulfoxonium ylides. Notably, an enantioselective organocatalytic strategy was developed to prepare these non-aryl atropisomers in high optical purity. This form of atropisomerism offers new routes for investigating the functional properties of axially chiral molecules. The synthesis of optically enriched atropisomers has so far been limited to molecules containing aryl groups. Now a variant of non-aryl atropisomerism has been identified in vinyl sulfoxonium ylides, and an organocatalytic method has been developed to produce these molecules. This type of axial chirality is characterized by restricted rotation of the central C(sp2)–C(sp2) bond.},

However, it remains a huge challenge due to the lack of sensitive methods to identify disease-specific rare molecules. Here we present MORAC, molecular recognition based on affinity and catalysis, which enables the effective identification of candidate biomarkers with low abundance. MORAC relies on a class of DNAzymes, each cleaving a sole RNA linkage embedded in their DNA chain upon specifically sensing a complex system with no prior knowledge of the system’s molecular content. We show that signal amplification from catalysis ensures the DNAzymes high sensitivity (for target probing); meanwhile, a simple RNA-to-DNA mutation can shut down their RNA cleavage ability and turn them into a pure affinity tool (for target pulldown). Using MORAC, we identify previously unknown, low-abundance candidate biomarkers with clear clinical value, including apolipoprotein L6 in breast cancer and seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 in polyps preceding colon cancer. The discovery of biomarkers remains challenging owing to a lack of methods sensitive enough to identify such rare molecules. Now, by simultaneously exploiting the catalysis and affinity of a DNAzyme, candidate biomarkers with low abundance in cancers can be pulled down for identification and validation.},

  abstract     = {Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is a powerful characterization technique that enables the determination of atomic arrangements in crystalline materials. Growing or retaining large single crystals amenable to it has, however, remained challenging with covalent organic frameworks (COFs), especially suffering from post-synthetic modifications. Here we show the synthesis of a flexible COF with interpenetrated qtz topology by polymerization of tetra(phenyl)bimesityl-based tetraaldehyde and tetraamine building blocks. The material is shown to be flexible through its large, anisotropic positive thermal expansion along the c axis (αc = +491 × 10–6 K–1), as well as through a structural transformation on the removal of solvent molecules from its pores. The as-synthesized and desolvated materials undergo single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation by reduction and oxidation of its imine linkages to amine and amide ones, respectively. These redox-induced linkage conversions endow the resulting COFs with improved stability towards strong acid; loading of phosphoric acid leads to anhydrous proton conductivity up to ca. 6.0 × 10−2 S cm−1. Covalent organic frameworks offer a highly tunable class of materials for a range of applications, although their dynamic structural transformations are challenging to analyse. Now single-crystal X-ray diffraction is shown to demonstrate single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations of the imine linkages, showing a well-defined interpenetrating topology and affording structures that have high positive thermal expansion and anhydrous proton-conduction properties.},

  abstract     = {Carbonyls and alkenes are versatile functional groups, whose reactivities are cornerstones of organic synthesis. The selective combination of two carbonyls to form an alkene—a carbonyl cross-metathesis—would be a valuable tool for their exchange. Yet, this important synthetic challenge remains unsolved. Although alkene/alkene and alkene/carbonyl cross-metathesis reactions are known, there is a lack of analogous methods for deoxygenative cross-coupling of two carbonyl compounds. Here we report a pair of strategies for the cross-metathesis of unbiased carbonyls, allowing an aldehyde to be chemo- and stereoselectively combined with another aldehyde or ketone. These mild, catalytic methods are promoted by earth-abundant metal salts and enable rapid access to an unprecedentedly broad range of either Z- or E-alkenes by two distinct mechanisms—entailing transiently generated (1) carbenes and ylides (via Fe catalysis) or (2) doubly nucleophilic gem-di-metallics (via Cr catalysis). Merging carbonyls to form an alkene by removing their oxygens is rare, yet synthetically useful, and the selective combination of two different carbonyls is especially challenging. Now, two strategies for cross-metathesis of unbiased carbonyls have been developed. An Fe-catalysed carbene/ylide strategy affords Z-alkenes, while Cr-catalysed gem-di-metals yield E-alkenes.},

  abstract     = {Exciplex-forming systems that display thermally activated delayed fluorescence are widely used for fabricating organic light-emitting diodes. However, their further development can be hindered through a lack of structural and thermodynamic characterization. Here we report the generation of inclusion complexes between a cage-like, macrocyclic, electron-accepting host (A) and various N-methyl-indolocarbazole-based electron-donating guests (D), which exhibit exciplex-like thermally activated delayed fluorescence via a through-space electron-transfer process. The D/A cocrystals are fully resolved by X-ray analyses, and UV–visible titration data show their formation to be an endothermic and entropy-driven process. Moreover, their emission can be fine-tuned through the molecular orbitals of the donor. Organic light-emitting diodes were fabricated using one of the D/A systems, and the maximum external quantum efficiency measured was 15.2%. An external quantum efficiency of 10.3% was maintained under a luminance of 1,000 cd m–2. The results show the potential of adopting inclusion complexation to better understand the relationships between the structure, formation thermodynamics and properties of exciplexes. Although exciplex-forming systems are widely used for fabricating organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), their structural and thermodynamic characterization is limited. Now donor/acceptor inclusion complexes that demonstrate thermally activated delayed fluorescence have been generated. Their cocrystal structures have been resolved and the thermodynamics of exciplex formation determined, which has enabled the fabrication of efficient OLEDs.},

A new challenge for the field is to use these designs directly in cells to intervene in biological processes and augment natural systems. The bottom-up design of self-assembled objects such as microcompartments and membraneless organelles is one such challenge. Here we describe the design of genetically encoded polypeptides that form membraneless organelles in Escherichia coli. To do this, we combine de novo α-helical sequences, intrinsically disordered linkers and client proteins in single-polypeptide constructs. We tailor the properties of the helical regions to shift protein assembly from arrested assemblies to dynamic condensates. The designs are characterized in cells and in vitro using biophysical methods and soft-matter physics. Finally, we use the designed polypeptide to co-compartmentalize a functional enzyme pair in E. coli, improving product formation close to the theoretical limit. Phase separation is being revealed as important in many biological processes. Most attempts to mimic and deconstruct this use engineered natural proteins. Now it is shown that de novo proteins can be designed from first principles to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation in cells, with the potential to organize multi-enzyme pathways.},

Conversely, the replicating entities can also affect their environment generating a reciprocal feedback on evolutionary dynamics. The onset of such eco-evolutionary dynamics marks a stepping stone in the transition from chemistry to biology. Yet the bottom-up creation of a molecular system that exhibits eco-evolutionary dynamics has remained elusive. Here we describe the onset of such dynamics in a minimal system containing two synthetic self-replicators. The replicators are capable of binding and activating a co-factor, enabling them to change the oxidation state of their environment through photoredox catalysis. The replicator distribution adapts to this change and, depending on light intensity, one or the other replicator becomes dominant. This study shows how behaviour analogous to eco-evolutionary dynamics—which until now has been restricted to biology—can be created using an artificial minimal replicator system. The onset of eco-evolutionary dynamics marks a stepping stone in the transition from chemistry to biology. Now a minimal replicator system showing such dynamics has been developed.

  abstract     = {Sustained autocatalysis coupled to compartment growth and division is a key step in the origin of life, but an experimental demonstration of this phenomenon in an artificial system has previously proven elusive. We show that autocatalytic reactions within compartments—when autocatalysis, and reactant and solvent exchange outpace product exchange—drive osmosis and diffusion, resulting in compartment growth. We demonstrate, using the formose reaction compartmentalized in aqueous droplets in an emulsion, that compartment volume can more than double. Competition for a common reactant (formaldehyde) causes variation in droplet growth rate based on the composition of the surrounding droplets. These growth rate variations are partially transmitted after selective division of the largest droplets by shearing, which converts growth-rate differences into differences in droplet frequency. This shows how a combination of properties of living systems (growth, division, variation, competition, rudimentary heredity and selection) can arise from simple physical–chemical processes and may have paved the way for the emergence of evolution by natural selection. The coupling of autocatalysis to compartment growth and division is a key step in the origin of life. Now it has been shown that compartmentalizing the formose reaction in emulsion droplets leads to several crucial properties of living and evolving systems (growth, division, variation, competition, rudimentary heredity and selection).},

Here in real time, we monitor the dynamics of LLPS of mixtures of segregatively phase-separating polymers inside all-synthetic, giant unilamellar vesicles. After dynamically triggering phase separation, we find that the ensuing relaxation—en route to the new equilibrium—is non-trivially modulated by a dynamic interplay between the coarsening of the evolving droplet phase and the interactive membrane boundary. The membrane boundary is preferentially wetted by one of the incipient phases, dynamically arresting the progression of coarsening and deforming the membrane. When the vesicles are composed of phase-separating mixtures of common lipids, LLPS within the vesicular interior becomes coupled to the membrane’s compositional degrees of freedom, producing microphase-separated membrane textures. This coupling of bulk and surface phase-separation processes suggests a physical principle by which LLPS inside living cells might be dynamically regulated and communicated to the cellular boundaries. The kinetics of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cell-like confinements remains poorly understood. Now it has been shown that it involves complex interplay between the incipient phases and the membrane boundary, which arrests phase coarsening, deforms the membrane and couples LLPS with lipid phase separation.},

Despite the construction of central chirality from tetracoordinate boron species via a 1,2-metallate shift, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral compounds from such boron ‘ate’ complexes is an ongoing challenge. Axially chiral alkenes have received great attention due to their unique characteristics and intriguing molecular scaffolds. Here we report an enantioselective nickel-catalysed strategy for the construction of axially chiral alkenes via a 1,3-metallate shift of alkynyl tetracoordinate boron species. The chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and atroposelectivity can be regulated and well-controlled from readily accessible starting materials with a cheap transition-metal catalyst. Downstream transformations indicate the powerful conversion ability of such compounds in this protocol, and late-stage elaborations of bioactive compounds can also be achieved. Mechanistic experiments reveal that regioselective syn-addition of an aryl–Ni complex with a carbon–carbon triple bond and subsequent 1,3-phenyl migration are the two key steps for the synthesis of axially chiral alkenes. Enantioselective transformations based on tetracoordinate borons are elusive. Now, an enantioselective nickel-catalysed strategy for the construction of axially chiral alkenes has been reported, via a 1,3-metallate shift of alkynyl tetracoordinate boron species.

Key outstanding problems include understanding the structure of amorphous calcium carbonate and rationalizing its metastability as an amorphous phase. Here we report high-quality atomistic models of amorphous calcium carbonate generated using state-of-the-art interatomic potentials to help guide fits to X-ray total scattering data. Exploiting a recently developed inversion approach, we extract from these models the effective Ca⋯Ca interaction potential governing the structure. This potential contains minima at two competing distances, corresponding to the two different ways that carbonate ions bridge Ca2+-ion pairs. We reveal an unexpected mapping to the Lennard-Jones–Gauss model normally studied in the context of computational soft matter. The empirical model parameters for amorphous calcium carbonate take values known to promote structural complexity. We thus show that both the complex structure and its resilience to crystallization are actually encoded in the geometrically frustrated effective interactions between Ca2+ ions. Although amorphous calcium carbonate represents an important biomineralization precursor, its structure has been difficult to understand. Now, amorphous calcium carbonate’s structure is shown to arise from the different bridging modes available to the calcium ions. This effective multi-well potential that drives calcium arrangements creates a geometric incompatibility between preferred Ca–Ca distances and frustrates crystallization.},

Excellent fluorogenic rhodamine dyes have been reported, but they often require long and low-yielding syntheses, and are spectrally limited to the visible range. Here we present a general strategy to transform polymethine compounds into fluorogenic dyes using an intramolecular ring-closure approach. We illustrate the generality of this method by creating both spontaneously blinking and no-wash, turn-on polymethine dyes with emissions across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. These probes are compatible with self-labelling proteins and small-molecule targeting ligands, and can be combined with rhodamine-based dyes for multicolour and fluorescence lifetime multiplexing imaging. This strategy provides access to bright, fluorogenic dyes that emit at wavelengths that are more red-shifted compared with those of existing rhodamine-based dyes. Polymethine dyes are bright and red-shifted fluorophores that lack an intrinsic turn-on mechanism, which leads to non-specific staining when applied to biological samples. Now the fluorescence of polymethine dyes was masked through an intracellular cyclization strategy that gets reversed upon binding an intended macromolecular target, providing specificity for live-cell imaging.},

Here we present the structural identification of the common, perpendicular intermediate of stilbene photoisomerization using ultrafast Raman spectroscopy. Our results reveal ultrafast birth and decay of an identical, short-lived transient that exhibits a vibrational signature characteristic of the perpendicular state upon photoexcitation of the trans and cis forms. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, it is shown that the photoexcited trans and cis forms are funnelled off to the ground state through the same, perpendicular intermediate. The prototypical trans–cis photoisomerization of stilbenes is thought to occur via a transient intermediate with a perpendicular conformation—often called ‘the phantom state’—but its unambiguous identification has thus far proved difficult.

  abstract     = {Stimuli-responsive behaviour is key to the design of smart materials, surfaces, nano-systems and effector molecules, allowing their application as switchable catalysts, molecular transporters, bioimaging probes or caged drugs. Supramolecular chemistry has embraced the widespread integration of photoswitches because of their precise spatiotemporal addressability and waste-free nature. In the vibrant area of discrete metal-mediated self-assembly, however, photoswitches are still rarely employed. Only recently has it been shown that embedding photoswitches into the organic backbones of coordination cages enables control of their host and material properties and thus unlocks the hitherto unexploited dynamic adaptivity of such systems. Here we discuss four cases where triggering ligand-integrated photoswitches leads to (1) control over disassembly/reassembly, (2) bi-stable switching between defined states, (3) interplay with thermal processes in metastable systems and (4) light-fuelled dissipative self-assembly. We highlight first clues concerning the relationship between fundamental photophysics and dynamic assembly equilibria and propose directions for future development. The self-assembly of stimuli-responsive building blocks yields functional nano-systems and smart materials. This Perspective discusses how the integration of photoswitches into discrete coordination cages enables control over their assembly, guest binding and systems behaviour. Four scenarios are drawn to highlight the relationship between the photoswitching and dynamic assembly equilibria.},
