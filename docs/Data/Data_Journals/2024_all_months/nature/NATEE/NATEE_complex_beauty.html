  abstract     = {Global ecosystems are rapidly approaching tipping points, where minute shifts can lead to drastic ecological changes. Theory predicts that evolution can shape a system’s tipping point behaviour, but direct experimental support is lacking. Here we investigate the power of evolutionary processes to alter these critical thresholds and protect an ecological community from collapse. To do this, we propagate a two-species microbial system composed of Escherichia coli and baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for over 4,000 generations, and map ecological stability before and after coevolution. Our results reveal that tipping points—and other geometric properties of ecological communities—can evolve to alter the range of conditions under which our microbial community can flourish. We develop a mathematical model to illustrate how evolutionary changes in parameters such as growth rate, carrying capacity and resistance to environmental change affect ecological resilience. Our study shows that adaptation of key species can shift an ecological community’s tipping point, potentially promoting ecological stability or accelerating collapse. Empirical evidence on how evolution affects the stability of ecological communities is scarce. Here, using two-species microbial assemblages as a model system, the authors show that adaptation can alter the tipping points of an ecological community.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the genetic and fitness consequences of anthropogenic bottlenecks is crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, studies of bottlenecked populations combining genomic approaches with fitness data are rare. Theory predicts that severe bottlenecks deplete genetic diversity, exacerbate inbreeding depression and decrease population viability. However, actual outcomes are complex and depend on how a species’ unique demography affects its genetic load. We used population genetic and veterinary pathology data, demographic modelling, whole-genome resequencing and forward genetic simulations to investigate the genomic and fitness consequences of a near-extinction event in the northern elephant seal. We found no evidence of inbreeding depression within the contemporary population for key fitness components, including body mass, blubber thickness and susceptibility to parasites and disease. However, we detected a genomic signature of a recent extreme bottleneck (effective population size = 6; 95% confidence interval = 5.0–7.5) that will have purged much of the genetic load, potentially leading to the lack of observed inbreeding depression in our study. Our results further suggest that deleterious genetic variation strongly impacted the post-bottleneck population dynamics of the northern elephant seal. Our study provides comprehensive empirical insights into the intricate dynamics underlying species-specific responses to anthropogenic bottlenecks. Analysis of northern elephant seal populations shows no evidence of inbreeding depression, probably because a recent extreme bottleneck purged much of the genetic load.},

  abstract     = {The onset of sedentism on the Tibetan Plateau is often presumed to be associated with the dispersal of agriculture or farmers from archaeological sites located in the low elevation margins of the plateau. Previous studies of the plateau assumed that all foragers were probably mobile, but few systematic excavations at forager sites have been conducted to inform us about their settlement patterns. Here we report the world’s highest elevation sedentary way of living exhibited by the Mabu Co site at 4,446 metres above sea level, deep in the interior of the Tibetan Plateau 4,400–4,000 years ago. Our interdisciplinary study indicates that the site was occupied by Indigenous inhabitants of the plateau, representing the earliest known DNA evidence of foragers who predominantly harbour the southern plateau ancestry. The evidence shows that they had a sedentary lifestyle primarily supported by fishing at nearby lakes, supplemented by mammal and bird hunting, as well as small-scale exchanges of millet and rice crops. Ancient DNA, stable isotopes and other archaeological methods establish that humans were living at extremely high elevation on the Tibetan Plateau 4,400 years ago, maintaining sedentary lifestyles that combined fishing, hunting and crop exchange.},

  abstract     = {Seasonal bird migration may provide energy benefits associated with moving to areas with less physiologically challenging climates or increased food availability, but migratory movements themselves may carry high costs. However, time-dynamic energy profiles of free-living migrants—especially small-bodied songbirds—are challenging to measure. Here we quantify energy output and thermoregulatory costs in partially migratory common blackbirds using implanted heart rate and temperature loggers paired with automated radio telemetry and energetic modelling. Our results show that blackbirds save considerable energy in preparation for migration by decreasing heart rate and body temperature 28 days before departure, potentially dwarfing the energy costs of migratory flights. Yet, in warmer wintering areas, migrants do not appear to decrease total daily energy expenditure despite a substantially reduced cost of thermoregulation. These findings indicate differential metabolic programmes across different wintering strategies despite equivalent overall energy expenditure, suggesting that the maintenance of migration is associated with differences in energy allocation rather than with total energy expenditure. The energetic costs of seasonal bird migration are challenging to measure. Here bio-loggers paired with radio telemetry and energetic modelling show that blackbirds offset the energetic cost of migration by decreasing heart rate and body temperature 28 days before departure but do not decrease total daily energy expenditure in warmer wintering areas.},

  abstract     = {Recent observations document that long-term soil warming in a temperate deciduous forest leads to significant soil carbon loss, whereas chronic soil nitrogen enrichment leads to significant soil carbon gain. Most global change experiments like these are single factor, investigating the impacts of one stressor in isolation of others. Because warming and ecosystem nitrogen enrichment are happening concurrently in many parts of the world, we designed a field experiment to test how these two factors, alone and in combination, impact soil carbon cycling. Here, we show that long-term continuous soil warming or nitrogen enrichment when applied alone followed the predicted response, with warming resulting in significant soil carbon loss and nitrogen fertilization tending towards soil carbon gain. The combination treatment showed an unanticipated response, whereby soil respiratory carbon loss was significantly higher than either single factor alone, but without a concomitant decline in soil carbon storage. Observations suggest that when soils are exposed to both factors simultaneously, plant carbon inputs to the soil are enhanced, counterbalancing soil carbon loss and helping maintain soil carbon stocks near control levels. This has implications for both atmospheric CO2 emissions and soil fertility and shows that coupling two important global change drivers results in a distinctive response that was not predicted by the behaviour of the single factors in isolation. Long-term warming of soils causes carbon loss, whereas chronic nitrogen enrichment causes carbon gain. Here, in an experiment that combined both factors, soil respiration was significantly higher than with either factor alone, without an associated decline in soil carbon.},

  abstract     = {Rapid warming and increasing disturbances in high-latitude regions have caused extensive vegetation shifts and uncertainty in future carbon budgets. Better predictions of vegetation dynamics and functions require characterizing resilience, which indicates the capability of an ecosystem to recover from perturbations. Here, using temporal autocorrelation of remotely sensed greenness, we quantify time-varying vegetation resilience during 2000–2019 across northwestern North American Arctic-boreal ecosystems. We find that vegetation resilience significantly decreased in southern boreal forests, including forests showing greening trends, while it increased in most of the Arctic tundra. Warm and dry areas with high elevation and dense vegetation cover were among the hotspots of reduced resilience. Resilience further declined both before and after forest losses and fires, especially in southern boreal forests. These findings indicate that warming and disturbance have been altering vegetation resilience, potentially undermining the expected long-term increase of high-latitude carbon uptake under future climate. Climate change is causing both greening and disturbances in high-latitude vegetation. Here the authors quantify patterns and trends of vegetation resilience in northwestern North America during 2000–2019 and link them to climate-driven land-cover changes and fire disturbance.},

  abstract     = {Many terrestrial plant communities, especially forests, have been shown to lag in response to rapid climate change. Grassland communities may respond more quickly to novel climates, as they consist mostly of short-lived species, which are directly exposed to macroclimate change. Here we report the rapid response of grassland communities to climate change in the California Floristic Province. We estimated 349 vascular plant species’ climatic niches from 829,337 occurrence records, compiled 15 long-term community composition datasets from 12 observational studies and 3 global change experiments, and analysed community compositional shifts in the climate niche space. We show that communities experienced significant shifts towards species associated with warmer and drier locations at rates of 0.0216 ± 0.00592 °C yr−1 (mean ± s.e.) and −3.04 ± 0.742 mm yr−1, and these changes occurred at a pace similar to that of climate warming and drying. These directional shifts were consistent across observations and experiments. Our findings contrast with the lagged responses observed in communities dominated by long-lived plants and suggest greater biodiversity changes than expected in the near future. Plant community responses to climate change tend to be lagged in forests, but could be faster in grasslands. Here, the authors integrate long-term experimental data with &amp;gt;1 million occurrence records for &amp;gt;300 species, finding grassland community shifts towards species associated with warmer and drier conditions at a pace that aligns with that of climate change.},

Virus transmission among pollinators via flowers may be reinforced by anthropogenic land-use change and concomitant alteration of plant–pollinator interactions. Here, we examine how species’ traits and roles in flower-visitation networks and landscape-scale factors drive key honeybee viruses—black queen cell virus (BQCV) and deformed wing virus—in 19 wild bee and hoverfly species, across 12 landscapes varying in pollinator-friendly (flower-rich) habitat. Viral loads were on average more than ten times higher in managed honeybees than in wild pollinators. Viral loads in wild pollinators were higher when floral resource use overlapped with honeybees, suggesting these as reservoir hosts, and increased with pollinator abundance and viral loads in honeybees. Viral prevalence decreased with the amount of pollinator-friendly habitat in a landscape, which was partly driven by reduced floral resource overlap with honeybees. Black queen cell virus loads decreased with a wild pollinator’s centrality in the network and the proportion of visited dish-shaped flowers. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of resource overlap with honeybees, species traits and roles in flower-visitation networks and flower-rich pollinator habitat shaping virus transmission. Human-driven landscape change may alter disease transmission among insect pollinators. Here, the authors show that species traits, flower-rich habitat and floral resource overlap with honeybees explain load and prevalence of viruses in wild bees and hoverflies co-occurring with honeybees.},

  abstract     = {Under the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis, sexual dimorphism in pelvic shape is a solution to accommodate high fetopelvic constraints. It is therefore unclear why chimpanzees display a human-like pattern of pelvic sexual dimorphism despite having easier births enabled by small neonates and capacious pelvic canals. Here we reassessed chimpanzee fetopelvic fit using three-dimensional simulations, revealing a similarly constricted midpelvis as in humans, with even narrower outlet dimensions. Geometric morphometric analyses confirm that female chimpanzees have larger pelvic canals than males despite a smaller body size and a morphology that maximizes pelvic dimensions favourable for parturition, particularly in smaller-bodied individuals. Together with evidence for increased neurological immaturity at birth relative to monkeys, our findings imply substantial obstetric constraints in chimpanzees and possibly other apes. We therefore propose that difficult birth did not arise abruptly in Homo with increasing encephalization but evolved gradually through a series of obstetric compromises from an already constricted birth canal shared across anthropoid primates. Specifically, we propose that obstetric selection pressures exacerbated incrementally with the stiffening of the symphysis that accompanied body size increase in hominoids, while subsequent adaptations to bipedalism shortened the ilium. The resulting contorted birth canal required obligatory fetal rotation, thus greatly increasing birth difficulty. The ‘obstetrical dilemma’ hypothesis states that opposing selective pressures from an increased neonatal brain size and efficient bipedal locomotion constrain the birth canal in humans. However, three-dimensional simulations of chimpanzee fetopelvic fit indicate a constricted midpelvis comparable to humans, indicative of obstetric constraints that may be shared with apes thereby suggesting a gradual exacerbation of birth difficulty in hominoid evolution.},

  abstract     = {Deuterostomes are one major group of bilaterians composed by hemichordates and echinoderms (collectively called Ambulacraria) and chordates. Comparative studies between these groups can provide valuable insights into the nature of the last common ancestor of deuterostomes and that of bilaterians. Indirect development of hemichordates, with larval phases similar to echinoderms and an adult body plan with an anteroposterior polarity like chordates and other bilaterians, makes them a suitable model for studying the molecular basis of development among deuterostomes. However, a comprehensive, quantitative catalogue of gene expression and chromatin dynamics in hemichordates is still lacking. In this study, we analysed the transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility of multiple developmental stages of the indirect-developing hemichordate Ptychodera flava. We observed that P. flava development is underpinned by a biphasic transcriptional program probably controlled by distinct genetic networks. Comparisons with other bilaterian species revealed similar transcriptional and regulatory dynamics during hemichordate gastrulation, cephalochordate neurulation and elongation stages of annelids. By means of regulatory networks analysis and functional validations by transgenesis experiments in echinoderms, we propose that gastrulation is the stage of highest molecular resemblance in deuterostomes and that much of the molecular basis of deuterostome development was probably present in the bilaterian last common ancestor. Analysis of transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility of multiple developmental stages of the indirect-developing hemichordate Ptychodera flava shows similar transcriptional dynamics of different developmental stages across hemichordates, echinoderms and chordates.},

  abstract     = {The density of wood is a key indicator of the carbon investment strategies of trees, impacting productivity and carbon storage. Despite its importance, the global variation in wood density and its environmental controls remain poorly understood, preventing accurate predictions of global forest carbon stocks. Here we analyse information from 1.1 million forest inventory plots alongside wood density data from 10,703 tree species to create a spatially explicit understanding of the global wood density distribution and its drivers. Our findings reveal a pronounced latitudinal gradient, with wood in tropical forests being up to 30% denser than that in boreal forests. In both angiosperms and gymnosperms, hydrothermal conditions represented by annual mean temperature and soil moisture emerged as the primary factors influencing the variation in wood density globally. This indicates similar environmental filters and evolutionary adaptations among distinct plant groups, underscoring the essential role of abiotic factors in determining wood density in forest ecosystems. Additionally, our study highlights the prominent role of disturbance, such as human modification and fire risk, in influencing wood density at more local scales. Factoring in the spatial variation of wood density notably changes the estimates of forest carbon stocks, leading to differences of up to 21% within biomes. Therefore, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of terrestrial biomass distribution and how environmental changes and disturbances impact forest ecosystems. Wood density is an important plant trait. Data from 1.1 million forest inventory plots and 10,703 tree species show a latitudinal gradient in wood density, with temperature and soil moisture explaining variation at the global scale and disturbance also having a role at the local level.},

  abstract     = {The environment influences how an organism’s genotype determines its phenotype and how this phenotype affects its fitness. Here, to better understand this dual role of environment in the production and selection of phenotypic variation, we determined genotype–phenotype–fitness relationships for mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in four environments. Specifically, we measured how promoter mutations of the metabolic gene TDH3 modified expression level and affected growth for four different carbon sources. In each environment, we observed a clear relationship between TDH3 expression level and fitness, but this relationship differed among environments. Mutations with similar effects on expression in different environments often had different effects on fitness and vice versa. Such environment-specific relationships between phenotype and fitness can shape the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We also found that mutations disrupting binding sites for transcription factors had more variable effects on expression among environments than those disrupting the TATA box, which is part of the core promoter. However, mutations with the most environmentally variable effects on fitness were located in the TATA box, because of both the lack of plasticity of TATA box mutations and environment-specific fitness functions. This observation suggests that mutations affecting different molecular mechanisms contribute unequally to regulatory sequence evolution in changing environments. Measuring how mutations in the promoter of a metabolic gene modified its expression level and affected growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in four environments, the authors show that the effects of mutations on gene expression and the relationships between expression levels and fitness vary among environments.},

We conduct a large-scale in silico replication project, leveraging cutting-edge statistical methodologies. Replicability is 30%–40% for studies with marginal statistical significance in the absence of selective reporting, whereas the replicability of studies presenting ‘strong’ evidence against the null hypothesis H0 is &amp;gt;70%. The former requires a sevenfold larger sample size to reach the latter’s replicability. We call for a change in planning, conducting and publishing research towards a transparent, credible and replicable ecology and evolution. Large-scale, direct replications of ecological and evolutionary studies are difficult to conduct. This paper applies statistical methods to meta-analyses of ecological and evolutionary studies to estimate replicability.},

  abstract     = {The failure to halt the global decline in biodiversity by 2020 contributed to the adoption of the ambitious Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which includes transparency and responsibility as foundations. The Global Biodiversity Framework identifies the actions needed so that societies are living in harmony with nature by 2050. To support the delivery of this ambition, the transparency and responsibility mechanisms defined in the Global Biodiversity Framework include a detailed Monitoring Framework designed to prompt evidence-based actions and track progress towards its goals and targets at the national and global level. The Monitoring Framework includes a set of indicators selected by the Parties through a political process. These indicators have since been operationalized through a scientific process led by an expert group focused on assessing and clarifying their methods. Most indicators are now ready to inform on progress, but key limitations of data availability and methodological challenges remain. The onus is now on the Parties to resource implementation and on the scientific community to support indicator use and development. Implementation of the Monitoring Framework will provide an unprecedented view of the state of biodiversity at the national level, which can be used to assess both national and global progress. Investment to overcome the Monitoring Framework’s weaknesses will improve our ability to measure progress and mobilize the actions needed to protect and restore biodiversity and the many benefits we receive from nature. This Perspective charts the development of the Monitoring Framework for tracking progress towards the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, including details on the process of indicator selection, and discusses what is still needed for implementation of the Monitoring Framework.},

  abstract     = {Historically, humans have managed food systems to maximize productivity. This pursuit has drastically modified terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems globally by reducing species diversity and body size while creating very productive, yet homogenized, environments. Such changes alter the structure and function of ecosystems in ways that ultimately erode their stability. This productivity–stability trade-off has largely been ignored in discussions around global food security. Here, we synthesize empirical and theoretical literature to demonstrate the existence of the productivity–stability trade-off and argue the need for its explicit incorporation in the sustainable management of food systems. We first explore the history of human management of food systems, its impacts on average body size within and across species and food web stability. We then demonstrate how reductions in body size are symptomatic of a broader biotic homogenization and rewiring of food webs. We show how this biotic homogenization decompartmentalizes interactions among energy channels and increases energy flux within the food web in ways that threaten their stability. We end by synthesizing large-scale ecological studies to demonstrate the prevalence of the productivity–stability trade-off. We conclude that management strategies promoting landscape heterogeneity and maintenance of key food web structures are critical to sustainable food production. A synthesis of empirical and theoretical literature shows the extent to which food production has homogenized and rewired food webs to increase productivity but with negative consequences for stability.},

  abstract     = {Southern Africa has one of the longest records of fossil hominins and harbours the largest human genetic diversity in the world. Yet, despite its relevance for human origins and spread around the globe, the formation and processes of its gene pool in the past are still largely unknown. Here, we present a time transect of genome-wide sequences from nine individuals recovered from a single site in South Africa, Oakhurst Rockshelter. Spanning the whole Holocene, the ancient DNA of these individuals allows us to reconstruct the demographic trajectories of the indigenous San population and their ancestors during the last 10,000 years. We show that, in contrast to most regions around the world, the population history of southernmost Africa was not characterized by several waves of migration, replacement and admixture but by long-lasting genetic continuity from the early Holocene to the end of the Later Stone Age. Although the advent of pastoralism and farming substantially transformed the gene pool in most parts of southern Africa after 1,300 bp, we demonstrate using allele-frequency and identity-by-descent segment-based methods that the ‡Khomani San and Karretjiemense from South Africa still show direct signs of relatedness to the Oakhurst hunter-gatherers, a pattern obscured by recent, extensive non-Southern African admixture. Yet, some southern San in South Africa still preserve this ancient, Pleistocene-derived genetic signature, extending the period of genetic continuity until today. Oakhurst rockshelter in South Africa documents marked cultural change during the Holocene, but genome-wide data from ancient human individuals at the site now demonstrate a remarkable degree of genetic continuity over the last 9,000 years: the contemporary ‡Khomani San and Karretjiemense from South Africa still show direct signs of relatedness to the Oakhurst hunter-gatherers.},

  abstract     = {The eastern branch of the Eastern African Rift System (EARS) is the source of a large proportion of the early hominin fossil record, but it covers a tiny fraction (ca. 1%) of the continent. Here we investigate how this mismatch between where fossils are preserved and where hominins probably lived may influence our ability to understand early hominin evolution, using extant mammals as analogues. We show that the eastern branch of the EARS is not an environmentally representative sample of the full species range for nearly all extant rift-dwelling mammals. Likewise, when we investigate published morphometric datasets for extant cercopithecine primates, evidence from the eastern branch alone fails to capture major portions of continental-scale cercopithecine cranial morphospace. We suggest that extant rift-dwelling species should be used as analogues to place confidence intervals on hominin habitat reconstructions. Furthermore, given the north–south orientation of the eastern branch of the EARS, morphoclines that are not aligned along this major north–south axis are likely to be poorly sampled by sites in the eastern branch. There is a pressing need for research on the geography of early hominin morphoclines to estimate how morphologically representative the hominin fossil sample from the eastern branch may be. The Eastern African Rift System (EARS) is a key location for the hominin fossil record, but the fact that it samples a narrow section of the continent has long been known. The authors tackle this known (but largely unaddressed) bias by sampling the distribution and morphospace of extant mammals in the rift, showing that the eastern branch of the EARS fails to capture the full range of diversity and morphology. This approach could be helpful to place confidence intervals on extinct habitat reconstructions, controlling for spatial bias.},

  abstract     = {Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements commonly found in bacteria. They are known to fuel bacterial evolution through horizontal gene transfer, and recent analyses indicate that they can also promote intragenomic adaptations. However, the role of plasmids as catalysts of bacterial evolution beyond horizontal gene transfer is poorly explored. In this study, we investigated the impact of a widespread conjugative plasmid, pOXA-48, on the evolution of several multidrug-resistant clinical enterobacteria. Combining experimental and within-patient evolution analyses, we unveiled that plasmid pOXA-48 promotes bacterial evolution through the transposition of plasmid-encoded insertion sequence 1 (IS1) elements. Specifically, IS1-mediated gene inactivation expedites the adaptation rate of clinical strains in vitro and fosters within-patient adaptation in the gut microbiota. We deciphered the mechanism underlying the plasmid-mediated surge in IS1 transposition, revealing a negative feedback loop regulated by the genomic copy number of IS1. Given the overrepresentation of IS elements in bacterial plasmids, our findings suggest that plasmid-mediated IS1 transposition represents a crucial mechanism for swift bacterial adaptation. Combining experimental and within-patient evolution analyses, the authors show that the widespread conjugative plasmid pOXA-48 promotes bacterial evolution through the transposition of plasmid-encoded insertion sequence IS1 elements.},

  abstract     = {Mutations can alter the short-term fitness of an organism, as well as the rates and benefits of future mutations. While numerous examples of these evolvability modifiers have been observed in rapidly adapting microbial populations, existing theory struggles to predict when they will be favoured by natural selection. Here we develop a mathematical framework for predicting the fates of genetic variants that modify the rates and benefits of future mutations in linked genomic regions. We derive analytical expressions showing how the fixation probabilities of these variants depend on the size of the population and the diversity of competing mutations. We find that competition between linked mutations can dramatically enhance selection for modifiers that increase the benefits of future mutations, even when they impose a strong direct cost on fitness. However, we also find that modest direct benefits can be sufficient to drive evolutionary dead ends to fixation. Our results suggest that subtle differences in evolvability could play an important role in shaping the long-term success of genetic variants in rapidly evolving microbial populations. Evolvability modifier mutations alter the rates and benefits of future mutations, but it is difficult to predict when they will be favoured by natural selection. A mathematical framework shows that competition between linked mutations can drive strong selection for modifiers and that subtle differences in evolvability can affect the long-term success of mutations.},

  abstract     = {Collective behaviour, social interactions and leadership in animal groups are often driven by individual differences. However, most studies focus on same-species groups, in which individual variation is relatively low. Multispecies groups, however, entail interactions among highly divergent phenotypes, ranging from simple exploitative actions to complex coordinated networks. Here we studied hunting groups of otherwise-solitary Octopus cyanea and multiple fish species, to unravel hidden mechanisms of leadership and associated dynamics in functional nature and complexity, when divergence is maximized. Using three-dimensional field-based tracking and field experiments, we found that these groups exhibit complex functional dynamics and composition-dependent properties. Social influence is hierarchically distributed over multiscale dimensions representing role specializations: fish (particularly goatfish) drive environmental exploration, deciding where, while the octopus decides if, and when, the group moves. Thus, ‘classical leadership’ can be insufficient to describe complex heterogeneous systems, in which leadership instead can be driven by both stimulating and inhibiting movement. Furthermore, group composition altered individual investment and collective action, triggering partner control mechanisms (that is, punching) and benefits for the de facto leader, the octopus. This seemingly non-social invertebrate flexibly adapts to heterospecific actions, showing hallmarks of social competence and cognition. These findings expand our current understanding of what leadership is and what sociality is. Using three-dimensional field-based tracking and field experiments, the authors find that octopus–fish collective hunting groups exhibit complex functional dynamics and composition-dependent properties, in which different members of the group lead on different decisions.},

On the one hand, host-specific mycorrhizal fungi may allow a plant to be competitively dominant by enhancing growth. On the other hand, host-specific mycorrhizal fungi with different functional capabilities may increase nutrient niche partitioning, allowing plant species to coexist. Here, to resolve the balance of these two contradictory forces, we used a controlled greenhouse study to manipulate the presence of two main types of mycorrhizal fungus, ectomycorrhizal fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and used a range of conspecific and heterospecific competitor densities to investigate the role of mycorrhizal fungi in plant competition and coexistence. We find that the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi equalizes fitness differences between plants and stabilizes competition to create conditions for host species coexistence. Our results show how below-ground mutualisms can shift outcomes of plant competition and that a holistic view of plant communities that incorporates their mycorrhizal partners is important in predicting plant community dynamics. A controlled greenhouse study that manipulated the presence of both ectomycorrhizal fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi at a range of conspecific and heterospecific plant competitor densities shows that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi promote plant species coexistence by equalizing fitness differences and stabilizing competition.},

Quotas are a common trade management tool and specify an annual number of individuals to be exported, yet at present there is no global assessment of quota coverage and compliance. Using over 7,000 country–year specific reptile quotas established under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) covering 343 species, we quantify quota coverage, compliance, trade trends pre-quota and post-quota setting and whether quotas likely represent adaptive management. Quotas predominantly concerned live wild-sourced reptiles, with only 6.6% of live non-zero quotas exceeded and 4.5% of zero quotas subverted. For 62.3% of species, quotas were established higher than pre-quota trade, with traded volumes post-quota mainly unchanged or higher than pre-quota establishment, thus potentially facilitating sustainable trade. Over 38% of quota series of species remained at the same level each year, with the longest-running quotas proportionately updated the least, indicating that many quotas do not change adaptively in response to changing threats to species through time. Greater specificity in exactly what quotas cover, justification for unchanged quotas and transparency over quota determination are needed to ensure that high compliance equates to sustainable use. Analysis of more than 7,000 quotas for reptile trade from around the world identifies that few quotas are exceeded, although quotas often exceed pre-quota trade volumes, and that many quotas remain unchanged, with the longest-running quotas proportionately changing the least.},

Using data on 13 trophic groups and 13 ecosystem functions from two large biodiversity experiments—one representing temperate grasslands and the other subtropical forests—we found that plant diversity increases multifunctionality through elevated multitrophic diversity. Across both experiments, the association between multitrophic diversity and multifunctionality was stronger than the relationship between the diversity of individual trophic groups and multifunctionality. Our results also suggest that the role of multitrophic diversity is greater in forests than in grasslands. These findings imply that, to promote sustained ecosystem multifunctionality, conservation planning must consider the diversity of both plants and higher trophic levels. Research on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships tends to focus on single trophic groups. This analysis of two biodiversity experiments, representing forests and grasslands, shows that plant diversity promotes ecosystem multifunctionality not only directly, but also by enhancing the diversity of other trophic levels.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial species can respond to a warming climate in multiple ways, including shifting in space (via latitude or elevation) and time (via phenology). Evidence for such shifts is often assessed independent of other temperature-tracking mechanisms; critically, no study has compared shifts across all three spatiotemporal dimensions. Here we used two continental-scale monitoring databases to estimate trends in the breeding latitude (311 species), elevation (251 species) and phenology (111 species) of North American landbirds over 27 years, with a shared pool of 102 species. We measured the magnitude of shifts and compared them relative to average regional warming (that is, shift ratios). Species shifted poleward (1.1 km per year, mean shift ratio 11%) and to higher elevations (1.2 m per year, mean shift ratio 17%), while also shifting their breeding phenology earlier (0.08 days per year, mean shift ratio 28%). These general trends belied substantial variation among species, with some species shifting faster than climate, whereas others shifted more slowly or in the opposite direction. Across the three dimensions (n = 102), birds cumulatively tracked temperature at 33% of current warming rates, 64% of which was driven by advances in breeding phenology as opposed to geographical shifts. A narrow focus on spatial dimensions of climate tracking may underestimate the responses of birds to climate change; phenological shifts may offer an alternative for birds—and probably other organisms—to conserve their thermal niche in a warming world. Analysis of North American landbirds compares their latitudinal, elevational and phenological responses to climate change.

  abstract     = {Measuring the growth rate of a microorganism is a simple yet profound way to quantify its effect on the world. The absolute growth rate of a microbial population reflects rates of resource assimilation, biomass production and element transformation—some of the many ways in which organisms affect Earth’s ecosystems and climate. Microbial fitness in the environment depends on the ability to reproduce quickly when conditions are favourable and adopt a survival physiology when conditions worsen, which cells coordinate by adjusting their relative growth rate. At the population level, relative growth rate is a sensitive metric of fitness, linking survival and reproduction to the ecology and evolution of populations. Techniques combining omics and stable isotope probing enable sensitive measurements of the growth rates of microbial assemblages and individual taxa in soil. Microbial ecologists can explore how the growth rates of taxa with known traits and evolutionary histories respond to changes in resource availability, environmental conditions and interactions with other organisms. We anticipate that quantitative and scalable data on the growth rates of soil microorganisms, coupled with measurements of biogeochemical fluxes, will allow scientists to test and refine ecological theory and advance process-based models of carbon flux, nutrient uptake and ecosystem productivity. Measurements of in situ microbial growth rates provide insights into the ecology of populations and can be used to quantitatively link microbial diversity to soil biogeochemistry. This Perspective discusses how recent developments in the ability to measure the growth of microbial populations, which provides an indicator of population fitness, can inform ecological and biogeochemical models.},

  abstract     = {Islands have played a prominent role in evolutionary and ecological theory, centring the theoretical framework for understanding biodiversity in terms of isolation and area and providing ‘laboratories’ of evolutionary change and adaptive radiation. However, a similar role for islands in understanding global language diversity has not been established, even though one-sixth of the world’s languages are spoken on islands which account for &amp;lt;1% of the inhabited land area. The striking diversity of island languages remains largely unexplained. We construct a global database which reveals that 10% of the world’s languages are endemic to islands (landmasses &amp;lt;11,000 km2) and we test several key theories of language evolution and diversity. We show that language diversity on islands increases with area but does not show a steady decrease with isolation, nor are island languages at elevated risk of loss. However, number of endemic languages per island increases with both area and isolation. We demonstrate that islands shape language evolution, with fewer phonemes (distinct sounds) in island endemic languages with increasing isolation. Our results suggest that islands generate language diversity by accelerating both language change and diversification. Constructing and exploring a global database, the authors find that 10% of the world’s languages are endemic to islands (a disproportionately large amount) and island area predicts number of languages. However, languages appear not to conform to all predictions of island biogeography theory.},

Here we study the evolutionary genetics of liver by comparing the amphioxus hepatic caecum and the vertebrate liver, as well as examining the functional transition within vertebrates. Using in vivo and in vitro experiments, single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq data and gene knockout experiments, we confirm that the amphioxus hepatic caecum and vertebrate liver are homologous organs and show that the emergence of ohnologues from two rounds of whole-genome duplications greatly contributed to the functional complexity of the vertebrate liver. Two ohnologues, kdr and flt4, play an important role in the development of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. In addition, we found that liver-related functions such as coagulation and bile production evolved in a step-by-step manner, with gene duplicates playing a crucial role. We reconstructed the genetic footprint of the transfer of haem detoxification from the liver to the spleen during vertebrate evolution. Together, these findings challenge the previous hypothesis that organ evolution is primarily driven by regulatory elements, underscoring the importance of gene duplicates in the emergence and diversification of a complex organ. Comparative analysis of single-cell data from the amphioxus hepatic caecum and the liver of several vertebrates shows how genome duplication contributes to cellular diversification and functional complexity of the vertebrate liver.},

  abstract     = {The size–complexity hypothesis is a leading explanation for the evolution of complex life on earth. It predicts that in lineages that have undergone a major transition in organismality, larger numbers of lower-level subunits select for increased division of labour. Current data from multicellular organisms and social insects support a positive correlation between the number of cells and number of cell types and between colony size and the number of castes. However, the implication of these results is unclear, because colony size and number of cells are correlated with other variables which may also influence selection for division of labour, and causality could be in either direction. Here, to resolve this problem, we tested multiple causal hypotheses using data from 794 ant species. We found that larger colony sizes favoured the evolution of increased division of labour, resulting in more worker castes and greater variation in worker size. By contrast, our results did not provide consistent support for alternative hypotheses regarding either queen mating frequency or number of queens per colony explaining variation in division of labour. Overall, our results provide strong support for the size–complexity hypothesis. Using data from 794 ant species, the authors test alternative causal models to explain the evolution of complexity in ant colonies. They find evidence that larger colony sizes favoured the evolution of greater division of labour, providing support for the size–complexity hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Over long spans of geological time, various groups of organisms may wax and wane, experiencing times of apparent success and contraction. These rises and falls are often said to reflect either opportunities created by climate change or the relative success of innovative characteristics. Phylum Brachiopoda was one of the most successful marine clades before the Permian/Triassic mass extinction (PTME), but after this event, they became marginal components of marine communities through to the present day. How brachiopod morphological innovations reacted to swiftly declining diversity has long remained poorly understood. Here we analyse morphological evolution over the 300 Myr (Permian–Quaternary) history of the four major Mesozoic–Cenozoic brachiopod orders (Terebratulida, Rhynchonellida, Spiriferinida, Athyridida). Unexpectedly, their disparities reached or exceeded pre-PTME levels, but were decoupled from generic richness, which was generally low. Distribution of taxa in morphospace and shifts in centroid indicate that all four orders exploited new morphospaces when adapting to post-Permian environments. A comparison of morphospace occupation and diversity evolution suggests that the high extinction rate of brachiopods and the limited diversification of new forms may have accounted for the depauperate nature of modern-day brachiopods. Analysing more than 1,000 genera of four major orders of brachiopods spanning the Permian to the Quaternary, the authors find that despite low levels of taxonomic richness after the Permian/Triassic mass extinction, brachiopods continued to innovate morphologically, indicative of high evolutionary adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Closely related species often use the same genes to adapt to similar environments. However, we know little about why such genes possess increased adaptive potential and whether this is conserved across deeper evolutionary lineages. Adaptation to climate presents a natural laboratory to test these ideas, as even distantly related species must contend with similar stresses. Here, we re-analyse genomic data from thousands of individuals from 25 plant species as diverged as lodgepole pine and Arabidopsis (~300 Myr). We test for genetic repeatability based on within-species associations between allele frequencies in genes and variation in 21 climate variables. Our results demonstrate significant statistical evidence for genetic repeatability across deep time that is not expected under randomness, identifying a suite of 108 gene families (orthogroups) and gene functions that repeatedly drive local adaptation to climate. This set includes many orthogroups with well-known functions in abiotic stress response. Using gene co-expression networks to quantify pleiotropy, we find that orthogroups with stronger evidence for repeatability exhibit greater network centrality and broader expression across tissues (higher pleiotropy), contrary to the ‘cost of complexity’ theory. These gene families may be important in helping wild and crop species cope with future climate change, representing important candidates for future study. Analysis of genomic data from 25 distantly related plant species shows signatures of selection on the same gene families and functions that repeatedly contributed to local adaptation to climate.},

  abstract     = {Sexual reproduction is widespread, but asexual lineages have repeatedly arisen from sexual ancestors across a wide range of eukaryotic taxa. The molecular changes underpinning the switch to asexuality remain elusive, particularly in organisms with haploid sexual systems. Here we explore independent events of loss of sex in the brown alga Scytosiphon, examine the proximate and evolutionary mechanisms involved, and test the importance of sexual conflict on gene expression changes following loss of sex. We find that asexual females (‘Amazons’) lose ability to produce sex pheromone and, consequently, are incapable of attracting males, whereas they gain rapid parthenogenic development from large, unfertilized eggs. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by convergent changes in gene expression. Decay of female functions, rather than relaxation of sexual antagonism, may be a dominant force at play during the emergence of asexuality in haploid sexual systems. Moreover, we show that haploid purifying selection plays a key role in limiting the accumulation of deleterious alleles in Amazons, and we identify an autosomal locus associated with the Amazon phenotype. The sex chromosome, together with this autosomal locus, may underlie the switch to obligate asexuality in the Amazon populations. Analysis of gamete transcriptomes of sexual and asexual individuals of the brown alga Scytosiphon shows decay of female functions but no signature of relaxation of sexual antagonism in the evolution of asexual reproduction in this haploid sexual system.},

  abstract     = {Seabirds play critical roles on islands. By catalysing terrestrial and marine productivity through guano nutrient input, seabirds support natural island functioning. In the Indo-Pacific, atolls comprise one-third of all islands but only ~0.02% of island area. The importance of atolls as seabird nesting grounds has been historically neglected except on a few key atolls. We compiled a global dataset of seabird surveys on atolls and modelled seabird distribution and nutrient deposition on all Indo-Pacific atolls. We found that atolls are breeding sites for 37 species, ranging from a few dozen to more than 3 million individuals per atoll. In total, an estimated 31.2 million seabirds nest on atolls, or ~25% of the tropical seabirds of the world. For 14 species, more than half of their global populations nest on atolls. Seabirds forage more than 10,000–100,000 km² around an atoll and deposit, on average, 65,000 kg N and 11,000 kg P per atoll per year, thus acting as major nutrient pumps within the tropical Indo-Pacific. Our findings reveal the global importance of atolls for tropical seabirds. Given global change, conservation will have to leverage atoll protection and restoration to preserve a relevant fraction of the tropical seabirds of the world. A global model compiling seabird surveys finds that 37 seabird species and around 25% of the world’s tropical seabird individuals nest on atolls, where they act as major nutrient pumps within tropical oceans.},

  abstract     = {Urbanization is creating a new global biome, in which cities and suburbs around the world often resemble each other more than the local natural areas they replaced. But while urbanization can profoundly affect ecology at local scales, we know little about whether it disrupts large-scale ecological patterns. Here we test whether urbanization disrupts a macroecological pattern central to ecological and evolutionary theory: the increase in seed predation intensity from high to low latitudes. Across 14,000 km of latitude spanning the Americas, we compared predation intensity on two species of standardized experimental seeds in urbanized and natural areas. In natural areas, predation on both seed species increased fivefold from high latitudes to the tropics, one of the strongest latitudinal gradients in species interactions documented so far. Surprisingly, latitudinal gradients in predation were equally strong in urbanized areas despite significant habitat modification. Nevertheless, urbanization did affect seed predation. Compared with natural areas, urbanization reduced overall predation and vertebrate predation, did not affect predation by invertebrates in general, and increased predation by ants. Our results show that macroecological patterns in predation intensity can persist in urbanized environments, even as urbanization alters the relative importance of predators and potentially the evolutionary trajectory of urban populations. Seed predation increases from the Arctic to the tropics, but it is unknown whether urbanization disrupts this latitudinal pattern. An experimental study conducted across the Americas shows that the latitudinal gradient in predation holds in urban areas, even though total seed predation is reduced.},

  abstract     = {Shifts in phenology with climate change can lead to asynchrony between interacting species, with cascading impacts on ecosystem services. Previous meta-analyses have produced conflicting results on whether asynchrony has increased in recent decades, but the underlying data have also varied—including in species composition, interaction types and whether studies compared data grouped by trophic level or compared shifts in known interacting species pairs. Here, using updated data from previous studies and a Bayesian phylogenetic model, we found that species have advanced an average of 3.1 days per decade across 1,279 time series across 29 taxonomic classes. We found no evidence that shifts vary by trophic level: shifts were similar when grouped by trophic level, and for species pairs when grouped by their type of interaction—either as paired species known to interact or as randomly paired species. Phenology varied with phylogeny (λ = 0.4), suggesting that uneven sampling of species may affect estimates of phenology and potentially phenological shifts. These results could aid forecasting for well-sampled groups but suggest that climate change has not yet led to widespread increases in phenological asynchrony across interacting species, although substantial biases in current data make forecasting for most groups difficult. Data from 1,279 time series across 29 taxonomic classes analysed with a Bayesian phylogenetic model shows that species phenology has advanced by 3.1 days per decade on average, with the timing of events varying by phylogeny but no evidence of differences in phenological shifts by trophic level.},

Combining remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index data since the 1980s with contemporary field data from 84 grasslands on 6 continents, we show a widening divergence in site-level biomass ranging from +51% to −34% globally. Biomass generally increased in warmer, wetter and species-rich sites with longer growing seasons and declined in species-poor arid areas. Phenological changes were widespread, revealing substantive transitions in grassland seasonal cycling. Grazing, nitrogen deposition and plant invasion were prevalent in some regions but did not predict overall trends. Grasslands are undergoing sizable changes in production, with implications for food security, biodiversity and carbon storage especially in arid regions where declines are accelerating. Remotely sensed NDVI data and contemporary field data from 84 grasslands on 6 continents show increasing divergence in aboveground plant biomass between sites in different bioclimatic regions.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial ecosystem respiration increases exponentially with temperature, constituting a positive feedback loop accelerating global warming. However, the response of ecosystem respiration to temperature strongly depends on water availability, yet where and when the water effects are important, is presently poorly constrained, introducing uncertainties in climate–carbon cycle feedback projections. Here, we disentangle the effects of temperature and precipitation (a proxy for water availability) on ecosystem respiration by analysing eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements across 212 globally distributed sites. We reveal a threshold precipitation function, determined by the balance between precipitation and ecosystem water demand, which separates temperature-limited and water-limited respiration. Respiration is temperature limited for precipitation above that threshold function, whereas in drier areas water limitation reduces the temperature sensitivity of respiration and its positive feedback to global warming. If the trend of expansion of water-limited areas with warming climate over the last decades continues, the positive feedback of ecosystem respiration is likely to be weakened and counteracted by the increasing water limitation. Eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements across 212 globally distributed sites reveal a threshold above which ecosystem respiration is temperature limited and below which it is water limited.},

  abstract     = {Few described archaeal, and fewer bacterial, lineages thrive under salt-saturating conditions, such as solar saltern crystallizers (salinity above 30% w/v). They accumulate molar K+ cytoplasmic concentrations to maintain osmotic balance (‘salt-in’ strategy) and have proteins adaptively enriched in negatively charged acidic amino acids. Here we analysed metagenomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from geothermally influenced hypersaline ecosystems with increasing chaotropicity in the Danakil Depression. Normalized abundances of universal single-copy genes confirmed that haloarchaea and Nanohaloarchaeota encompass 99% of microbial communities in the near-life-limiting conditions of the Western-Canyon Lakes. Danakil metagenome- and metagenome-assembled-genome-inferred proteomes, compared with those of freshwater, seawater and solar saltern ponds up to saturation (6–14–32% salinity), showed that Western-Canyon Lake archaea encode the most acidic proteomes ever observed (median protein isoelectric points ≤4.4). We identified previously undescribed haloarchaeal families as well as an Aenigmatarchaeota family and a bacterial phylum independently adapted to extreme halophily. Despite phylum-level diversity decreasing with increasing salinity–chaotropicity, and unlike in solar salterns, adapted archaea exceedingly diversified in Danakil ecosystems, challenging the notion of decreasing diversity under extreme conditions. Metabolic flexibility to utilize multiple energy and carbon resources generated by local hydrothermalism along feast-and-famine strategies seemingly shapes microbial diversity in these ecosystems near life limits. Metagenome analysis of microbial communities from the Danakil Depression shows that haloarchaea and Nanohaloarchaeota dominate these life-limiting salt-saturated conditions and that these archaea have the most acidic proteomes observed so far.},

  abstract     = {Soil health is expected to be of key importance for plant growth and ecosystem functioning. However, whether soil health is linked to primary productivity across environmental gradients and land-use types remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a pan-European field study including 588 sites from 27 countries to investigate the link between soil health and primary productivity across three major land-use types: woodlands, grasslands and croplands. We found that mean soil health (a composite index based on soil properties, biodiversity and plant disease control) in woodlands was 31.4% higher than in grasslands and 76.1% higher than in croplands. Soil health was positively linked to cropland and grassland productivity at the continental scale, whereas climate best explained woodland productivity. Among microbial diversity indicators, we observed a positive association between the richness of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and primary productivity. Among microbial functional groups, we found that primary productivity in croplands and grasslands was positively related to nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi and negatively related to plant pathogens. Together, our results point to the importance of soil biodiversity and soil health for maintaining primary productivity across contrasting land-use types. Geographic patterns in plant growth are probably influenced by soil abiotic and biotic conditions. Here, the authors assess the relationship of a composite soil health index to primary productivity and the underlying environmental predictors across major land-use types in Europe.},

  abstract     = {Determining the factors that affect community stability is crucial to understanding the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of global warming. We investigated how four temperature components (that is, median, variability, trend and extremes) affected diversity–synchrony–stability relationships for 1,246 bird and 580 fish communities from temperate regions. We hypothesized a stabilizing effect on the community if the variation in species’ response to changing median temperature decreases overall community synchrony (hypothesis H1) and if temperature extremes reduce interspecific synchrony at extreme abundances due to variation in species’ thermal tolerance limits (hypothesis H2). We found support for H1 in fish and for H2 in bird communities. Here we showed that the abiotic components (that is, the median, variability, trend and extremes of temperature) had more indirect effects on community stability, predominantly by affecting the biotic components (that is, diversity, synchrony). Considering various temperature components’ direct as well as indirect impacts on stability for terrestrial versus aquatic communities will improve our mechanistic understanding of biodiversity change in response to global climatic stressors. Four temperature components are shown to have different effects on diversity–synchrony–stability relationships in 1,246 bird communities versus 580 fish communities from temperate regions.},

  abstract     = {Current social-technical and political conditions threaten the integrity of the Amazon biome. Overcoming these lock-ins requires structural transformations away from conventional economies towards ‘socio-bioeconomies’ (SBEs). SBEs are economies based on the sustainable use and restoration of Amazonian ecosystems, as well as Indigenous and rural livelihood systems in the region. They include sustainable eco-tourism as well as diversified production and innovative processing of fruits, nuts, oils, medicines, fish and other products deriving from socio-biodiversity. Using a sustainability transitions perspective, we argue for multi-scalar policy changes to sustain, enhance and scale-out and scale-up SBE initiatives. To nurture niche SBE acitivities, we advocate for improvements in infrastructure, value chains and social organizations. To dismantle structural barriers, we call for an end to harmful subsidies, greater representation of marginalized communities in territorial planning, enhanced rural–urban and intersectoral linkages, international collaboration, shifts in demand, and changes in conservation and production narratives. Policies for SBEs must also use clear definitions, participatory processes and a multi-biome approach to avoid perverse outcomes. Socio-bioeconomies are essential to sustainable use and restoration of ecosystems and to justice and livelihoods for Indigenous and local people. This Perspective details the transformative changes that are needed across multifaceted existing barriers to enable socio-bioeconomies to be scaled out and up across the Amazon.},

  abstract     = {Many attempts to scale conservation actions have failed to deliver their intended benefits, caused unintended harm or later been abandoned, hampering efforts to bend the curve on biodiversity loss. Here we encourage those calling for scaling to pause and reflect on past scaling efforts, which offer valuable lessons: the total impact of an action depends on both its effectiveness and scalability; effectiveness can change depending on scale for multiple reasons; feedback processes can change socio-ecological conditions influencing future adoption; and the drive to scale can incentivize bad practices that undermine long-term outcomes. Cutting across these themes is the recognition that monitoring scaling can enhance evidence-informed adaptive management, reporting and research. We draw on evidence and concepts from disparate fields, explore new linkages between often isolated concepts and suggest strategies for practitioners, policymakers and researchers. Reflecting on these five lessons may help in the scaling of effective conservation actions in responsible ways to meet the triple goals of reversing biodiversity loss, combating climate change and supporting human wellbeing. This Perspective encourages conservation practitioners to learn from past efforts to scale conservation actions in the hope that enhanced understanding of linkages between scaling, effectiveness and social justice will benefit future attempts to scale up, out and deep.},

  abstract     = {Safeguarding biodiversity and human well-being depends on sustaining ecosystems. Two global standards for quantifying ecosystem change, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) and the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting (EA), underpin headline indicators for the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We analyse similarities and differences between the standards to understand their complementary roles in environmental policy and decision-making. The standards share key concepts, definitions of ecosystems and spatial data needs, meaning that similar data can be used in both. Their complementarities stem from their differing purposes and thus how data are analysed and interpreted. Although both record changes in ecosystem extent and condition, the RLE analyses the magnitude of change in terms of risk of ecosystem collapse and biodiversity loss, whereas EA links ecosystem change with the ecosystem’s contributions to people and the economy. We recommend that the RLE and EA should not be treated as unrelated nor undertaken in isolation. Developing them in concert can exploit their complementarities while ensuring consistency in foundational data, in particular ecosystem classifications, maps and condition variables. Finding pathways for co-investment in foundational data, and for knowledge-sharing between people and organizations who undertake RLE assessments and accounting, will improve both processes and outcomes for biodiversity, ecosystems and people. This Perspective discusses how two global standards for quantifying ecosystem change—the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems and UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting—should be used in tandem to optimize their complementarities in assessing ecosystems and to further develop both processes.},

  abstract     = {Evolution in a static laboratory environment often proceeds via large-effect beneficial mutations that may become maladaptive in other environments. Conversely, natural settings require populations to endure environmental fluctuations. A sensible assumption is that the fitness of a lineage in a fluctuating environment is the time average of its fitness over the sequence of static conditions it encounters. However, transitions between conditions may pose entirely new challenges, which could cause deviations from this time average. To test this, we tracked hundreds of thousands of barcoded yeast lineages evolving in static and fluctuating conditions and subsequently isolated 900 mutants for pooled fitness assays in 15 environments. Here we find that fitness in fluctuating environments indeed often deviates from the time average, leading to fitness non-additivity. Moreover, closer examination reveals that fitness in one component of a fluctuating environment is often strongly influenced by the previous component. We show that this environmental memory is especially common for mutants with high variance in fitness across tested environments. We use a simple mathematical model and whole-genome sequencing to propose mechanisms underlying this effect, including lag time evolution and sensing mutations. Our results show that environmental fluctuations impact fitness and suggest that variance in static environments can explain these impacts. A combination of experimental evolution of barcoded yeast lineages evolving in static and fluctuating conditions with math modelling shows that environmental fluctuations have non-additive effects on fitness.},

  abstract     = {Eastern Africa preserves the most complete record of human evolution anywhere in the world but we have little knowledge of how long-term biogeographic dynamics in the region influenced hominin diversity and distributions. Here, we use spatial beta diversity analyses of mammal fossil records from the East African Rift System to reveal long-term biotic homogenization (increasing compositional similarity of faunas) over the last 6 Myr. Late Miocene and Pliocene faunas (~6–3 million years ago (Ma)) were largely composed of endemic species, with the shift towards biotic homogenization after ~3 Ma being driven by the loss of endemic species across functional groups and a growing number of shared grazing species. This major biogeographic transition closely tracks the regional expansion of grass-dominated ecosystems. Although grazers exhibit low beta diversity in open environments of the Early Pleistocene, the high beta diversity of Mio-Pliocene browsers and frugivores occurred in the context of extensive woody vegetation. We identify other key aspects of the Late Cenozoic biogeographic development of eastern Africa, their likely drivers and place the hominin fossil record in this context. Because hominins were undoubtedly influenced by many of the same factors as other eastern African mammals, this provides a new perspective on the links between environmental and human evolutionary histories. Spatial beta diversity analyses of mammalian fossil records from the East African Rift System reveal long-term biotic homogenization over the last six million years, a key time frame and context for human evolution.},

  abstract     = {Dietary specializations in animals lead to adaptations in morphology, anatomy and physiology. Neotropical bats, with their high taxonomic and trophic diversity, offer a unique perspective on diet-driven evolutionary adaptations. Here we assess the metabolic response to different dietary sugars among wild-caught bats. We found that insectivorous bats had a pronounced metabolic response to trehalose, whereas bats with nectar and fruit-based diets showed significantly higher blood glucose levels in response to glucose and sucrose, reaching levels over 750 mg dl−1. The genomic analysis of 22 focal species and two outgroup species identified positive selection for the digestive enzyme trehalase in insect eaters, while sucrase–isomaltase showed selection in lineages with omnivorous and nectar diets. By examining anatomical and cellular features of the small intestine, we discovered that dietary sugar proportion strongly impacted numerous digestive traits, providing valuable insight into the physiological implications of molecular adaptations. Using hybridization chain reaction (HCR) RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, we observed unusually high expression in the glucose transporter gene Slc2a2 in nectar bats, while fruit bats increased levels of Slc5a1 and Slc2a5. Overall, this study highlights the intricate interplay between molecular, morphological and physiological aspects of diet evolution, offering new insights into the mechanisms of dietary diversification and sugar assimilation in mammals. An analysis of Neotropical bats with different diets reveals molecular and physiological mechanisms of dietary diversification and sugar assimilation.},

  abstract     = {Several ecogeographical ‘rules’ have been proposed to explain colour variation at broad spatial and phylogenetic scales but these rarely consider whether colours are based on pigments or structural colours. However, mechanism can have profound effects on the function and evolution of colours. Here, we combine geographic information, climate data and colour mechanism at broad phylogenetic (9,409 species) and spatial scales (global) to determine how transitions between pigmentary and structural colours influence speciation dynamics and range distributions in birds. Among structurally coloured species, we find that rapid dispersal into tropical regions drove the accumulation of iridescent species, whereas the build-up of non-iridescent species in the tropics was driven by a combination of dispersal and faster in situ evolution in the tropics. These results could be explained by pleiotropic links between colouration and dispersal behaviour or ecological factors influencing colonization success. These data elucidate geographic patterns of colouration at a global scale and provide testable hypotheses for future work on birds and other animals with structural colours. Combining geographic information, climate data and colour mechanism at broad phylogenetic and spatial scales, the authors determine how transitions between pigmentary and structural colours influence bird speciation dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) are the largest extant predatory lizards and their ziphodont (serrated, curved and blade-shaped) teeth make them valuable analogues for studying tooth structure, function and comparing with extinct ziphodont taxa, such as theropod dinosaurs. Like other ziphodont reptiles, V. komodoensis teeth possess only a thin coating of enamel that is nevertheless able to cope with the demands of their puncture–pull feeding. Using advanced chemical and structural imaging, we reveal that V. komodoensis teeth possess a unique adaptation for maintaining their cutting edges: orange, iron-enriched coatings on their tooth serrations and tips. Comparisons with other extant varanids and crocodylians revealed that iron sequestration is probably widespread in reptile enamels but it is most striking in V. komodoensis and closely related ziphodont species, suggesting a crucial role in supporting serrated teeth. Unfortunately, fossilization confounds our ability to consistently detect similar iron coatings in fossil teeth, including those of ziphodont dinosaurs. However, unlike V. komodoensis, some theropods possessed specialized enamel along their tooth serrations, resembling the wavy enamel found in herbivorous hadrosaurid dinosaurs. These discoveries illustrate unexpected and disparate specializations for maintaining ziphodont teeth in predatory reptiles. Chemical and structural imaging of Komodo dragon teeth reveals that they maintain their sharp cutting edges through iron-enriched coatings, a unique adaptation compared with theropod dinosaurs (for which they have previously been used as an extant model).},

  abstract     = {The common ancestor of all vertebrates had a highly sophisticated nervous system, but questions remain about the evolution of vertebrate neural cell types. The amphioxus, a chordate that diverged before the origin of vertebrates, can inform vertebrate evolution. Here we develop and analyse a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset from seven amphioxus embryo stages to understand chordate cell type evolution and to study vertebrate neural cell type origins. We identified many new amphioxus cell types, including homologues to the vertebrate hypothalamus and neurohypophysis, rooting the evolutionary origin of these structures. On the basis of ancestor–descendant reconstruction of cell trajectories of the amphioxus and other species, we inferred expression dynamics of transcription factor genes throughout embryogenesis and identified three ancient developmental routes forming chordate neurons. We characterized cell specification at the mechanistic level and generated mutant lines to examine the function of five key transcription factors involved in neural specification. Our results show three developmental origins for the vertebrate nervous system: an anterior FoxQ2-dependent mechanism that is deeply conserved in invertebrates, a less-conserved route leading to more posterior neurons in the vertebrate spinal cord and a mechanism for specifying neuromesoderm progenitors that is restricted to chordates. The evolution of neuromesoderm progenitors may have led to a dramatic shift in posterior neural and mesodermal cell fate decisions and the body elongation process in a stem chordate. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from seven amphioxus embryo stages informs the evolution of chordate cell type evolution and reveals three developmental origins for the vertebrate nervous system.},

  abstract     = {The neural crest is a vertebrate-specific stem cell population that helped drive the origin and evolution of vertebrates. A distinguishing feature of these cells is their multi-germ layer potential, which has parallels to another stem cell population—pluripotent stem cells of the vertebrate blastula. Here, we investigate the evolutionary origins of neural crest potential by comparing neural crest and pluripotency gene regulatory networks of a jawed vertebrate, Xenopus, and a jawless vertebrate, lamprey. We reveal an ancient evolutionary origin of shared regulatory factors in these gene regulatory networks that dates to the last common ancestor of extant vertebrates. Focusing on the key pluripotency factor pou5, we show that a lamprey pou5 orthologue is expressed in animal pole cells but is absent from neural crest. Both lamprey and Xenopus pou5 promote neural crest formation, suggesting that pou5 activity was lost from the neural crest of jawless vertebrates or acquired along the jawed vertebrate stem. Finally, we provide evidence that pou5 acquired novel, neural crest-enhancing activity after evolving from an ancestral pou3-like clade. This work provides evidence that both the neural crest and blastula pluripotency networks arose at the base of the vertebrates and that this may be linked to functional evolution of pou5. Comparison of neural crest and pluripotency gene regulatory networks of Xenopus and lamprey reveals shared regulatory factors in the last common ancestor of extant vertebrates and suggests common molecular features of blastula and neural crest stem cells.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary arms races between cells and viruses drive the rapid diversification of antiviral genes in diverse life forms. Recent discoveries have revealed the existence of immune genes that are shared between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and show molecular and mechanistic similarities in their response to viruses. However, the evolutionary dynamics underlying the conservation and adaptation of these antiviral genes remain mostly unexplored. Here, we show that viperins constitute a highly conserved family of immune genes across diverse prokaryotes and eukaryotes and identify mechanisms by which they diversified in eukaryotes. Our findings indicate that viperins are enriched in Asgard archaea and widely distributed in all major eukaryotic clades, suggesting their presence in the last eukaryotic common ancestor and their acquisition in eukaryotes from an archaeal lineage. We show that viperins maintain their immune function by producing antiviral nucleotide analogues and demonstrate that eukaryotic viperins diversified through serial innovations on the viperin gene, such as the emergence and selection of substrate specificity towards pyrimidine nucleotides, and through partnerships with genes maintained through genetic linkage, notably with nucleotide kinases. These findings unveil biochemical and genomic transitions underlying the adaptation of immune genes shared by prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Our study paves the way for further understanding of the conservation of immunity across domains of life. Systematic analysis of viperin sequences, a family of immune genes that are highly conserved across diverse prokaryotes and eukaryotes, shows that eukaryotic viperins were acquired from archaea and provides information about their evolutionary dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The nature of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), its age and its impact on the Earth system have been the subject of vigorous debate across diverse disciplines, often based on disparate data and methods. Age estimates for LUCA are usually based on the fossil record, varying with every reinterpretation. The nature of LUCA’s metabolism has proven equally contentious, with some attributing all core metabolisms to LUCA, whereas others reconstruct a simpler life form dependent on geochemistry. Here we infer that LUCA lived ~4.2 Ga (4.09–4.33 Ga) through divergence time analysis of pre-LUCA gene duplicates, calibrated using microbial fossils and isotope records under a new cross-bracing implementation. Phylogenetic reconciliation suggests that LUCA had a genome of at least 2.5 Mb (2.49–2.99 Mb), encoding around 2,600 proteins, comparable to modern prokaryotes. Our results suggest LUCA was a prokaryote-grade anaerobic acetogen that possessed an early immune system. Although LUCA is sometimes perceived as living in isolation, we infer LUCA to have been part of an established ecological system. The metabolism of LUCA would have provided a niche for other microbial community members and hydrogen recycling by atmospheric photochemistry could have supported a modestly productive early ecosystem. Integration of phylogenetics, comparative genomics and palaeobiological approaches suggests that the last universal common ancestor lived about 4.2 billion years ago and was a complex prokaryote-grade anaerobic acetogen that was part of an ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {Dissecting plant responses to the environment is key to understanding whether and how plants adapt to anthropogenic climate change. Stomata, plants’ pores for gas exchange, are expected to decrease in density following increased CO2 concentrations, a trend already observed in multiple plant species. However, it is unclear whether such responses are based on genetic changes and evolutionary adaptation. Here we make use of extensive knowledge of 43 genes in the stomatal development pathway and newly generated genome information of 191 Arabidopsis thaliana historical herbarium specimens collected over 193 years to directly link genetic variation with climate change. While we find that the essential transcription factors SPCH, MUTE and FAMA, central to stomatal development, are under strong evolutionary constraints, several regulators of stomatal development show signs of local adaptation in contemporary samples from different geographic regions. We then develop a functional score based on known effects of gene knock-out on stomatal development that recovers a classic pattern of stomatal density decrease over the past centuries, suggesting a genetic component contributing to this change. This approach combining historical genomics with functional experimental knowledge could allow further investigations of how different, even in historical samples unmeasurable, cellular plant phenotypes may have already responded to climate change through adaptive evolution. Exploring genomic data from contemporary and 191 Arabidopsis thaliana herbarium specimens collected over 193 years, the authors identify signs of local adaptation in regulators of stomatal development in contemporary samples from different geographic regions, then use functional scoring to identify a genetic component contributing to this change.},

We found some congruence and some important differences between culturally significant entities priorities and management compared with the colonial focus of threatened species management underpinned by current laws and policies.

  abstract     = {Declining pollinator populations could threaten global food production, especially if current crop yields are limited by insufficient pollinator visitation to flowers, in a phenomenon referred to as ‘pollinator limitation’. Here, we assess the global prevalence of pollinator limitation, explore the risk factors, such as crop type or geographic region, that predict where pollinator limitation is more likely and ask by how much increases in pollinator visitation could improve crop yields. We address these questions using 198,360 plant–pollinator interactions and 2,083 yield measurements from 32 crop species grown in 120 study systems. We find that 28–61% of global crop systems are pollinator limited and that this limitation most frequently occurs in blueberry, coffee and apple crops. For a few datasets, we note that the probability of pollinator limitation decreases with greater forest land cover surrounding a crop field at 1 km, although average effect sizes are small. Finally, we estimate that for those crops we identify as pollinator limited, increasing pollinator visitation at all farms to existing levels observed in the 90th percentile of each study system would close 63% of yield gaps between high- and low-yielding fields. Our findings show variations in sensitivity to pollinator limitation across diverse crop systems and indicate that realistic increases in pollinator visitation could mitigate crop yield shortfalls attributable to pollinator limitation. Measurements of plant–pollinator interactions and crop yields for 32 crops in 120 study systems show that 28–61% of crop systems globally are pollinator limited and that realistic increases in pollinator visitation could close yield gaps.},

  abstract     = {Generalism in resource use is commonly considered a critical driver of population success, species distribution and extinction risk. This idea can be questioned as generalism may be a result rather than the cause of species abundance and range size. We tested these contrasting causal hypotheses focusing on host use in three databases encompassing approximately 44,000 mutualistic (hummingbird–plant), commensalistic (lichen–plant) and parasitic (flea–mammal) interactions in 617 ecological communities across the Americas and Eurasia. Across all interaction types, our analyses indicated that range size and abundance influence the probability of encountering hosts and set the arena for species to express generalism potentials or adapt to new hosts. Hence, our findings support the hypothesis that generalism is a consequence of species ecological success. This highlights the importance of ecological opportunity in driving species characteristics considered key for their survival and conservation. Generalism is often assumed to be a cause of species success. This analysis of mutualistic, commensalistic and parasitic interactions supports the alternative causal hypothesis that generalism is the consequence of ecological success.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is driving a rapid redistribution of life on Earth. Variability in the rates, magnitudes and directions of species’ shifts can alter spatial overlap between predators and prey, with the potential to decouple trophic interactions. Although phenological mismatches between predator requirements and prey availability under climate change are well-established, ‘spatial match–mismatch’ dynamics remain poorly understood. We synthesize global evidence for climate-driven changes in spatial predator–prey overlap resulting from species redistribution across marine and terrestrial domains. We show that spatial mismatches can have vastly different outcomes for predator populations depending on their diet specialization and role within the wider ecosystem. We illustrate ecosystem-level consequences of climate-driven changes in spatial predator–prey overlap, from restructuring food webs to altering socio-ecological interactions. It remains unclear how predator–prey overlap at the landscape scale relates to prey encounter and consumption rates at local scales, or how the spatial reorganization of food webs affects ecosystem function. We identify key research directions necessary to resolve the scale of ecological impacts caused by species redistribution under climate change. This Review synthesizes global evidence on climate-change-driven spatial mismatch between predator and prey species in marine and terrestrial domains. The authors discuss ecosystem-level impacts of changes in predator–prey overlap and identify future research directions to understand the ecological consequences of these changes.},

Although comprehensively investigating these processes in nature is challenging, the infrastructure and data from long-term ecological research networks can support cross-disciplinary investigations. We propose using these networks to advance our understanding of fundamental evolutionary processes and responses to global change. For ecologists, we outline how long-term ecological experiments can be expanded for evolutionary inquiry, and for evolutionary biologists, we illustrate how observed long-term ecological patterns may motivate new evolutionary questions. We advocate for collaborative, multi-site investigations and discuss barriers to conducting evolutionary work at network sites. Ultimately, these networks offer valuable information and opportunities to improve predictions of species’ responses to global change.

The hominin fossil evidence for H. naledi displays a distinctive combination of primitive and derived morphology, yet for a time-averaged fossil sample it is remarkable for its relatively low level of variation. Thus—unusually for palaeoanthropology—there has been little pushback against the decision to recognize a single novel taxon for all of the material recovered from the Rising Star Cave system. However, almost everything else claimed about H. naledi—its age, burial context and behaviour—has been controversial. Here we examine the strength of the evidence for these claims. Ten years after the discovery of Homo naledi, the authors explore the various anatomical and behavioural evidence accumulated for this intriguing species.},

  abstract     = {Humans have moved domestic animals around the globe for thousands of years. These have occasionally established feral populations in nature, often with devastating ecological consequences. To understand how natural selection shapes re-adaptation into the wild, we investigated one of the most successful colonizers in history, the European rabbit. By sequencing the genomes of 297 rabbits across three continents, we show that introduced populations exhibit a mixed wild–domestic ancestry. We show that alleles that increased in frequency during domestication were preferentially selected against in novel natural environments. Interestingly, causative mutations for common domestication traits sometimes segregate at considerable frequencies if associated with less drastic phenotypes (for example, coat colour dilution), whereas mutations that are probably strongly maladaptive in nature are absent. Whereas natural selection largely targeted different genomic regions in each introduced population, some of the strongest signals of parallelism overlap genes associated with neuronal or brain function. This limited parallelism is probably explained by extensive standing genetic variation resulting from domestication together with the complex mixed ancestry of introduced populations. Our findings shed light on the selective and molecular mechanisms that enable domestic animals to re-adapt to the wild and provide important insights for the mitigation and management of invasive populations. Analysis of 297 whole-genome sequences of six introduced European rabbit populations, domestic rabbits and wild rabbits from the native range shows wild and domestic ancestry in introduced rabbit populations and purging of alleles for domesticated traits when rabbits colonized novel natural environments.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of comparative studies, puzzling aspects of the relationship between mammalian brain and body mass continue to defy satisfactory explanation. Here we show that several such aspects arise from routinely fitting log-linear models to the data: the correlated evolution of brain and body mass is in fact log-curvilinear. This simultaneously accounts for several phenomena for which diverse biological explanations have been proposed, notably variability in scaling coefficients across clades, low encephalization in larger species and the so-called taxon-level problem. Our model implies a need to revisit previous findings about relative brain mass. Accounting for the true scaling relationship, we document dramatically varying rates of relative brain mass evolution across the mammalian phylogeny, and we resolve the question of whether there is an overall trend for brain mass to increase through time. We find a trend in only three mammalian orders, which is by far the strongest in primates, setting the stage for the uniquely rapid directional increase ultimately producing the computational powers of the human brain. Analysis of mammalian brain and body mass reveals a curvilinear relationship contrary to assumptions of log-linear power laws. As mammals grow larger, increases in brain mass compared to body mass diminish.},

  abstract     = {According to Mendel’s second law, chromosomes segregate randomly in meiosis. Non-random segregation is primarily known for cases of selfish meiotic drive in females, in which particular alleles bias their own transmission into the oocyte. Here we report a rare example of unselfish meiotic drive for crossover inheritance in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, in which both alleles are co-inherited at all loci across the entire genome. This species produces diploid offspring parthenogenetically via fusion of two haploid nuclei from the same meiosis. This process should cause rapid genotypic degeneration due to loss of heterozygosity, which results if crossover recombination is followed by random (Mendelian) segregation of chromosomes. However, by comparing whole genomes of mothers and daughters, we show that loss of heterozygosity is exceedingly rare, raising the possibility that crossovers are infrequent or absent in O. biroi meiosis. Using a combination of cytology and whole-genome sequencing, we show that crossover recombination is, in fact, common but that loss of heterozygosity is avoided because crossover products are faithfully co-inherited. This results from a programmed violation of Mendel’s law of segregation, such that crossover products segregate together rather than randomly. This discovery highlights an extreme example of cellular ‘memory’ of crossovers, which could be a common yet cryptic feature of chromosomal segregation. This study reports non-random segregation of chromosomes during meiosis in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, but no loss of heterozygosity because crossover products are faithfully co-inherited.},

However, it remains unclear whether the gene expression programme controlling regeneration is evolutionarily conserved. Brittle stars are a species-rich class of echinoderms with outstanding regenerative abilities, but investigations into the genetic bases of regeneration in this group have been hindered by the limited genomic resources. Here we report a chromosome-scale genome assembly for the brittle star Amphiura filiformis. We show that the brittle star genome is the most rearranged among echinoderms sequenced so far, featuring a reorganized Hox cluster reminiscent of the rearrangements observed in sea urchins. In addition, we performed an extensive profiling of gene expression during brittle star adult arm regeneration and identified sequential waves of gene expression governing wound healing, proliferation and differentiation. We conducted comparative transcriptomic analyses with other invertebrate and vertebrate models for appendage regeneration and uncovered hundreds of genes with conserved expression dynamics, particularly during the proliferative phase of regeneration. Our findings emphasize the crucial importance of echinoderms to detect long-range expression conservation between vertebrates and classical invertebrate regeneration model systems. A newly sequenced genome of the brittle star Amphiura filiformis and gene expression profiling of adult arm regeneration reveal genes with conserved expression dynamics across invertebrates and vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Microbial communities are shaped by environmental metabolites, but the principles that govern whether different communities will converge or diverge in any given condition remain unknown, posing fundamental questions about the feasibility of microbiome engineering. Here we studied the longitudinal assembly dynamics of a set of natural microbial communities grown in laboratory conditions of increasing metabolic complexity. We found that different microbial communities tend to become similar to each other when grown in metabolically simple conditions, but they diverge in composition as the metabolic complexity of the environment increases, a phenomenon we refer to as the divergence-complexity effect. A comparative analysis of these communities revealed that this divergence is driven by community diversity and by the assortment of specialist taxa capable of degrading complex metabolites. An ecological model of community dynamics indicates that the hierarchical structure of metabolism itself, where complex molecules are enzymatically degraded into progressively simpler ones that then participate in cross-feeding between community members, is necessary and sufficient to recapitulate our experimental observations. In addition to helping understand the role of the environment in community assembly, the divergence-complexity effect can provide insight into which environments support multiple community states, enabling the search for desired ecosystem functions towards microbiome engineering applications. A longitudinal analysis of microbial community assembly dynamics reveals that communities cultured in metabolically complex media are more different from each other than those cultured in simpler media. Using consumer-resource model simulations, the authors demonstrate that the breakdown of complex metabolites by specialist taxa may promote cross-feeding between community members and allow for the assembly of more diverse communities.},

Here we assess deforestation and poverty outcomes (fiscal income, income inequality, sanitation and literacy) between 2000 and 2010 of strict PAs (SPAs), sustainable-use PAs (SUPAs) and Indigenous territories (ITs) compared with different land uses (agriculture and mining concessions) across ~5,500 census tracts in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. ITs reduced deforestation relative to all alternative land uses (48–83%) but had smaller socio-economic benefits compared with other protection types and land uses (18–36% depending on outcome), indicating that Indigenous communities experience socio-economic trade-offs. By contrast, SUPAs, and potentially SPAs, did not reduce deforestation relative to small-scale agriculture (landholdings &amp;lt;10 ha) but did so relative to larger agricultural landholdings (70–82%). Critically, these reductions in deforestation frequently occurred without negative socio-economic outcomes. By contrast, ITs and SUPAs protected against deforestation from mining, but at the cost of smaller improvements in income and inequality. Our results suggest that although PAs in the Brazilian Legal Amazon substantially reduced deforestation without compromising local socio-economic development, efforts to secure Indigenous rights need additional interventions to ensure these communities are not further disadvantaged. The authors find that protected areas and Indigenous territories in the Brazilian Amazon are highly effective at reducing deforestation driven by agriculture and legal mining concessions, but Indigenous territories typically generate smaller socio-economic benefits than strict and sustainable-use protected areas.},

  abstract     = {Human settlement of islands across the Pacific Ocean was followed by waves of faunal extinctions that occurred so rapidly that their dynamics are difficult to reconstruct in space and time. These extinctions included large, wingless birds called moa that were endemic to New Zealand. Here we reconstructed the range and extinction dynamics of six genetically distinct species of moa across New Zealand at a fine spatiotemporal resolution, using hundreds of thousands of process-explicit simulations of climate–human–moa interactions, which were validated against inferences of occurrence and range contraction from an extensive fossil record. These process-based simulations revealed important interspecific differences in the ecological and demographic attributes of moa and established how these differences influenced likely trajectories of geographic and demographic declines of moa following Polynesian colonization of New Zealand. We show that despite these interspecific differences in extinction dynamics, the spatial patterns of geographic range collapse of moa species were probably similar. It is most likely that the final populations of all moa species persisted in suboptimal habitats in cold, mountainous areas that were generally last and least impacted by people. We find that these refugia for the last populations of moa continue to serve as isolated sanctuaries for New Zealand’s remaining flightless birds, providing fresh insights for conserving endemic species in the face of current and future threats. Reconstructing Holocene range and extinction dynamics of moa (order Dinornithiformes), the authors determine that despite interspecifically different dynamics, spatial patterns of collapse were probably similar. They also find that the likely final refugia for moa were in the same areas and ecological conditions where New Zealand’s remaining flightless birds persist today.},

Turnover and diversity generally increased thereafter, starting ~6,000 to ~1,000 years ago, although the timings, magnitudes and even directions of these changes varied among continents, biomes and sites.

Once-forested parts of the world tended to exhibit biodiversity increases while open areas tended to decline.

Here we evaluated the formal degree of protection of global drylands, their land vertebrate biodiversity and current threats, and projected human-induced land-use changes to drylands under different future climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. Overall, drylands have lower protected-area coverage (12%) compared to non-drylands (21%). Consequently, most dryland vertebrates including many endemic and narrow-ranging species are inadequately protected (0–2% range coverage). Dryland vertebrates are threatened by varied anthropogenic factors—including agricultural and infrastructure development (that is, artificial structures, surfaces, roads and industrial sites). Alarmingly, by 2100 drylands are projected to experience some degree of land conversion in 95–100% of their current natural habitat due to urban, agricultural and alternative energy expansion. This loss of undisturbed dryland regions is expected across different socioeconomic pathways, even under optimistic scenarios characterized by progressive climate policies and moderate socioeconomic trends. Drylands face multiple anthropogenic stressors globally.

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic habitat destruction leads to habitat loss and fragmentation, both of which interact to determine how biodiversity changes at the landscape level. While the detrimental effects of habitat loss are clear, there is a long-standing debate about the role of habitat fragmentation per se. We identify the influence of the total habitat amount lost as a modulator of the relationship between habitat fragmentation and biodiversity. Using a simple metacommunity model characterized by colonization–competition (C–C) trade-offs, we show that the magnitude of habitat loss can induce a unimodal response of biodiversity to habitat fragmentation. When habitat loss is low, habitat fragmentation promotes coexistence by suppressing competitively dominant species, while habitat fragmentation at high levels of habitat loss can shape many smaller isolated patches that drive extinctions of superior competitors. While the C–C trade-off is not the only mechanism for biodiversity maintenance, the modulation of habitat fragmentation effects by habitat loss is probably common. Reanalysis of a globally distributed dataset of fragmented animal and plant metacommunities shows an overall pattern that supports this hypothesis, suggesting a resolution to the debate regarding the relative importance of positive versus negative fragmentation effects. How biodiversity responds to habitat fragmentation per se is debated. Here the authors combine metacommunity simulations with reanalysis of empirical metacommunities to show that the amount of habitat loss modulates the response of biodiversity to fragmentation.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing but poorly tested hypothesis in plant ecology and evolution is that biotic interactions play a more important role in producing and maintaining species diversity in the tropics than in the temperate zone. A core prediction of this hypothesis is that tropical plants deploy a higher diversity of phytochemicals within and across communities because they experience more herbivore pressure than temperate plants. However, simultaneous comparisons of phytochemical diversity and herbivore pressure in plant communities from the tropical to the temperate zone are lacking. Here we provide clear support for this prediction by examining phytochemical diversity and herbivory in 60 tree communities ranging from species-rich tropical rainforests to species-poor subalpine forests. Using a community metabolomics approach, we show that phytochemical diversity is higher within and among tropical tree communities than within and among subtropical and subalpine communities, and that herbivore pressure and specialization are highest in the tropics. Furthermore, we show that the phytochemical similarity of trees has little phylogenetic signal, indicating rapid divergence between closely related species. In sum, we provide several lines of evidence from entire tree communities showing that biotic interactions probably play an increasingly important role in generating and maintaining tree diversity in the lower latitudes.

  abstract     = {Climate change is exacerbating wildfire conditions, but evidence is lacking for global trends in extreme fire activity itself. Here we identify energetically extreme wildfire events by calculating daily clusters of summed fire radiative power using 21 years of satellite data, revealing that the frequency of extreme events (≥99.99th percentile) increased by 2.2-fold from 2003 to 2023, with the last 7 years including the 6 most extreme. Although the total area burned on Earth may be declining, our study highlights that fire behaviour is worsening in several regions—particularly the boreal and temperate conifer biomes—with substantial implications for carbon storage and human exposure to wildfire disasters. Analysis of fire radiative power derived from satellite data finds that the frequency of extreme fire events increased 2.2-fold from 2003 to 2023 and that these increases were mostly driven by extreme fires in temperate conifer and boreal forest biomes.},

  abstract     = {Despite their small individual size, marine prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes can form large 3D structures and complex habitats. These habitats contribute to seafloor heterogeneity, facilitating colonization by animals and protists. They also provide food and refuge for a variety of species and promote novel ecological interactions. Here we illustrate the role of microbes as ecosystem engineers and propose a classification based on five types of habitat: microbial mats, microbial forests, microbial-mineralized habitats, microbial outcrops and microbial nodules. We also describe the metabolic processes of microbial habitat formers and their ecological roles, highlighting current gaps in knowledge. Their biogeography indicates that these habitats are widespread in all oceans and are continuously being discovered across latitudes and depths. These habitats are also expected to expand under future global change owing to their ability to exploit extreme environmental conditions. Given their high ecological relevance and their role in supporting endemic species and high biodiversity levels, microbial habitats should be included in future spatial planning, conservation and management measures. Marine microbes can form habitats for animals and protists to colonize, promoting novel ecological interactions and also providing food and refuge. This Review surveys the ecology and biogeography of marine microbes as ecosystem engineers, and discusses their role in management and conservation.},

  abstract     = {Planetary boundaries represent thresholds in major Earth system processes that are sensitive to human activity and control global-scale habitability and stability. These processes are interconnected such that movement of one planetary boundary process can alter the likelihood of crossing other boundaries. Here we argue that the observed deoxygenation of the Earth’s freshwater and marine ecosystems represents an additional planetary boundary process that is critical to the integrity of Earth’s ecological and social systems, and both regulates and responds to ongoing changes in other planetary boundary processes. Research on the rapid and ongoing deoxygenation of Earth’s aquatic habitats indicates that relevant, critical oxygen thresholds are being approached at rates comparable to other planetary boundary processes. Concerted global monitoring, research and policy efforts are needed to address the challenges brought on by rapid deoxygenation, and the expansion of the planetary boundaries framework to include deoxygenation as a boundary helps to focus those efforts. Deoxygenation is rapidly occurring in marine and freshwater habitats worldwide. This Perspective proposes that deoxygenation should be considered as a planetary boundary, discusses how deoxygenation affects Earth systems and describes interactions with several other described planetary boundaries.},

We argue that registration and registered reports can enhance the quality and impact of ecological research. Drawing on evidence from other fields, chiefly medicine, we support our claim that registration can reduce research waste. However, increasing registration rates, quality and impact will be very slow without coordinated effort of funders, publishers and research institutions. We therefore call on them to facilitate the adoption of registration by providing adequate support. We outline several aspects to be considered when designing a registration system that would best serve the field of ecology. To further inform the development of such a system, we call for more research to identify the causes of low registration rates in ecology. We suggest short- and long-term actions to bolster registration and reduce research waste. This Perspective argues that registration and registered reports are important tools for reducing research waste in ecology, and that this needs to be supported by coordinated efforts by funders, publishers and research institutions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding species distributions is a global priority for mitigating environmental pressures from human activities. Ample studies have identified key environmental (climate and habitat) predictors and the spatial scales at which they influence species distributions. However, regarding human influence, such understandings are largely lacking. Here, to advance knowledge concerning human influence on species distributions, we systematically reviewed species distribution modelling (SDM) articles and assessed current modelling efforts. We searched 12,854 articles and found only 1,429 articles using human predictors within SDMs. Collectively, these studies of &amp;gt;58,000 species used 2,307 unique human predictors, suggesting that in contrast to environmental predictors, there is no ‘rule of thumb’ for human predictor selection in SDMs. The number of human predictors used across studies also varied (usually one to four per study). Moreover, nearly half the articles projecting to future climates held human predictors constant over time, risking false optimism about the effects of human activities compared with climate change. Advances in using human predictors in SDMs are paramount for accurately informing and advancing policy, conservation, management and ecology. We show considerable gaps in including human predictors to understand current and future species distributions in the Anthropocene, opening opportunities for new inquiries. We pose 15 questions to advance ecological theory, methods and real-world applications. A systematic review of 12,854 articles that use species distribution modelling shows that only 1,429 include human predictors as well as environmental ones. Half of those that include human predictors alongside future climate projections keep the human factors constant over time. The article discusses the need for greater inclusion of human predictors to inform policy and management.},

  abstract     = {Personal names are a universal feature of human language, yet few analogues exist in other species. While dolphins and parrots address conspecifics by imitating the calls of the addressee, human names are not imitations of the sounds typically made by the named individual. Labelling objects or individuals without relying on imitation of the sounds made by the referent radically expands the expressive power of language. Thus, if non-imitative name analogues were found in other species, this could have important implications for our understanding of language evolution. Here we present evidence that wild African elephants address one another with individually specific calls, probably without relying on imitation of the receiver. We used machine learning to demonstrate that the receiver of a call could be predicted from the call’s acoustic structure, regardless of how similar the call was to the receiver’s vocalizations. Moreover, elephants differentially responded to playbacks of calls originally addressed to them relative to calls addressed to a different individual. Our findings offer evidence for individual addressing of conspecifics in elephants. They further suggest that, unlike other non-human animals, elephants probably do not rely on imitation of the receiver’s calls to address one another. Machine learning analyses and playback experiments in wild African elephants suggest that individuals address conspecifics with name-like calls that do not rely on imitation of the receiver.},

  abstract     = {Despite deep evolutionary conservation, recombination rates vary greatly across the genome and among individuals, sexes and populations. Yet the impact of this variation on adaptively diverging populations is not well understood. Here we characterized fine-scale recombination landscapes in an adaptively divergent pair of marine and freshwater populations of threespine stickleback from River Tyne, Scotland. Through whole-genome sequencing of large nuclear families, we identified the genomic locations of almost 50,000 crossovers and built recombination maps for marine, freshwater and hybrid individuals at a resolution of 3.8 kb. We used these maps to quantify the factors driving variation in recombination rates. We found strong heterochiasmy between sexes but also differences in recombination rates among ecotypes. Hybrids showed evidence of significant recombination suppression in overall map length and in individual loci. Recombination rates were lower not only within individual marine–freshwater-adaptive loci, but also between loci on the same chromosome, suggesting selection on linked gene ‘cassettes’. Through temporal sampling along a natural hybrid zone, we found that recombinants showed traits associated with reduced fitness. Our results support predictions that divergence in cis-acting recombination modifiers, whose functions are disrupted in hybrids, may play an important role in maintaining differences among adaptively diverging populations. The authors build recombination maps of marine, freshwater and hybrid sticklebacks at a scale of 3.8 kb, examining differences in recombination rates and evolutionary implications in populations undergoing adaptive divergence. They find evidence of recombination suppression in hybrids and reduced fitness of recombinants in a natural hybrid zone.},

  abstract     = {Age and longevity are key parameters for demography and life-history evolution of organisms. In clonal species, a widespread life history among animals, plants, macroalgae and fungi, the sexually produced offspring (genet) grows indeterminately by producing iterative modules, or ramets, and so obscure their age. Here we present a novel molecular clock based on the accumulation of fixed somatic genetic variation that segregates among ramets. Using a stochastic model, we demonstrate that the accumulation of fixed somatic genetic variation will approach linearity after a lag phase, and is determined by the mitotic mutation rate, without direct dependence on asexual generation time. The lag phase decreased with lower stem cell population size, number of founder cells for the formation of new modules, and the ratio of symmetric versus asymmetric cell divisions. We calibrated the somatic genetic clock on cultivated eelgrass Zostera marina genets (4 and 17 years respectively). In a global data set of 20 eelgrass populations, genet ages were up to 1,403 years. The somatic genetic clock is applicable to any multicellular clonal species where the number of founder cells is small, opening novel research avenues to study longevity and, hence, demography and population dynamics of clonal species. This study develops a somatic molecular clock based on the accumulation of fixed somatic genetic variation that segregates among clonally produced organisms and applies it to the eelgrass Zostera marina.},

In collaboration with Indigenous rangers and conservation managers, we generated the Ninu chromosome-level genome assembly (3.66 Gbp) and genome sequences for the extinct Yallara (lesser bilby, Macrotis leucura). We developed and tested a scat single-nucleotide polymorphism panel to inform current and future conservation actions, undertake ecological assessments and improve our understanding of Ninu genetic diversity in managed and wild populations. We also assessed the beneficial impact of translocations in the metapopulation (N = 363 Ninu). Resequenced genomes (temperate Ninu, 6; semi-arid Ninu, 6; and Yallara, 4) revealed two major population crashes during global cooling events for both species and differences in Ninu genes involved in anatomical and metabolic pathways. Despite their 45-year captive history, Ninu have fewer long runs of homozygosity than other larger mammals, which may be attributable to their boom–bust life history. Here we investigated the unique Ninu biology using 12 tissue transcriptomes revealing expression of all 115 conserved eutherian chorioallantoic placentation genes in the uterus, an XY1Y2 sex chromosome system and olfactory receptor gene expansions. Together, we demonstrate the holistic value of genomics in improving key conservation actions, understanding unique biological traits and developing tools for Indigenous rangers to monitor remote wild populations. A chromosome-level genome assembly for the Ninu (greater bilby) and genome sequences for the extinct Yallara (lesser bilby), together with resequenced genomes, shed light on the demographic history of Ninu and inform conservation plans for this culturally and ecologically important marsupial.},

This can occur when niches are estimated considering only currently available climatic conditions, disregarding the fact that climate change can open up portions of the fundamental niche that are currently inaccessible to species. Using a new metric, we estimate the prevalence of potential situations of fundamental niche truncation by measuring whether current ecological niche limits are contiguous to the boundaries of currently available climatic conditions for 24,944 species at the global scale in both terrestrial and marine realms and including animals and plants. We show that 12,172 (~49%) species are showing niche contiguity, particularly those inhabiting tropical ecosystems and the marine realm. Using niche expansion scenarios, we find that 86% of species showing niche contiguity could have a fundamental niche potentially expanding beyond current climatic limits, resulting in lower—yet still alarming—rates of predicted biodiversity loss, particularly within the tropics. Caution is therefore advised when forecasting future distributions of species presenting niche contiguity, particularly towards climatic limits that are predicted to expand in the future. Niche contiguity occurs when only current climatic conditions are used to estimate the niche of a species, ignoring potential niche expansion under climate change. An assessment of 24,944 species shows that nearly half exhibit niche contiguity, which can lead to overestimates of biodiversity loss under climate change.},

  abstract     = {Long-term, large-scale experimental studies provide critical information about how global change influences communities. When environmental changes are severe, they can trigger abrupt transitions from one community type to another leading to a regime shift. From 2014 to 2016, rocky intertidal habitats in the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced extreme temperatures during a multi-year marine heatwave (MHW) and sharp population declines of the keystone predator Pisaster ochraceus due to sea star wasting disease (SSWD). Here we measured the community structure before, during and after the MHW onset and SSWD outbreak in a 15-year succession experiment conducted in a rocky intertidal meta-ecosystem spanning 13 sites on four capes in Oregon and northern California, United States. Kelp abundance declined during the MHW due to extreme temperatures, while gooseneck barnacle and mussel abundances increased due to reduced predation pressure after the loss of Pisaster from SSWD. Using several methods, we detected regime shifts from substrate- or algae-dominated to invertebrate-dominated alternative states at two capes. After water temperatures cooled and Pisaster population densities recovered, community structure differed from pre-disturbance conditions, suggesting low resilience. Consequently, thermal stress and predator loss can result in regime shifts that fundamentally alter community structure even after restoration of baseline conditions. A 15-year experiment at rocky intertidal sites on the northwestern US coast documents kelp, barnacle and mussel abundances before, during and after a multi-year marine heatwave and an outbreak of sea star wasting disease, including changes to communities that did not recover after return to baseline conditions.},

However, microbial inoculants can invade and alter the composition of native microbial communities; thus, a comprehensive analysis is urgently needed to understand the overall impact of microbial inoculants on the biomass, diversity, structure and network complexity of native communities. Here we provide a meta-analysis of 335 studies revealing a positive effect of microbial inoculants on soil microbial biomass. This positive effect was weakened by environmental stress and enhanced by the use of fertilizers and native inoculants. Although microbial inoculants did not alter microbial diversity, they induced major changes in the structure and bacterial composition of soil microbial communities, reducing the complexity of bacterial networks and increasing network stability. Finally, higher initial levels of soil nutrients amplified the positive impact of microbial inoculants on fungal biomass, actinobacterial biomass, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen. Together, our results highlight the positive effects of microbial inoculants on soil microbial biomass, emphasizing the benefits of native inoculants and the important regulatory roles of soil nutrient levels and environmental stress. A meta-analysis of 335 studies reveals that microbial inoculants have overall positive effects on the biomass of soil microbial communities. These effects were weakened by environmental stress and strengthened by the use of fertilizers and native inoculants.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how species loss impacts ecosystem stability is critical given contemporary declines in global biodiversity. Despite decades of research on biodiversity–stability relationships, most studies are performed within a trophic level, overlooking the multitrophic complexity structuring natural communities. Here, in a global analysis of diversity–synchrony–stability (DSS) studies (n = 420), we found that 74% were monotrophic and biased towards terrestrial plant communities, with 91% describing stabilizing effects of asynchrony. Multitrophic studies (26%) were representative of all biomes and showed that synchrony had mixed effects on stability. To explore potential mechanisms, we applied a multitrophic framework adapted from DSS theory to investigate DSS relationships in algae–herbivore assemblages across five long-term tropical and temperate marine system datasets. Both algal and herbivore species diversity reduced within-group synchrony in both systems but had different interactive effects on species synchrony between systems. Herbivore synchrony was positively and negatively influenced by algal diversity in tropical versus temperate systems, respectively, and algal synchrony was positively influenced by herbivore diversity in temperate systems. While herbivore synchrony reduced multitrophic stability in both systems, algal synchrony only reduced stability in tropical systems. These results highlight the complexity of DSS relationships at the multitrophic level and emphasize why more multitrophic assessments are needed to better understand how biodiversity influences community stability in nature. Most diversity–synchrony–stability studies are conducted on a single trophic level. A multitrophic assessment of algae–herbivore assemblages across five long-term tropical and temperate marine system datasets demonstrates the varied and complex nature of diversity–synchrony–stability relationships.},

  abstract     = {Morphological disparity and taxonomic diversity are distinct measures of biodiversity, typically expected to evolve synergistically. However, evidence from mass extinctions indicates that they can be decoupled, and while mass extinctions lead to a drastic loss of diversity, their impact on disparity remains unclear. Here we evaluate the dynamics of morphological disparity and extinction selectivity across the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. We developed an automated approach, termed DeepMorph, for the extraction of morphological features from fossil images using a deep learning model and applied it to a high-resolution temporal dataset encompassing 599 genera across six marine clades. Ammonoids, brachiopods and ostracods experienced a selective loss of complex and ornamented forms, while bivalves, gastropods and conodonts did not experience morphologically selective extinctions. The presence and intensity of morphological selectivity probably reflect the variations in environmental tolerance thresholds among different clades. In clades affected by selective extinctions, the intensity of diversity loss promoted the loss of morphological disparity. Conversely, under non-selective extinctions, the magnitude of diversity loss had a negligible impact on disparity. Our results highlight that the Permian–Triassic mass extinction had heterogeneous morphological selective impacts across clades, offering new insights into how mass extinctions can reshape biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Using a deep learning method that extracts morphological features from images of marine fossils, the authors explore morphological disparity dynamics over a time series of 4 million years, spanning the Permian–Triassic mass extinction event.},

  abstract     = {The driving forces behind the evolution of early metazoans are not well understood, but key insights into their ecology and evolution can be gained through ecological analyses of the in situ, sessile communities of the Avalon assemblage in the Ediacaran (~565 million years ago). Community structure in the Avalon is thought to be underpinned by epifaunal tiering and ecological succession, which we investigate in this study in 18 Avalon communities. Here we found that Avalon communities form four distinctive Community Types irrespective of succession processes, which are instead based on the dominance of morphologically distinct taxa, and that tiering is prevalent in three of these Community Types. Our results are consistent with emergent neutrality, whereby ecologically specialized morphologies evolve as a consequence of neutral (stochastic or reproductive) processes within niches, leading to generalization within the frond-dominated Community Type. Our results provide an ecological signature of the first origination and subsequent loss of disparate morphologies, probably as a consequence of community restructuring in response to ecological innovation. This restructuring led to the survival of non-tiered frondose generalists over tiered specialists, even into the youngest Ediacaran assemblages. Such frondose body plans also survive beyond the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition, perhaps due to the greater resilience afforded to them by their alternative ecological strategies. The authors investigate epifaunal tiering and ecological succession within the oldest preserved animal communities, those of the Ediacaran Avalon assemblage (574–560 Ma), identifying four community types that form irrespective of succession and finding that tiering is prevalent in three community types.},

But as the new field of macrogenetics is demonstrating, if genetic data and their metadata were more accessible and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant, they could be reused for many additional purposes. We discuss the main challenges with existing genetic and genomic data archives, and suggest best practices for archiving genetic and genomic data. Recognizing that this is a longstanding issue due to little formal data management training within the fields of ecology and evolution, we highlight steps that research institutions and publishers could take to improve data archiving.

  abstract     = {Although invasive alien species have long been recognized as a major threat to nature and people, until now there has been no comprehensive global review of the status, trends, drivers, impacts, management and governance challenges of biological invasions. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Thematic Assessment Report on Invasive Alien Species and Their Control (hereafter ‘IPBES invasive alien species assessment’) drew on more than 13,000 scientific publications and reports in 15 languages as well as Indigenous and local knowledge on all taxa, ecosystems and regions across the globe. Therefore, it provides unequivocal evidence of the major and growing threat of invasive alien species alongside ambitious but realistic approaches to manage biological invasions. The extent of the threat and impacts has been recognized by the 143 member states of IPBES who approved the summary for policymakers of this assessment. Here, the authors of the IPBES assessment outline the main findings of the IPBES invasive alien species assessment and highlight the urgency to act now. This Perspective highlights the global consensus on the urgency and growing threat of invasive alien species, and management needs, as found by the 2023 report on invasive alien species conducted by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).},

  abstract     = {Eastern Africa is home to the largest terrestrial migrations on Earth. Though these migratory systems have been well studied for decades, little is known of their antiquity and evolutionary history. Serially sampled strontium stable isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) from tooth enamel can be used to track migration in mammals. Here we analyse 87Sr/86Sr for 79 bovid and equid individuals representing 18 species from four localities in Kenya to characterize prehistoric migratory systems during the Last Glacial Period (115–11.7 ka). Of the species analysed, 16 lack definitive evidence for migration, including blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), Thomson’s gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) and plains zebra (Equus quagga), which are long-distance migrants today in the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem and historically in the Athi-Kapiti Plains. Only two species, the extinct wildebeests Rusingoryx atopocranion and Megalotragus sp., were migratory. These findings suggest a possible alternative narrative about ecosystem dynamics during the Last Glacial Period and shed light on the behaviour of both extant and extinct species at this time. In particular, these results indicate that migratory behaviour in extant species either emerged during the Holocene or was more spatiotemporally constrained in the past. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the structure and function of geologically recent large mammal communities in eastern Africa differed considerably from those observed in the present day. Analysing strontium isotope ratios for individuals of 18 bovid and equid species dating to the Last Glacial Period (115–11.7 ka), the authors find that 16 of these species lack definitive evidence of migration, even those species that are long-distance migrants today.},

  abstract     = {The search for drivers of hominin speciation and extinction has tended to focus on the impact of climate change. Far less attention has been paid to the role of interspecific competition. However, research across vertebrates more broadly has shown that both processes are often correlated with species diversity, suggesting an important role for interspecific competition. Here we ask whether hominin speciation and extinction conform to the expected patterns of negative and positive diversity dependence, respectively. We estimate speciation and extinction rates from fossil occurrence data with preservation variability priors in a validated Bayesian framework and test whether these rates are correlated with species diversity. We supplement these analyses with calculations of speciation rate across a phylogeny, again testing whether these are correlated with diversity. Our results are consistent with clade-wide diversity limits that governed speciation in hominins overall but that were not quite reached by the Australopithecus and Paranthropus subclade before its extinction. Extinction was not correlated with species diversity within the Australopithecus and Paranthropus subclade or within hominins overall; this is concordant with climate playing a greater part in hominin extinction than speciation. By contrast, Homo is characterized by positively diversity-dependent speciation and negatively diversity-dependent extinction—both exceedingly rare patterns across all forms of life. The genus Homo expands the set of reported associations between diversity and macroevolution in vertebrates, underscoring that the relationship between diversity and macroevolution is complex. These results indicate an important, previously underappreciated and comparatively unusual role of biotic interactions in Homo macroevolution, and speciation in particular. The unusual and unexpected patterns of diversity dependence in Homo speciation and extinction may be a consequence of repeated Homo range expansions driven by interspecific competition and made possible by recurrent innovations in ecological strategies. Exploring how hominin macroevolution fits into the general vertebrate macroevolutionary landscape has the potential to offer new perspectives on longstanding questions in vertebrate evolution and shed new light on evolutionary processes within our own lineage. In an analysis of how biotic interactions regulate hominin evolutionary dynamics, the authors show that speciation is negatively related to species diversity in Australopithecus and Paranthropus, in the same way that it is in many other vertebrates, whereas the genus Homo is characterized by positive diversity-dependent speciation and negative diversity-dependent extinction.},

  abstract     = {Vertebrates rely on rod photoreceptors for vision in low-light conditions. The specialized downstream circuit for rod signalling, called the primary rod pathway, is well characterized in mammals, but circuitry for rod signalling in non-mammals is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the mammalian primary rod pathway is conserved in zebrafish, which diverged from extant mammals ~400 million years ago. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two bipolar cell types in zebrafish that are related to mammalian rod bipolar cell (RBCs), the only bipolar type that directly carries rod signals from the outer to the inner retina in the primary rod pathway. By combining electrophysiology, histology and ultrastructural reconstruction of the zebrafish RBCs, we found that, similar to mammalian RBCs, both zebrafish RBC types connect with all rods in their dendritic territory and provide output largely onto amacrine cells. The wiring pattern of the amacrine cells postsynaptic to one RBC type is strikingly similar to that of mammalian RBCs and their amacrine partners, suggesting that the cell types and circuit design of the primary rod pathway emerged before the divergence of teleost fish and mammals. The second RBC type, which forms separate pathways, was either lost in mammals or emerged in fish. Analysis of cell types and circuit design of the primary rod pathway in zebrafish suggests that this specialized downstream circuit for rod signalling has been established before the divergence of teleost fish and mammals.},

  abstract     = {Neural-crest cells and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are multipotent cells that are important for development of vertebrate embryos. In embryos of ascidians, which are the closest invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, several cells located at the border between the neural plate and the epidermal region have neural-crest-like properties; hence, the last common ancestor of ascidians and vertebrates may have had ancestral cells similar to neural-crest cells. However, these ascidian neural-crest-like cells do not produce cells that are commonly of mesodermal origin. Here we showed that a cell population located in the lateral region of the neural plate has properties resembling those of vertebrate neural-crest cells and NMPs. Among them, cells with Tbx6-related expression contribute to muscle near the tip of the tail region and cells with Sox1/2/3 expression give rise to the nerve cord. These observations and cross-species transcriptome comparisons indicate that these cells have properties similar to those of NMPs. Meanwhile, transcription factor genes Dlx.b, Zic-r.b and Snai, which are reminiscent of a gene circuit in vertebrate neural-crest cells, are involved in activation of Tbx6-related.b. Thus, the last common ancestor of ascidians and vertebrates may have had cells with properties of neural-crest cells and NMPs and such ancestral cells may have produced cells commonly of ectodermal and mesodermal origins. This study shows a pluripotent cell population with properties of vertebrate neural-crest cells and neuromesodermal progenitors in ascidian embryos, the closest invertebrate relatives of vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Regulation of gene expression is arguably the main mechanism underlying the phenotypic diversity of tissues within and between species. Here we assembled an extensive transcriptomic dataset covering 8 tissues across 20 bilaterian species and performed analyses using a symmetric phylogeny that allowed the combined and parallel investigation of gene expression evolution between vertebrates and insects. We specifically focused on widely conserved ancestral genes, identifying strong cores of pan-bilaterian tissue-specific genes and even larger groups that diverged to define vertebrate and insect tissues. Systematic inferences of tissue-specificity gains and losses show that nearly half of all ancestral genes have been recruited into tissue-specific transcriptomes. This occurred during both ancient and, especially, recent bilaterian evolution, with several gains being associated with the emergence of unique phenotypes (for example, novel cell types). Such pervasive evolution of tissue specificity was linked to gene duplication coupled with expression specialization of one of the copies, revealing an unappreciated prolonged effect of whole-genome duplications on recent vertebrate evolution. A transcriptomic analysis of 8 tissues across 20 bilaterian species reveals that ancestral gains of tissue-specific gene expression were closely associated with whole-genome duplications in vertebrates and the diversification of ancestral tissue types.},

  abstract     = {Self-incompatibility and recurrent transitions to self-compatibility have shaped the extant mating systems underlying the nonrandom mating critical for speciation in angiosperms. Linkage between self-incompatibility and speciation is illustrated by the shared pollen rejection pathway between self-incompatibility and interspecific unilateral incompatibility (UI) in the Brassicaceae. However, the pollen discrimination system that activates this shared pathway for heterospecific pollen rejection remains unknown. Here we show that Stigma UI3.1, the genetically identified stigma determinant of UI in Arabidopsis lyrata × Arabidopsis arenosa crosses, encodes the S-locus-related glycoprotein 1 (SLR1). Heterologous expression of A. lyrata or Capsella grandiflora SLR1 confers on some Arabidopsis thaliana accessions the ability to discriminate against heterospecific pollen. Acquisition of this ability also requires a functional S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), whose ligand-induced dimerization activates the self-pollen rejection pathway in the stigma. SLR1 interacts with SRK and interferes with SRK homomer formation. We propose a pollen discrimination system based on competition between basal or ligand-induced SLR1–SRK and SRK–SRK complex formation. The resulting SRK homomer levels would be sensed by the common pollen rejection pathway, allowing discrimination among conspecific self- and cross-pollen as well as heterospecific pollen. Our results establish a mechanistic link at the pollen recognition phase between self-incompatibility and interspecific incompatibility. Through genetic and molecular analyses of interspecific stigma–pollen interactions, the authors show that Brassicaceae plants use an integrated pollen discrimination system and a shared pollen rejection pathway to reject conspecific self-pollen and heterospecific pollen. This establishes a mechanistic link between self-incompatibility and speciation in this clade.},

  abstract     = {Many shark populations are in decline around the world, with severe ecological and economic consequences. Fisheries management and marine protected areas (MPAs) have both been heralded as solutions. However, the effectiveness of MPAs alone is questionable, particularly for globally threatened sharks and rays (‘elasmobranchs’), with little known about how fisheries management and MPAs interact to conserve these species. Here we use a dedicated global survey of coral reef elasmobranchs to assess 66 fully protected areas embedded within a range of fisheries management regimes across 36 countries. We show that conservation benefits were primarily for reef-associated sharks, which were twice as abundant in fully protected areas compared with areas open to fishing. Conservation benefits were greatest in large protected areas that incorporate distinct reefs. However, the same benefits were not evident for rays or wide-ranging sharks that are both economically and ecologically important while also threatened with extinction. We show that conservation benefits from fully protected areas are close to doubled when embedded within areas of effective fisheries management, highlighting the importance of a mixed management approach of both effective fisheries management and well-designed fully protected areas to conserve tropical elasmobranch assemblages globally. A survey of sharks and rays on coral reefs within 66 marine protected areas across 36 countries showcases that the conservation benefits of full MPA protection to sharks almost double when accompanied by effective fisheries management.},

  abstract     = {Large pulses of tree mortality have ushered in a major reorganization of Europe’s forest ecosystems. To initiate a robust next generation of trees, the species that are planted today need to be climatically suitable throughout the entire twenty-first century. Here we developed species distribution models for 69 European tree species based on occurrence data from 238,080 plot locations to investigate the option space for current forest management in Europe. We show that the average pool of tree species continuously suitable throughout the century is smaller than that under current and end-of-century climate conditions, creating a tree species bottleneck for current management. If the need for continuous climate suitability throughout the lifespan of a tree planted today is considered, climate change shrinks the tree species pool available to management by between 33% and 49% of its current values (40% and 54% of potential end-of-century values), under moderate (Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6) and severe (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) climate change, respectively. This bottleneck could have strong negative impacts on timber production, carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, as only 3.18, 3.53 and 2.56 species of high potential for providing these functions remain suitable throughout the century on average per square kilometre in Europe. Our results indicate that the option space for silviculture is narrowing substantially because of climate change and that an important adaptation strategy in forestry—creating mixed forests—might be curtailed by widespread losses of climatically suitable tree species. Species distribution modelling for 69 European tree species under current climate conditions and projected conditions to 2100 (in decadal steps) demonstrates that, for climate suitability to be maintained throughout a tree’s lifespan, many fewer tree species are available to forest managers than are currently used.},

  abstract     = {Inland navigation in Europe is proposed to increase in the coming years, being promoted as a low-carbon form of transport. However, we currently lack knowledge on how this would impact biodiversity at large scales and interact with existing stressors. Here we addressed this knowledge gap by analysing fish and macroinvertebrate community time series across large European rivers comprising 19,592 observations from 4,049 sampling sites spanning the past 32 years. We found ship traffic to be associated with biodiversity declines, that is, loss of fish and macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness, diversity and trait richness. Ship traffic was also associated with increases in taxonomic evenness, which, in concert with richness decreases, was attributed to losses in rare taxa. Ship traffic was especially harmful for benthic taxa and those preferring slow flows. These effects often depended on local land use and riparian degradation. In fish, negative impacts of shipping were highest in urban and agricultural landscapes. Regarding navigation infrastructure, the negative impact of channelization on macroinvertebrates was evident only when riparian degradation was also high. Our results demonstrate the risk of increasing inland navigation on freshwater biodiversity. Integrative waterway management accounting for riparian habitats and landscape characteristics could help to mitigate these impacts. An analysis of fish and macroinvertebrate communities in European rivers over 32 years shows that inland ship traffic is associated with declining taxonomic richness, diversity and trait richness and with increased taxonomic evenness.},

  abstract     = {Invasive species are pervasive around the world and have profound impacts on the ecosystem they invade. Invasive species, however, can also have impacts beyond the ecosystem they invade by altering the flow of non-living materials (for example, nutrients or chemicals) or movement of organisms across the boundaries of the invaded ecosystem. Cross-ecosystem interactions via spatial flows are ubiquitous in nature, for example, connecting forests and lakes, grasslands and rivers, and coral reefs and the deep ocean. Yet, we have a limited understanding of the cross-ecosystem impacts invasive species have relative to their local effects. By synthesizing emerging evidence, here we demonstrate the cross-ecosystem impacts of invasive species as a ubiquitous phenomenon that influences biodiversity and ecosystem functioning around the world. We identify three primary ways by which invasive species have cross-ecosystem effects: first, by altering the magnitude of spatial flows across ecosystem boundaries; second, by altering the quality of spatial flows; and third, by introducing novel spatial flows. Ultimately, the strong impacts invasive species can drive across ecosystem boundaries suggests the need for a paradigm shift in how we study and manage invasive species around the world, expanding from a local to a cross-ecosystem perspective. Invasive species may have impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning beyond the ecosystem they directly invade, by altering flows of biotic or abiotic materials. In this Review, the authors synthesize current evidence showing how invasive species have cross-ecosystem effects in three ways: by introducing novel spatial flows between ecosystems, or altering the quality or magnitude of spatial flows.},

  abstract     = {Increasing evidence suggests that urbanization is associated with higher mutation rates, which can affect the health and evolution of organisms that inhabit cities. Elevated pollution levels in urban areas can induce DNA damage, leading to de novo mutations. Studies on mutations induced by urban pollution are most prevalent in humans and microorganisms, whereas studies of non-human eukaryotes are rare, even though increased mutation rates have the potential to affect organisms and their populations in contemporary time. Our Perspective explores how higher mutation rates in urban environments could impact the fitness, ecology and evolution of populations. Most mutations will be neutral or deleterious, and higher mutation rates associated with elevated pollution in urban populations can increase the risk of cancer in humans and potentially other species. We highlight the potential for urban-driven increased deleterious mutational loads in some organisms, which could lead to a decline in population growth of a wide diversity of organisms. Although beneficial mutations are expected to be rare, we argue that higher mutation rates in urban areas could influence adaptive evolution, especially in organisms with short generation times. Finally, we explore avenues for future research to better understand the effects of urban-induced mutations on the fitness, ecology and evolution of city-dwelling organisms. Pollution in urban areas causes higher rates of mutation than in unpolluted areas. This Perspective discusses the effects of these mutations on the health, evolutionary fitness and ecology of urban organisms.},

  abstract     = {The transition from hunting-gathering to agriculture stands as one of the most important dietary revolutions in human history. Yet, due to a scarcity of well-preserved human remains from Pleistocene sites, little is known about the dietary practices of pre-agricultural human groups. Here we present the isotopic evidence of pronounced plant reliance among Late Stone Age hunter-gatherers from North Africa (15,000–13,000 cal BP), predating the advent of agriculture by several millennia. Employing a comprehensive multi-isotopic approach, we conducted zinc (δ66Zn) and strontium (87Sr/86Sr) analysis on dental enamel, bulk carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) and sulfur (δ34S) isotope analysis on dentin and bone collagen, and single amino acid analysis on human and faunal remains from Taforalt (Morocco). Our results unequivocally demonstrate a substantial plant-based component in the diets of these hunter-gatherers. This distinct dietary pattern challenges the prevailing notion of high reliance on animal proteins among pre-agricultural human groups. It also raises intriguing questions surrounding the absence of agricultural development in North Africa during the early Holocene. This study underscores the importance of investigating dietary practices during the transition to agriculture and provides insights into the complexities of human subsistence strategies across different regions. Isotope analysis of human and faunal remains dated to the Later Stone Age reveals a substantial plant-based component to hunter-gatherer diets at the site of Taforalt, several millennia prior to the development of agriculture in the Levant, renewing the question of why agriculture did not develop contemporaneously in North Africa.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial genomes co-evolve with the nuclear genome over evolutionary timescales and are shaped by selection in the female germline. Here we investigate how mismatching between nuclear and mitochondrial ancestry impacts the somatic evolution of the mitochondrial genome in different tissues throughout ageing. We used ultrasensitive duplex sequencing to profile ~2.5 million mitochondrial genomes across five mitochondrial haplotypes and three tissues in young and aged mice, cataloguing ~1.2 million mitochondrial somatic and ultralow-frequency inherited mutations, of which 81,097 are unique. We identify haplotype-specific mutational patterns and several mutational hotspots, including at the light strand origin of replication, which consistently exhibits the highest mutation frequency. We show that rodents exhibit a distinct mitochondrial somatic mutational spectrum compared with primates with a surfeit of reactive oxygen species-associated G &amp;gt; T/C &amp;gt; A mutations, and that somatic mutations in protein-coding genes exhibit signatures of negative selection. Lastly, we identify an extensive enrichment in somatic reversion mutations that ‘re-align’ mito-nuclear ancestry within an organism’s lifespan. Together, our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial genomes are a dynamically evolving subcellular population shaped by somatic mutation and selection throughout organismal lifetimes. Mismatch between the ancestry of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes can drive somatic evolution during ageing. Analysis of around 1.2 million mitochodrial somatic mutations in young and old mice shows haplotype-specific mutational patterns and hotspots, and reversion mutations that re-align mito-nuclear ancestry during an organism’s lifespan.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of multicellular life spurred evolutionary radiations, fundamentally changing many of Earth’s ecosystems. Yet little is known about how early steps in the evolution of multicellularity affect eco-evolutionary dynamics. Through long-term experimental evolution, we observed niche partitioning and the adaptive divergence of two specialized lineages from a single multicellular ancestor. Over 715 daily transfers, snowflake yeast were subjected to selection for rapid growth, followed by selection favouring larger group size. Small and large cluster-forming lineages evolved from a monomorphic ancestor, coexisting for over ~4,300 generations, specializing on divergent aspects of a trade-off between growth rate and survival. Through modelling and experimentation, we demonstrate that coexistence is maintained by a trade-off between organismal size and competitiveness for dissolved oxygen. Taken together, this work shows how the evolution of a new level of biological individuality can rapidly drive adaptive diversification and the expansion of a nascent multicellular niche, one of the most historically impactful emergent properties of this evolutionary transition. Long-term experimental evolution and modelling show the evolution of small and large cluster-forming lineages of snowflake yeast that coexist over generations due to a trade-off between organismal size and competitiveness for dissolved oxygen.},

  abstract     = {An unresolved question in the origin and evolution of life is whether a continuous path from geochemical precursors to the majority of molecules in the biosphere can be reconstructed from modern-day biochemistry. Here we identified a feasible path by simulating the evolution of biosphere-scale metabolism, using only known biochemical reactions and models of primitive coenzymes. We find that purine synthesis constitutes a bottleneck for metabolic expansion, which can be alleviated by non-autocatalytic phosphoryl coupling agents. Early phases of the expansion are enriched with enzymes that are metal dependent and structurally symmetric, supporting models of early biochemical evolution. This expansion trajectory suggests distinct hypotheses regarding the tempo, mode and timing of metabolic pathway evolution, including a late appearance of methane metabolisms and oxygenic photosynthesis consistent with the geochemical record. The concordance between biological and geological analyses suggests that this trajectory provides a plausible evolutionary history for the vast majority of core biochemistry. Constructing a biosphere-scale model of the evolutionary history of metabolism based on &amp;gt;12,000 biochemical reactions, the authors show that a bottleneck in purine synthesis prevents metabolic expansion from geochemical precursors.},

  abstract     = {Horizontal gene transfer, the exchange of genetic material through means other than reproduction, is a fundamental force in prokaryotic genome evolution. Genomic persistence of horizontally transferred genes has been shown to be influenced by both ecological and evolutionary factors. However, there is limited availability of ecological information about species other than the habitats from which they were isolated, which has prevented a deeper exploration of ecological contributions to horizontal gene transfer. Here we focus on transfers detected through comparison of individual gene trees to the species tree, assessing the distribution of gene-exchanging prokaryotes across over a million environmental sequencing samples. By analysing detected horizontal gene transfer events, we show distinct functional profiles for recent versus old events. Although most genes transferred are part of the accessory genome, genes transferred earlier in evolution tend to be more ubiquitous within present-day species. We find that co-occurring, interacting and high-abundance species tend to exchange more genes. Finally, we show that host-associated specialist species are most likely to exchange genes with other host-associated specialist species, whereas species found across different habitats have similar gene exchange rates irrespective of their preferred habitat. Our study covers an unprecedented scale of integrated horizontal gene transfer and environmental information, highlighting broad eco-evolutionary trends. The authors analyse 8,790 prokaryotic pangenomes to identify the ecological variables associated with recent versus old horizontal gene transfer events, finding that gene transfers are more common among co-occurring, highly abundant or host-associated species.},

  abstract     = {Gut microbes shape many aspects of organismal biology, yet how these key bacteria transmit among hosts in natural populations remains poorly understood. Recent work in mammals has emphasized either transmission through social contacts or indirect transmission through environmental contact, but the relative importance of different routes has not been directly assessed. Here we used a novel radio-frequency identification-based tracking system to collect long-term high-resolution data on social relationships, space use and microhabitat in a wild population of mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), while regularly characterizing their gut microbiota with 16S ribosomal RNA profiling. Through probabilistic modelling of the resulting data, we identify positive and statistically distinct signals of social and environmental transmission, captured by social networks and overlap in home ranges, respectively. Strikingly, microorganisms with distinct biological attributes drove these different transmission signals. While the social network effect on microbiota was driven by anaerobic bacteria, the effect of shared space was most influenced by aerotolerant spore-forming bacteria. These findings support the prediction that social contact is important for the transfer of microorganisms with low oxygen tolerance, while those that can tolerate oxygen or form spores may be able to transmit indirectly through the environment. Overall, these results suggest social and environmental transmission routes can spread biologically distinct members of the mammalian gut microbiota. Long-term high-resolution data on social relationships, space use and microhabitat in a wild population of mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), accompanied by sampling of the gut microbiota, show that distinct sets of microorganisms dominate social and environmental transmission routes of microbiota. Microorganisms with low oxygen tolerance are more reliant on social transmission.},

  abstract     = {Most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases stem from viruses that naturally circulate in non-human vertebrates. When these viruses cross over into humans, they can cause disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. While zoonotic host jumps have been extensively studied from an ecological perspective, little attention has gone into characterizing the evolutionary drivers and correlates underlying these events. To address this gap, we harnessed the entirety of publicly available viral genomic data, employing a comprehensive suite of network and phylogenetic analyses to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning recent viral host jumps. Surprisingly, we find that humans are as much a source as a sink for viral spillover events, insofar as we infer more viral host jumps from humans to other animals than from animals to humans. Moreover, we demonstrate heightened evolution in viral lineages that involve putative host jumps. We further observe that the extent of adaptation associated with a host jump is lower for viruses with broader host ranges. Finally, we show that the genomic targets of natural selection associated with host jumps vary across different viral families, with either structural or auxiliary genes being the prime targets of selection. Collectively, our results illuminate some of the evolutionary drivers underlying viral host jumps that may contribute to mitigating viral threats across species boundaries. Analysis of publicly available viral genomes shows that humans may give more viruses to animals than they give to us, and reveals evolutionary mechanisms underpinning viral host jumps.},

  abstract     = {Mosquito transmitted viruses are responsible for an increasing burden of human disease. Despite this, little is known about the diversity and ecology of viruses within individual mosquito hosts. Here, using a meta-transcriptomic approach, we determined the viromes of 2,438 individual mosquitoes (81 species), spanning ~4,000 km along latitudes and longitudes in China. From these data we identified 393 viral species associated with mosquitoes, including 7 (putative) species of arthropod-borne viruses (that is, arboviruses). We identified potential mosquito species and geographic hotspots of viral diversity and arbovirus occurrence, and demonstrated that the composition of individual mosquito viromes was strongly associated with host phylogeny. Our data revealed a large number of viruses shared among mosquito species or genera, enhancing our understanding of the host specificity of insect-associated viruses. We also detected multiple virus species that were widespread throughout the country, perhaps reflecting long-distance mosquito dispersal. Together, these results greatly expand the known mosquito virome, linked viral diversity at the scale of individual insects to that at a country-wide scale, and offered unique insights into the biogeography and diversity of viruses in insect vectors. A meta-transcriptomic analysis of the viromes of 2,438 mosquitoes of 81 species from across China identifies geographic hotspots of mosquito virus diversity, links between mosquito virome composition and host phylogeny, and a suggestion of long-distance mosquito dispersal.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is driving the global redistribution of species. A common assumption is that rapid range shifts occur in tandem with overall stable or positive abundance trends throughout the range and thus these species may be considered as climate change ‘winners’. However, although establishing the link between range shift velocities and population trends is crucial for predicting climate change impacts it has not been empirically tested. Using 2,572 estimates of changes in marine fish abundance spread across the world’s oceans, we show that poleward range shifts are not necessarily associated with positive population trends. Species experiencing high-velocity range shifts seem to experience local population declines irrespective of the position throughout the species range. High range shift velocities of 17 km yr−1 are associated with a 50% decrease in population sizes over a period of 10 yr, which is dramatic compared to the overall stable population trends in non-shifting species. This pattern, however, mostly occurs in populations located in the poleward, colder, portion of the species range. The lack of a positive association between poleward range shift velocities and population trends at the coldest portion of the range contrasts with the view that rapid range shifts safeguard against local population declines. Instead, our work suggests that marine fishes experiencing rapid range shifts could be more vulnerable to climatic change and therefore should be carefully assessed for conservation status. Abundance data for marine fish populations show that those shifting poleward rapidly due to climate change experience substantial population declines, suggesting that rapid range shifts are not sufficient to maintain stable populations.},

  abstract     = {Wildlife must adapt to human presence to survive in the Anthropocene, so it is critical to understand species responses to humans in different contexts. We used camera trapping as a lens to view mammal responses to changes in human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Across 163 species sampled in 102 projects around the world, changes in the amount and timing of animal activity varied widely. Under higher human activity, mammals were less active in undeveloped areas but unexpectedly more active in developed areas while exhibiting greater nocturnality. Carnivores were most sensitive, showing the strongest decreases in activity and greatest increases in nocturnality. Wildlife managers must consider how habituation and uneven sensitivity across species may cause fundamental differences in human–wildlife interactions along gradients of human influence. Analysing camera-trap data of 163 mammal species before and after the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, the authors show that responses to human activity are dependent on the degree to which the landscape is modified by humans, with carnivores being especially sensitive.},

  abstract     = {Vegetation greening has been suggested to be a dominant trend over recent decades, but severe pulses of tree mortality in forests after droughts and heatwaves have also been extensively reported. These observations raise the question of to what extent the observed severe pulses of tree mortality induced by climate could affect overall vegetation greenness across spatial grains and temporal extents. To address this issue, here we analyse three satellite-based datasets of detrended growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIGS) with spatial resolutions ranging from 30 m to 8 km for 1,303 field-documented sites experiencing severe drought- or heat-induced tree-mortality events around the globe. We find that severe tree-mortality events have distinctive but localized imprints on vegetation greenness over annual timescales, which are obscured by broad-scale and long-term greening. Specifically, although anomalies in NDVIGS (ΔNDVI) are negative during tree-mortality years, this reduction diminishes at coarser spatial resolutions (that is, 250 m and 8 km). Notably, tree-mortality-induced reductions in NDVIGS (|ΔNDVI|) at 30-m resolution are negatively related to native plant species richness and forest height, whereas topographic heterogeneity is the major factor affecting ΔNDVI differences across various spatial grain sizes. Over time periods of a decade or longer, greening consistently dominates all spatial resolutions. The findings underscore the fundamental importance of spatio-temporal scales for cohesively understanding the effects of climate change on forest productivity and tree mortality under both gradual and abrupt changes. Using multiple remote-sensing datasets, the authors show that temporal and spatial scale influence the detection of tree-mortality events and explain why there has been a seemingly conflicting pattern of both overall greening but also extensive tree mortality in recent decades.},

  abstract     = {Amazonia’s floodplain system is the largest and most biodiverse on Earth. Although forests are crucial to the ecological integrity of floodplains, our understanding of their species composition and how this may differ from surrounding forest types is still far too limited, particularly as changing inundation regimes begin to reshape floodplain tree communities and the critical ecosystem functions they underpin. Here we address this gap by taking a spatially explicit look at Amazonia-wide patterns of tree-species turnover and ecological specialization of the region’s floodplain forests. We show that the majority of Amazonian tree species can inhabit floodplains, and about a sixth of Amazonian tree diversity is ecologically specialized on floodplains. The degree of specialization in floodplain communities is driven by regional flood patterns, with the most compositionally differentiated floodplain forests located centrally within the fluvial network and contingent on the most extraordinary flood magnitudes regionally. Our results provide a spatially explicit view of ecological specialization of floodplain forest communities and expose the need for whole-basin hydrological integrity to protect the Amazon’s tree diversity and its function. Analysing &amp;gt;1,700 inventory plots from the Amazon Tree Diversity Network, the authors show that the majority of Amazon tree species can occupy floodplains and that patterns of species turnover are closely linked to regional flood patterns.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting the risks of climate change for species and ecosystems is necessary for developing targeted conservation strategies. Previous risk assessments mapped the exposure of the global land surface to changes in climate. However, this procedure is unlikely to robustly identify priority areas for conservation actions because nonlinear physiological responses and colimitation processes ensure that ecological changes will not map perfectly to the forecast climatic changes. Here, we combine ecophysiological growth models of 135,153 vascular plant species and plant growth-form information to transform ambient and future climatologies into phytoclimates, which describe the ability of climates to support the plant growth forms that characterize terrestrial ecosystems. We forecast that 33% to 68% of the global land surface will experience a significant change in phytoclimate by 2070 under representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Phytoclimates without present-day analogue are forecast to emerge on 0.3–2.2% of the land surface and 0.1–1.3% of currently realized phytoclimates are forecast to disappear. Notably, the geographic pattern of change, disappearance and novelty of phytoclimates differs markedly from the pattern of analogous trends in climates detected by previous studies, thereby defining new priorities for conservation actions and highlighting the limits of using untransformed climate change exposure indices in ecological risk assessments. Our findings suggest that a profound transformation of the biosphere is underway and emphasize the need for a timely adaptation of biodiversity management practices. Combining ecophysiological growth models of &amp;gt;135,000 vascular plant species and information on plant growth form, the authors show that 33–68% of the global land surface will experience a significant change in the next 50 years in how climate supports the plant growth forms that define terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Forest biodiversity and ecosystem services are hitherto predominantly quantified in forest interiors, well away from edges. However, these edges also represent a substantial proportion of the global forest cover. Here we quantified plant biodiversity and ecosystem service indicators in 225 plots along forest edge-to-interior transects across Europe. We found strong trade-offs: phylogenetic diversity (evolutionary measure of biodiversity), proportion of forest specialists, decomposition and heatwave buffering increased towards the interior, whereas species richness, nectar production potential, stemwood biomass and tree regeneration decreased. These trade-offs were mainly driven by edge-to-interior structural differences. As fragmentation continues, recognizing the role of forest edges is crucial for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem service considerations into sustainable forest management and policy. In an analysis of forest edge-to-interior transects in Europe, the authors show that different facets of biodiversity and different types of ecosystem service are found in forest interiors versus edges, suggesting that both have a role to play in the provisioning of ecosystem services in landscapes.},

  abstract     = {The expansion of globalized industrial societies is causing global warming, ecosystem degradation, and species and language extinctions worldwide. Mainstream conservation efforts still focus on nature protection strategies to revert this crisis, often overlooking the essential roles of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IP&amp;amp;LC) in protecting biodiversity and ecosystems globally. Here we assess the scientific literature to identify relationships between biodiversity (including ecosystem diversity) and cultural diversity, and investigate how these connections may affect conservation outcomes in tropical lowland South America. Our assessment reveals a network of interactions and feedbacks between biodiversity and diverse IP&amp;amp;LC, suggesting interconnectedness and interdependencies from which multiple benefits to nature and societies emerge. We illustrate our findings with five case studies of successful conservation models, described as consolidated or promising ‘social–ecological hope spots’, that show how engagement with IP&amp;amp;LC of various cultures may be the best hope for biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, particularly when aligned with science and technology. In light of these five inspiring cases, we argue that conservation science and policies need to recognize that protecting and promoting both biological and cultural diversities can provide additional co-benefits and solutions to maintain ecosystems resilient in the face of global changes. This Review identifies and describes interactions and feedbacks between biodiversity and diversity of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities, and uses case studies from South America to illustrate the conservation and human benefits that can arise from protecting both biological and cultural diversity.},

  abstract     = {Deep-time protein preservation has attracted increasing interest and rapid research activity within the palaeobiological community in recent years, but there are several different viewpoints without a cohesive framework for the interpretation of these proteins. Therefore, despite this activity, crucial gaps exist in the understanding of how proteins are preserved in the geological record and we believe it is vital to arrive at a synthesis of the various taphonomic pathways in order to proceed forward with their elucidation. Here we take a critical look at the state of knowledge regarding deep-time protein preservation and argue for the necessity of a more nuanced approach to understanding the molecular taphonomy of proteins through the lens of diagenetic pathways. We also propound an initial framework with which to comprehend the chemical changes undergone by proteins via the concept of ‘proteagen’. In this Perspective, the authors discuss current knowledge of deep-time protein preservation and how the chemical changes undergone by proteins affect taphonomic and palaeoproteomic analyses.},

  abstract     = {Soqotra, an island situated at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden in the northwest Indian Ocean between Africa and Arabia, is home to ~60,000 people subsisting through fishing and semi-nomadic pastoralism who speak a Modern South Arabian language. Most of what is known about Soqotri history derives from writings of foreign travellers who provided little detail about local people, and the geographic origins and genetic affinities of early Soqotri people has not yet been investigated directly. Here we report genome-wide data from 39 individuals who lived between ~650 and 1750 ce at six locations across the island and document strong genetic connections between Soqotra and the similarly isolated Hadramawt region of coastal South Arabia that likely reflects a source for the peopling of Soqotra. Medieval Soqotri can be modelled as deriving ~86% of their ancestry from a population such as that found in the Hadramawt today, with the remaining ~14% best proxied by an Iranian-related source with up to 2% ancestry from the Indian sub-continent, possibly reflecting genetic exchanges that occurred along with archaeologically documented trade from these regions. In contrast to all other genotyped populations of the Arabian Peninsula, genome-level analysis of the medieval Soqotri is consistent with no sub-Saharan African admixture dating to the Holocene. The deep ancestry of people from medieval Soqotra and the Hadramawt is also unique in deriving less from early Holocene Levantine farmers and more from groups such as Late Pleistocene hunter–gatherers from the Levant (Natufians) than other mainland Arabians. This attests to migrations by early farmers having less impact in southernmost Arabia and Soqotra and provides compelling evidence that there has not been complete population replacement between the Pleistocene and Holocene throughout the Arabian Peninsula. Medieval Soqotra harboured a small population that showed qualitatively different marriage practices from modern Soqotri, with first-cousin unions occurring significantly less frequently than today. Ancient DNA from Soqotra, an island off the coast of Yemen, evidences a population history differing from other areas of the Arabian Peninsula and suggests there has not been complete population replacement throughout the region between the Pleistocene and Holocene.},

  abstract     = {Behavioural innovations can provide key advantages for animals in the wild, especially when ecological conditions change rapidly and unexpectedly. Innovation rates can be compared across taxa by compiling field reports of novel behaviours. Large-scale analyses have shown that innovativeness reduces extinction risk, increases colonization success and is associated with increased brain size and pallial neuron numbers. However, appropriate laboratory measurements of innovativeness, necessary to conduct targeted experimental studies, have not been clearly established, despite decades of speculation on the most suitable assay. Here we implemented a battery of cognitive tasks on 203 birds of 15 passerine species and tested for relationships at the interspecific and intraspecific levels with ecological metrics of innovation and brain size. We found that species better at solving extractive foraging problems had higher technical innovation rates in the wild and larger brains. By contrast, performance on other cognitive tasks often subsumed under the term behavioural flexibility, namely, associative and reversal learning, as well as self-control, were not related to problem-solving, innovation in the wild or brain size. Our study yields robust support for problem-solving as an accurate experimental proxy of innovation and suggests that novel motor solutions are more important than self-control or learning of modified cues in generating technical innovations in the wild. Behavioural innovation provides a key adaptive advantage to wild populations, but it is unclear which experimental assay is the best predictor for innovation. The authors administered a battery of cognitive tests to 15 passerine species to show that performance in problem-solving tasks is most closely associated with innovations in the wild.},

  abstract     = {Variation in the size and number of axial segments underlies much of the diversity in animal body plans. Here we investigate the evolutionary, genetic and developmental mechanisms driving tail-length differences between forest and prairie ecotypes of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). We first show that long-tailed forest mice perform better in an arboreal locomotion assay, consistent with tails being important for balance during climbing. We then identify six genomic regions that contribute to differences in tail length, three of which associate with caudal vertebra length and the other three with vertebra number. For all six loci, the forest allele increases tail length, indicative of the cumulative effect of natural selection. Two of the genomic regions associated with variation in vertebra number contain Hox gene clusters. Of those, we find an allele-specific decrease in Hoxd13 expression in the embryonic tail bud of long-tailed forest mice, consistent with its role in axial elongation. Additionally, we find that forest embryos have more presomitic mesoderm than prairie embryos and that this correlates with an increase in the number of neuromesodermal progenitors, which are modulated by Hox13 paralogues. Together, these results suggest a role for Hoxd13 in the development of natural variation in adaptive morphology on a microevolutionary timescale. Forest ecotypes of deer mice have longer tails than prairie ecotypes. This study shows that this difference is adaptive and involves changes in six genomic regions, one of which is an allele-specific reduction in Hoxd13 expression that leads to tail elongation.},

One-tenth of all described species on Earth are butterflies and moths, the Lepidoptera, which generally possess 31 chromosomes. However, some species display dramatic variation in chromosome number. Here we analyse 210 chromosomally complete lepidopteran genomes and show that the chromosomes of extant lepidopterans are derived from 32 ancestral linkage groups, which we term Merian elements. Merian elements have remained largely intact through 250 million years of evolution and diversification. Against this stable background, eight lineages have undergone extensive reorganization either through numerous fissions or a combination of fusion and fission events. Outside these lineages, fusions are rare and fissions are rarer still. Fusions often involve small, repeat-rich Merian elements and the sex-linked element. Our results reveal the constraints on genome architecture in Lepidoptera and provide a deeper understanding of chromosomal rearrangements in eukaryotic genome evolution. Analysis of 210 lepidopteran chromosome-level genomes reveals stability of the 32 ancestral chromosomes and extensive reorganization, including fusion and fission events, in eight lineages over 250 million years of evolution.},

  abstract     = {Shared genetic polymorphisms between populations and species can be ascribed to ancestral variation or to more recent gene flow. Here, we mapped shared polymorphisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sister species Saccharomyces paradoxus, which diverged 4–6 million years ago. We used a dense map of single-nucleotide diagnostic markers (mean distance 15.6 base pairs) in 1,673 sequenced S. cerevisiae isolates to catalogue 3,852 sequence blocks (≥5 consecutive markers) introgressed from S. paradoxus, with most being recent and clade-specific. The highly diverged wild Chinese S. cerevisiae lineages were depleted of introgressed blocks but retained an excess of individual ancestral polymorphisms derived from incomplete lineage sorting, perhaps due to less dramatic population bottlenecks. In the non-Chinese S. cerevisiae lineages, we inferred major hybridization events and detected cases of overlapping introgressed blocks across distinct clades due to either shared histories or convergent evolution. We experimentally engineered, in otherwise isogenic backgrounds, the introgressed PAD1-FDC1 gene pair that independently arose in two S. cerevisiae clades and revealed that it increases resistance against diverse antifungal drugs. Overall, our study retraces the histories of divergence and secondary contacts across S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus populations and unveils a functional outcome. Analysis of 1,673 sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates identifies 3,852 sequence blocks introgressed from Saccharomyces paradoxus, most of which are recent and clade-specific. By contrast, divergent Chinese strains of S. cerevisiae show little evidence of introgression but do share ancient polymorphisms with S. paradoxus due to incomplete lineage sorting.},

  abstract     = {Intensive agriculture with high reliance on pesticides and fertilizers constitutes a major strategy for ‘feeding the world’. However, such conventional intensification is linked to diminishing returns and can result in ‘intensification traps’—production declines triggered by the negative feedback of biodiversity loss at high input levels. Here we developed a novel framework that accounts for biodiversity feedback on crop yields to evaluate the risk and magnitude of intensification traps. Simulations grounded in systematic literature reviews showed that intensification traps emerge in most landscape types, but to a lesser extent in major cereal production systems. Furthermore, small reductions in maximal production (5–10%) could be frequently transmitted into substantial biodiversity gains, resulting in small-loss large-gain trade-offs prevailing across landscape types. However, sensitivity analyses revealed a strong context dependence of trap emergence, inducing substantial uncertainty in the identification of optimal management at the field scale. Hence, we recommend the development of case-specific safety margins for intensification preventing double losses in biodiversity and food security associated with intensification traps. Conventional agricultural intensification can lead to ‘traps’ where production actually declines because of biodiversity loss. By integrating case study archetypes, literature review and simulations, the authors show what systems are at risk of traps and how these risks can be limited.},

  abstract     = {Climate change and habitat loss present serious threats to nature. Yet, due to a lack of historical land-use data, the potential for land-use change and baseline land-use conditions to interact with a changing climate to affect biodiversity remains largely unknown. Here, we use historical land use, climate data and species observation data to investigate the patterns and causes of biodiversity change in Great Britain. We show that anthropogenic climate change and land conversion have broadly led to increased richness, biotic homogenization and warmer-adapted communities of British birds, butterflies and plants over the long term (50+ years) and short term (20 years). Biodiversity change was found to be largely determined by baseline environmental conditions of land use and climate, especially over shorter timescales, suggesting that biodiversity change in recent periods could reflect an inertia derived from past environmental changes. Climate–land-use interactions were mostly related to long-term change in species richness and beta diversity across taxa. Semi-natural grasslands (in a broad sense, including meadows, pastures, lowland and upland heathlands and open wetlands) were associated with lower rates of biodiversity change, while their contribution to national-level biodiversity doubled over the long term. Our findings highlight the need to protect and restore natural and semi-natural habitats, alongside a fuller consideration of individual species’ requirements beyond simple measures of species richness in biodiversity management and policy. Analysing changes in observations of birds, butterflies and plants in Great Britain over more than 50 years, the authors show that climate change and land conversion have led to increases in richness, biotic homogenization and warmer-adapted communities over both the long and short terms.},

  abstract     = {Lengthy debate has surrounded the theoretical and empirical science of whether climatic niche evolution is related to increased or decreased rates of biological diversification. Because species can persist for thousands to millions of years, these questions cross broad scales of time and space. Thus, short-term experiments may not provide comprehensive understanding of the system, leading to the emergence of contrasting opinions: niche evolution may increase diversity by allowing species to explore and colonize new geographic areas across which they could speciate; or, niche conservatism might augment biodiversity by supporting isolation of populations that may then undergo allopatric speciation. Here, we use a simulation approach to test how biological diversification responds to different rates and modes of niche evolution. We find that niche conservatism promotes biological diversification, whereas labile niches—whether adapting to the conditions available or changing randomly—generally led to slower diversification rates. These novel results provide a framework for understanding how Earth–life interactions produced such a diverse biota. The authors use a simulation framework to assess how the dynamics of species’ diversification changed with ecological niche shifts under historical climate conditions. Modelling scenarios with niche conservatism resulted in higher rates of net diversification, recapitulating empirical biodiversity patterns.},

  abstract     = {Viruses are crucial in shaping soil microbial functions and ecosystems. However, studies on soil viromes have been limited in both spatial scale and biome coverage. Here we present a comprehensive synthesis of soil virome biogeographic patterns using the Global Soil Virome dataset (GSV) wherein we analysed 1,824 soil metagenomes worldwide, uncovering 80,750 partial genomes of DNA viruses, 96.7% of which are taxonomically unassigned. The biogeography of soil viral diversity and community structure varies across different biomes. Interestingly, the diversity of viruses does not align with microbial diversity and contrasts with it by showing low diversity in forest and shrubland soils. Soil texture and moisture conditions are further corroborated as key factors affecting diversity by our predicted soil viral diversity atlas, revealing higher diversity in humid and subhumid regions. In addition, the binomial degree distribution pattern suggests a random co-occurrence pattern of soil viruses. These findings are essential for elucidating soil viral ecology and for the comprehensive incorporation of viruses into soil ecosystem models. Analysing biogeographic patterns in soil viromes based on 1,824 soil metagenomes from sites around the world, the authors show that viral diversity rarely corresponds to overall microbial diversity, with soil texture and moisture being closely associated with viral diversity.},

  abstract     = {Megafauna (animals ≥45 kg) have probably shaped the Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years with pronounced impacts on biogeochemistry, vegetation, ecological communities and evolutionary processes. However, a quantitative global synthesis on the generality of megafauna effects on ecosystems is lacking. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of 297 studies and 5,990 individual observations across six continents to determine how wild herbivorous megafauna influence ecosystem structure, ecological processes and spatial heterogeneity, and whether these impacts depend on body size and environmental factors. Despite large variability in megafauna effects, we show that megafauna significantly alter soil nutrient availability, promote open vegetation structure and reduce the abundance of smaller animals. Other responses (14 out of 26), including, for example, soil carbon, were not significantly affected. Further, megafauna significantly increase ecosystem heterogeneity by affecting spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure and the abundance and diversity of smaller animals. Given that spatial heterogeneity is considered an important driver of biodiversity across taxonomic groups and scales, these results support the hypothesis that megafauna may promote biodiversity at large scales. Megafauna declined precipitously in diversity and abundance since the late Pleistocene, and our results indicate that their restoration would substantially influence Earth’s terrestrial ecosystems. A meta-analysis synthesizes the range of effects of megafauna on ecosystems, finding that megafauna significantly increase ecosystem heterogeneity and impact a wide range of ecosystem properties by altering soil nutrient availability, promoting open vegetation structure and reducing the abundance of smaller animals.},

  abstract     = {The ongoing climate change is triggering plant community thermophilization. This selection process ought to shift community composition towards species adapted to warmer climates but may also lead to biotic homogenization. The link between thermophilization and homogenization and the community dynamics that drive them (colonization and extinction) remain unknown but is critical for understanding community responses under rapid environmental change. We used 14,167 pairs of plots to study shifts in plant community during 10 years of rising temperature in 80 forest ecoregions of France. We computed community mean thermal optimum (thermophilization) and Δβ-diversity (homogenization) for each ecoregion and partitioned these changes into extinction and colonization dynamics of cold- and warm-adapted species. Forest understorey communities thermophilized on average by 0.12 °C per decade and up to 0.20 °C per decade in warm ecoregions. This rate was entirely driven by extinction dynamics. Extinction of cold-adapted species was a driver of homogenization but it was compensated for by the colonization of rare species and the extinction of common species, resulting in the absence of an apparent homogenization trend. Here we show a dieback of present cold-adapted species rather than an adaptation of communities via the arrival of warm-adapted species, with a mutually cancelling effect on β-diversity. These results suggest that a future loss of biodiversity and delayed biotic homogenization should be considered. Analysing &amp;gt;14,000 pairs of plots over 10 years, the authors show that forest understorey plant communities increase their average temperature affiliations by 0.1 °C each decade. This increase was caused by the extinction of cold-adapted species, but with no visible effect on community heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Populations and species are threatened by human pressure, but their fate is variable. Some depleted populations, such as that of the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), recover rapidly even when the surviving population was small. The northern elephant seal was hunted extensively and taken by collectors between the early 1800s and 1892, suffering an extreme population bottleneck as a consequence. Recovery was rapid and now there are over 200,000 individuals. We sequenced 260 modern and 8 historical northern elephant seal nuclear genomes to assess the impact of the population bottleneck on individual northern elephant seals and to better understand their recovery. Here we show that inbreeding, an increase in the frequency of alleles compromised by lost function, and allele frequency distortion, reduced the fitness of breeding males and females, as well as the performance of adult females on foraging migrations. We provide a detailed investigation of the impact of a severe bottleneck on fitness at the genomic level and report on the role of specific gene systems. Genome analysis of modern and historical elephant seals reveals impacts of a severe bottleneck on the genomes and fitness of individual seals, and the implications for recovery.},

  abstract     = {Habitat associations underpin species ecologies in high-diversity systems. Within tropical, shallow water coral reefs, the relationship between fishes and corals is arguably the most iconic and highly scrutinized. A strong relationship between fishes and reef-building hard corals is often assumed, a belief supported by studies that document the decline of reef fishes following coral loss. However, the extent of this relationship is often unclear, as evidenced by conflicting reports. Here we assess the strength of this ecological association by relying on literature that has surveyed both fishes and corals synchronously. We quantitatively synthesize 723 bivariate correlation coefficients (from 66 papers), published over 38 years, that relate fish metrics (abundance, biomass and species richness) with the percentage of hard coral cover. Remarkably, despite extensive variation, the pattern of association on a global scale reveals a predominantly positive, albeit weak (|r| &amp;lt; 0.4), correlation. Even for commonly hypothesized drivers of fish–coral associations, fish family and trophic group, associations were consistently weak. These findings question our assumptions regarding the strength and ubiquity of fish–coral associations, and caution against assuming a direct and omnipresent relationship between these two iconic animal groups. A meta-analysis of papers that relate reef fish abundance, biomass or species richness to proportion of living hard coral cover finds correlations that are predominantly positive but consistently weak.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is altering the functioning of foundational ecosystems. While the direct effects of warming are expected to influence individual species, the indirect effects of warming on species interactions remain poorly understood. In marine systems, as tropical herbivores undergo poleward range expansion, they may change food web structure and alter the functioning of key habitats. While this process (‘tropicalization’) has been documented within declining kelp forests, we have a limited understanding of how this process might unfold across other systems. Here we use a network of sites spanning 23° of latitude to explore the effects of increased herbivory (simulated via leaf clipping) on the structure of a foundational marine plant (turtlegrass). By working across its geographic range, we also show how gradients in light, temperature and nutrients modified plant responses. We found that turtlegrass near its northern boundary was increasingly affected (reduced productivity) by herbivory and that this response was driven by latitudinal gradients in light (low insolation at high latitudes). By contrast, low-latitude meadows tolerated herbivory due to high insolation which enhanced plant carbohydrates. We show that as herbivores undergo range expansion, turtlegrass meadows at their northern limit display reduced resilience and may be under threat of ecological collapse. Conducting a simulated turtlegrass herbivory experiment across 650 experimental plots and 13 seagrass meadows, the authors show that the negative effects of herbivory increase with latitude, driven by low levels of light insolation at high latitudes.},

In this study, we describe the diversity and preservation of the Cabrières Biota, a newly discovered Early Ordovician Lagerstätte from Montagne Noire, southern France. The Cabrières Biota showcases a diverse polar assemblage of both biomineralized and soft-bodied organisms predominantly preserved in iron oxides. Echinoderms are extremely scarce, while sponges and algae are abundantly represented. Non-biomineralized arthropod fragments are also preserved, along with faunal elements reminiscent of Cambrian Burgess Shale-type ecosystems, such as armoured lobopodians. The taxonomic diversity observed in the Cabrières Biota mixes Early Ordovician Lagerstätten taxa with Cambrian forms. By potentially being the closest Lagerstätte to the South Pole, the Cabrières Biota probably served as a biotic refuge amid the high-water temperatures of the Early Ordovician, and shows comparable ecological structuring to modern polar communities.

  abstract     = {Mammalian herbivores browse palatable plants of ecological and economical value. Undesirable neighbours can reduce browsing to these plants by providing ‘associational refuge’, but they can also compete for resources. Here we recreated the informative odour emitted by undesirable plants. We then tested whether this odour could act as virtual neighbours, providing browsing refuge to palatable eucalyptus tree seedlings. We found that protection using this method was equivalent to protection provided by real plants. Palatable seedlings were 17–20 times more likely to be eaten by herbivores without virtual, or real, neighbours. Because many herbivores use plant odour to forage, virtual neighbours could provide a useful practical management approach to help protect valued plants. Unpalatable plants can deter herbivory on palatable plants grown in the same vicinity, but managing unwanted herbivory by planting unpalatable plants is not time- or cost-effective. This paper shows that artificial odour, designed to mimic the informative volatile compounds of unpalatable plants, can deter herbivory on the target plants, offering a potentially useful management strategy},

  abstract     = {Understanding how diversity evolves and is maintained is critical to predicting the future trajectories of ecosystems under climate change; however, our understanding of these processes is limited in marine systems. Corals, which engineer reef ecosystems, are critically threatened by climate change, and global efforts are underway to conserve and restore populations as attempts to mitigate ocean warming continue. Recently, sequencing efforts have uncovered widespread undescribed coral diversity, including ‘cryptic lineages’—genetically distinct but morphologically similar coral taxa. Such cryptic lineages have been identified in at least 24 coral genera spanning the anthozoan phylogeny and across ocean basins. These cryptic lineages co-occur in many reef systems, but their distributions often differ among habitats. Research suggests that cryptic lineages are ecologically specialized and several examples demonstrate differences in thermal tolerance, highlighting the critical implications of this diversity for predicting coral responses to future warming. Here, we draw attention to recent discoveries, discuss how cryptic diversity affects the study of coral adaptation and acclimation to future environments, explore how it shapes symbiotic partnerships, and highlight challenges and opportunities for conservation and restoration efforts. Cryptic lineages of morphologically similar but genetically distinct coral taxa occur in many reef systems. This Perspective discusses the relevance of this genetic diversity to studies of coral responses to climate change and to reef conservation and restoration.},

  abstract     = {The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity set the agenda for global aspirations and action to reverse biodiversity loss. The GBF includes an explicit goal for maintaining and restoring biodiversity, encompassing ecosystems, species and genetic diversity (goal A), targets for ecosystem protection and restoration and headline indicators to track progress and guide action1. One of the headline indicators is the Red List of Ecosystems2, the global standard for ecosystem risk assessment. The Red List of Ecosystems provides a systematic framework for collating, analysing and synthesizing data on ecosystems, including their distribution, integrity and risk of collapse3. Here, we examine how it can contribute to implementing the GBF, as well as monitoring progress. We find that the Red List of Ecosystems provides common theory and practical data, while fostering collaboration, cross-sector cooperation and knowledge sharing, with important roles in 16 of the 23 targets. In particular, ecosystem maps, descriptions and risk categories are key to spatial planning for halting loss, restoration and protection (targets 1, 2 and 3). The Red List of Ecosystems is therefore well-placed to aid Parties to the GBF as they assess, plan and act to achieve the targets and goals. We outline future work to further strengthen this potential and improve biodiversity outcomes, including expanding spatial coverage of Red List of Ecosystems assessments and partnerships between practitioners, policy-makers and scientists. The Red List of Ecosystems is a headline indicator in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. This Progress illustrates how the Red List of Ecosystems can be used by Parties to the Framework to contribute to its implementation and monitoring.},

  abstract     = {The spread of Homo sapiens into new habitats across Eurasia ~45,000 years ago and the concurrent disappearance of Neanderthals represents a critical evolutionary turnover in our species’ history. ‘Transitional’ technocomplexes, such as the Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician (LRJ), characterize the European record during this period but their makers and evolutionary significance have long remained unclear. New evidence from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany, now provides a secure connection of the LRJ to H. sapiens remains dated to ~45,000 years ago, making it one of the earliest forays of our species to central Europe. Using many stable isotope records of climate produced from 16 serially sampled equid teeth spanning ~12,500 years of LRJ and Upper Palaeolithic human occupation at Ranis, we review the ability of early humans to adapt to different climate and habitat conditions. Results show that cold climates prevailed across LRJ occupations, with a temperature decrease culminating in a pronounced cold excursion at ~45,000–43,000 cal bp. Directly dated H. sapiens remains confirm that humans used the site even during this very cold phase. Together with recent evidence from the Initial Upper Palaeolithic, this demonstrates that humans operated in severe cold conditions during many distinct early dispersals into Europe and suggests pronounced adaptability. The authors present palaeoclimatic data in the form of stable isotope records from equid teeth spanning 12,500 years of human occupation at the site of Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany, including the earliest occupation of the site by Homo sapiens ~45,000 years ago.},

  abstract     = {Recent excavations at Ranis (Germany) identified an early dispersal of Homo sapiens into the higher latitudes of Europe by 45,000 years ago. Here we integrate results from zooarchaeology, palaeoproteomics, sediment DNA and stable isotopes to characterize the ecology, subsistence and diet of these early H. sapiens. We assessed all bone remains (n = 1,754) from the 2016–2022 excavations through morphology (n = 1,218) or palaeoproteomics (zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (n = 536) and species by proteome investigation (n = 212)). Dominant taxa include reindeer, cave bear, woolly rhinoceros and horse, indicating cold climatic conditions. Numerous carnivore modifications, alongside sparse cut-marked and burnt bones, illustrate a predominant use of the site by hibernating cave bears and denning hyaenas, coupled with a fluctuating human presence. Faunal diversity and high carnivore input were further supported by ancient mammalian DNA recovered from 26 sediment samples. Bulk collagen carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 52 animal and 10 human remains confirm a cold steppe/tundra setting and indicate a homogenous human diet based on large terrestrial mammals. This lower-density archaeological signature matches other Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician sites and is best explained by expedient visits of short duration by small, mobile groups of pioneer H. sapiens. Using zooarchaeology, palaeoproteomics, ancient sediment DNA and stable isotope analyses, the authors characterize the ecology of the Homo sapiens individuals associated with the ‘transitional’ Lincombian–Ranisian–Jerzmanowician technocomplex at Ilsenhöhle in Ranis.},

  abstract     = {The geographic expansion of Homo sapiens populations into southeastern Europe occurred by ∼47,000 years ago (∼47 ka), marked by Initial Upper Palaeolithic (IUP) technology. H. sapiens was present in western Siberia by ∼45 ka, and IUP industries indicate early entries by ∼50 ka in the Russian Altai and 46–45 ka in northern Mongolia. H. sapiens was in northeastern Asia by ∼40 ka, with a single IUP site in China dating to 43–41 ka. Here we describe an IUP assemblage from Shiyu in northern China, dating to ∼45 ka. Shiyu contains a stone tool assemblage produced by Levallois and Volumetric Blade Reduction methods, the long-distance transfer of obsidian from sources in China and the Russian Far East (800–1,000 km away), increased hunting skills denoted by the selective culling of adult equids and the recovery of tanged and hafted projectile points with evidence of impact fractures, and the presence of a worked bone tool and a shaped graphite disc. Shiyu exhibits a set of advanced cultural behaviours, and together with the recovery of a now-lost human cranial bone, the record supports an expansion of H. sapiens into eastern Asia by about 45 ka. The authors report an Initial Upper Palaeolithic archaeological assemblage from China dating to 45,000 years ago that includes blade technology, tanged and hafted projectile points, long-distance obsidian transfer and the use of a perforated graphite disc.},

  abstract     = {The arrangement and morphology of the vertebrate skull reflect functional and ecological demands, making it a highly adaptable structure. However, the fundamental developmental and macroevolutionary mechanisms leading to different vertebrate skull phenotypes remain unclear. Here we exploit the morphological diversity of squamate reptiles to assess the developmental and evolutionary patterns of skull variation and covariation in the whole head. Our geometric morphometric analysis of a complex squamate ontogenetic dataset (209 specimens, 169 embryos, 44 species), covering stages from craniofacial primordia to fully ossified bones, reveals that morphological differences between snake and lizard skulls arose gradually through changes in spatial relationships (heterotopy) followed by alterations in developmental timing or rate (heterochrony). Along with dynamic spatiotemporal changes in the integration pattern of skull bone shape and topology with surrounding brain tissues and sensory organs, we identify a relatively higher phenotypic integration of the developing snake head compared with lizards. The eye, nasal cavity and Jacobson’s organ are pivotal in skull morphogenesis, highlighting the importance of sensory rearrangements in snake evolution. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the importance of early embryonic, ontogenetic and tissue interactions in shaping craniofacial evolution and ecological diversification in squamates, with implications for the nature of cranio-cerebral relations across vertebrates. A geometric morphometric analysis of the developing skulls of 44 squamate species shows that the diversity of skull shapes arises from changes in spatial arrangements followed by alterations in developmental timings, and that phenotypic integration with surrounding head tissues is greater in snakes than in lizards.},

  abstract     = {Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication (WGD) is a major event that drastically reshapes genome architecture and is often assumed to be causally associated with organismal innovations and radiations. The 2R hypothesis suggests that two WGD events (1R and 2R) occurred during early vertebrate evolution. However, the timing of the 2R event relative to the divergence of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) and cyclostomes (jawless hagfishes and lampreys) is unresolved and whether these WGD events underlie vertebrate phenotypic diversification remains elusive. Here we present the genome of the inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. Through comparative analysis with lamprey and gnathostome genomes, we reconstruct the early events in cyclostome genome evolution, leveraging insights into the ancestral vertebrate genome. Genome-wide synteny and phylogenetic analyses support a scenario in which 1R occurred in the vertebrate stem-lineage during the early Cambrian, and 2R occurred in the gnathostome stem-lineage, maximally in the late Cambrian–earliest Ordovician, after its divergence from cyclostomes. We find that the genome of stem-cyclostomes experienced an additional independent genome triplication. Functional genomic and morphospace analyses demonstrate that WGD events generally contribute to developmental evolution with similar changes in the regulatory genome of both vertebrate groups. However, appreciable morphological diversification occurred only in the gnathostome but not in the cyclostome lineage, calling into question the general expectation that WGDs lead to leaps of bodyplan complexity. Analysis of a newly sequenced genome of the inshore hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri, together with genomes of lampreys and jawed vertebrates, provides insights into whole-genome duplication events and their implications for vertebrate genome evolution.},

  abstract     = {The increasing similarity of plant species composition among distinct areas is leading to the homogenization of ecosystems globally. Human actions such as ecosystem modification, the introduction of non-native plant species and the extinction or extirpation of endemic and native plant species are considered the main drivers of this trend. However, little is known about when floristic homogenization began or about pre-human patterns of floristic similarity. Here we investigate vegetation trends during the past 5,000 years across the tropical, sub-tropical and warm temperate South Pacific using fossil pollen records from 15 sites on 13 islands within the biogeographical realm of Oceania. The site comparisons show that floristic homogenization has increased over the past 5,000 years. Pairwise Bray–Curtis similarity results also show that when two islands were settled by people in a given time interval, their floristic similarity is greater than when one or neither of the islands were settled. Importantly, higher elevation sites, which are less likely to have experienced human impacts, tended to show less floristic homogenization. While biotic homogenization is often referred to as a contemporary issue, we have identified a much earlier trend, likely driven by human colonization of the islands and subsequent impacts. Exploring pollen records from 13 South Pacific islands, the authors find that floristic homogenization commenced following human arrival beginning around 3,000 years ago.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of arthropod populations to adapt to long-term climatic warming is currently uncertain. Here we combine theory and extensive data to show that the rate of their thermal adaptation to climatic warming will be constrained in two fundamental ways. First, the rate of thermal adaptation of an arthropod population is predicted to be limited by changes in the temperatures at which the performance of four key life-history traits can peak, in a specific order of declining importance: juvenile development, adult fecundity, juvenile mortality and adult mortality. Second, directional thermal adaptation is constrained due to differences in the temperature of the peak performance of these four traits, with these differences expected to persist because of energetic allocation and life-history trade-offs. We compile a new global dataset of 61 diverse arthropod species which provides strong empirical evidence to support these predictions, demonstrating that contemporary populations have indeed evolved under these constraints. Our results provide a basis for using relatively feasible trait measurements to predict the adaptive capacity of diverse arthropod populations to geographic temperature gradients, as well as ongoing and future climatic warming. By combining theory and empirical data, the authors show that the adaptive capacity of arthropod populations to long-term climatic warming will be constrained by the temperatures at which the performance of four key life-history traits can peak.},

  abstract     = {Soil-dwelling organisms play a key role in ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services. As a consequence, soil taxa such as earthworms are iconic in good land management practices. However, their introduction in places where species did not co-evolve with them can trigger catastrophic changes. This issue has been largely ignored so far in nature management policies because of the positive image of soil taxa and the lack of knowledge of the magnitude of soil fauna introductions outside their native range. Here we address this gap with a large spatio-temporal database of introduced alien earthworms. We show that 70 alien earthworm species have colonized the North American continent. They have larger geographical ranges than native species and novel ecological functions, representing a serious threat to the biodiversity and functioning of native ecosystems. The probably continuous introduction of alien earthworms, from a variety of sources and introduction pathways, into many distant and often empty niches, contrasts with the classical patterns of invasions in most aboveground taxa. This suggests that earthworms, and probably other soil organisms, constitute a major but overlooked pool of invasive species that are not adequately managed by existing control and mitigation strategies. The authors assemble a large database of native and introduced earthworm species richness and explore patterns of invasions as well as traits of the invasives relative to native species.},

  abstract     = {Successful alien species may experience a period of quiescence, known as the lag phase, before becoming invasive and widespread. The existence of lags introduces severe uncertainty in risk analyses of aliens as the present state of species is a poor predictor of future distributions, invasion success and impact. Predicting a species’ ability to invade and pose negative impacts requires a quantitative understanding of the commonality and magnitude of lags, environmental factors and mechanisms likely to terminate lag. Using herbarium and climate data, we analysed over 5,700 time series (species × regions) in 3,505 naturalized plant species from nine regions in temperate and tropical climates to quantify lags and test whether there have been shifts in the species’ climatic space during the transition from the lag phase to the expansion phase. Lags were identified in 35% of the assessed invasion events. We detected phylogenetic signals for lag phases in temperate climate regions and that annual self-fertilizing species were less likely to experience lags. Where lags existed, they had an average length of 40 years and a maximum of 320 years. Lengthy lags (&amp;gt;100 years) were more likely to occur in perennial plants and less frequent in self-pollinating species. For 98% of the species with a lag phase, the climate spaces sampled during the lag period differed from those in the expansion phase based on the assessment of centroid shifts or degree of climate space overlap. Our results highlight the importance of functional traits for the onset of the expansion phase and suggest that climate discovery may play a role in terminating the lag phase. However, other possibilities, such as sampling issues and climate niche shifts, cannot be ruled out. Analysing time series in &amp;gt;3,500 naturalized plant species from herbarium data, the authors show that 35% of alien species experience a lag phase lasting an average of 40 years before becoming invasive, with the majority occupying different climatic spaces during the lag and expansion phases.},

  abstract     = {Phenology varies widely over space and time because of its sensitivity to climate. However, whether phenological variation is primarily generated by rapid organismal responses (plasticity) or local adaptation remains unresolved. Here we used 1,038,027 herbarium specimens representing 1,605 species from the continental United States to measure flowering-time sensitivity to temperature over time (Stime) and space (Sspace). By comparing these estimates, we inferred how adaptation and plasticity historically influenced phenology along temperature gradients and how their contributions vary among species with different phenology and native climates and among ecoregions differing in species composition. Parameters Sspace and Stime were positively correlated (r = 0.87), of similar magnitude and more frequently consistent with plasticity than adaptation. Apparent plasticity and adaptation generated earlier flowering in spring, limited responsiveness in late summer and delayed flowering in autumn in response to temperature increases. Nonetheless, ecoregions differed in the relative contributions of adaptation and plasticity, from consistently greater importance of plasticity (for example, southeastern United States plains) to their nearly equal importance throughout the season (for example, Western Sierra Madre Piedmont). Our results support the hypothesis that plasticity is the primary driver of flowering-time variation along temperature gradients, with local adaptation having a widespread but comparatively limited role. Using a large sample of herbarium records containing flowering-time data for 1,605 species of plants from the United States, the authors show that most changes in phenology in response to temperature change are attributable to phenotypic plasticity rather than local adaptation.},

Here we assess the robustness of the current European reserve network to safeguard the European Alps’ flora by 2080 using semi-mechanistic simulations. We first highlight that the current network needs strong readjustments as it does not capture biodiversity patterns as well as our conservation simulations. Overall, we predict a strong shift in conservation need through time along latitudes, and from lower to higher elevations as plants migrate upslope and shrink their distribution. While increasing species, trait and evolutionary diversity, migration could also threaten 70% of the resident flora. In the face of global changes, the future European reserve network will need to ensure strong elevation and latitudinal connections to complementarily protect multifaceted biodiversity beyond national borders. Simulations of species range shifts for flora of the European Alps under varying climate and land-use models to 2080 provide the basis for spatial conservation planning to preserve taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how and why local communities change is a pressing task for conservation, especially in freshwater systems. It remains challenging because of the complexity of biodiversity changes, driven by the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of human pressures. Using a compilation of riverine fish community time series (93% between 1993 and 2019) across the Palaearctic, Nearctic and Australasia realms, we assessed how past and recent anthropogenic pressures drive community changes across both space and time. We found evidence of rapid changes in community composition of 30% per decade characterized by important changes in the dominant species, together with a 13% increase in total abundance per decade and a 7% increase in species richness per decade. The spatial heterogeneity in these trends could be traced back to the strength and timing of anthropogenic pressures and was mainly mediated by non-native species introductions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the negative effects of anthropogenic pressures on species richness and total abundance were compensated over time by the establishment of non-native species, a pattern consistent with previously reported biotic homogenization at the global scale. Overall, our study suggests that accounting for the complexity of community changes and its drivers is a crucial step to reach global conservation goals. A compilation of 4,476 riverine fish community time series is used to identify trends in community composition and species abundance and richness over several decades. Spatial heterogeneity in the trends is linked to the timing and strength of anthropogenic pressures, including the introduction of non-native species.},

Here we show that mixed biodiversity responses may arise because community metrics show variable responses to anthropogenic impacts across broad spatial scales. We first quantified temporal trends in anthropogenic impacts for 1,365 riverine invertebrate communities from 23 European countries, based on similarity to least-impacted reference communities. Reference comparisons provide necessary, but often missing, baselines for evaluating whether communities are negatively impacted or have improved (less or more similar, respectively). We then determined whether changing impacts were consistently reflected in metrics of community abundance, taxon richness, evenness and composition. Invertebrate communities improved, that is, became more similar to reference conditions, from 1992 until the 2010s, after which improvements plateaued. Improvements were generally reflected by higher taxon richness, providing evidence that certain community metrics can broadly indicate anthropogenic impacts. However, richness responses were highly variable among sites, and we found no consistent responses in community abundance, evenness or composition. These findings suggest that, without sufficient data and careful metric selection, many common community metrics cannot reliably reflect anthropogenic impacts, helping explain the prevalence of mixed biodiversity trends. Analysing 27 years of freshwater invertebrate biomonitoring data from European rivers, the authors show that although some commonly used biodiversity metrics can reflect anthropogenic impacts at broad spatial scales, there was little consistency among other metrics in accurately reflecting community responses.},

  abstract     = {Despite clear evidence that some pollinator populations are declining, our ability to predict pollinator communities prone to collapse or species at risk of local extinction is remarkably poor. Here, we develop a model grounded in the structuralist approach that allows us to draw sound predictions regarding the temporal persistence of species in mutualistic networks. Using high-resolution data from a six-year study following 12 independent plant–pollinator communities, we confirm that pollinator species with more persistent populations in the field are theoretically predicted to tolerate a larger range of environmental changes. Persistent communities are not necessarily more diverse, but are generally located in larger habitat patches, and present a distinctive combination of generalist and specialist species resulting in a more nested structure, as predicted by previous theoretical work. Hence, pollinator interactions directly inform about their ability to persist, opening the door to use theoretically informed models to predict species’ fate within the ongoing global change. The authors use the structuralist approach and high-resolution empirical data to develop a mechanistic model that accurately predicts the temporal persistence of pollinators in plant–pollinator communities. They show that mean pollinator persistence is highest in communities with high opportunities for species’ coexistence.},

  abstract     = {Evidence is mounting that vertebrate defaunation greatly impacts global biogeochemical cycling. Yet, there is no comprehensive assessment of the potential vertebrate influence over plant decomposition, despite litter decay being one of the largest global carbon fluxes. We therefore conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate vertebrate effects on litter mass loss and associated element release across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that vertebrates affected litter decomposition by various direct and indirect pathways, increasing litter mass loss by 6.7% on average, and up to 34.4% via physical breakdown. This positive vertebrate impact on litter mass loss was consistent across contrasting litter types (woody and non-woody), climatic regions (boreal, temperate and tropical), ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial) and vertebrate taxa, but disappeared when evaluating litter nitrogen and phosphorus release. Moreover, we found evidence of interactive effects between vertebrates and non-vertebrate decomposers on litter mass loss, and a larger influence of vertebrates at mid-to-late decomposition stages, contrasting with the invertebrate effect known to be strongest at early decomposition stage. Our synthesis demonstrates a global vertebrate control over litter mass loss, and further stresses the need to account for vertebrates when assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss on biogeochemical cycles. Across terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems, vertebrates increase litter decomposition, both directly and indirectly, by 6.7% on average, and this effect interacts with but generally occurs at a later stage of decomposition than the effect of invertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Mycorrhizae, a form of plant–fungal symbioses, mediate vegetation impacts on ecosystem functioning. Climatic effects on decomposition and soil quality are suggested to drive mycorrhizal distributions, with arbuscular mycorrhizal plants prevailing in low-latitude/high-soil-quality areas and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) plants in high-latitude/low-soil-quality areas. However, these generalizations, based on coarse-resolution data, obscure finer-scale variations and result in high uncertainties in the predicted distributions of mycorrhizal types and their drivers. Using data from 31 lowland tropical forests, both at a coarse scale (mean-plot-level data) and fine scale (20 × 20 metres from a subset of 16 sites), we demonstrate that the distribution and abundance of EcM-associated trees are independent of soil quality. Resource exchange differences among mycorrhizal partners, stemming from diverse evolutionary origins of mycorrhizal fungi, may decouple soil fertility from the advantage provided by mycorrhizal associations. Additionally, distinct historical biogeographies and diversification patterns have led to differences in forest composition and nutrient-acquisition strategies across three major tropical regions. Notably, Africa and Asia’s lowland tropical forests have abundant EcM trees, whereas they are relatively scarce in lowland neotropical forests. A greater understanding of the functional biology of mycorrhizal symbiosis is required, especially in the lowland tropics, to overcome biases from assuming similarity to temperate and boreal regions. Analysing data on the relative abundance of basal area of ectomycorrhizal trees from lowland tropical forests, the authors show that their distribution and abundance are independent of soil quality.},

  abstract     = {Overyielding, the high productivity of multispecies plant communities, is commonly seen as the result of plant genetic diversity. Here we demonstrate that biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships can emerge in clonal plant populations through interaction with microorganisms. Using a model clonal plant species, we found that exposure to volatiles of certain microorganisms led to divergent plant phenotypes. Assembling communities out of plants associated with different microorganisms led to transgressive overyielding in both biomass and seed yield. Our results highlight the importance of belowground microbial diversity in plant biodiversity research and open new avenues for precision ecosystem management. Exposing clonal plant populations to volatile compounds produced by root-associated microorganisms, the authors show that combinations of different plant phenotypes induced by this exposure can lead to transgressive overyielding in biomass when different phenotypes are combined in diverse mixtures.},

  abstract     = {Animal colour vision is based on comparing signals from different photoreceptors. It is generally assumed that processing different spectral types of photoreceptor mainly serves colour vision. Here I propose instead that photoreceptors are parallel feature channels that differentially support visual-motor programmes like motion vision behaviours, prey capture and predator evasion. Colour vision may have emerged as a secondary benefit of these circuits, which originally helped aquatic vertebrates to visually navigate and segment their underwater world. Specifically, I suggest that ancestral vertebrate vision was built around three main systems, including a high-resolution general purpose greyscale system based on ancestral red cones and rods to mediate visual body stabilization and navigation, a high-sensitivity specialized foreground system based on ancestral ultraviolet cones to mediate threat detection and prey capture, and a net-suppressive system based on ancestral green and blue cones for regulating red/rod and ultraviolet circuits. This ancestral strategy probably still underpins vision today, and different vertebrate lineages have since adapted their original photoreceptor circuits to suit their diverse visual ecologies. This Perspective proposes that the driving force of photoreceptor diversity was visual–motor perception with colour discrimination evolving as a secondary function.},

  abstract     = {Zokors, an Asiatic group of subterranean rodents, originated in lowlands and colonized high-elevational zones following the uplift of the Qinghai–Tibet plateau about 3.6 million years ago. Zokors live at high elevation in subterranean burrows and experience hypobaric hypoxia, including both hypoxia (low oxygen concentration) and hypercapnia (elevated partial pressure of CO2). Here we report a genomic analysis of six zokor species (genus Eospalax) with different elevational ranges to identify structural variants (deletions and inversions) that may have contributed to high-elevation adaptation. Based on an assembly of a chromosome-level genome of the high-elevation species, Eospalax baileyi, we identified 18 large inversions that distinguished this species from congeners native to lower elevations. Small-scale structural variants in the introns of EGLN1, HIF1A, HSF1 and SFTPD of E. baileyi were associated with the upregulated expression of those genes. A rearrangement on chromosome 1 was associated with altered chromatin accessibility, leading to modified gene expression profiles of key genes involved in the physiological response to hypoxia. Multigene families that underwent copy-number expansions in E. baileyi were enriched for autophagy, HIF1 signalling and immune response. E. baileyi show a significantly larger lung mass than those of other Eospalax species. These findings highlight the key role of structural variants underlying hypoxia adaptation of high-elevation species in Eospalax. Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequencing of six zokor species that live at different altitudes show the contribution of deletions and inversions to adaptation to high altitude in these subterranean rodents.},

Driven by rapidly accumulating single-cell datasets, recent attempts to infer cell type evolution have largely been limited to pairwise comparisons because we lack approaches to build cell phylogenies using model-based approaches. Here we approach the challenges of applying explicit phylogenetic methods to single-cell data by using principal components as phylogenetic characters. We infer a cell phylogeny from a large, comparative single-cell dataset of eye cells from five distantly related mammals. Robust cell type clades enable us to provide a phylogenetic, rather than phenetic, definition of cell type, allowing us to forgo marker genes and phylogenetically classify cells by topology. We further observe evolutionary relationships between diverse vessel endothelia and identify the myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells as sister cell types. Finally, we examine principal component loadings and describe the gene expression dynamics underlying the function and identity of cell type clades that have been conserved across the five species. A cell phylogeny provides a rigorous framework towards investigating the evolutionary history of cells and will be critical to interpret comparative single-cell datasets that aim to ask fundamental evolutionary questions. The authors apply explicit phylogenetic methods to single-cell transcriptomic data of eye cells to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cell types in distantly related mammals.},

  abstract     = {Reversing the evolution of traits harmful to humans, such as antimicrobial resistance, is a key ambition of applied evolutionary biology. A major impediment to reverse evolution is the relatively low spontaneous mutation rates that revert evolved genotypes back to their ancestral state. However, the repeated re-introduction of ancestral alleles by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) could make reverse evolution likely. Here we evolve populations of an antibiotic-resistant strain of Helicobacter pylori in growth conditions without antibiotics while introducing an ancestral antibiotic-sensitive allele by HGT. We evaluate reverse evolution using DNA sequencing and find that HGT facilitates the molecular reverse evolution of the antibiotic resistance allele, and that selection for high rates of HGT drives the evolution of increased HGT rates in low-HGT treatment populations. Finally, we use a theoretical model and carry out simulations to infer how the fitness costs of antibiotic resistance, rates of HGT and effects of genetic drift interact to determine the probability and predictability of reverse evolution. The authors evolved antibiotic-resistant Helicobacter pylori in the absence of antibiotics and presence of DNA from antibiotic-sensitive strains. Horizontal gene transfer mediated the molecular reverse evolution of the antibiotic-resistance gene to the antibiotic-sensitive allele, and the authors used theoretical modelling to determine the evolutionary conditions that promote reverse evolution.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing question is to what degree genetic drift and selection drive the divergence in rare accessory gene content between closely related bacteria. Rare genes, including singletons, make up a large proportion of pangenomes (all genes in a set of genomes), but it remains unclear how many such genes are adaptive, deleterious or neutral to their host genome. Estimates of species’ effective population sizes (Ne) are positively associated with pangenome size and fluidity, which has independently been interpreted as evidence for both neutral and adaptive pangenome models. We hypothesized that pseudogenes, used as a neutral reference, could be used to distinguish these models. We find that most functional categories are depleted for rare pseudogenes when a genome encodes only a single intact copy of a gene family. In contrast, transposons are enriched in pseudogenes, suggesting they are mostly neutral or deleterious to the host genome. Thus, even if individual rare accessory genes vary in their effects on host fitness, we can confidently reject a model of entirely neutral or deleterious rare genes. We also define the ratio of singleton intact genes to singleton pseudogenes (si/sp) within a pangenome, compare this measure across 668 prokaryotic species and detect a signal consistent with the adaptive value of many rare accessory genes. Taken together, our work demonstrates that comparing with pseudogenes can improve inferences of the evolutionary forces driving pangenome variation. Using pseudogenes as a neutral reference, the authors examine whether prokaryotic pangenomes have evolved primarily under selection or neutral drift. They show that even rare intact accessory genes are often under selection, providing support for an adaptive pangenome model.},

  abstract     = {Top predator declines are pervasive and often have dramatic effects on ecological communities via changes in food web dynamics, but their evolutionary consequences are virtually unknown. Tasmania’s top terrestrial predator, the Tasmanian devil, is declining due to a lethal transmissible cancer. Spotted-tailed quolls benefit via mesopredator release, and they alter their behaviour and resource use concomitant with devil declines and increased disease duration. Here, using a landscape community genomics framework to identify environmental drivers of population genomic structure and signatures of selection, we show that these biotic factors are consistently among the top variables explaining genomic structure of the quoll. Landscape resistance negatively correlates with devil density, suggesting that devil declines will increase quoll genetic subdivision over time, despite no change in quoll densities detected by camera trap studies. Devil density also contributes to signatures of selection in the quoll genome, including genes associated with muscle development and locomotion. Our results provide some of the first evidence of the evolutionary impacts of competition between a top predator and a mesopredator species in the context of a trophic cascade. As top predator declines are increasing globally, our framework can serve as a model for future studies of evolutionary impacts of altered ecological interactions. Decline of the Tasmanian devil due to transmissible cancer has allowed mesopredator release of the spotted-tailed quoll. Population genomic analysis of the quoll shows the effect of devil decline on population structure, and selection on genes, including those for muscle development and locomotion.},

Interspecific admixture events can increase genetic variation in the recipient species’ gene pool, but empirical examples of species-wide restoration of genetic diversity by admixture are lacking. Here we present multi-fold coverage genomic data from three ancient Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) approximately 2,000–4,000 years old and show a continuous or recurrent process of interspecies admixture with the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) that increased modern Iberian lynx genetic diversity above that occurring millennia ago despite its recent demographic decline. Our results add to the accumulating evidence for natural admixture and introgression among closely related species and show that this can result in an increase of species-wide genetic diversity in highly genetically eroded species. The strict avoidance of interspecific sources in current genetic restoration measures needs to be carefully reconsidered, particularly in cases where no conspecific source population exists. An analysis of three ancient Iberian lynx genomes shows that genetic admixture with the Eurasian lynx contributed to levels of modern Iberian lynx genetic diversity higher than those experienced millennia ago, despite recent population decline.},

  abstract     = {Genetic monitoring of populations currently attracts interest in the context of the Convention on Biological Diversity but needs long-term planning and investments. However, genetic diversity has been largely neglected in biodiversity monitoring, and when addressed, it is treated separately, detached from other conservation issues, such as habitat alteration due to climate change. We report an accounting of efforts to monitor population genetic diversity in Europe (genetic monitoring effort, GME), the evaluation of which can help guide future capacity building and collaboration towards areas most in need of expanded monitoring. Overlaying GME with areas where the ranges of selected species of conservation interest approach current and future climate niche limits helps identify whether GME coincides with anticipated climate change effects on biodiversity. Our analysis suggests that country area, financial resources and conservation policy influence GME, high values of which only partially match species’ joint patterns of limits to suitable climatic conditions. Populations at trailing climatic niche margins probably hold genetic diversity that is important for adaptation to changing climate. Our results illuminate the need in Europe for expanded investment in genetic monitoring across climate gradients occupied by focal species, a need arguably greatest in southeastern European countries. This need could be met in part by expanding the European Union’s Birds and Habitats Directives to fully address the conservation and monitoring of genetic diversity. Comparing data on genetic monitoring efforts across Europe with the distributions of areas at species’ climatic niche margins, the authors show that monitoring efforts should be expanded to populations at trailing niche margins to include genetic variation that may prove important for adaptation to ongoing climate warming.},

  abstract     = {The biodiversity impacts of agricultural deforestation vary widely across regions. Previous efforts to explain this variation have focused exclusively on the landscape features and management regimes of agricultural systems, neglecting the potentially critical role of ecological filtering in shaping deforestation tolerance of extant species assemblages at large geographical scales via selection for functional traits. Here we provide a large-scale test of this role using a global database of species abundance ratios between matched agricultural and native forest sites that comprises 71 avian assemblages reported in 44 primary studies, and a companion database of 10 functional traits for all 2,647 species involved. Using meta-analytic, phylogenetic and multivariate methods, we show that beyond agricultural features, filtering by the extent of natural environmental variability and the severity of historical anthropogenic deforestation shapes the varying deforestation impacts across species assemblages. For assemblages under greater environmental variability—proxied by drier and more seasonal climates under a greater disturbance regime—and longer deforestation histories, filtering has attenuated the negative impacts of current deforestation by selecting for functional traits linked to stronger deforestation tolerance. Our study provides a previously largely missing piece of knowledge in understanding and managing the biodiversity consequences of deforestation by agricultural deforestation. The authors collate literature on the responses of bird assemblages to forest loss and show that locations with a more variable natural environment and a longer history of agricultural land use have bird assemblages that are more tolerant to forest loss.},

  abstract     = {Mangrove forests are a highly productive ecosystem with important potential to offset anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Mangroves are expected to respond differently to climate change compared to terrestrial forests owing to their location in the tidal environment and unique ecophysiological characteristics, but the magnitude of difference remains uncertain at the global scale. Here we use satellite observations to examine mean trends and interannual variability in the productivity of global mangrove forests and nearby terrestrial evergreen broadleaf forests from 2001 to 2020. Although both types of ecosystem experienced significant recent increases in productivity, mangroves exhibited a stronger increasing trend and greater interannual variability in productivity than evergreen broadleaf forests on three-quarters of their co-occurring coasts. The difference in productivity trends is attributed to the stronger CO2 fertilization effect on mangrove photosynthesis, while the discrepancy in interannual variability is attributed to the higher sensitivities to variations in precipitation and sea level. Our results indicate that mangroves will have a faster increase in productivity than terrestrial forests in a CO2-rich future but may suffer more from deficits in water availability, highlighting a key difference between terrestrial and tidal ecosystems in their responses to climate change. Remote sensing of vegetation productivity in mangroves and nearby terrestrial evergreen forests shows that mangrove productivity has increased more but also shown more variability in the last two decades compared to nearby terrestrial forests, suggesting they are more vulnerable to coastal water deficits.},

  abstract     = {A steady rise in fires in the Western United States, coincident with intensifying droughts, imparts substantial modifications to the underlying vegetation, hydrology and overall ecosystem. Drought can compound the ecosystem disturbance caused by fire, although how these compound effects on hydrologic and ecosystem recovery vary among ecosystems is poorly understood. Here we use remote sensing-derived high-resolution evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from before and after 1,514 fires to show that ecoregions dominated by grasslands and shrublands are more susceptible to drought, which amplifies fire-induced ET decline and, subsequently, shifts water flux partitioning. In contrast, severely burned forests recover from fire slowly or incompletely, but are less sensitive to dry extremes. We conclude that moisture limitation caused by droughts influences the dynamics of water balance recovery in post-fire years. This finding explains why moderate to extreme droughts aggravate impacts on the water balance in non-forested vegetation, while moisture accessed by deeper roots in forests helps meet evaporative demands unless severe burns disrupt internal tree structure and deplete fuel load availability. Our results highlight the dominant control of drought on altering the resilience of vegetation to fires, with critical implications for terrestrial ecosystem stability in the face of anthropogenic climate change in the West. The authors compare how grasslands, shrublands and forests differ in their capacity to recover from fires, and how this recovery depends on deviations in water balance caused by drought; they show that the compound effects of fire and drought are less impactful in forests than in non-forests, owing to deeper rooting structures that can maintain access to water.},

  abstract     = {Spring vegetation growth can benefit summer growth by increasing foliage area and carbon sequestration potential, or impair it by consuming additional resources needed for sustaining subsequent growth. However, the prevalent driving mechanism and its temporal changes remain unknown. Using satellite observations and long-term atmospheric CO2 records, here we show a weakening trend of the linkage between spring and summer vegetation growth/productivity in the Northern Hemisphere during 1982–2021. This weakening is driven by warmer and more extreme hot weather that becomes unfavourable for peak-season growth, shifting peak plant functioning away from earlier periods. This is further exacerbated by seasonally growing ecosystem water stress due to reduced water supply and enhanced water demand. Our finding suggests that beneficial carryover effects of spring growth on summer growth are diminishing or even reversing, acting as an early warning sign of the ongoing shift of climatic effects from stimulating to suppressing plant photosynthesis during the early to peak seasons. Combining long-term atmospheric CO2 records with satellite observations of vegetation activities across the Northern Hemisphere, the authors identify a weakening trend of the link between spring and summer productivity over the past 40 years.},

  abstract     = {Inferring biotic interactions from species co-occurrence patterns has long intrigued ecologists. Yet recent research revealed that co-occurrences may not reliably represent pairwise biotic interactions. We propose that examining network-level co-occurrence patterns can provide valuable insights into community structure and assembly. Analysing ten bipartite networks of empirically sampled biotic interactions and associated species spatial distribution, we find that approximately 20% of co-occurrences correspond to actual interactions. Moreover, the degree distribution shifts from exponential in co-occurrence networks to power laws in networks of biotic interactions. This shift results from a strong interplay between species’ biotic (their interacting partners) and abiotic (their environmental requirements) niches, and is accurately predicted by considering co-occurrence frequencies. Our work offers a mechanistic understanding of the assembly of ecological communities and suggests simple ways to infer fundamental biotic interaction network characteristics from co-occurrence data. Analysing ten bipartite networks of empirically sampled biotic interactions and the associated species’ spatial distribution, the authors model how network degree distributions can be predicted by accounting for the frequency of co-occurrences between species.},

  abstract     = {Tree canopies are one of the most recognizable features of forests, providing shelter from external influences to a myriad of species that live within and below the tree foliage. Canopy disturbances are now increasing across European forests, and climate-change-induced drought is a key driver, together with pests and pathogens, storms and fire. These disturbances are opening the canopy and exposing below-canopy biodiversity and functioning to novel light regimes—spatial and temporal characteristics of light distribution at forest floors not found previously. The majority of forest biodiversity occurs in the shade within and below tree canopies, and numerous ecosystem processes are regulated at the forest floor. Altered light regimes, in interaction with other global change drivers, can thus strongly impact forest biodiversity and functioning. As recent European droughts are unprecedented in the past two millennia, and this has initiated probably the largest pulse of forest disturbances in almost two centuries, we urgently need to quantify, understand and predict the impacts of novel light regimes on below-canopy forest biodiversity and functions. This will be a crucial element in delivering much-needed information for policymakers and managers to adapt European forests to future no-analogue conditions. The canopies of European forests are being increasingly disturbed by drought and other drivers, many of which are associated with climate change. This Perspective discusses how such disturbances will lead to changed light conditions at the forest floor, with consequences for below-canopy biodiversity and functions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how systemic biases influence local ecological communities is essential for developing just and equitable environmental practices that prioritize both human and wildlife well-being. With over 270 million residents inhabiting urban areas in the United States, the socioecological consequences of racially targeted zoning, such as redlining, need to be considered in urban planning. There is a growing body of literature documenting the relationships between redlining and the inequitable distribution of environmental harms and goods, green space cover and pollutant exposure. However, it remains unknown whether historical redlining affects the distribution of urban noise or whether inequitable noise drives an ecological change in urban environments. Here we conducted a spatial analysis of how urban noise corresponds to the distribution of redlining categories and a systematic literature review to summarize the effects of noise on wildlife in urban landscapes. We found strong evidence to indicate that noise is inequitably distributed in redlined urban communities across the United States, and that inequitable noise may drive complex biological responses across diverse urban wildlife, reinforcing the interrelatedness of socioecological outcomes. These findings lay a foundation for future research that advances relationships between acoustic and urban ecology through centring equity and challenging systems of oppression in wildlife studies. A spatial analysis of how transportation noise corresponds with ‘redlining’ categories of racial segregation in US cities is combined with a literature review of the effects of noise on urban wildlife.},

  abstract     = {Cancers with acquired resistance to targeted therapy can become simultaneously dependent on the presence of the targeted therapy drug for survival, suggesting that intermittent therapy may slow resistance. However, relatively little is known about which tumours are likely to become dependent and how to schedule intermittent therapy optimally. Here we characterized drug dependence across a panel of over 75 MAPK-inhibitor-resistant BRAFV600E mutant melanoma models at the population and single-clone levels. Melanocytic differentiated models exhibited a much greater tendency to give rise to drug-dependent progeny than their dedifferentiated counterparts. Mechanistically, acquired loss of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor in differentiated melanoma models drives ERK–JunB–p21 signalling to enforce drug dependence. We identified the optimal scheduling of ‘drug holidays’ using simple mathematical models that we validated across short and long timescales. Without detailed knowledge of tumour characteristics, we found that a simple adaptive therapy protocol can produce near-optimal outcomes using only measurements of total population size. Finally, a spatial agent-based model showed that optimal schedules derived from exponentially growing cells in culture remain nearly optimal in the context of tumour cell turnover and limited environmental carrying capacity. These findings may guide the implementation of improved evolution-inspired treatment strategies for drug-dependent cancers. Melanoma cell lines are used to identify the tumour characteristics that increase the chances of drug dependency, and mathematical modelling shows that this can be exploited for treatment using drug holidays with only measurements of total population size required for near optimality.},

  abstract     = {Human newborns are considered altricial compared with other primates because they are relatively underdeveloped at birth. However, in a broader comparative context, other mammals are more altricial than humans. It has been proposed that altricial development evolved secondarily in humans due to obstetrical or metabolic constraints, and in association with increased brain plasticity. To explore this association, we used comparative data from 140 placental mammals to measure how altriciality evolved in humans and other species. We also estimated how changes in brain size and gestation length influenced the timing of neurodevelopment during hominin evolution. Based on our data, humans show the highest evolutionary rate to become more altricial (measured as the proportion of adult brain size at birth) across all placental mammals, but this results primarily from the pronounced postnatal enlargement of brain size rather than neonatal changes. In addition, we show that only a small number of neurodevelopmental events were shifted to the postnatal period during hominin evolution, and that they were primarily related to the myelination of certain brain pathways. These results indicate that the perception of human altriciality is mostly driven by postnatal changes, and they point to a possible association between the timing of myelination and human neuroplasticity. Humans have the highest evolutionary rate towards becoming more altricial across all placental mammals, but this results primarily from postnatal enlargement of brain size rather than neonatal changes.},

  abstract     = {Whereas living representatives of Pseudosuchia, crocodylians, number fewer than 30 species, more than 700 pseudosuchian species are known from their 250-million-year fossil record, displaying far greater ecomorphological diversity than their extant counterparts. With a new time-calibrated tree of &amp;gt;500 species, we use a phylogenetic framework to reveal that pseudosuchian evolutionary history and diversification dynamics were directly shaped by the interplay of abiotic and biotic processes over hundreds of millions of years, supported by information theory analyses. Speciation, but not extinction, is correlated with higher temperatures in terrestrial and marine lineages, with high sea level associated with heightened extinction in non-marine taxa. Low lineage diversity and increased speciation in non-marine species is consistent with opportunities for niche-filling, whereas increased competition may have led to elevated extinction rates. In marine lineages, competition via increased lineage diversity appears to have driven both speciation and extinction. Decoupling speciation and extinction, in combination with ecological partitioning, reveals a more complex picture of pseudosuchian evolution than previously understood. As the number of species threatened with extinction by anthropogenic climate change continues to rise, the fossil record provides a unique window into the drivers that led to clade success and those that may ultimately lead to extinction. Using a new phylogeny of Pseudosuchia (crocodile-line archosaurs), the authors use diversification analyses and information theory to show that the interplay of abiotic and biotic processes over hundreds of millions of years shaped evolutionary history and diversification dynamics in this clade.},

  abstract     = {Taste is a vital chemical sense for feeding behaviour. In mammals, the umami and sweet taste receptors comprise three members of the taste receptor type 1 (T1R/TAS1R) family: T1R1, T1R2 and T1R3. Because their functional homologues exist in teleosts, only three TAS1R genes generated by gene duplication are believed to have been inherited from the common ancestor of bony vertebrates. Here, we report five previously uncharacterized TAS1R members in vertebrates, TAS1R4, TAS1R5, TAS1R6, TAS1R7 and TAS1R8, based on genome-wide survey of diverse taxa. We show that mammalian and teleost fish TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 genes are paralogues. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the bony vertebrate ancestor had nine TAS1Rs resulting from multiple gene duplications. Some TAS1Rs were lost independently in descendent lineages resulting in retention of only three TAS1Rs in mammals and teleosts. Combining functional assays and expression analysis of non-teleost fishes we show that the novel T1Rs form heterodimers in taste-receptor cells and recognize a broad range of ligands such as essential amino acids, including branched-chain amino acids, which have not been previously considered as T1R ligands. This study reveals diversity of taste sensations in both modern vertebrates and their ancestors, which might have enabled vertebrates to adapt to diverse habitats on Earth. A combination of phylogenetic analysis and functional assays reveals surprising diversity of taste receptors in the ancestors of vertebrates and their complex evolutionary history.},

  abstract     = {The organization and coordination of fish schools provide a valuable model to investigate the genetic architecture of affiliative behaviours and dissect the mechanisms underlying social behaviours and personalities. Here we used replicate guppy selection lines that vary in schooling propensity and combine quantitative genetics with genomic and transcriptomic analyses to investigate the genetic basis of sociability phenotypes. We show that consistent with findings in collective motion patterns, experimental evolution of schooling propensity increased the sociability of female, but not male, guppies when swimming with unfamiliar conspecifics. This finding highlights a relevant link between coordinated motion and sociability for species forming fission–fusion societies in which both group size and the type of social interactions are dynamic across space and time. We further show that alignment and attraction, the two major traits forming the sociability personality axis in this species, showed heritability estimates at the upper end of the range previously described for social behaviours, with important variation across sexes. The results from both Pool-seq and RNA-seq data indicated that genes involved in neuron migration and synaptic function were instrumental in the evolution of sociability, highlighting a crucial role of glutamatergic synaptic function and calcium-dependent signalling processes in the evolution of schooling. The authors used multiple lines of evidence including behavioural assays, quantitative genetics and transcriptomics to explore schooling behaviour in guppies. Both genomic and transcriptomic analyses indicated that genes involved in neuron migration and synaptic function played key roles in the evolution of schooling behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Sex-limited morphs can provide profound insights into the evolution and genomic architecture of complex phenotypes. Inter-sexual mimicry is one particular type of sex-limited polymorphism in which a novel morph resembles the opposite sex. While inter-sexual mimics are known in both sexes and a diverse range of animals, their evolutionary origin is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the genomic basis of female-limited morphs and male mimicry in the common bluetail damselfly. Differential gene expression between morphs has been documented in damselflies, but no causal locus has been previously identified. We found that male mimicry originated in an ancestrally sexually dimorphic lineage in association with multiple structural changes, probably driven by transposable element activity. These changes resulted in ~900 kb of novel genomic content that is partly shared by male mimics in a close relative, indicating that male mimicry is a trans-species polymorphism. More recently, a third morph originated following the translocation of part of the male-mimicry sequence into a genomic position ~3.5 mb apart. We provide evidence of balancing selection maintaining male mimicry, in line with previous field population studies. Our results underscore how structural variants affecting a handful of potentially regulatory genes and morph-specific genes can give rise to novel and complex phenotypic polymorphisms. The authors investigate the genetic basis of inter-sexual mimicry in Ischnura elegans damselflies, where females are polymorphic and one female morph mimics males. By combining genomic, transcriptomic and phylogenetic evidence, they identify a causal locus and structural variants associated with the evolution of female polymorphism and male mimicry in this species.},

  abstract     = {Developmental time is a key life-history trait with large effects on Darwinian fitness. In many insects, developmental time is currently under strong selection to minimize ecological mismatches in seasonal timing induced by climate change. The genetic basis of responses to such selection, however, is poorly understood. To address this problem, we set up a long-term evolve-and-resequence experiment in the beetle Tribolium castaneum and selected replicate, outbred populations for fast or slow embryonic development. The response to this selection was substantial and embryonic developmental timing of the selection lines started to diverge during dorsal closure. Pooled whole-genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and an RNAi screen pinpoint a 222 bp deletion containing binding sites for Broad and Tramtrack upstream of the ecdysone degrading enzyme Cyp18a1 as a main target of selection. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to reconstruct this allele in the homogenous genetic background of a laboratory strain, we unravel how this single deletion advances the embryonic ecdysone peak inducing dorsal closure and show that this allele accelerates larval development but causes a trade-off with fecundity. Our study uncovers a life-history allele of large effect and reveals the evolvability of developmental time in a natural insect population. The authors use a long-term evolve-and-resequence experiment in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum to identify the genetic basis for variation in development time, finding that a deletion upstream of the enzyme Cyp18a1 is a main target of selection, and this allele accelerates development but trades off with fecundity.},

  abstract     = {Cycads are ancient seed plants (gymnosperms) that emerged by the early Permian. Although they were common understory flora and food for dinosaurs in the Mesozoic, their abundance declined markedly in the Cenozoic. Extant cycads persist in restricted populations in tropical and subtropical habitats and, with their conserved morphology, are often called ‘living fossils.’ All surviving taxa receive nitrogen from symbiotic N2-fixing cyanobacteria living in modified roots, suggesting an ancestral origin of this symbiosis. However, such an ancient acquisition is discordant with the abundance of cycads in Mesozoic fossil assemblages, as modern N2-fixing symbioses typically occur only in nutrient-poor habitats where advantageous for survival. Here, we use foliar nitrogen isotope ratios—a proxy for N2 fixation in modern plants—to probe the antiquity of the cycad–cyanobacterial symbiosis. We find that fossilized cycad leaves from two Cenozoic representatives of extant genera have nitrogen isotopic compositions consistent with microbial N2 fixation. In contrast, all extinct cycad genera have nitrogen isotope ratios that are indistinguishable from co-existing non-cycad plants and generally inconsistent with microbial N2 fixation, pointing to nitrogen assimilation from soils and not through symbiosis. This pattern indicates that, rather than being ancestral within cycads, N2-fixing symbiosis arose independently in the lineages leading to living cycads during or after the Jurassic. The preferential survival of these lineages may therefore reflect the effects of competition with angiosperms and Cenozoic climatic change. Nitrogen isotopic measurements from fossilized cycad leaves and ancestral state reconstructions suggest that N2-fixing symbiosis arose independently in the lineages leading to extant cycads at some point during or after the Jurassic.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of natural habitats to farmland is a major cause of biodiversity loss and poses the greatest extinction risk to birds worldwide. Tropical raptors are of particular concern, being relatively slow-breeding apex predators and scavengers, whose disappearance can trigger extensive cascading effects. Many of Africa’s raptors are at considerable risk from habitat conversion, prey-base depletion and persecution, driven principally by human population expansion. Here we describe multiregional trends among 42 African raptor species, 88% of which have declined over a ca. 20–40-yr period, with 69% exceeding the International Union for Conservation of Nature criteria classifying species at risk of extinction. Large raptors had experienced significantly steeper declines than smaller species, and this disparity was more pronounced on unprotected land. Declines were greater in West Africa than elsewhere, and more than twice as severe outside of protected areas (PAs) than within. Worryingly, species suffering the steepest declines had become significantly more dependent on PAs, demonstrating the importance of expanding conservation areas to cover 30% of land by 2030—a key target agreed at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity COP15. Our findings also highlight the significance of a recent African-led proposal to strengthen PA management—initiatives considered fundamental to safeguarding global biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and climate resilience. A compilation of survey data from pre- and post-2000 for 42 raptor species across parts of West, Central, East and southern Africa shows 88% of species in population decline and reveals trends across regions, protected areas and species size.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the behaviour of complex microbial communities is challenging. However, this is essential for complex biotechnological processes such as those in biological wastewater treatment plants (BWWTPs), which require sustainable operation. Here we summarize 14 months of longitudinal meta-omics data from a BWWTP anaerobic tank into 17 temporal signals, explaining 91.1% of the temporal variance, and link those signals to ecological events within the community. We forecast the signals over the subsequent five years and use 21 extra samples collected at defined time intervals for testing and validation. Our forecasts are correct for six signals and hint on phenomena such as predation cycles. Using all the 17 forecasts and the environmental variables, we predict gene abundance and expression, with a coefficient of determination ≥0.87 for the subsequent three years. Our study demonstrates the ability to forecast the dynamics of open microbial ecosystems using interactions between community cycles and environmental parameters. Using high-resolution multi-omic data from biological wastewater treatment plants, the authors develop a method to forecast microbial community composition and function; the forecasting is accurate for 3 yr into the future.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies suggested that microbial communities can harbour keystone species whose removal can cause a dramatic shift in microbiome structure and functioning. Yet, an efficient method to systematically identify keystone species in microbial communities is still lacking. Here we propose a data-driven keystone species identification (DKI) framework based on deep learning to resolve this challenge. Our key idea is to implicitly learn the assembly rules of microbial communities from a particular habitat by training a deep-learning model using microbiome samples collected from this habitat. The well-trained deep-learning model enables us to quantify the community-specific keystoneness of each species in any microbiome sample from this habitat by conducting a thought experiment on species removal. We systematically validated this DKI framework using synthetic data and applied DKI to analyse real data. We found that those taxa with high median keystoneness across different communities display strong community specificity. The presented DKI framework demonstrates the power of machine learning in tackling a fundamental problem in community ecology, paving the way for the data-driven management of complex microbial communities. Using deep learning to identify the assembly rules of microbial communities from different habitats, the authors develop a framework to quantify and predict the community-specific keystoneness of each species in any microbiome sample.},
