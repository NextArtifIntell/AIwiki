  abstract     = {Naive pluripotent stem cells have the highest developmental potential but their in vivo existence in the blastocyst is transient. Here we report a blastocyst motif substrate for the in vitro reversion of mouse and human pluripotent stem cells to a naive state. The substrate features randomly varied microstructures, which we call motifs, mimicking the geometry of the blastocyst. Motifs representing mouse-blastocyst-scaled curvature ranging between 15 and 62 mm−1 were the most efficient in promoting reversion to naivety, as determined by time-resolved correlative analysis. In these substrates, apical constriction enhances E-cadherin/RAC1 signalling and activates the mechanosensitive nuclear transducer YAP, promoting the histone modification of pluripotency genes. This results in enhanced levels of pluripotency transcription factor NANOG, which persist even after cells are removed from the substrate. Pluripotent stem cells cultured in blastocyst motif substrates display a higher development potential in generating embryoid bodies and teratomas. These findings shed light on naivety-promoting substrate design and their large-scale implementation. Substrates with blastocyst-like microstructures effectively revert primed pluripotent stem cells to naivety by promoting cell–cell apical constriction and mechanoinduced epigenetic activation of naive pluripotency genes.},

  abstract     = {Nanoparticles are promising for drug delivery applications, with several clinically approved products. However, attaining high nanoparticle accumulation in solid tumours remains challenging. Here we show that tumour cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) block nanoparticle delivery to tumours, unveiling another barrier to nanoparticle-based tumour therapy. Tumour cells secrete large amounts of sEVs in the tumour microenvironment, which then bind to nanoparticles entering tumour tissue and traffic them to liver Kupffer cells for degradation. Knockdown of Rab27a, a gene that controls sEV secretion, decreases sEV levels and improves nanoparticle accumulation in tumour tissue. The therapeutic efficacy of messenger RNAs encoding tumour suppressing and proinflammatory proteins is greatly improved when co-encapsulated with Rab27a small interfering RNA in lipid nanoparticles. Together, our results demonstrate that tumour cell-derived sEVs act as a defence system against nanoparticle tumour delivery and that this system may be a potential target for improving nanoparticle-based tumour therapies. Cancer cell-derived small extracellular vesicles bind to therapeutic nanoparticles leading them from tumours to the liver for degradation. This mechanism is another barrier for the development of efficient nanoparticle-based cancer therapies.},

However, obtaining agile movement in diverse environments with dynamic steerability remains a challenge. Here we report a light-fuelled soft liquid crystal elastomer torus with self-sustained out-of-equilibrium movement. Under constant light excitation, the torus undergoes spontaneous rotation arising from the formation of zero-elastic-energy modes. By exploiting dynamic friction or drag, the zero-elastic-energy-mode-based locomotion direction can be optically controlled in various dry and fluid environments. We demonstrate the ability of the liquid crystal elastomer torus to laterally and vertically swim in the Stokes regime. The torus navigation can be extended to three-dimensional space with full steerability of the swimming direction. These results demonstrate the possibilities enabled by prestrained topological structures towards robotic functions of out-of-equilibrium soft matter. Zero-elastic-energy modes drive the self-sustained locomotion of a liquid crystal elastomer torus across various environments.},

  abstract     = {Transient electric fields across cell bilayer membranes can lead to electroporation and cell fusion, effects crucial to cell viability whose biological implications have been extensively studied. However, little is known about these behaviours in a materials context. Here we find that transmembrane electric fields can lead to a massive, reversible modulation of the sliding friction between surfaces coated with lipid-bilayer membranes—a 200-fold variation, up to two orders of magnitude greater than that achieved to date. Atomistic simulations reveal that the transverse fields, resembling those at cell membranes, lead to fully reversible electroporation of the confined bilayers and the formation of inter-bilayer bridges analogous to the stalks preceding intermembrane fusion. These increase the interfacial dissipation through reduced hydration at the slip plane, forcing it to revert in part from the low-dissipation, hydrated lipid–headgroup plane to the intra-bilayer, high-dissipation acyl tail interface. Our results demonstrate that lipid bilayers under transmembrane electric fields can have striking materials modification properties. Lipid bilayers under the influence of electric fields, similar to those across cell membranes, act as moderators of shear force between solid surfaces, presenting a new route to tuning interfacial properties across thin films.},

However, fundamental aspects of their many-body correlated electron–ion transport physics remain poorly understood. Here we show that in p-type organic electrochemical transistors it is possible to remove all of the electrons from the valence band and even access deeper bands without degradation. By adding a second, field-effect gate electrode, additional electrons or holes can be injected at set doping states. Under conditions where the counterions are unable to equilibrate in response to field-induced changes in the electronic carrier density, we observe surprising, non-equilibrium transport signatures that provide unique insights into the interaction-driven formation of a frozen, soft Coulomb gap in the density of states. Our work identifies new strategies for substantially enhancing the transport properties of conducting polymers by exploiting non-equilibrium states in the coupled system of electronic charges and counterions. Mixed ionic–electronic transport in conducting polymers remains poorly understood. Here the authors observe non-equilibrium electronic transport when counterions are unable to equilibrate in response to gate-injected electronic carriers.},

  abstract     = {PtM (M = S, Se, Te) dichalcogenides are promising two-dimensional materials for electronics, optoelectronics and gas sensors due to their high air stability, tunable bandgap and high carrier mobility. However, their potential as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is often underestimated due to their semiconducting properties and limited surface area from van der Waals stacking. Here we show an approach for synthesizing a highly efficient and stable ORR catalyst by restructuring defective platinum diselenide (DEF-PtSe2) through electrochemical cycling in an O2-saturated electrolyte. After 42,000 cycles, DEF-PtSe2 exhibited 1.3 times higher specific activity and 2.6 times higher mass activity compared with a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. Even after 126,000 cycles, it maintained superior ORR performance with minimal decay. Quantum mechanical calculations using hybrid density functional theory reveal that the improved performance is due to the synergistic contributions from Pt nanoparticles and the apical active sites on the DEF-PtSe2 surface. This work highlights the potential of DEF-PtSe2 as a durable electrocatalyst for ORR, offering insights into PtM dichalcogenide electrochemistry and the design of advanced catalysts. Defective platinum diselenide can serve as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction outperforming commercial Pt/C catalysts, which is achieved by a restructuring approach via electrochemical cycling.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal nitride (TMN-) based materials have recently emerged as promising non-precious-metal-containing electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. However, the lack of fundamental understanding of the oxide surface has limited insights into structure–(re)activity relationships and rational catalyst design. Here we demonstrate how a well-defined TMN can dictate/control the as-formed oxide surface and the resulting ORR electrocatalytic activity. Structural characterization of MnN nanocuboids revealed that an electrocatalytically active Mn3O4 shell grew epitaxially on the MnN core, with an expansive strain along the [010] direction to the surface Mn3O4. The strained Mn3O4 shell on the MnN core exhibited an intrinsic activity that was over 300% higher than that of pure Mn3O4. A combined electrochemical and computational investigation indicated/suggested that the enhancement probably originates from a more hydroxylated oxide surface resulting from the expansive strain. This work establishes a clear and definitive atomistic picture of the nitride/oxide interface and provides a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the structure–reactivity relationship in TMNs, critical for other catalytic interfaces for different electrochemical processes. While transition metal nitrides are promising low-cost electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, a fundamental understanding of their activity is still lacking.

We show that the preferential adsorption of the octoate moiety on the Cu substrate induces the construction of a carbonate-less protective layer, which inhibits the side reactions and contributes to the uniform Li plating. In the mean time, the reduction of Sn2+ at the initial charging process builds a stable lithophilic layer of Cu6Sn5 alloy and Sn, improving the affinity between the Li and the Cu substrate. Notably, anode-free Li metal pouch cells with tin octoate additive demonstrate good cycling stability with a high coulombic efficiency of ~99.1%. Furthermore, this in situ p-block layer plating strategy is also demonstrated with other types of p-block metal octoate, as well as a Na metal battery system, demonstrating the high level of universality.

Various strategies have been reported so far to control the morphology of electrodeposited alkali metal films to be homogeneous and dense, but until now, the microstructure of electrodeposited alkali metal is unknown, and a suitable characterization route is yet to be identified. Here we establish a reproducible protocol for characterizing the size and orientation of metal grains in differently processed lithium and sodium samples by a combination of focused ion beam and electron backscatter diffraction. Electrodeposited films at Cu|Li6.5Ta0.5La3Zr1.5O12, steel|Li6PS5Cl and Al|Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 interfaces were characterized. The analyses show large grain sizes (&amp;gt;100 µm) within these films and a preferential orientation of grain boundaries. Furthermore, metal growth and dissolution were investigated using in situ electron backscatter diffraction, showing a dynamic grain coarsening during electrodeposition and pore formation within grains during dissolution. Our methodology and results deepen the research field for the improvement of solid-state battery performance through a characterization of the alkali metal microstructure. The microstructure of alkali metals in anode-free cells is currently unknown.

  abstract     = {Non-reciprocal charge transport has gained significant attention due to its potential in exploring quantum symmetry and its promising applications. Traditionally, non-reciprocal transport has been observed in the longitudinal direction, with non-reciprocal resistance being a small fraction of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a transverse non-reciprocal transport phenomenon featuring a quadratic current–voltage characteristic and divergent non-reciprocity, termed the non-reciprocal Hall effect. This effect is observed in microscale Hall devices fabricated from platinum (Pt) deposited by a focused ion beam on silicon substrates. The transverse non-reciprocal Hall effect arises from the geometrically asymmetric scattering of textured Pt nanoparticles within the focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt structures. Notably, the non-reciprocal Hall effect generated in focused-ion-beam-deposited Pt electrodes can propagate to adjacent conductors such as Au and NbP through Hall current injection. Additionally, this pronounced non-reciprocal Hall effect facilitates broadband frequency mixing. These findings not only validate the non-reciprocal Hall effect concept but also open avenues for its application in terahertz communication, imaging and energy harvesting. Non-reciprocal charge transport has potential for applications but is usually weak. Here the authors report a room-temperature divergent non-reciprocal Hall effect in devices made of Pt deposited on Si substrates.},

  abstract     = {Second-order superlattices form when moiré superlattices with similar periodicities interfere with each other, leading to larger superlattice periodicities. These crystalline structures are engineered using two-dimensional materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, and the specific alignment plays a crucial role in facilitating correlation-driven topological phases. Signatures of second-order superlattices have been identified in magnetotransport experiments; however, real-space visualization is still lacking. Here we reveal the second-order superlattice in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene closely aligned with hexagonal boron nitride through electronic transport measurements and cryogenic nanoscale photovoltage measurements and evidenced by long-range periodic photovoltage modulations. Our results show that even minuscule strain and twist-angle variations as small as 0.01° can lead to drastic changes in the second-order superlattice structure. Our real-space observations, therefore, serve as a ‘magnifying glass’ for strain and twist angle and can elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the breaking of spatial symmetries in twisted bilayer graphene. Second-order superlattices emerging in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride are visualized in real space through cryogenic nano-imaging, revealing the impact of strain and twist-angle variations.},

  abstract     = {Platinum (Pt) oxides are vital catalysts in numerous reactions, but research indicates that they decompose at high temperatures, limiting their use in high-temperature applications. In this study, we identify a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline Pt oxide with remarkable thermal stability (1,200 K under nitrogen dioxide) using a suite of in situ methods. This 2D Pt oxide, characterized by a honeycomb lattice of Pt atoms encased between dual oxygen layers forming a six-pointed star structure, exhibits minimized in-plane stress and enhanced vertical bonding due to its unique structure, as revealed by theoretical simulations. These features contribute to its high thermal stability. Multiscale in situ observations trace the formation of this 2D Pt oxide from α-PtO2, providing insights into its formation mechanism from the atomic to the millimetre scale. This 2D Pt oxide with outstanding thermal stability and distinct surface electronic structure subverts the previously held notion that Pt oxides do not exist at high temperatures and can also present unique catalytic capabilities. This work expands our understanding of Pt oxidation species and sheds light on the oxidative and catalytic behaviours of Pt oxide in high-temperature settings. Pt oxides are essential catalysts in many critical reactions, but are typically unstable and prone to evaporation above 700 K. A two-dimensional layered Pt oxide with exceptional thermal stability is introduced, capable of surviving at high temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Nanoscale three-dimensional (3D) printing of metals and alloys has faced challenges in speed, miniaturization and deficiency in material properties. Traditional nanomanufacturing relies on lithographic methods with material constraints, limited resolution and slow layer-by-layer processing. This work introduces polymer-free techniques using two-photon decomposition and optical force trapping for free-space direct 3D printing of metals, metal oxides and multimetallic alloys with resolutions beyond optical limits. This method involves the two-photon decomposition of metal atoms from precursors, rapid assembly into nanoclusters via optical forces and ultrafast laser sintering, yielding dense, smooth nanostructures. Enhanced near-field optical forces from laser-induced localized surface plasmon resonance facilitate nanocluster aggregation. Our approach eliminates the need for organic materials, layer-by-layer printing and complex post-processing. Printed Mo nanowires show an excellent mechanical performance, closely resembling the behaviour of single crystals, while Mo–Co–W alloy nanowires outperform Mo nanowires. This innovation promises the customizable 3D nanoprinting of high-quality metals and metal oxides, impacting nanoelectronics, nanorobotics and advanced chip manufacturing. A polymer-free 3D printing technique of metals and alloys, using two-photon decomposition and optical force trapping, is presented. It achieves dense and smooth nanostructures with a resolution beyond optical limits.},

  abstract     = {Superconductivity and magnetism are often antagonistic in quantum matter, although their intertwining has long been considered in frustrated-lattice systems. Here we utilize scanning tunnelling microscopy and muon spin resonance to demonstrate time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductivity in kagome metal Cs(V, Ta)3Sb5, where the Cooper pairing exhibits magnetism and is modulated by it. In the magnetic channel, we observe spontaneous internal magnetism in a fully gapped superconducting state. Under the perturbation of inverse magnetic fields, we detect a time-reversal asymmetrical interference of Bogoliubov quasi-particles at a circular vector. At this vector, the pairing gap spontaneously modulates, which is distinct from pair density waves occurring at a point vector and consistent with the theoretical proposal of an unusual interference effect under time-reversal symmetry breaking. The correlation between internal magnetism, Bogoliubov quasi-particles and pairing modulation provides a chain of experimental indications for time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagome superconductivity. The authors use scanning tunnelling microscopy and muon spin resonance to demonstrate time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductivity in Cs(V, Ta)3Sb5.

  abstract     = {Lignin is an abundant source of renewable aromatics that has long been targeted for valorization. Traditionally, the inherent heterogeneity and reactivity of lignin has relegated it to direct combustion, but its higher energy density compared with polysaccharides makes it an ideal candidate for biofuel production. This Review critically assesses lignin’s potential as a substrate for sustainable aviation fuel blendstocks. Lignin can generate the necessary cyclic compounds for a fully renewable, sustainable aviation fuel when integrated with current paraffinic blends and can meet the current demand 2.5 times over. Using an energy-centric analysis, we show that lignin conversion technologies have the near-term potential to match the enthalpic yields of existing commercial sustainable aviation fuel production processes. Key factors influencing the viability of technologies for converting lignin to sustainable aviation fuel include lignin structure, delignification extent, depolymerization performance, and the development of stable and tunable deoxygenation catalysts. Lignin is an abundant source of renewable aromatic carbon and is of interest as a feedstock for sustainable fuels. This Review provides an overview of production technologies, jet fuel requirements, effects of lignin chemistry, depolymerization techniques, upgrading of bio-oils and challenges for catalysis using real biomass feedstocks.},

  abstract     = {Jamming of cell collectives and associated rigidity transitions have been shown to play a key role in tissue dynamics, structure and morphogenesis. Cellular jamming is controlled by cellular density and the mechanics of cell–cell contacts. However, the contribution of subcellular organelles to the physical state of the emergent tissue is unclear. Here we report a nuclear jamming transition in zebrafish retina and brain tissues, where physical interactions between highly packed nuclei restrict cellular movements and control tissue mechanics and architecture. Computational modelling suggests that the nuclear volume fraction and anisotropy of cells control the emerging tissue physical state. Analysis of tissue architecture, mechanics and nuclear movements during eye development show that retina tissues undergo a nuclear jamming transition as they form, with increasing nuclear packing leading to more ordered cellular arrangements, reminiscent of the crystalline cellular packings in the functional adult eye. Our results reveal an important role of the cell nucleus in tissue mechanics and architecture. Developing zebrafish retina and brain tissues undergo a nuclear jamming transition that induces crystalline-like cellular ordering, with the emergent tissue stiffness controlled by nuclear mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Urinary collecting tubules form during kidney embryogenesis through the branching of the ureteric bud epithelium. A travelling mesenchyme niche of nephron progenitor cells caps each branching ureteric bud tip. These ‘tip domain’ niches pack more closely over developmental time and their number relates to nephron endowment at birth. Yet, how the crowded tissue environment impacts niche number and cell decision-making remains unclear. Here, through experiments and mathematical modelling, we show that niche packing conforms to physical limitations imposed by kidney curvature. We relate packing geometries to rigidity theory to predict a stiffening transition starting at embryonic day 15 in the mouse, validated by micromechanical analysis. Using a method to estimate tip domain ‘ages’ relative to their most recent branch events, we find that new niches overcome mechanical resistance as they branch and displace neighbours. This creates rhythmic mechanical stress in the niche. These findings expand our understanding of kidney development and inform engineering strategies for synthetic regenerative tissues. Geometric packing of tubules in the developing kidney urinary collecting system leads to tissue stiffening and rhythmic mechanical stresses local to nephron-forming niches that synchronize with tubule branching.},

  abstract     = {Morphogenesis requires embryonic cells to generate forces and perform mechanical work to shape their tissues. Incorrect functioning of these force fields can lead to congenital malformations. Understanding these dynamic processes requires the quantification and profiling of three-dimensional mechanics during evolving vertebrate morphogenesis. Here we describe elastic spring-like force sensors with micrometre-level resolution, fabricated by intravital three-dimensional bioprinting directly in the closing neural tubes of growing chicken embryos. Integration of calibrated sensor read-outs with computational mechanical modelling allows direct quantification of the forces and work performed by the embryonic tissues. As they displace towards the embryonic midline, the two halves of the closing neural tube reach a compression of over a hundred nano-newtons during neural fold apposition. Pharmacological inhibition of Rho-associated kinase to decrease the pro-closure force shows the existence of active anti-closure forces, which progressively widen the neural tube and must be overcome to achieve neural tube closure. Overall, our approach and findings highlight the intricate interplay between mechanical forces and tissue morphogenesis. Hydrogel force sensors directly bioprinted into embryonic tissues quantify the forces driving tissue remodelling and reveal the existence of mechanisms that counteract tissue morphogenesis.},

  abstract     = {To fulfil their function, epithelial tissues need to sustain mechanical stresses and avoid rupture. Although rupture is usually undesired, it is central to some developmental processes, for example, blastocoel formation. Nonetheless, little is known about tissue rupture because it is a multiscale phenomenon that necessitates comprehension of the interplay between mechanical forces and biological processes at the molecular and cellular scales. Here we characterize rupture in epithelial monolayers using mechanical measurements, live imaging and computational modelling. We show that despite consisting of only a single layer of cells, monolayers can withstand surprisingly large deformations, often accommodating several-fold increases in their length before rupture. At large deformation, epithelia increase their stiffness multiple fold in a process controlled by a supracellular network of keratin filaments. Perturbing the keratin network organization fragilized the monolayers and prevented strain-stiffening. Although the kinetics of adhesive bond rupture ultimately control tissue strength, tissue rheology and the history of deformation set the strain and stress at the onset of fracture. Tissue monolayers avoid rupture at large tensile stresses through a strain-stiffening process governed by intermediate keratin filaments.},

Here we use optical tweezers to show that ions involved in physiological chromosome condensation are crucial for chromosomal stability, stiffness and viscous dissipation. We combine these experiments with high-salt histone depletion and theory to show that chromosomal elasticity originates from the chromatin fibre behaving as a flexible polymer, whereas energy dissipation can be explained by modelling chromatin loops as an entangled polymer solution. Taken together, we show how collective properties of mitotic chromosomes, a biomaterial of incredible complexity, emerge from molecular properties, and how they are controlled by the physico-chemical environment. The physical mechanisms that govern chromosomal viscoelasticity remain elusive.

However, their realization has been limited by the contradictory requirements of robust reusability and high sensing capability to multiple interactions among transducer surface, sensing probes and target analytes. Here we propose a drug-mediated organic electrochemical transistor as a robust, reusable epidermal growth factor receptor sensor with striking sensitivity and selectivity. By electrostatically adsorbing protonated gefitinib onto poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate and leveraging its strong binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor target, the device operates with a unique refresh-in-sensing mechanism. It not only yields an ultralow limit-of-detection concentration down to 5.74 fg ml−1 for epidermal growth factor receptor but, more importantly, also produces an unprecedented regeneration cycle exceeding 200. We further validate the potential of our devices for easy-to-use biomedical applications by creating an 8 × 12 diagnostic drug-mediated organic electrochemical transistor array with excellent uniformity to clinical blood samples. Both reusability and sensing capability of biosensors are required but usually challenging to achieve. Here a reusable and highly sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor sensor based on a drug-mediated organic electrochemical transistor is reported.},

Polymers have been explored for decades as solid-state electrolytes by either adding salt to polar polymers or tethering ions to the backbone to create less flammable and more robust systems. New design paradigms are needed to advance the performance of solid polymer electrolytes beyond conventional systems. Here the role of a helical secondary structure is shown to greatly enhance the conductivity of solvent-free polymer electrolytes using cationic polypeptides with a mobile anion. Longer helices lead to higher conductivity, and random coil peptides show substantially lower conductivity. The macrodipole of the helix increases with peptide length, leading to larger dielectric constants. The hydrogen bonding of the helix also imparts thermal and electrochemical stability, while allowing for facile dissolution back to monomer in acid. Peptide polymer electrolytes present a promising platform for the design of next-generation ion-transporting materials.

At 298 K, MIL-125-Zn exhibits a benzene uptake of 7.63 mmol g−1 at 1.2 mbar and 5.33 mmol g−1 at 0.12 mbar, and breakthrough experiments confirm the removal of trace benzene (from 5 to &amp;lt;0.5 ppm) from air (up to 111,000 min g−1 of metal–organic framework), even after exposure to moisture. The binding of benzene to the defect and open Zn(II) sites at low pressure has been visualized by diffraction, scattering and spectroscopy. This work highlights the importance of fine-tuning pore chemistry for designing adsorbents for the removal of air pollutants. Benzene is a genotoxic carcinogen with no safe level of exposure. Here, by creating and decorating a structural defect in a metal–organic framework to form MIL-125-Zn, a benzene uptake of 7.63 mmol g–1 at 1.2 mbar is observed due to binding to Zn(II) sites.},

Recent studies have expanded the scope of magnetoresistances to the nonlinear regime, such as a bilinear magnetoelectric resistance (BMER), which is proportional to both electric field and magnetic field. Here we demonstrate that the BMER is a general phenomenon that arises even in three-dimensional systems without explicit momentum-space spin textures. Our theory suggests that the spin Hall effect enables the BMER provided that the magnitudes of spin accumulation at the top and bottom interfaces are not identical. The sign of the BMER follows the sign of the spin Hall effect of heavy metals, thereby evidencing that the BMER originates from the bulk spin Hall effect. Our observation suggests that the BMER serves as a general nonlinear transport characteristic in three-dimensional systems, especially playing a crucial role in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

For specific twist angles, we detect a spin component radial with the electron’s momentum, in addition to the standard orthogonal component. Our results show that the helicity of the spin texture can be reversed by twist angle, highlighting the critical role of the twist angle in the spin–orbit properties of WSe2/graphene heterostructures and paving the way for the development of spin-twistronic devices. The authors experimentally demonstrate twist-angle modulation of the spin texture in graphene-based heterostructures.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising protection layer for dielectric integration in the next-generation large-scale integrated electronics. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to growing single-crystal hBN film, wafer-scale ultraflat hBN has still not been achieved. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of 4 in. ultraflat single-crystal hBN on Cu0.8Ni0.2(111)/sapphire wafers. The strong coupling between hBN and Cu0.8Ni0.2(111) suppresses the formation of wrinkles and ensures the seamless stitching of parallelly aligned hBN domains, resulting in an ultraflat single-crystal hBN film on a wafer scale. Using the ultraflat hBN as a protective layer, we integrate the wafer-scale ultrathin high-κ dielectrics onto two-dimensional (2D) materials with a damage-free interface. The obtained hBN/HfO2 composite dielectric exhibits an ultralow current leakage (2.36 × 10−6 A cm−2) and an ultrathin equivalent oxide thickness of 0.52 nm, which meets the targets of the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems. Our findings pave the way to the synthesis of ultraflat 2D materials and integration of future 2D electronics. The synthesis of wafer-scale ultraflat single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride film is realized by strong coupling to a Cu0.8Ni0.2(111)/sapphire wafer, providing a potential method for industry-compatible high-κ dielectric integration in two-dimensional electronics.},

  abstract     = {Harnessing the rich nonlinear dynamics of highly deformable materials has the potential to unlock the next generation of functional smart materials and devices. However, unlocking such potential requires effective strategies to spatially engineer material architectures within the nonlinear dynamic regime. Here we introduce an inverse-design framework to discover flexible mechanical metamaterials with a target nonlinear dynamic response. The desired dynamic task is encoded via optimal tuning of the full-scale metamaterial geometry through an inverse-design approach powered by a fully differentiable simulation environment. By deploying such a strategy, mechanical metamaterials are tailored for energy focusing, energy splitting, dynamic protection and nonlinear motion conversion. Furthermore, our design framework can be expanded to automatically discover reprogrammable architectures capable of switching between different dynamic tasks. For instance, we encode two strongly competing tasks—energy focusing and dynamic protection—within a single architecture, using static precompression to switch between these behaviours. The discovered designs are physically realized and experimentally tested, demonstrating the robustness of the engineered tasks. Our approach opens an untapped avenue towards designer materials with tailored robotic-like reprogrammable functionalities. A framework is presented to automate the design of flexible metamaterial structures that can execute desired nonlinear dynamic tasks and have reprogrammable functionality.},

  abstract     = {We are at an inflection point in computing where traditional technologies are incapable of keeping up with the demands of exploding data collection and artificial intelligence. This challenge demands a leap to a new platform as transformative as the digital silicon revolution. Over the past 30 years molecular materials for computing have generated great excitement but continually fallen short of performance and reliability requirements. However, recent reports indicate that those historical limitations may have been resolved. Here we assess the current state of computing with molecular-based materials, especially using transition metal complexes of redox active ligands, in the context of neuromorphic computing. We describe two complementary research paths necessary to determine whether molecular materials can be the basis of a new computing technology: continued exploration of the molecular electronic properties that enable computation and, equally important, the process development for on-chip integration of molecular materials. Molecular materials for computing progress intensively but the performance and reliability still lag behind. Here the authors assess the current state of computing with molecular-based materials and describe two issues as the basis of a new computing technology: continued exploration of molecular electronic properties and process development for on-chip integration.},

Here we report an inulin gel formulated with an allergen that normalizes the dysregulated ileal microbiota and metabolites in allergic mice, establishes allergen-specific oral tolerance and achieves robust oral immunotherapy efficacy with sustained unresponsiveness in food allergy models. These positive outcomes are associated with enhanced allergen uptake by antigen-sampling dendritic cells in the small intestine, suppressed pathogenic type 2 immune responses, increased interferon-γ+ and interleukin-10+ regulatory T cell populations, and restored ileal abundances of Eggerthellaceae and Enterorhabdus in allergic mice. Overall, our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of the engineered allergen gel as a suitable microbiome-modulating platform for food allergy and other allergic diseases.

We develop a high-throughput pipeline to define species-specific materials that enable survival through drying, elevated temperatures, organic solvents and ionizing radiation. Using this pipeline, we enhance the stability of E. coli Nissle 1917 by more than four orders of magnitude over commercial formulations and demonstrate its capacity to remain viable while undergoing tableting and pharmaceutical processing. We further show, in live animals and plants, that synthetic extremophiles remain functional against enteric pathogens and as nitrogen-fixing plant supplements even after exposure to elevated temperatures. This synthetic, material-based stabilization enhances our capacity to apply microorganisms in extreme environments on Earth and potentially during exploratory space travel. A high-throughput screen of substances generally recognized as safe identifies species-specific materials that stabilize live microbial therapeutics as powders, making them robust to pharmaceutical manufacturing workflows.},

Here we report an engineered accumulated strain energy-fracture power-amplification method that is inspired by the pressurized fluidic squirting mechanism of Ecballium elaterium (squirting cucumber plants). We realize a light-driven hydrogel launcher that harnesses fast liquid vapourization triggered by the photothermal response of an embedded graphene suspension. This vapourization leads to appreciable elastic energy storage within the surrounding hydrogel network, followed by rapid elastic energy release within 0.3 ms. These soft hydrogel robots achieve controlled launching at high velocity with a predictable trajectory. The accumulated strain energy-fracture method was used to create an artificial squirting cucumber that disperses artificial seeds over metres, which can further achieve smart seeding through an integrated radio-frequency identification chip. This power-amplification strategy provides a basis for propulsive motion to advance the capabilities of miniaturized soft robotic systems. Propulsive motion in soft robotic systems requires the power amplification of stored energy.

  abstract     = {The voltage penalty driving water dissociation (WD) at high current density is a major obstacle in the commercialization of bipolar membrane (BPM) technology for energy devices. Here we show that three materials descriptors, that is, electrical conductivity, microscopic surface area and (nominal) surface-hydroxyl coverage, effectively control the kinetics of WD in BPMs. Using these descriptors and optimizing mass loading, we design new earth-abundant WD catalysts based on nanoparticle SnO2 synthesized at low temperature with high conductivity and hydroxyl coverage. These catalysts exhibit exceptional performance in a BPM electrolyser with low WD overvoltage (ηwd) of 100 ± 20 mV at 1.0 A cm−2. The new catalyst works equivalently well with hydrocarbon proton-exchange layers as it does with fluorocarbon-based Nafion, thus providing pathways to commercializing advanced BPMs for a broad array of electrolysis, fuel-cell and electrodialysis applications. The voltage penalty driving water dissociation at high current density is a challenge for bipolar-membrane-based energy devices. Materials descriptors such as electrical conductivity, microscopic surface area and surface-hydroxyl coverage are now shown to control water dissociation kinetics in these membranes.},

  abstract     = {Advanced transfer printing technologies have enabled the fabrication of high-performance flexible and stretchable devices, revolutionizing many research fields including soft electronics, optoelectronics, bioelectronics and energy devices. Despite previous innovations, challenges remain, such as safety concerns due to toxic chemicals, the expensive equipment, film damage during the transfer process and difficulty in high-temperature processing. Thus a new transfer printing process is needed for the commercialization of high-performance soft electronic devices. Here we propose a damage-free dry transfer printing strategy based on stress control of the deposited thin films. First, stress-controlled metal bilayer films are deposited using direct current magnetron sputtering. Subsequently, mechanical bending is applied to facilitate the release of the metal bilayer by increasing the overall stress. Experimental and simulation studies elucidate the stress evolution mechanisms during the processes. By using this method, we successfully transfer metal thin films and high-temperature-treated oxide thin films onto flexible or stretchable substrates, enabling the fabrication of two-dimensional flexible electronic devices and three-dimensional multifunctional devices. Current transfer printing technologies enable versatile flexible devices but challenges remain. Here the authors report a facile, versatile and damage-free dry transfer printing strategy based on stress control of the deposited thin films.},

  abstract     = {Novel two-dimensional semiconductor crystals can exhibit diverse physical properties beyond their inherent semiconducting attributes, making their pursuit paramount. Memristive properties, as exemplars of these attributes, are predominantly manifested in wide-bandgap materials. However, simultaneously harnessing semiconductor properties alongside memristive characteristics to produce memtransistors is challenging. Herein we prepared a class of semiconducting III–V-derived van der Waals crystals, specifically the HxA1–xBX form, exhibiting memristive characteristics. To identify candidates for the material synthesis, we conducted a systematic high-throughput screening, leading us to 44 prospective III–V candidates; of these, we successfully synthesized ten, including nitrides, phosphides, arsenides and antimonides. These materials exhibited intriguing characteristics such as electrochemical polarization and memristive phenomena while retaining their semiconductive attributes. We demonstrated the gate-tunable synaptic and logic functions within single-gate memtransistors, capitalizing on the synergistic interplay between the semiconducting and memristive properties of our two-dimensional crystals. Our approach guides the discovery of van der Waals materials with unique properties from unconventional crystal symmetries. New two-dimensional semiconductors may exhibit properties beyond inherent semiconducting attributes.

  abstract     = {Ultrafast stimuli can stabilize metastable states of matter inaccessible by equilibrium means. Establishing the spatiotemporal link between ultrafast excitation and metastability is crucial to understand these phenomena. Here we utilize single-shot optical pump–X-ray probe measurements to capture snapshots of the emergence of a persistent polar vortex supercrystal in a heterostructure that hosts a fine balance between built-in electrostatic and elastic frustrations by design. By perturbing this balance with photoinduced charges, an initially heterogeneous mixture of polar phase disorders within a few picoseconds, leading to a state composed of disordered ferroelectric and suppressed vortex orders. On the picosecond–nanosecond timescales, transient labyrinthine fluctuations develop, accompanied by the recovery of the vortex order. On longer timescales, these fluctuations are progressively quenched by dynamical strain modulations, which drive the collective emergence of a single vortex supercrystal phase. Our results, corroborated by dynamical phase-field modelling, reveal non-equilibrium pathways following the ultrafast excitation of designer systems to persistent metastability. Understanding transformations of non-equilibrium materials is a key open scientific question. Here the pathway by which different polar supertextures undergo dynamical correlations and collectively transform into a metastable supercrystal state is revealed experimentally and theoretically over seven orders of magnitude timescale.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and deterministic nonlinear phononic interactions could revolutionize classical and quantum information processing at radio frequencies in much the same way that nonlinear photonic interactions have at optical frequencies. Here we show that in the important class of phononic materials that are piezoelectric, deterministic nonlinear phononic interactions can be enhanced by orders of magnitude via the heterogeneous integration of high-mobility semiconductor materials. To this end, a lithium niobate and indium gallium arsenide heterostructure is utilized to produce the most efficient three- and four-wave phononic mixing to date, to the best of our knowledge. We then show that the conversion efficiency can be further enhanced by applying semiconductor bias fields that amplify the phonons. We present a theoretical model that accurately predicts the three-wave mixing efficiencies in this work and extrapolate that these nonlinearities can be enhanced far beyond what is demonstrated here by confining phonons to smaller dimensions in waveguides and optimizing the semiconductor material properties. Efficient phononic nonlinear processes are demonstrated in an acoustoelectric heterostructure combining a high-mobility semiconductor indium gallium arsenide film heterogeneously integrated onto a lithium niobate thin film.},

Despite rapid progress reported across several candidate systems, those possessing quantum coherent single spins at room temperature remain extremely rare. Here we report quantum coherent control under ambient conditions of a single-photon-emitting defect spin in a layered van der Waals material, namely, hexagonal boron nitride. We identify that the carbon-related defect has a spin-triplet electronic ground-state manifold. We demonstrate that the spin coherence is predominantly governed by coupling to only a few proximal nuclei and is prolonged by decoupling protocols. Our results serve to introduce a new platform to realize a room-temperature spin qubit coupled to a multiqubit quantum register or quantum sensor with nanoscale sample proximity. Quantum coherent control of single-photon-emitting defect spins have been reported in hexagonal boron nitride, revealing that spin coherence is mainly governed by coupling to a few proximal nuclei and can be prolonged by decoupling protocols.},

  abstract     = {Iron-based 1111-type superconductors display high critical temperatures and relatively high critical current densities Jc. The typical approach to increasing Jc is to introduce defects to control dissipative vortex motion. However, when optimized, this approach is theoretically predicted to be limited to achieving a maximum Jc of only ∼30% of the depairing current density Jd, which depends on the coherence length and the penetration depth. Here we dramatically boost Jc in SmFeAsO1–xHx films using a thermodynamic approach aimed at increasing Jd and incorporating vortex pinning centres. Specifically, we reduce the penetration depth, coherence length and critical field anisotropy by increasing the carrier density through high electron doping using H substitution. Remarkably, the quadrupled Jd reaches 415 MA cm–2, a value comparable to cuprates. Finally, by introducing defects using proton irradiation, we obtain high Jc values in fields up to 25 T. We apply this method to other iron-based superconductors and achieve a similar enhancement of current densities. The authors report very high in-field critical current densities in Fe-based superconductors. They achieve this through doping to increase the carrier density and adding defects to pin vortices.},

However, current methods are mainly limited to the transitions among phases with unchanged chemical stoichiometry. Here we propose on-device phase engineering that allows us to realize various lattice phases with distinct chemical stoichiometries. Using palladium and selenide as a model system, we show that a PdSe2 channel with prepatterned Pd electrodes can be transformed into Pd17Se15 and Pd4Se by thermally tailoring the chemical composition ratio of the channel. Different phase configurations can be obtained by precisely controlling the thickness and spacing of the electrodes. The device can be thus engineered to implement versatile functions in situ, such as exhibiting superconducting behaviour and achieving ultralow-contact resistance, as well as customizing the synthesis of electrocatalysts. The proposed on-device phase engineering approach exhibits a universal mechanism and can be expanded to 29 element combinations between a metal and chalcogen. Our work highlights on-device phase engineering as a promising research approach through which to exploit fundamental properties as well as their applications.

However, due to the metastable nature of 1T′-TMDs, the controlled synthesis of 1T′-TMD monolayers (MLs) with high phase purity and stability still remains a challenge. Here we report that 4H-Au nanowires (NWs), when used as templates, can induce the quasi-epitaxial growth of high-phase-purity and stable 1T′-TMD MLs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2 and MoSe2, via a facile and rapid wet-chemical method. The as-synthesized 4H-Au@1T′-TMD core–shell NWs can be used for ultrasensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. For instance, the 4H-Au@1T′-WS2 NWs have achieved attomole-level SERS detections of Rhodamine 6G and a variety of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins. This work provides insights into the preparation of high-phase-purity and stable 1T′-TMD MLs on metal substrates or templates, showing great potential in various promising applications.

  abstract     = {Helicity in solids often arises from the precise ordering of cooperative intra- and intermolecular interactions unique to natural, organic or molecular systems. This exclusivity limited the realization of helicity and its ensuing properties in dense inorganic solids. Here we report that Ga atoms in GaSeI, a representative III–VI–VII one-dimensional (1D) van der Waals crystal, manifest the rare Boerdijk–Coxeter helix motif. This motif is a non-repeating geometric pattern characterized by 1D face-sharing tetrahedra whose adjacent vertices are rotated by an irrational angle. Using InSeI and GaSeI, we show that the modularity of 1D van der Waals lattices accommodates the systematic twisting of a periodic tetrahelix with a 41 screw axis in InSeI to an infinitely extending Boerdijk–Coxeter helix in GaSeI. GaSeI crystals are non-centrosymmetric, optically active and exfoliable to a single chain. These results present a materials platform towards understanding the origin and physical manifestation of aperiodic helicity in low-dimensional solids. Helical motifs in dense inorganic solids have remained exceedingly scarce. Now a type of 1D van der Waals helical crystal, GaSeI, is presented that manifests the rare quasi-periodic Boerdijk–Coxeter helix motif.},

  abstract     = {Most two-dimensional (2D) materials experimentally studied so far have hexagons as their building blocks. Only a few exceptions, such as PdSe2, are lower in energy in pentagonal phases and exhibit pentagons as building blocks. Although theory has predicted a large number of pentagonal 2D materials, many of these are metastable and their experimental realization is difficult. Here we report the successful synthesis of a metastable pentagonal 2D material, monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, by symmetry-driven epitaxy. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and complementary spectroscopy measurements are used to characterize this material, which demonstrates well-ordered low-symmetry atomic arrangements and is stabilized by lattice matching with the underlying Pd(100) substrate. Theoretical calculations, along with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, reveal monolayer pentagonal PdTe2 to be a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.05 eV. Our work opens an avenue for the synthesis of pentagon-based 2D materials and gives opportunities to explore their applications such as multifunctional nanoelectronics. A metastable pentagonal PdTe2 monolayer has been synthesized through symmetry-driven epitaxy, utilizing lattice matching with a Pd(100) substrate.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, which feature atomically thin geometry and dangling-bond-free surfaces, have attracted intense interest for diverse technology applications, including ultra-miniaturized transistors towards the subnanometre scale. A straightforward exfoliation-and-restacking approach has been widely used for nearly arbitrary assembly of diverse two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures, superlattices and moiré superlattices, providing a versatile materials platform for fundamental investigations of exotic physical phenomena and proof-of-concept device demonstrations. While this approach has contributed importantly to the recent flourishing of 2D materials research, it is clearly unsuitable for practical technologies. Capturing the full potential of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides requires robust and scalable synthesis of these atomically thin materials and their heterostructures with designable spatial modulation of chemical compositions and electronic structures. The extreme aspect ratio, lack of intrinsic substrate and highly delicate nature of the atomically thin crystals present fundamental difficulties in material synthesis. Here we summarize the key challenges, highlight current advances and outline opportunities in the scalable synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenide-based heterostructures, superlattices and moiré superlattices. The practical application of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) requires robust and scalable synthesis of these atomically thin materials and their heterostructures. This Review discusses the key challenges, current progress and opportunities in the controllable synthesis of TMD-based heterostructures, superlattices and moiré superlattices.},

While liquid formulations are easier to ingest, they lack the capacity to localize therapeutics with excipients nor act as controlled release devices. Here we describe drug formulations based on liquid in situ-forming tough (LIFT) hydrogels that bridge the advantages of solid and liquid dosage forms. LIFT hydrogels form directly in the stomach through sequential ingestion of a crosslinker solution of calcium and dithiol crosslinkers, followed by a drug-containing polymer solution of alginate and four-arm poly(ethylene glycol)-maleimide. We show that LIFT hydrogels robustly form in the stomachs of live rats and pigs, and are mechanically tough, biocompatible and safely cleared after 24 h. LIFT hydrogels deliver a total drug dose comparable to unencapsulated drug in a controlled manner, and protect encapsulated therapeutic enzymes and bacteria from gastric acid-mediated deactivation. Overall, LIFT hydrogels may expand access to advanced therapeutics for patients with difficulty swallowing. Sequential drinks of crosslinker and polymer solutions form a tough hydrogel in the stomach, enabling delivery of drugs and biologics in this harsh chemical environment.},

  abstract     = {Living systems are complex dynamic entities that operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Their active, non-equilibrium behaviour requires energy to drive cellular organization and dynamics. Unfortunately, most statistical mechanics approaches are not valid in non-equilibrium situations, forcing researchers to use intricate and often invasive methods to study living processes. Here we experimentally demonstrate that an observable termed mean back relaxation quantifies the active mechanics of living cells from passively observed particle trajectories. The mean back relaxation represents the average trajectory of a particle after a recent motion and is calculated from three-point probabilities. We show that this parameter allows the detection of broken detailed balance in confined systems. We experimentally observe that it provides access to the non-equilibrium generating energy and viscoelastic properties of artificial bulk materials and living cells. These findings suggest that the mean back relaxation can function as a marker of non-equilibrium dynamics and is a non-invasive avenue to determine viscoelastic material properties from passive measurements. An approach based on the average trajectory of moving particles allows for the quantification of the mechanics of living systems, namely, the non-equilibrium energy and viscoelastic properties of cells, in a non-invasive manner.},

  abstract     = {Chirality is ubiquitous in nature across all length scales, with major implications spanning fields from biology, chemistry and physics to materials science. How chirality propagates from nanoscale building blocks to meso- and macroscopic helical structures remains an open issue. Here, working with a canonical system of filamentous viruses, we demonstrate that their self-assembly into chiral liquid crystal phases quantitatively results from the interplay between two main mechanisms of chirality transfer: electrostatic interactions from the helical charge patterns on the virus surface, and fluctuation-based helical deformations leading to viral backbone helicity. Our experimental and theoretical approach provides a comprehensive framework for deciphering how chirality is hierarchically and quantitatively propagated across spatial scales. Our work highlights the ways in which supramolecular helicity may arise from subtle chiral contributions of opposite handedness that act either cooperatively or competitively, thus accounting for the multiplicity of chiral behaviours observed for nearly identical molecular systems. The authors investigate the origins of chirality transfer across length scales, quantitatively demonstrating how chirality propagates from the molecular to liquid crystal level in filamentous virus systems.},

However, the development of n-type OSCs has been severely held back due to the poor stability of their most candidates, that is, the intrinsically high reactivity of negatively charged polarons to oxygen and water. Here we demonstrate a general strategy based on vitamin C to stabilize n-type OSCs, remarkably improving the performance and stability of their device, for example, organic field-effect transistors. Vitamin C scavenges reactive oxygen species and inhibits their generation by sacrificial oxidation and non-sacrificial triplet quenching in a cascade process, which not only lastingly prevents molecular structure from oxidation damage but also passivates the latent electron traps to stabilize electron transport. This study presents a way to overcome the long-standing stability problem of n-type OSCs and devices. The development of n-type organic semiconductors (OSCs) has been held back due to stability issues. Here the authors report that vitamin C improves both the performance and stability of n-type OSCs and devices.},

  abstract     = {Structurally ordered L10-PtM (M = Fe, Co, Ni and so on) intermetallic nanocrystals, benefiting from the chemically ordered structure and higher stability, are one of the best electrocatalysts used for fuel cells. However, their practical development is greatly plagued by the challenge that the high-temperature (&amp;gt;600 °C) annealing treatment necessary for realizing the ordered structure usually leads to severe particle sintering, morphology change and low ordering degree, which makes it very difficult for the gram-scale preparation of desirable PtM intermetallic nanocrystals with high Pt content for practical fuel cell applications. Here we report a new concept involving the low-melting-point-metal (M′ = Sn, Ga, In)-induced bond strength weakening strategy to reduce Ea and promote the ordering process of PtM (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Cu and Zn) alloy catalysts for a higher ordering degree. We demonstrate that the introduction of M′ can reduce the ordering temperature to extremely low temperatures (≤450 °C) and thus enable the preparation of high-Pt-content (≥40 wt%) L10-Pt-M-M′ intermetallic nanocrystals as well as ten-gram-scale production. X-ray spectroscopy studies, in situ electron microscopy and theoretical calculations reveal the fundamental mechanism of the Sn-facilitated ordering process at low temperatures, which involves weakened bond strength and consequently reduced Ea via Sn doping, the formation and fast diffusion of low-coordinated surface free atoms, and subsequent L10 nucleation. The developed L10-Ga-PtNi/C catalysts display outstanding performance in H2–air fuel cells under both light- and heavy-duty vehicle conditions. Under the latter condition, the 40% L10-Pt50Ni35Ga15/C catalyst delivers a high current density of 1.67 A cm−2 at 0.7 V and retains 80% of the current density after extended 90,000 cycles, which exceeds the United States Department of Energy performance metrics and represents among the best cathodic electrocatalysts for practical proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. Although structurally ordered intermetallic nanocrystals are promising electrocatalysts for fuel cells, their high-temperature large-scale preparation has proved challenging. A low-melting-point-metal-induced bond strength weakening strategy to promote alloy catalyst ordering is now proposed.},

  abstract     = {New highly oxygen-active materials may enhance many energy-related technologies by enabling efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures, for example, below ~400 °C. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to realize such performance but have received far less attention than vacancy-mediated conductors. Here we combine physically motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations and experiments to demonstrate an approach to discover new fast interstitial oxygen conductors. Multiple new families were found, which adopt completely different structures from known oxygen conductors. From these families, we synthesized and studied oxygen kinetics in La4Mn5Si4O22+δ, a representative member of the perrierite/chevkinite family. We found that La4Mn5Si4O22+δ has higher oxygen-ion conductivity than the widely used yttria-stabilized ZrO2, and among the highest surface oxygen exchange rates at the intermediate temperature of known materials. The fast oxygen kinetics is the result of simultaneously active interstitial and interstitialcy diffusion pathways. We propose that the essential features for forming an effective interstitial oxygen conductor are the availability of electrons and structural flexibility, enabling a sufficient accessible volume. This work provides a powerful approach for understanding and discovering new interstitial oxygen conductors. Interstitial oxygen conductors have the potential to enable efficient oxygen-ion transport at lower temperatures. An approach combining physically motivated structure and property descriptors, ab initio simulations and experiments is now proposed for the discovery of fast interstitial oxygen conductors.},

  abstract     = {By virtue of their open network structures and low densities, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are soft materials that exhibit elastic instabilities at low applied stresses. The conventional strategy for improving elastic stability is to increase the connectivity of the underlying MOF network, which necessarily increases the material density and reduces the porosity. Here we demonstrate an alternative paradigm, whereby elastic stability is enhanced in a MOF with an aperiodic network topology. We use a combination of variable-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements and coarse-grained lattice-dynamical calculations to interrogate the high-pressure behaviour of the topologically aperiodic system TRUMOF-1, which we compare against that of its ordered congener MOF-5. We show that the topology of the former quenches the elastic instability responsible for pressure-induced framework collapse in the latter, much as irregularity in the shapes and sizes of stones acts to prevent cooperative mechanical failure in drystone walls. Our results establish aperiodicity as a counter-intuitive design motif in engineering the mechanical properties of framework structures that is relevant to MOFs and larger-scale architectures alike. High-pressure experiments performed on aperiodic TRUMOF-1 demonstrate that this material remains crystalline up to pressures of 1.8 GPa, higher than other cubic metal–organic framework, due to the heterogeneous distribution of different shock-absorption mechanisms throughout the material.},

Here, we show that the temporal dynamics of internally produced heat in electronic devices can be engineered to both encode information within a single device and process information across multiple devices. In our demonstration, electronic NbOx Mott neurons, integrated on a flexible organic substrate, exhibit 18 biomimetic neuronal behaviours and frequency-based nociception within a single component by exploiting both the thermal dynamics of the Mott transition and the dynamical thermal interactions with the organic substrate. Further, multiple interconnected Mott neurons spatiotemporally communicate purely via heat, which we use for graph optimization by consuming over 106 times less energy when compared with the best digital processors. Thus, exploiting natural thermal processes in computing can lead to functionally dense, energy-efficient and radically novel mixed-physics computing primitives. Heat in electronic devices is normally dissipated via cooling. Here the authors engineer the thermal dynamics of the Mott transition and dynamical thermal interactions with the substrate to enable neuromorphic computing in a NbOx-based device.},

The recent identification of bright, tunable and stable emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has opened the door to quantum platforms operating across the infrared to ultraviolet spectrum. Although it is widely acknowledged that defects are responsible for single-photon emitters in hBN, crucial details regarding their origin, electronic levels and orbital involvement remain unknown. Here we employ a combination of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy in defective hBN, unveiling an elementary excitation at 285 meV that gives rise to a plethora of harmonics correlated with single-photon emitters. We discuss the importance of N π* anti-bonding orbitals in shaping the electronic states of the emitters. The discovery of elementary excitations in hBN provides fundamental insights into quantum emission in low-dimensional materials, paving the way for future investigations in other platforms. Combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering and photoluminescence spectroscopy, an elementary excitation in hexagonal-boron-nitride-based single-photon emitters has been demonstrated, giving rise to multiple regular harmonics that can explain the wide frequency range of these emitters.},

Square moiré superlattices with varying periodic lengths are clearly visualized through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Twist-angle-dependent transient photoluminescence microscopy and electrical characterizations indicate the emergence of localized bright excitons and trapped charge carriers near a twist angle of ~10°. The localized excitons are accompanied by enhanced exciton emission, attributed to an increased oscillator strength by a theoretically predicted flat band. This research showcases the promise of two-dimensional perovskites as unique room-temperature moiré materials.

Moreover, we identify a set of Van Hove singularities adhering to the kagome-layer electrons, which appear along one direction of the Brillouin zone and are annihilated along other high-symmetry directions, revealing rotational symmetry breaking. Via detailed spectroscopic maps, we further observe an elliptical deformation of the Fermi surface, which provides direct evidence for an electronically mediated nematic order.

Computational simulations have suggested the presence of short-range order (SRO) in these alloys, and recent experimental evidence is also beginning to emerge. Unfortunately, the difficulty in quantifying the SRO under different heat treatment conditions has generated much debate on the atomic preferencing and implications of SRO on mechanical properties. Here we develop an approach to measure SRO using atom probe tomography. This method balances the limitations of atom probe tomography with the threshold values of SRO to map the regimes where the required atomistic neighbourhood information is preserved and where it is not. We demonstrate the method with a case study of the CoCrNi alloy and use this to monitor SRO changes induced by heat treatments. These species-specific SRO measurements enable the generation of computational simulations of atomic neighbourhood models that are equivalent to the experiment and can contribute to the further understanding and design of medium- and high-entropy alloys and other materials systems where SRO may occur. A method is introduced to quantify short-range order in multicomponent alloys using atom probe tomography, which enables further understanding and materials design related to atomic-scale solute engineering.},

Here we report the vitrification of gold, which is notoriously difficult to be vitrified, and several similar close-packed face-centred cubic and hexagonal metals using a method of picosecond pulsed laser ablation in a liquid medium. The vitrification occurs through the rapid cooling during laser ablation and the inhibition of nucleation by the liquid medium. Using this method, a large number of atomic configurations, including glassy configurations, can be generated simultaneously, from which a stable glass state can be sampled. Simulations demonstrate that the favourable stability of monatomic metals stems from the strong topological frustration of icosahedra-like clusters. Our work breaks the limitation of the glass-forming ability of matter, indicating that vitrification is an intrinsic property of matter and providing a strategy for the preparation and design of metallic glasses from an atomic configuration perspective.

  abstract     = {Recent discoveries of Mott insulating and unconventional superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene with moiré superlattices have not only reshaped the landscape of ‘twistronics’ but also sparked the rapidly growing fields of moiré photonic and phononic structures. These innovative moiré structures have opened new routes of exploration for classical wave physics, leading to intriguing phenomena and robust control of electromagnetic and mechanical waves. Drawing inspiration from the success of twisted bilayer graphene, this Perspective describes an overarching framework of the emerging moiré photonic and phononic structures that promise novel classical wave devices. We begin with the fundamentals of moiré superlattices, before highlighting recent studies that exploit twist angle and interlayer coupling as new ingredients with which to engineer and tailor the band structures and effective material properties of photonic and phononic structures. Finally, we discuss the future directions and prospects of this emerging area in materials science and wave physics. Platforms that exhibit moiré patterns have the potential to tailor band structures and control electromagnetic and mechanical waves. This Perspective discusses the current state of the art, challenges and outlook within the realm of classical wave physics.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by its fibrotic and stiff extracellular matrix. However, how the altered cell/extracellular-matrix signalling contributes to the PDAC tumour phenotype has been difficult to dissect. Here we design and engineer matrices that recapitulate the key hallmarks of the PDAC tumour extracellular matrix to address this knowledge gap. We show that patient-derived PDAC organoids from three patients develop resistance to several clinically relevant chemotherapies when cultured within high-stiffness matrices mechanically matched to in vivo tumours. Using genetic barcoding, we find that while matrix-specific clonal selection occurs, cellular heterogeneity is not the main driver of chemoresistance. Instead, matrix-induced chemoresistance occurs within a stiff environment due to the increased expression of drug efflux transporters mediated by CD44 receptor interactions with hyaluronan. Moreover, PDAC chemoresistance is reversible following transfer from high- to low-stiffness matrices, suggesting that targeting the fibrotic extracellular matrix may sensitize chemoresistant tumours. Overall, our findings support the potential of engineered matrices and patient-derived organoids for elucidating extracellular matrix contributions to human disease pathophysiology. Patient-derived pancreatic cancer organoids grown in engineered matrices acquire chemoresistance due to the increased expression of drug efflux transporters, promoted by CD44 receptor interactions with hyaluronan in the stiffer tumoural matrix.},

Micrometre-sized colloidal particles enable the real-time observation of crystallization with optical microscopy, but in practice this is still hampered by a lack of ‘X-ray vision’. Here we introduce a system of index-matched fluorescently labelled colloidal particles and demonstrate the robust formation of ionic crystals in aqueous solution, with structures that can be controlled by size ratio and salt concentration. Full three-dimensional coordinates of particles are distinguished through in situ confocal microscopy, and the crystal structures are identified via comparison of their simulated scattering pattern with known atomic arrangements. Finally, we leverage our ability to look inside colloidal crystals to observe the motion of defects and crystal melting in time and space and to reveal the origin of crystal twinning. Using this platform, the path to real-time analysis of ionic colloidal crystallization is now ‘crystal clear’. Index-matched fluorescent particles provide a system that directly visualizes ionic crystallization using confocal microscopy, and offers insight into the structure, nucleation and growth of ionic solids.},

Yet how the electronic properties of the nanofluidic channels influence transport efficiency remains largely unexplored. Here we measure transport through the inner pores of sub-1 nm metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotube porins. We find that water and proton transport are enhanced in metallic nanotubes over semiconducting nanotubes, whereas ion transport is largely insensitive to the nanotube bandgap value. Molecular simulations using polarizable force fields highlight the contributions of the anisotropic polarizability tensor of the carbon nanotubes to the ion–nanotube interactions and the water friction coefficient. We also describe the origin of the proton transport enhancement in metallic nanotubes using deep neural network molecular dynamics simulations. These results emphasize the complex role of the electronic properties of nanofluidic channels in modulating transport under extreme nanoscale confinement. Extreme confinement of water and ions within nanofluidic channels gives rise to unusual transport phenomena. Here the authors investigate how electronic properties of carbon nanotube porins influence the transport efficiency of water and ions.},

  abstract     = {Continuous and in situ detection of biomarkers in biofluids (for example, sweat) can provide critical health data but is limited by biofluid accessibility. Here we report a sensor design that enables in situ detection of solid-state biomarkers ubiquitously present on human skin. We deploy an ionic–electronic bilayer hydrogel to facilitate the sequential dissolution, diffusion and electrochemical reaction of solid-state analytes. We demonstrate continuous monitoring of water-soluble analytes (for example, solid lactate) and water-insoluble analytes (for example, solid cholesterol) with ultralow detection limits of 0.51 and 0.26 nmol cm−2, respectively. Additionally, the bilayer hydrogel electrochemical interface reduces motion artefacts by a factor of three compared with conventional liquid-sensing electrochemical interfaces. In a clinical study, solid-state epidermal biomarkers measured by our stretchable wearable sensors showed a high correlation with biomarkers in human blood and dynamically correlated with physiological activities. These results present routes to universal platforms for biomarker monitoring without the need for biofluid acquisition. Biomarkers in biofluids are widely used for medical diagnosis, but their use is limited by accessibility. Here the authors present a stretchable wearable sensor allowing in situ detection of solid-state biomarkers on human skin, hence avoiding biofluid acquisition.},

  abstract     = {Artificial pressure sensors often use soft materials to achieve skin-like softness, but the viscoelastic creep of soft materials and the ion leakage, specifically for ionic conductors, cause signal drift and inaccurate measurement. Here we report drift-free iontronic sensing by designing and copolymerizing a leakage-free and creep-free polyelectrolyte elastomer containing two types of segments: charged segments having fixed cations to prevent ion leakage and neutral slippery segments with a high crosslink density for low creep. We show that an iontronic sensor using the polyelectrolyte elastomer barely drifts under an ultrahigh static pressure of 500 kPa (close to its Young’s modulus), exhibits a drift rate two to three orders of magnitude lower than that of the sensors adopting conventional ionic conductors and enables steady and accurate control for robotic manipulation. Such drift-free iontronic sensing represents a step towards highly accurate sensing in robotics and beyond. Conventional iontronic pressure sensors suffer from signal drift and inaccuracy owing to creep of soft materials and ion leakage. Here the authors report a leakage-free and creep-free polyelectrolyte-elastomer-based iontronic sensor that achieves a drift rate two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional iontronic sensors.},

  abstract     = {Elucidating the mechanism of photoinduced water splitting on TiO2 is important for advancing the understanding of photocatalysis and the ability to control photocatalytic surface reactions. However, incomplete experimental information and complex coupled electron–nuclear motion make the microscopic understanding challenging. Here we analyse the atomic-scale pathways of photogenerated charge carrier transport and photoinduced water dissociation at the prototypical water–rutile TiO2(110) interface using first-principles dynamics simulations. Two distinct mechanisms are observed. Field-initiated electron migration leads to adsorbed water dissociation via proton transfer to a surface bridging oxygen. In the other pathway, adsorbed water dissociation occurs via proton donation to a second-layer water molecule coupled to photoexcited-hole transfer promoted by in-plane surface lattice distortions. Two stages of non-adiabatic in-plane lattice motion—expansion and recovery—are observed, which are closely associated with population changes in Ti3d orbitals. Controlling such highly correlated electron–nuclear dynamics may provide opportunities for boosting the performance of photocatalytic materials. Understanding the origin of photoinduced water splitting on TiO2 is crucial to control photocatalytic surface reactions. A photoexcited-hole-transfer-driven mechanism now shows that water dissociation is strongly coupled with dynamic lattice distortion (photoexcited phonons) on TiO2 surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemomechanical degradation is one of the most common causes of capacity deterioration in high-energy-density cathodes, particularly intercalation-based layered oxides. Here we reveal the presence of rotational stacking faults (RSFs) in layered lithium transition-metal oxides, arising from specific stacking sequences at different angles, and demonstrate their critical role in determining structural/electrochemical stability. Our combined experiments and calculations show that RSFs facilitate oxygen dimerization and transition-metal migration in layered oxides, fostering microcrack nucleation/propagation concurrently with cumulative electrochemomechanical degradation on cycling. We further show that thermal defect annihilation as a potential solution can suppress RSFs, reducing microcracks and enhancing cyclability in lithium-rich layered cathodes. The common but previously overlooked occurrence of RSFs suggests a new synthesis guideline of high-energy-density layered oxide cathodes. Degradation is one of the most common causes of capacity deterioration in high-energy-density cathodes. Rotational stacking faults in layered lithium transition-metal oxides are shown to play a critical role in determining their structural and electrochemical stabilities.},

  abstract     = {Surface terminations profoundly influence the intrinsic properties of MXenes, but existing terminations are limited to monoatomic layers or simple groups, showing disordered arrangements and inferior stability. Here we present the synthesis of MXenes with triatomic-layer borate polyanion terminations (OBO terminations) through a flux-assisted eutectic molten etching approach. During the synthesis, Lewis acidic salts act as the etching agent to obtain the MXene backbone, while borax generates BO2− species, which cap the MXene surface with an O–B–O configuration. In contrast to conventional chlorine/oxygen-terminated Nb2C with localized charge transport, OBO-terminated Nb2C features band transport described by the Drude model, exhibiting a 15-fold increase in electrical conductivity and a 10-fold improvement in charge mobility at the d.c. limit. This transition is attributed to surface ordering that effectively mitigates charge carrier backscattering and trapping. Additionally, OBO terminations provide Ti3C2 MXene with substantially enriched Li+-hosting sites and thereby a large charge-storage capacity of 420 mAh g−1. Our findings illustrate the potential of intricate termination configurations in MXenes and their applications for (opto)electronics and energy storage. MXenes with borate polyanion terminations are synthesized using a flux-assisted eutectic molten etching approach. These triatomic-layer terminations empower MXenes with considerably improved charge transport and charge storage capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Robust ferroelectricity in nanoscale fluorite oxide-based thin films enables promising applications in silicon-compatible non-volatile memories and logic devices. However, the polar orthorhombic (O) phase of fluorite oxides is a metastable phase that is prone to transforming into the ground-state non-polar monoclinic (M) phase, leading to macroscopic ferroelectric degradation. Here we investigate the reversibility of the O–M phase transition in ZrO2 nanocrystals via in situ visualization of the martensitic transformation at the atomic scale. We reveal that the reversible shear deformation pathway from the O phase to the monoclinic-like (M′) state, a compressive-strained M phase, is protected by 90° ferroelectric–ferroelastic switching. Nevertheless, as the M′ state gradually accumulates localized strain, a critical tensile strain can pin the ferroelastic domain, resulting in an irreversible M′–M strain relaxation and the loss of ferroelectricity. These findings demonstrate the key role of ferroelastic switching in the reversibility of phase transition and also provide a tensile-strain threshold for stabilizing the metastable ferroelectric phase in fluorite oxide thin films. Ferroelectric phase stability is a pivotal challenge for fluorite-structure ferroelectrics. Using electron microscopy, a ferroelastically protected reversible polar-to-non-polar phase transition in ZrO2 is observed and the critical strain state to break the reversibility is measured.},

  abstract     = {Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene exhibits correlated phenomena such as superconductivity and Mott insulating states related to the weakly dispersing flat band near the Fermi energy. Such a flat band is expected to be sensitive to both the moiré period and lattice relaxations. Thus, clarifying the evolution of the electronic structure with the twist angle is critical for understanding the physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Here we combine nano-spot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to resolve the fine electronic structure of the flat band and remote bands, as well as their evolution with twist angle from 1.07° to 2.60°. Near the magic angle, the dispersion is characterized by a flat band near the Fermi energy with a strongly reduced band width. Moreover, we observe a spectral weight transfer between remote bands at higher binding energy, which allows to extract the modulated interlayer spacing near the magic angle. Our work provides direct spectroscopic information on flat band physics and highlights the important role of lattice relaxations. By combining nano-spot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, the authors resolve the fine electronic structure of the flat band and remote bands of twisted bilayer graphene as the twist angle varies, revealing a spectral weight transfer between remote bands that is attributed to lattice relaxations.},

Systematic improvement is limited by a lack of understanding of the microscopic energy flow at the single-emitter level and ultrafast timescales. Here we utilize a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy to capture the sample-averaged dynamics of defects with single-particle sensitivity. We employ this approach to study heterogeneous emitters in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride. From milliseconds to nanoseconds, the translational, shelving, rotational and antibunching features are disentangled in time, which quantifies the normalized two-photon emission quantum yield. Leveraging the femtosecond resolution of this technique, we visualize electron–phonon coupling and discover the acceleration of polaronic formation on multi-electron excitation. Corroborated with theory, this translates to the photon fidelity characterization of cascaded emission efficiency and decoherence time. Our work provides a framework for ultrafast spectroscopy in heterogeneous emitters, opening new avenues of extreme-scale characterization for quantum applications.

Real-space imaging via scanning tunnelling microscopy reveals two distinct charge orderings at the lower and upper Hubbard band energies, whose origin is attributed to the correlation-driven honeycomb hole crystal composed of hole-rich Ru sites and rotational-symmetry-breaking paired electron crystal composed of electron-rich Ru–Ru bonds, respectively. Moreover, a gate-induced transition of electron–hole crystals is directly visualized, further corroborating their nature as correlation-driven charge crystals. The realization and atom-resolved visualization of imbalanced electron–hole crystals in a doped Mott insulator opens new doors in the search for correlated bosonic states within strongly correlated materials.

Here we experimentally demonstrate antiskyrmion sliding in response to a pulsed electric current at room temperature without the requirement of an external magnetic field. This is realized by embedding antiskyrmions in helical stripe domains, which naturally provide one-dimensional straight tracks along which antiskyrmion sliding can be easily launched with low current density and without transverse deflection from the antiskyrmion Hall effect. The higher mobility of the antiskyrmions in the background of helical stripes in contrast to the typical ferromagnetic state is a result of intrinsic material parameters and elastic energy of the stripe domain, thereby smearing out the random pinning potential, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. The demonstration and comprehensive understanding of antiskyrmion movement along naturally straight tracks offers a new perspective for (anti)skyrmion application in spintronics. Electric current pulses are used to move antiskyrmions, by coupling them with a helical track.},

Dimers are optically suppressed without spatial correlation, generating a structure whose level of disorder strongly depends on the length scale. The redevelopment of structural ordering over tens of picoseconds is directly tracked over both space and time as a transient state is approached. This measurement demonstrates the crucial role of local structure and disorder in non-equilibrium processes as well as the feasibility of accessing this information with state-of-the-art XFEL facilities.

Starting from a simple four-component reaction platform, we create a chemically diverse library of 584 ionizable lipids. We screen the mRNA transfection potencies of lipid nanoparticles containing those lipids and use the data as a foundational dataset for training various machine learning models. We choose the best-performing model to probe an expansive virtual library of 40,000 lipids, synthesizing and experimentally evaluating the top 16 lipids flagged. We identify lipid 119-23, which outperforms established benchmark lipids in transfecting muscle and immune cells in several tissues. This approach facilitates the creation and evaluation of versatile ionizable lipid libraries, advancing the formulation of lipid nanoparticles for precise mRNA delivery.

Here we describe a reconfigurable, two-dimensional DNA origami with geometrically patterned CD95 ligands that regulates immune cell signalling to alleviate rheumatoid arthritis. In response to pH changes, the device reversibly transforms from a closed to an open configuration, displaying a hexagonal pattern of CD95 ligands with ~10 nm intermolecular spacing, precisely mirroring the spatial arrangement of CD95 receptor clusters on the surface of immune cells. In a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, DNA origami elicits robust and selective activation of CD95 death-inducing signalling in activated immune cells located in inflamed synovial tissues. Such localized immune tolerance ameliorates joint damage with no noticeable side effects. This device allows for the precise spatial control of cellular signalling, expanding our understanding of ligand–receptor interactions and is a promising platform for the development of pharmacological interventions targeting these interactions. A pH-responsive DNA origami device displays a precise geometric array of CD95 ligands to selectively induce activated immune cell death and elicit localized immune tolerance to alleviate rheumatoid arthritis.},

We develop a hybrid data-driven and physics-informed approach for model training, designed to minimize not only the data-driven loss but also the physics-informed loss. By employing an ensemble strategy, the model can successfully infer the shape of monomeric DNA origami structures almost in real time. Further refinement of the model in an unsupervised manner enables the analysis of supramolecular assemblies consisting of tens to hundreds of DNA blocks. The proposed model enables an automated inverse design of DNA origami structures for given target shapes. Our approach facilitates the real-time virtual prototyping of DNA origami, broadening its design space. Limited datasets hinder the accurate prediction of DNA origami structures.

Here we identify two distinguishable pathways from achiral to chiral morphologies in gold nanoparticles by training an artificial neural network of cellular automata according to experimental results. We find that the chirality is initially determined by the nature of the asymmetric growth along the boundaries of enantiomeric high-index planes. The deep learning-based interpretation of chiral morphogenesis provides a theoretical understanding but also allows us to predict an unprecedented crossover pathway and the resulting morphology. The emergence of chiral morphologies from achiral building blocks is not well understood. Deep learning-based interpretation provides representative models for the process of symmetry breaking and chiral development during the growth of gold nanoparticles.},

Driven with applied voltages as small as a few hundreds of millivolts, these cuffs allow active grasping or wrapping around delicate nerves. We validate this technology using in vivo rat models, showing that the cuffs form and maintain a self-closing and reliable bioelectronic interface with the sciatic nerve of rats without the use of surgical sutures or glues. This seamless integration of soft electrochemical actuators with neurotechnology offers a path towards minimally invasive intraoperative monitoring of nerve activity and high-quality bioelectronic interfaces.

  abstract     = {Limitations in electrochemical performance as well as supply chain challenges have rendered positive electrode materials a critical bottleneck for Li-ion batteries. State-of-the-art Li-ion batteries fall short of accessing theoretical capacities. As such, there is intense interest in the design of strategies that enable the more effective utilization of active intercalation materials. Pre-intercalation with alkali-metal ions has attracted interest as a means of accessing higher reversible capacity and improved rate performance. However, the structural basis for improvements in electrochemical performance remains mostly unexplored. Here we use topochemical single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations in a tunnel-structured ζ-V2O5 positive electrode to illustrate the effect of pre-intercalation in modifying the host lattice and altering diffusion pathways. Furthermore, operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction is used to map Li-ion site preferences and occupancies as a function of the depth of discharge in pre-intercalated materials. Na- and K-ion intercalation ‘props open’ the one-dimensional tunnel, reduces electrostatic repulsions between inserted Li ions and entirely modifies diffusion pathways, enabling orders of magnitude higher Li-ion diffusivities and accessing higher capacities. Deciphering the atomistic origins of improved performance in pre-intercalated materials on the basis of single-crystal-to-single-crystal topochemical transformation and operando diffraction studies paves the way to site-selective modification approaches for positive electrode design. Pre-intercalation with alkali-metal ions is attractive for accessing higher reversible capacity and improved rate performance in Li-ion batteries. Topochemical single-crystal transformations in a tunnel-structured positive electrode are used to clarify the effect of pre-intercalation in modifying the host lattice and altering diffusion pathways.},

  abstract     = {Ion exchange is a powerful method to access metastable materials with advanced functionalities for energy storage applications. However, high concentrations and unfavourably large excesses of lithium are always used for synthesizing lithium cathodes from parent sodium material, and the reaction pathways remain elusive. Here, using layered oxides as model materials, we demonstrate that vacancy level and its corresponding lithium preference are critical in determining the accessible and inaccessible ion exchange pathways. Taking advantage of the strong lithium preference at the right vacancy level, we establish predictive compositional and structural evolution at extremely dilute and low excess lithium based on the phase equilibrium between Li0.94CoO2 and Na0.48CoO2. Such phase separation behaviour is general in both surface reaction-limited and diffusion-limited exchange conditions and is accomplished with the charge redistribution on transition metals. Guided by this understanding, we demonstrate the synthesis of NayCoO2 from the parent LixCoO2 and the synthesis of Li0.94CoO2 from NayCoO2 at 1–1,000 Li/Na (molar ratio) with an electrochemical assisted ion exchange method by mitigating the kinetic barriers. Our study opens new opportunities for ion exchange in predictive synthesis and separation applications. Ion exchange is a powerful method to access metastable materials for energy storage, but identifying lithium and sodium interchange in layered oxides remains challenging. Using such model materials, vacancy level and corresponding lithium preference are shown to be crucial for ion exchange pathway accessibility.},

  abstract     = {Thin-film materials with large electromechanical responses are fundamental enablers of next-generation micro-/nano-electromechanical applications. Conventional electromechanical materials (for example, ferroelectrics and relaxors), however, exhibit severely degraded responses when scaled down to submicrometre-thick films due to substrate constraints (clamping). This limitation is overcome, and substantial electromechanical responses in antiferroelectric thin films are achieved through an unconventional coupling of the field-induced antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition and the substrate constraints. A detilting of the oxygen octahedra and lattice-volume expansion in all dimensions are observed commensurate with the phase transition using operando electron microscopy, such that the in-plane clamping further enhances the out-of-plane expansion, as rationalized using first-principles calculations. In turn, a non-traditional thickness scaling is realized wherein an electromechanical strain (1.7%) is produced from a model antiferroelectric PbZrO3 film that is just 100 nm thick. The high performance and understanding of the mechanism provide a promising pathway to develop high-performance micro-/nano-electromechanical systems. Here, the authors observe that in thin films of antiferroelectric PbZrO3, substrate clamping enhances the electromechanical response, with expansion purely in the out-of-plane direction, achieving 1.7% strain for 100-nm-thick films.},

Here we establish the robust polaronic nature of the excitons in these materials at room temperature by combining ultrafast spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations. We show that polaronic distortion is associated with low-frequency (30–60 cm−1) lead iodide octahedral lattice motions. More importantly, we discover how targeted ligand modification of this two-dimensional perovskite structure manipulates exciton–phonon coupling, exciton polaron population and carrier cooling. At high excitation density, stronger exciton–phonon coupling increases the hot-carrier lifetime, forming a hot-phonon bottleneck. Our study provides detailed insight into the exciton–phonon coupling and its role in carrier cooling in two-dimensional perovskites relevant for developing emerging hybrid semiconductor materials with tailored properties. The detailed interplay between electronic and lattice dynamics in two-dimensional perovskite materials remains elusive.

  abstract     = {Spin qubits defined by valence band hole states are attractive for quantum information processing due to their inherent coupling to electric fields, enabling fast and scalable qubit control. Heavy holes in germanium are particularly promising, with recent demonstrations of fast and high-fidelity qubit operations. However, the mechanisms and anisotropies that underlie qubit driving and decoherence remain mostly unclear. Here we report the highly anisotropic heavy-hole g-tensor and its dependence on electric fields, revealing how qubit driving and decoherence originate from electric modulations of the g-tensor. Furthermore, we confirm the predicted Ising-type hyperfine interaction and show that qubit coherence is ultimately limited by 1/f charge noise, where f is the frequency. Finally, operating the qubit at low magnetic field, we measure a dephasing time of $${T}_{2}^{* }$$  = 17.6 μs, maintaining single-qubit gate fidelities well above 99% even at elevated temperatures of T &amp;gt; 1 K. This understanding of qubit driving and decoherence mechanisms is key towards realizing scalable and highly coherent hole qubit arrays.

  abstract     = {Polar metals have recently garnered increasing interest because of their promising functionalities. Here we report the experimental realization of an intrinsic coexisting ferromagnetism, polar distortion and metallicity in quasi-two-dimensional Ca3Co3O8. This material crystallizes with alternating stacking of oxygen tetrahedral CoO4 monolayers and octahedral CoO6 bilayers. The ferromagnetic metallic state is confined within the quasi-two-dimensional CoO6 layers, and the broken inversion symmetry arises simultaneously from the Co displacements. The breaking of both spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetries, along with their strong coupling, gives rise to an intrinsic magnetochiral anisotropy with exotic magnetic field-free non-reciprocal electrical resistivity. An extraordinarily robust topological Hall effect persists over a broad temperature–magnetic field phase space, arising from dipole-induced Rashba spin–orbit coupling. Our work not only provides a rich platform to explore the coupling between polarity and magnetism in a metallic system, with extensive potential applications, but also defines a novel design strategy to access exotic correlated electronic states.

Nevertheless, the future of skyrmionics may rely on antiferromagnets due to their immunity to dipolar fields, straight motion along the driving force and ultrafast dynamics. While complex topological objects were recently discovered in intrinsic antiferromagnets, mastering their nucleation, stabilization and manipulation with energy-efficient means remains an outstanding challenge. Designing topological polar states in magnetoelectric antiferromagnetic multiferroics would allow one to electrically write, detect and erase topological antiferromagnetic entities. Here we stabilize ferroelectric centre states using a radial electric field in multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films. We show that such polar textures contain flux closures of antiferromagnetic spin cycloids, with distinct antiferromagnetic entities at their cores depending on the electric field polarity. By tuning the epitaxial strain, quadrants of canted antiferromagnetic domains can also be electrically designed. These results open the path to reconfigurable topological states in multiferroic antiferromagnets. Control over topological antiferromagnetic entities is achieved at room temperature in multiferroic nanodevices using an electric field that induces magnetoelectric coupling to ferroelectric centre states.},

Here we report the experimental observation of chiral spin transport in multiferroic BiFeO3 and its control by reversing the ferroelectric polarization (that is, by breaking spatial inversion symmetry). The ferroelectrically controlled magnons show up to 18% modulation at room temperature. The spin torque that the magnons in BiFeO3 carry can be used to efficiently switch the magnetization of adjacent magnets, with a spin–torque efficiency comparable to the spin Hall effect in heavy metals. Utilizing such controllable magnon generation and transmission in BiFeO3, an all-oxide, energy-scalable logic is demonstrated composed of spin–orbit injection, detection and magnetoelectric control. Our observations open a new chapter of multiferroic magnons and pave another path towards low-dissipation nanoelectronics.

  abstract     = {Interactions among and between electrons and phonons steer the energy flow in photo-excited materials and govern the emergence of correlated phases. The strength of electron–phonon interactions, decay channels of strongly coupled modes and the evolution of three-dimensional order are revealed by electron or X-ray pulses tracking non-equilibrium structural dynamics. Despite such capabilities, the growing relevance of inherently anisotropic two-dimensional materials and functional heterostructures still calls for techniques with monolayer sensitivity and, specifically, access to out-of-plane phonon polarizations. Here, we resolve non-equilibrium phonon dynamics and quantify the excitonic contribution to the structural order parameter in 1T-TiSe2. To this end, we introduce ultrafast low-energy electron diffuse scattering and trace strongly momentum- and fluence-dependent phonon populations. Mediated by phonon–phonon scattering, a few-picosecond build-up near the zone boundary precedes a far slower generation of zone-centre acoustic modes. These weakly coupled phonons are shown to substantially delay overall equilibration in layered materials. Moreover, we record the surface structural response to a quench of the material’s widely investigated exciton condensate, identifying an approximate 30:70 ratio of excitonic versus Peierls contributions to the total lattice distortion in the charge density wave phase. The surface-sensitive approach complements the ultrafast structural toolbox and may further elucidate the impact of phonon scattering in numerous other phenomena within two-dimensional materials, such as the formation of interlayer excitons in twisted bilayers. The thermalization of acoustic phonons after photoexcitation is traced by electron pulses in TiSe2, and the excitonic contribution to the structural order parameter of the material’s charge density wave phase is quantified.},

The high-temperature behaviour and structure of PuO2–x above 1,800 K remain largely unexplored, and these conditions must be considered for reactor design and planning for the mitigation of severe accidents. Here, we measure the atomic structure of PuO2–x through the melting transition up to 3,000 ± 50 K using X-ray scattering of aerodynamically levitated and laser-beam-heated samples, with O/Pu ranging from 1.57 to 1.76. Liquid structural models consistent with the X-ray data are developed using machine-learned interatomic potentials and density functional theory. Molten PuO1.76 contains some degree of covalent Pu–O bonding, signalled by the degeneracy of Pu 5f and O 2p orbitals. The liquid is isomorphous with molten CeO1.75, demonstrating the latter as a non-radioactive, non-toxic, structural surrogate when differences in the oxidation potentials of Pu and Ce are accounted for. These characterizations provide essential constraints for modelling pertinent to reactor safety design. The molten structure of plutonium oxide—a component of mixed oxide nuclear fuels—is measured, showing some degree of covalent bonding. Its atomic structure is similar to that of cerium oxide, which could be a non-radioactive structural surrogate.},

Here, we describe a method for precise delivery and accurate dosing of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using an intelligent DNA nanodevice. We use DNA origami to integrate DNA nanosheets with predesigned tPA binding sites and thrombin-responsive DNA fasteners. The fastener is an interlocking DNA triplex structure that acts as a thrombin recognizer, threshold controller and opening switch. When loaded with tPA and intravenously administrated in vivo, these DNA nanodevices rapidly target the site of thrombosis, track the circulating microemboli and expose the active tPA only when the concentration of thrombin exceeds a threshold. We demonstrate their improved therapeutic efficacy in ischaemic stroke and pulmonary embolism models, supporting the potential of these nanodevices to provide accurate tPA dosing for the treatment of different thromboses. An intelligent DNA nanodevice, composed of DNA origami nanosheets and a thrombin-responsive DNA fastener, accurately delivers the appropriate dose of tissue plasminogen activator following activation by distinct thrombosis events.},

Here we show that implanted patient-derived freeze-dried lymph nodes loaded with chimeric antigen receptor T cells improve delivery to solid tumours and inhibit tumour recurrence after surgery. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells can be effectively loaded into lyophilized lymph nodes, whose unaltered meshwork and cytokine and chemokine contents promote chimeric antigen receptor T cell viability and activation. In mouse models of cell-line-derived human cervical cancer and patient-derived pancreatic cancer, delivery of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting mesothelin via the freeze-dried lymph nodes is more effective in preventing tumour recurrence when compared to hydrogels containing T-cell-supporting cytokines. This tissue-mediated cell delivery strategy holds promise for controlled release of various cells and therapeutics with long-term activity and augmented function.

Incorporation of allyl sulfide groups enables adaptive liquid crystal elastomers that can be reconfigured into desired phases or complex patterns. Laser-induced dynamic crosslinking is compatible with existing processing methods and allows the generation of thermo- and strain-responsive patterns that include isotropic, polydomain and monodomain phases within a single liquid crystal elastomer film. We show temporary information encryption at body temperature, expanding the functionality of liquid crystal elastomer devices in wearable applications. Lack of local phase patterning in liquid crystal elastomers has hindered their broad implementation.

  abstract     = {Lithium-rich oxide cathodes lose energy density during cycling due to atomic disordering and nanoscale structural rearrangements, which are both challenging to characterize. Here we resolve the kinetics and thermodynamics of these processes in an exemplar layered Li-rich (Li1.2–xMn0.8O2) cathode using a combined approach of ab initio molecular dynamics and cluster expansion-based Monte Carlo simulations. We identify a kinetically accessible and thermodynamically favourable mechanism to form O2 molecules in the bulk, involving Mn migration and driven by interlayer oxygen dimerization. At the top of charge, the bulk structure locally phase segregates into MnO2-rich regions and Mn-deficient nanovoids, which contain O2 molecules as a nanoconfined fluid. These nanovoids are connected in a percolating network, potentially allowing long-range oxygen transport and linking bulk O2 formation to surface O2 loss. These insights highlight the importance of developing strategies to kinetically stabilize the bulk structure of Li-rich O-redox cathodes to maintain their high energy densities. Lithium-rich oxygen-redox cathodes demonstrate high capacities, but lose energy density when cycled, showing cation disordering and formation of nanovoids and bulk molecular O2. These structural changes are shown to be a consequence of a kinetically viable and thermodynamically favoured local phase segregation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen redox cathodes, such as Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, deliver higher energy densities than those based on transition metal redox alone. However, they commonly exhibit voltage fade, a gradually diminishing discharge voltage on extended cycling. Recent research has shown that, on the first charge, oxidation of O2− ions forms O2 molecules trapped in nano-sized voids within the structure, which can be fully reduced to O2− on the subsequent discharge. Here we show that the loss of O-redox capacity on cycling and therefore voltage fade arises from a combination of a reduction in the reversibility of the O2−/O2 redox process and O2 loss. The closed voids that trap O2 grow on cycling, rendering more of the trapped O2 electrochemically inactive. The size and density of voids leads to cracking of the particles and open voids at the surfaces, releasing O2. Our findings implicate the thermodynamic driving force to form O2 as the root cause of transition metal migration, void formation and consequently voltage fade in Li-rich cathodes. Oxygen redox cathodes deliver higher energy densities than those based on transition metal redox but commonly exhibit voltage fade on extended cycling. The loss of O-redox capacity and voltage fade is shown to arise from a reduction in O2−/O2 redox process reversibility and O2 loss.},

  abstract     = {For halide perovskites that are susceptible to photolysis and ion migration, iodide-related defects, such as iodine (I2) and iodine vacancies, are inevitable. Even a small number of these defects can trigger self-accelerating chemical reactions, posing serious challenges to the durability of perovskite solar cells. Fortunately, before I2 can damage the perovskites under illumination, they generally diffuse over a long distance. Therefore, detrimental I2 can be captured by interfacial materials with strong iodide/polyiodide (Ix−) affinities, such as fullerenes and perfluorodecyl iodide. However, fullerenes in direct contact with perovskites fail to confine Ix− ions within the perovskite layer but cause detrimental iodine vacancies. Perfluorodecyl iodide, with its directional Ix− affinity through halogen bonding, can both capture and confine Ix−. Therefore, inverted perovskite solar cells with over 10 times improved ultraviolet irradiation and thermal-light stabilities (under 85 °C and 1 sun illumination), and 1,000 times improved reverse-bias stability (under ISOS-V ageing tests) have been developed. Iodide-related defects pose serious challenges to the irradiation, thermal, light or reverse-bias stabilities of perovskite solar cells. Here, the authors find that by using the iodide/polyiodide capture and confine effects of perfluorodecyl iodide interfacing with perovskites, inverted perovskite solar cells achieve much improved stabilities.},

Here we present transmissive thin scintillators made from CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, designed for real-time single-proton counting. These perovskite scintillators exhibit exceptional sensitivity, with a high light yield (~100,000 photons per MeV) when subjected to proton beams. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to radiative emission from biexcitons generated through proton-induced upconversion and impact ionization. These scintillators can detect as few as seven protons per second, a sensitivity level far below the rates encountered in clinical settings. The combination of rapid response (~336 ps) and pronounced ionostability enables diverse applications, including single-proton tracing, patterned irradiation and super-resolution proton imaging. These advancements have the potential to improve proton dosimetry in proton therapy and radiography. Current organic proton detectors have poor detection sensitivities due to low light yields and limited radiation toleration. Here the authors report a perovskite nanocrystal-based transmissive thin scintillator that can detect seven protons per second, enabled by radiative emission from biexcitons.},

  abstract     = {Condensates are a hallmark of emergence in quantum materials such as superconductors and charge density waves. Excitonic insulators are an intriguing addition to this library, exhibiting spontaneous condensation of electron–hole pairs. However, condensate observables can be obscured through parasitic coupling to the lattice. Here we employ nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy to disentangle such obscurants through measurement of the quantum dynamics. We target Ta2NiSe5, a putative room-temperature excitonic insulator in which electron–lattice coupling dominates the structural transition (Tc = 326 K), hindering identification of excitonic correlations. A pronounced increase in the terahertz reflectivity manifests following photoexcitation and exhibits a Bose–Einstein condensation-like temperature dependence well below the Tc, suggesting an approach to monitor the exciton condensate dynamics. Nonetheless, dynamic condensate–phonon coupling remains as evidenced by peaks in the enhanced reflectivity spectrum at select infrared-active phonon frequencies, indicating that parametric reflectivity enhancement arises from phonon squeezing. Our results highlight that coherent dynamics can drive parametric stimulated emission. Employing nonlinear, time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to study condensate dynamics on Ta2NiSe5—a narrow-bandgap semiconductor and putative excitonic insulator—the authors reveal enhanced terahertz reflectivity upon photoexcitation and condensation-like temperature dependence below the structural transition critical temperature.},

Ultrafast external fields that couple exclusively to electronic order parameters have rarely been investigated, however, despite their potential importance in inducing exotic effects. Here we show that when inversion symmetry is broken by the antiferromagnetic order in Cr2O3, transmitting a linearly polarized light pulse through the crystal gives rise to an in-plane rotational symmetry-breaking (from C3 to C1) via optical rectification. Using interferometric time-resolved second harmonic generation, we show that the ultrafast timescale of the symmetry reduction is indicative of a purely electronic response; the underlying spin and crystal structures remain unaffected. The symmetry-broken state exhibits a dipole moment, and its polar axis can be controlled with the incident light. Our results establish a coherent nonlinear optical protocol by which to break electronic symmetries and produce unconventional electronic effects in solids. A light-induced polar electronic state is generated in Cr2O3; the symmetry reduction occurs on an ultrafast timescale, ruling out contributions from the lattice or spins.},

Although the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect has been identified in various chiral materials, its Onsager reciprocal process, the inverse chirality-induced spin selectivity effect, remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of the inverse chirality-induced spin selectivity effect in chiral assemblies of π-conjugated polymers. Using spin-pumping techniques, the inverse chirality-induced spin selectivity effect enables quantification of the magnitude of the longitudinal spin-to-charge conversion driven by chirality-induced spin selectivity in different chiral polymers. By widely tuning conductivities and supramolecular chiral structures via a printing method, we found a very long spin relaxation time of up to several nanoseconds parallel to the chiral axis. Our demonstration of the inverse chirality-induced spin selectivity effect suggests possibilities for elucidating the puzzling interplay between spin and chirality, and opens a route for spintronic applications using printable chiral assemblies.

We demonstrate that the equilibrium terahertz conductivity and non-equilibrium terahertz responses of an optimally Sr-doped nickelate film (superconducting transition temperature of Tc = 17 K) are in line with the electrodynamics of d-wave superconductivity in the dirty limit. The gap-to-Tc ratio (2Δ/kBTc) is found to be 3.4, indicating that the superconductivity falls in the weak coupling regime. In addition, we observed substantial superconducting fluctuations near Tc that do not extend into the deep normal state as the optimally hole-doped cuprates do. Our results support a d-wave system that closely resembles the electron-doped cuprates.

The out-of-plane spins in PtTe2/WTe2 bilayers enable the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization at room temperature without magnetic fields, and the power consumption is 67 times smaller than that of the Pt control case. The high out-of-plane spin Hall conductivity is attributed to the conversion from in-plane spin to out-of-plane spin, induced by the crystal asymmetry of WTe2.

Recently, such structures have also been created on surfaces under encapsulation by graphene, allowing studies at elevated temperatures through scanning tunnelling microscopy. However, for this technique, the encapsulation layer often obscures the arrangement of the noble gas atoms. Here we create Kr and Xe clusters in between two suspended graphene layers, and uncover their atomic structure through transmission electron microscopy. We show that small crystals (N &amp;lt; 9) arrange on the basis of the simple non-directional van der Waals interaction. Larger crystals show some deviations, possibly enabled by deformations in the encapsulating graphene lattice. We further discuss the dynamics of the clusters within the graphene sandwich, and show that although all the Xe clusters with up to N ≈ 100 remain solid, Kr clusters with already N ≈ 16 turn occasionally fluid under our experimental conditions (under a pressure of ~0.3 GPa). This study opens a way for the so-far unexplored frontier of encapsulated two-dimensional van der Waals solids with exciting possibilities for fundamental condensed-matter physics research and possible applications in quantum information technology. Direct observation of noble gas structures has been achieved at room temperature using electron microscopy. This was enabled by trapping them between two layers of graphene, where they form two-dimensional clusters.},

  abstract     = {The strength–ductility trade-off has long been a Gordian knot in conventional metallic structural materials and it is no exception in multi-principal element alloys. In particular, at ultrahigh yield strengths, plastic instability, that is, necking, happens prematurely, because of which ductility almost entirely disappears. This is due to the growing difficulty in the production and accumulation of dislocations from the very beginning of tensile deformation that renders the conventional dislocation hardening insufficient. Here we propose that premature necking can be harnessed for work hardening in a VCoNi multi-principal element alloy. Lüders banding as an initial tensile response induces the ongoing localized necking at the band front to produce both triaxial stress and strain gradient, which enables the rapid multiplication of dislocations. This leads to forest dislocation hardening, plus extra work hardening due to the interaction of dislocations with the local-chemical-order regions. The dual work hardening combines to restrain and stabilize the premature necking in reverse as well as to facilitate uniform deformation. Consequently, a superior strength-and-ductility synergy is achieved with a ductility of ~20% and yield strength of 2 GPa during room-temperature and cryogenic deformation. These findings offer an instability-control paradigm for synergistic work hardening to conquer the strength–ductility paradox at ultrahigh yield strengths. Harnessing premature necking produces a rapid multiplication of dislocations to interact with local chemical orders for work hardening in VCoNi alloy, achieving ductility of 20% and yield strength of 2 GPa during room-temperature and cryogenic deformation.},

Until now, ODS alloys have been developed for reducible metals by chemical processing methods, but there are no commercially available ODS alloys for unreducible metals, namely, Al, Mg, Ti, Zr and so on, owing to the challenge of uniformly dispersing oxide particles in these alloys by traditional techniques. Here we present a strategy to achieve ODS Al alloys containing highly dispersive 5 nm MgO nanoparticles by powder metallurgy, using nanoparticles that have in situ-grown graphene-like coatings and hence largely reduced surface energy. Notably, the densely dispersed MgO nanoparticles, which have a fully coherent relationship with an Al matrix, show effective suppression of interfacial vacancy diffusion, thus leading to unprecedented strength (~200 MPa) and creep resistance at temperatures as high as 500 °C. Our processing approach should enable the dispersion of ultrafine nanoparticles in a wide range of alloys for high-temperature-related applications. An interface modification strategy has been developed to uniformly distribute high-density sub-10 nm coherent MgO particles in an Al matrix, resulting in high strength and creep resistance at temperatures up to 500 °C.},

However, most materials are challenging to produce as uniform, thin crystals. Here we present a synthesis approach where thin crystals are grown in a nanoscale mould defined by atomically flat van der Waals (vdW) materials. By heating and compressing bismuth in a vdW mould made of hexagonal boron nitride, we grow ultraflat bismuth crystals less than 10 nm thick. Due to quantum confinement, the bismuth bulk states are gapped, isolating intrinsic Rashba surface states for transport studies. The vdW-moulded bismuth shows exceptional electronic transport, enabling the observation of Shubnikov–de Haas quantum oscillations originating from the (111) surface state Landau levels. By measuring the gate-dependent magnetoresistance, we observe multi-carrier quantum oscillations and Landau level splitting, with features originating from both the top and bottom surfaces. Our vdW mould growth technique establishes a platform for electronic studies and control of bismuth’s Rashba surface states and topological boundary modes1–3. Beyond bismuth, the vdW-moulding approach provides a low-cost way to synthesize ultrathin crystals and directly integrate them into a vdW heterostructure. Ultrathin and flat crystals of bismuth are grown between the atomically flat layers of a van der Waals material.

  abstract     = {Breast cancer becomes invasive when carcinoma cells invade through the basement membrane (BM)—a nanoporous layer of matrix that physically separates the primary tumour from the stroma. Single cells can invade through nanoporous three-dimensional matrices due to protease-mediated degradation or force-mediated widening of pores via invadopodial protrusions. However, how multiple cells collectively invade through the physiological BM, as they do during breast cancer progression, remains unclear. Here we developed a three-dimensional in vitro model of collective invasion of the BM during breast cancer. We show that cells utilize both proteases and forces—but not invadopodia—to breach the BM. Forces are generated from a combination of global cell volume expansion, which stretches the BM, and local contractile forces that act in the plane of the BM to breach it, allowing invasion. These results uncover a mechanism by which cells collectively interact to overcome a critical barrier to metastasis. Forces resulting from global cell volume expansion and local cell contractions distort the basement membrane of an in vitro three-dimensional model of breast cancer, to promote collective cell invasion that precedes metastasis.},

Here we decoupled the particle Brownian motion from colloidal stability to achieve a permanent fluidic magnet with high magnetization, flowability and reconfigurability. The key to create such permanent fluidic magnets is to maintain a stable magnetic colloidal fluid by using non-Brownian magnetic particles to self-assemble a three-dimensional oriented and ramified magnetic network structure in the carrier fluid. This structure has high coercivity and permanent magnetization, with long-term magnetization stability. We establish a scaling theory model to decipher the permanent fluid magnet formation criteria and formulate a general assembly guideline. Further, we develop injectable and retrievable permanent-fluidic-magnet-based liquid bioelectronics for highly sensitive, self-powered wireless cardiovascular monitoring. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of permanent fluidic magnets as an ultrasoft material for liquid devices and systems, from bioelectronics to robotics. The magnetism-mediated assembly of non-Brownian magnetic colloidal particles into a three-dimensional oriented and ramified magnetic network yields permanent fluidic magnets that are used in a self-powered, liquid-based wireless cardiovascular sensor.},

However, developing green and efficient methods to precisely synthesize alternating CP structures on a large scale remains challenging and critical for their industrialization. Here a room-temperature, scalable and homogeneous Suzuki–Miyaura-type polymerization reaction is developed with broad generality validated for 24 CPs including donor–donor, donor–acceptor and acceptor–acceptor connectivities, yielding device-quality polymers with high molecular masses. Furthermore, the polymerization protocol significantly reduces homocoupling structural defects, yielding more structurally regular and higher-performance electronic materials and optoelectronic devices than conventional thermally activated polymerizations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that a borate transmetalation process plays a key role in suppressing protodeboronation, which is critical for large-scale structural regularity. Thus, these results provide a general polymerization tool for the scalable production of device-quality CPs with alternating structural regularity. A general process for a room-temperature, homogeneous Suzuki–Miyaura-type polymerization is reported, demonstrating a route for the scalable production of device-quality conjugated polymers.},

Deposition is often performed at various rates and temperatures on rigid substrates to control the glass properties. Here we demonstrate that on soft, rubbery substrates, surface-mediated equilibration is enhanced up to 170 nm away from the interface, forming stable glasses with densities up to 2.5% higher than liquid-quenched glasses within 2.5 h of deposition. Gaining similar properties on rigid substrates would require 10 million times slower deposition, taking ~3,000 years. Controlling the modulus of the rubbery substrate provides control over the glass structure and density at constant deposition conditions. These results underscore the significance of substrate elasticity in manipulating the properties of the mobile surface layer and thus the glass structure and properties, allowing access to deeper states of the energy landscape without prohibitively slow deposition rates. Controlling substrate elasticity during physical vapour deposition allows access to high-density stable glasses that would otherwise be formed under prohibitively slow deposition conditions on rigid substrates.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid organic/inorganic materials have contributed to solve important challenges in different areas of science. One of the biggest challenges for a more sustainable society is to have active and stable catalysts that enable the transition from fossil fuel to renewable feedstocks, reduce energy consumption and minimize the environmental footprint. Here we synthesize novel hybrid materials where an amorphous oxide coating with embedded organic ligands surrounds metallic nanocrystals. We demonstrate that the hybrid coating is a powerful means to create electrocatalysts stable against structural reconstruction during the CO2 electroreduction. These electrocatalysts consist of copper nanocrystals encapsulated in a hybrid organic/inorganic alumina shell. This shell locks a fraction of the copper surface into a reduction-resistant Cu2+ state, which inhibits those redox processes responsible for the structural reconstruction of copper. The electrocatalyst activity is preserved, which would not be possible with a conventional dense alumina coating. Varying the shell thickness and the coating morphology yields fundamental insights into the stabilization mechanism and emphasizes the importance of the Lewis acidity of the shell in relation to the retention of catalyst structure. The synthetic tunability of the chemistry developed herein opens new avenues for the design of stable electrocatalysts and beyond. Active and stable catalysts to accelerate the transition from fossil fuel to renewable feedstocks, reduce energy consumption and minimize environmental footprints are needed. Electrocatalysts based on copper nanocrystals encapsulated in hybrid alumina shells stable against structural reconstruction during CO2 electroreduction are reported.},

  abstract     = {Fast charging is a critical concern for the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices, driving extensive research on new electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors and micro-supercapacitors. Here we introduce a significant advance in producing thick ruthenium nitride pseudocapacitive films fabricated using a sputter deposition method. These films deliver over 0.8 F cm–2 (~500 F cm–3) with a time constant below 6 s. By utilizing an original electrochemical oxidation process, the volumetric capacitance doubles (1,200 F cm–3) without sacrificing cycling stability. This enables an extended operating potential window up to 0.85 V versus Hg/HgO, resulting in a boost to 3.2 F cm–2 (3,200 F cm–3). Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal novel insights into the electrochemical oxidation process. The charge storage mechanism takes advantage of the high electrical conductivity and the morphology of cubic ruthenium nitride and Ru phases in the feather-like core, leading to high electrical conductivity in combination with high capacity. Accordingly, we have developed an analysis that relates capacity to time constant as a means of identifying materials capable of retaining high capacity at high charge/discharge rates. Fast charging is driving extensive research on enhanced electrodes for high-performance electrochemical capacitors and micro-supercapacitors. Thick ruthenium nitride pseudocapacitive films are shown to exhibit enhanced capacitance with a time constant of less than 6 s.},

Spectroscopic experiments and computer simulations show that these dynamics in aqueous systems occur on a picosecond timescale. In the case of organic electrolytes, however, conflicting values ranging from 1 to several 100 picoseconds have been reported. We resolve this conflict by studying mixtures of an organic polymer and a lithium salt. Lithium ions coordinate with multiple polymer chains, resulting in temporary crosslinks. Relaxation of these crosslinks, detected by quasielastic neutron scattering, are directly related to solvation dynamics. Simulations reveal a broad spectrum of relaxation times. The average timescale for solvation dynamics in both experiment and simulation is one nanosecond. We present the direct measurement of ultraslow dynamics of solvation shell break-up in an electrolyte. Solvation dynamics at picosecond timescales critically affect charge transport in aqueous systems, but conflicting values have been reported for organic electrolytes. Lifetimes on the order of 1 ns for mixtures of organic polymer and lithium salt exhibiting ultraslow dynamics of solvation shell break-up are now reported.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the factors underpinning device switching times is crucial for the implementation of organic electrochemical transistors in neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics and real-time sensing applications. Existing models of device operation cannot explain the experimental observations that turn-off times are generally much faster than turn-on times in accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors. Here, using operando optical microscopy, we image the local doping level of the transistor channel and show that turn-on occurs in two stages—propagation of a doping front, followed by uniform doping—while turn-off occurs in one stage. We attribute the faster turn-off to a combination of engineering as well as physical and chemical factors including channel geometry, differences in doping and dedoping kinetics and the phenomena of carrier-density-dependent mobility. We show that ion transport limits the operation speed in our devices. Our study provides insights into the kinetics of organic electrochemical transistors and guidelines for engineering faster organic electrochemical transistors. The turn-off time is generally faster than the turn-on time in accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), but the mechanism is less understood. Here the authors find different transient behaviours of turn-on and turn-off in accumulation mode OECTs, and ion transport is the limiting factor of device kinetics.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the structural and dynamic properties of disordered systems at the mesoscale is crucial. This is particularly important in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), which undergo significant and complex structural changes when operated in an electrolyte. In this study, we investigate the mesoscale strain, reversibility and dynamics of a model OMIEC material under external electrochemical potential using operando X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Our results reveal that strain and structural hysteresis depend on the sample’s cycling history, establishing a comprehensive kinetic sequence bridging the macroscopic and microscopic behaviours of OMIECs. Furthermore, we uncover the equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of charge carriers and material-doping states, highlighting the unexpected coupling between charge carrier dynamics and mesoscale order. These findings advance our understanding of the structure–dynamics–function relationships in OMIECs, opening pathways for designing and engineering materials with improved performance and functionality in non-equilibrium states during device operation. Understanding mesoscale structure and dynamics in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors is crucial. Mesoscale strain kinetics and structural hysteresis have been studied, and they uncover the coupling between charge carrier dynamics and mesoscale order in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors.},

Here we use optimally oriented interdigitated surface electrodes to investigate extrinsic electrocaloric effects in low-loss epitaxial SrTiO3 films near the broad second-order 243 K ferroelectric phase transition created by biaxial in-plane coherent tensile strain from DyScO3 substrates. Our extrinsic electrocaloric effects are an order of magnitude larger than the corresponding effects in bulk SrTiO3 over a wide range of temperatures including room temperature, and unlike electrocaloric effects associated with first-order transitions they are highly reversible in unipolar applied fields. Additionally, the canonical Landau description for strained SrTiO3 films works well if we set the low-temperature zero-field polarization along one of the in-plane pseudocubic &amp;lt;100&amp;gt; directions. In future, similar strain engineering could be exploited for other films, multilayers and bulk samples to increase the range of electrocaloric materials for energy efficient cooling. Electrocaloric effects are large in a limited set of materials that display hysteretic first-order phase transitions. Here epitaxial SrTiO3 thin films are strain engineered to achieve anhysteretic second-order phase transitions, with electrocaloric effects enhanced by one order of magnitude over bulk.},

Scanning tunnelling microscopy has played a key role in probing microscopic behaviours of the moiré correlated ground states at the atomic scale. However, imaging of quantum excited states in moiré heterostructures remains an outstanding challenge. Here we develop a photocurrent tunnelling microscopy technique that combines laser excitation and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to directly visualize the electron and hole distribution within the photoexcited moiré exciton in twisted bilayer WS2. The tunnelling photocurrent alternates between positive and negative polarities at different locations within a single moiré unit cell. This alternating photocurrent originates from the in-plane charge transfer moiré exciton in twisted bilayer WS2, predicted by our GW-Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations, that emerges from the competition between the electron–hole Coulomb interaction and the moiré potential landscape. Our technique enables the exploration of photoexcited non-equilibrium moiré phenomena at the atomic scale. The authors combine laser excitation and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to visualize the electron and hole distributions in photoexcited moiré excitons in twisted bilayer WS2.

This damping appears to be a fundamental bottleneck for the use of magnets in information processing. However, here we demonstrate the recall of the magnetization-precession phase after times that exceed the damping timescale by two orders of magnitude using dedicated two-colour microwave pump–probe experiments for a Y3Fe5O12 microstructured film. Time-resolved magnetization state tomography confirms the persistent magnetic coherence by revealing a double-exponential decay of magnetization correlation. We attribute persistent magnetic coherence to a feedback effect, that is, coherent coupling of the uniform precession with long-lived excitations at the minima of the spin-wave dispersion relation. Our finding liberates magnetic systems from the strong damping in nanostructures that has limited their use in coherent information storage and processing. Precession phase of a magnetic material is shown to be recalled over timescales far exceeding that of Gilbert damping.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets hosting real-space topological textures are promising platforms to model fundamental ultrafast phenomena and explore spintronics. However, they have only been epitaxially fabricated on specific symmetry-matched substrates, thereby preserving their intrinsic magneto-crystalline order. This curtails their integration with dissimilar supports, restricting the scope of fundamental and applied investigations. Here we circumvent this limitation by designing detachable crystalline antiferromagnetic nanomembranes of α-Fe2O3. First, we show—via transmission-based antiferromagnetic vector mapping—that flat nanomembranes host a spin-reorientation transition and rich topological phenomenology. Second, we exploit their extreme flexibility to demonstrate the reconfiguration of antiferromagnetic states across three-dimensional membrane folds resulting from flexure-induced strains. Finally, we combine these developments using a controlled manipulator to realize the strain-driven non-thermal generation of topological textures at room temperature. The integration of such free-standing antiferromagnetic layers with flat/curved nanostructures could enable spin texture designs via magnetoelastic/geometric effects in the quasi-static and dynamical regimes, opening new explorations into curvilinear antiferromagnetism and unconventional computing. Topological antiferromagnetic states are generated and spatially reconfigured in free-standing crystalline membranes of haematite through strain design.},

While the superconducting diode effect lays the foundation for realizing ultralow dissipative circuits, Josephson-phenomena-based diode effect (JDE) can enable the realization of protected qubits. The superconducting diode effect and JDE reported thus far are at low temperatures (~4 K), limiting their applications. Here we demonstrate JDE persisting up to 77 K using an artificial Josephson junction of twisted layers of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ. JDE manifests as an asymmetry in the magnitude and distributions of switching currents, attaining the maximum at 45° twist. The asymmetry is induced by and tunable with a very small magnetic field applied perpendicular to the junction and arises due to interaction between Josephson and Abrikosov vortices. We report a large asymmetry of 60% at 20 K. Our results provide a path towards realizing superconducting Josephson circuits at liquid-nitrogen temperature. A large Josephson diode effect has been reported at liquid-nitrogen temperatures in twisted flakes of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ.},

  abstract     = {The conventional fabrication of bulk van der Waals (vdW) materials requires a temperature above 1,000 °C to sinter from the corresponding particulates. Here we report the near-room-temperature densification (for example, ∼45 °C for 10 min) of two-dimensional nanosheets to form strong bulk materials with a porosity of &amp;lt;0.1%, which are mechanically stronger than the conventionally made ones. The mechanistic study shows that the water-mediated activation of van der Waals interactions accounts for the strong and dense bulk materials. Initially, water adsorbed on two-dimensional nanosheets lubricates and promotes alignment. The subsequent extrusion closes the gaps between the aligned nanosheets and densifies them into strong bulk materials. Water extrusion also generates stresses that increase with moulding temperature, and too high a temperature causes intersheet misalignment; therefore, a near-room-temperature moulding process is favoured. This technique provides an energy-efficient alternative to design a wide range of dense bulk van der Waals materials with tailored compositions and properties. Strong bulk van der Waals materials are fabricated by the compressive moulding of two-dimensional nanosheets near room temperature through water-mediated densification, providing an energy-efficient way for synthesizing various van der Waals materials and a potential for tailoring compositions.},

It is found that the self-shrinking force drives the two-dimensional cellulose and supported particles to pucker and roll into fibres, a gentle process that prevents agglomeration and structural damage of the powder particles. We demonstrate over 120 fibre samples involving various powder guests, including elements, compounds, organics and hybrids in different morphologies, densities and particle sizes. Customized fibres with an adjustable diameter and guest content can be easily constructed into high-performance macromaterials with various geometries, creating a library of building blocks for different fields of applications.

Here we report the emergence of two Frank–Kasper phases from the self-assembly of five-fold symmetric molecular pentagons. The μ phase, an important intermediate in superalloys, is indexed in soft matter, whereas the ϕ phase exhibits a structure distinct from known Frank–Kasper phases in metallic systems. We find a broad size and shape distribution of self-assembled mesoatoms formed by molecular pentagons while approaching equilibrium that contribute to the unique packing structures. This work provides insight into the manipulation of soft building blocks that deviate from the typical spherical geometry and opens avenues for the fabrication of ‘soft alloy’ structures that were previously unattainable in metal alloys. Soft building blocks tend to be near spherical, limiting their packing structures to those found in metallic systems.

Development of microactuators using active materials is often hampered by their fabrication complexity and limited motion at small scales. Here we report light-fuelled artificial goosebumps to actuate passive microstructures, inspired by the natural reaction of hair bristling (piloerection) on biological skin. We use light-responsive liquid crystal elastomers as the responsive artificial skin to move three-dimensionally printed passive polymer microstructures. When exposed to a programmable femtosecond laser, the liquid crystal elastomer skin generates localized artificial goosebumps, resulting in precise actuation of the surrounding microstructures. Such microactuation can tilt micro-mirrors for the controlled manipulation of light reflection and disassemble capillary-force-induced self-assembled microstructures globally and locally. We demonstrate the potential application of the proposed microactuation system for information storage. This methodology provides precise, localized and controllable manipulation of microstructures, opening new possibilities for the development of programmable micromachines. Light-induced artificial goosebumps on liquid crystal elastomer skin are used to precisely manipulate passive microstructures, achieving a localized and controllable system for programmable micromachines.},

The developed synthesis method offers metal-dynamically stabilized atomic catalysts, and it can be applied to reducible metal oxides, including TiO2, ZnO and CeO2, containing various catalytically active transition metals, including Pt, Ir and Cu. The optimized Pt-DSA/TiO2 shows unprecedentedly high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, producing 164 mmol g−1 h−1 with a turnover frequency of 1.27 s−1. Furthermore, it generates 42.2 mmol gsub−1 of hydrogen via a non-recyclable-plastic-photoreforming process, achieving a total conversion of 98%; this offers a promising solution for mitigating plastic waste and simultaneously producing valuable energy sources.

Yet, the electrochemical performance of silicon anodes in solid-state batteries is still poor (for example, low actual specific capacity and fast capacity decay), hindering practical applications. Here the chemo-mechanical failure mechanisms of composite Si/Li6PS5Cl and solid-electrolyte-free silicon anodes are revealed by combining structural and chemical characterizations with theoretical simulations. The growth of the solid electrolyte interphase at the Si|Li6PS5Cl interface causes severe resistance increase in composite anodes, explaining their fast capacity decay. Solid-electrolyte-free silicon anodes show sufficient ionic and electronic conductivities, enabling a high specific capacity. However, microscale void formation during delithiation causes larger mechanical stress at the two-dimensional interfaces of these anodes than in composite anodes. Understanding these chemo-mechanical failure mechanisms of different anode architectures and the role of interphase formation helps to provide guidelines for the design of improved electrode materials. Although silicon anodes are promising for solid-state batteries, they still suffer from poor electrochemical performance. Chemo-mechanical failure mechanisms of composite Si|Li6PS5Cl and solid-electrolyte-free silicon anodes are now revealed and should help in designing improved electrodes.},

We find that the face-sharing Li configurations create a novel spinel with unconventional stoichiometry and raise the energy of Li, thereby promoting fast Li-ion conduction. The over-stoichiometric Li–In–Sn–O compound exhibits a total Li superionic conductivity of 3.38 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature with a low migration barrier of 255 meV.

We report the synergetic enhancement in figure of merit (ZT) and stability in Cu1.99Se-based superionic conductors enabled by ion confinement effects. Guided by density functional theory and nudged elastic band simulations, we elevated the activation energy to restrict ion migrations through a cation–anion co-doping strategy. We reduced the carrier concentration without sacrificing the low thermal conductivity, obtaining a ZT of ∼3.0 at 1,050 K. Notably, the fabricated device module maintained a high conversion efficiency of up to ∼13.4% for a temperature difference of 518 K without obvious degradation after 120 cycles. Our work could be generalized to develop electrically and thermally robust functional materials with ionic migration characteristics. Cu2Se is of interest for thermoelectrics as it is environmentally sustainable and has a high figure of merit ZT; however, copper ion migration impacts device stability. Here a co-doping strategy that combines steric and electrostatic effects is shown to improve device stability as well as improving ZT to 3.},

  abstract     = {Hyperfluorescence shows great promise for the next generation of commercially feasible blue organic light-emitting diodes, for which eliminating the Dexter transfer to terminal emitter triplet states is key to efficiency and stability. Current devices rely on high-gap matrices to prevent Dexter transfer, which unfortunately leads to overly complex devices from a fabrication standpoint. Here we introduce a molecular design where ultranarrowband blue emitters are covalently encapsulated by insulating alkylene straps. Organic light-emitting diodes with simple emissive layers consisting of pristine thermally activated delayed fluorescence hosts doped with encapsulated terminal emitters exhibit negligible external quantum efficiency drops compared with non-doped devices, enabling a maximum external quantum efficiency of 21.5%. To explain the high efficiency in the absence of high-gap matrices, we turn to transient absorption spectroscopy. It is directly observed that Dexter transfer from a pristine thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer host can be substantially reduced by an encapsulated terminal emitter, opening the door to highly efficient ‘matrix-free’ blue hyperfluorescence. Suppressed Dexter transfer is needed to achieve efficient and stable hyperfluorescence, but complex matrices must be involved. A molecular design strategy has been proposed where Dexter transfer can be substantially reduced by an encapsulated terminal emitter, leading to ‘matrix-free’ hyperfluorescence.},

Spin-active single defect centres have been studied in wide bandgap materials including diamond, SiC and hexagonal boron nitride, each with associated advantages for applications. We report the discovery of optically detected magnetic resonance in two distinct species of bright, isolated defect centres hosted in GaN. In one group, we find negative optically detected magnetic resonance of a few percent associated with a metastable electronic state, whereas in the other, we find positive optically detected magnetic resonance of up to 30% associated with the ground and optically excited electronic states. We examine the spin symmetry axis of each defect species and establish coherent control over a single defect’s ground-state spin. Given the maturity of the semiconductor host, these results are promising for scalable and integrated quantum sensing applications. Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient mechanism for quantum sensors and has been discovered in a few systems, but all have technological limitations. Here the authors report room temperature ODMR in single defects in GaN, promising for integrated quantum sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Surface plasmon polaritons and phonon polaritons offer a means of surpassing the diffraction limit of conventional optics and facilitate efficient energy storage, local field enhancement and highsensitivity sensing, benefiting from their subwavelength confinement of light. Unfortunately, losses severely limit the propagation decay length, thus restricting the practical use of polaritons. While optimizing the fabrication technique can help circumvent the scattering loss of imperfect structures, the intrinsic absorption channel leading to heat production cannot be eliminated. Here, we utilize synthetic optical excitation of complex frequency with virtual gain, synthesized by combining the measurements made at multiple real frequencies, to compensate losses in the propagations of phonon polaritons with dramatically enhanced propagation distance. The concept of synthetic complex frequency excitation represents a viable solution to the loss problem for various applications including photonic circuits, waveguiding and plasmonic/phononic structured illumination microscopy. Propagation losses have limited the practical use of polaritons in photonic applications. Here the authors demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the propagation distance of phonon polaritons, employing synthetic optical excitation of complex frequency with virtual gain synthesized by combining multiple real frequency measurements.},

  abstract     = {Compressing light into nanocavities substantially enhances light–matter interactions, which has been a major driver for nanostructured materials research. However, extreme confinement generally comes at the cost of absorption and low resonator quality factors. Here we suggest an alternative optical multimodal confinement mechanism, unlocking the potential of hyperbolic phonon polaritons in isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride. We produce deep-subwavelength cavities and demonstrate several orders of magnitude improvement in confinement, with estimated Purcell factors exceeding 108 and quality factors in the 50–480 range, values approaching the intrinsic quality factor of hexagonal boron nitride polaritons. Intriguingly, the quality factors we obtain exceed the maximum predicted by impedance-mismatch considerations, indicating that confinement is boosted by higher-order modes. We expect that our multimodal approach to nanoscale polariton manipulation will have far-reaching implications for ultrastrong light–matter interactions, mid-infrared nonlinear optics and nanoscale sensors. Exploiting optical multimodal confinement, the deep-subwavelength confinement of hyperbolic phonon polaritons is demonstrated in isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitride, enabling nanoscale polariton manipulation.},

  abstract     = {The primordial ingredient of cuprate superconductivity is the CuO2 unit cell. Theories usually concentrate on the intra-atom Coulombic interactions dominating the 3d9 and 3d10 configurations of each copper ion. However, if Coulombic interactions also occur between electrons of the 2p6 orbitals of each planar oxygen atom, spontaneous orbital ordering may split their energy levels. This long-predicted intra-unit-cell symmetry breaking should generate an orbitally ordered phase, for which the charge transfer energy ε separating the 2p6 and 3d10 orbitals is distinct for the two oxygen atoms. Here we introduce sublattice-resolved ε(r) imaging to CuO2 studies and discover intra-unit-cell rotational symmetry breaking of ε(r). Spatially, this state is arranged in disordered Ising domains of orthogonally oriented orbital order bounded by dopant ions, and within whose domain walls low-energy electronic quadrupolar two-level systems occur. Overall, these data reveal a Q = 0 orbitally ordered state that splits the oxygen energy levels by ~50 meV, in underdoped CuO2. An orbitally ordered state in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x is revealed, which splits the energy levels of oxygen orbitals by ~50 meV.},

  abstract     = {A hallmark of many unconventional superconductors is the presence of many-body interactions that give rise to broken-symmetry states intertwined with superconductivity. Recent resonant soft X-ray scattering experiments report commensurate 3a0 charge density wave order in infinite-layer nickelates, which has important implications regarding the universal interplay between charge order and superconductivity in both cuprates and nickelates. Here we present X-ray scattering and spectroscopy measurements on a series of NdNiO2+x samples, which reveal that the signatures of charge density wave order are absent in fully reduced, single-phase NdNiO2. The 3a0 superlattice peak instead originates from a partially reduced impurity phase where excess apical oxygens form ordered rows with three-unit-cell periodicity. The absence of any observable charge density wave order in NdNiO2 highlights a crucial difference between the phase diagrams of cuprate and nickelate superconductors. Samples of NdNiO2+x are prepared with meticulous control of the oxygen content. Their X-ray scattering and spectroscopy measurements then reveal that the previously reported charge density wave in undoped infinite-layer nickelates is, in fact, a spurious effect.},

  abstract     = {In anisotropic crystals, the direction-dependent effective mass of carriers can have a profound impact on spin transport dynamics. The puckered crystal structure of black phosphorus leads to direction-dependent charge transport and optical response, suggesting that it is an ideal system for studying anisotropic spin transport. To this end, we fabricate and characterize high-mobility encapsulated ultrathin black-phosphorus-based spin valves in a four-terminal geometry. Our measurements show that in-plane spin lifetimes are strongly gate tunable and exceed one nanosecond. Through high out-of-plane magnetic fields, we observe a fivefold enhancement in the out-of-plane spin signal case compared to in-plane and estimate a colossal spin-lifetime anisotropy of ∼6. This finding is further confirmed by oblique Hanle measurements. Additionally, we estimate an in-plane spin-lifetime anisotropy ratio of up to 1.8. Our observation of strongly anisotropic spin transport along three orthogonal axes in this pristine material could be exploited to realize directionally tunable spin transport. The authors study spin transport anisotropy in a 5.5 nm black phosphorus ribbon encapsulated by boron nitride.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional materials have emerged as an important research frontier for overcoming the challenges in nanoelectronics and for exploring new physics. Among them, black phosphorus, with a combination of a tunable bandgap and high mobility, is one of the most promising systems. In particular, black phosphorus nanoribbons show excellent electrostatic gate control, which can mitigate short-channel effects in nanoscale transistors. Controlled synthesis of black phosphorus nanoribbons, however, has remained an outstanding problem. Here we report large-area growth of black phosphorus nanoribbons directly on insulating substrates. We seed the chemical vapour transport growth with black phosphorus nanoparticles and obtain uniform, single-crystal nanoribbons oriented exclusively along the [100] crystal direction. With comprehensive structural calculations, we discover that self-passivation at the zigzag edges holds the key to the preferential one-dimensional growth. Field-effect transistors based on individual nanoribbons exhibit on/off ratios up to ~104, confirming the good semiconducting behaviour of the nanoribbons. These results demonstrate the potential of black phosphorus nanoribbons for nanoelectronic devices and also provide a platform for investigating the exotic physics in black phosphorus. Single-crystal black phosphorus nanoribbons are grown uniformly on insulating substrates by chemical vapour transport growth with black phosphorus nanoparticles as seeds, demonstrating potential for application in nanoelectronic devices and the exploration of the exotic physics in black phosphorus.},

In this Review, we highlight experimental and computational efforts to understand the routes to fabricate TMC/TMD heterostructures. Furthermore, we showcase how controlling these heterostructures can lead to emergent electronic transport, optical properties and improved catalytic properties. Non-layered transition metal carbides (TMCs) and layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can form various heterostructure configurations through chemical conversion.

  abstract     = {Cancer cell glycocalyx is a major line of defence against immune surveillance. However, how specific physical properties of the glycocalyx are regulated on a molecular level, contribute to immune evasion and may be overcome through immunoengineering must be resolved. Here we report how cancer-associated mucins and their glycosylation contribute to the nanoscale material thickness of the glycocalyx and consequently modulate the functional interactions with cytotoxic immune cells. Natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity is inversely correlated with the glycocalyx thickness of the target cells. Changes in glycocalyx thickness of approximately 10 nm can alter the susceptibility to immune cell attack. Enhanced stimulation of natural killer and T cells through equipment with chimeric antigen receptors can improve the cytotoxicity against mucin-bearing target cells. Alternatively, cytotoxicity can be enhanced through engineering effector cells to display glycocalyx-editing enzymes, including mucinases and sialidases. Together, our results motivate the development of immunoengineering strategies that overcome the glycocalyx armour of cancer cells. A nanoscale polymer layer formed by mucins at the surface of tumour cells protects them against immune cell attack. This shield can be circumvented through immune cell engineering, using chimeric antigen receptors to stimulate natural killer and T cells or by tethering glycocalyx-editing enzymes to immune cells.},

Here we describe the assembly of colloidal quasicrystals by exploiting the geometry of nanoscale decahedra and the programmable bonding characteristics of DNA immobilized on their facets. This process is enthalpy-driven, works over a range of particle sizes and DNA lengths, and is made possible by the energetic preference of the system to maximize DNA duplex formation and favour facet alignment, generating local five- and six-coordinated motifs. This class of axial structures is defined by a square–triangle tiling with rhombus defects and successive on-average quasiperiodic layers exhibiting stacking disorder which provides the entropy necessary for thermodynamic stability. Taken together, these results establish an engineering milestone in the deliberate design of programmable matter. The rational design and assembly of colloidal quasicrystals is achieved by exploring the hybridization of nanoscale decahedra nanoparticles functionalized with DNA linkers.},

  abstract     = {The structure–property paradox of biological tissues, in which water-rich porous structures efficiently transfer mass while remaining highly mechanically stiff, remains unsolved. Although hydrogel/sponge hybridization is the key to understanding this phenomenon, material incompatibility makes this a challenging task. Here we describe hydrogel/sponge hybrids (hydrospongels) that behave as both ultrastiff water-rich gels and reversibly squeezable sponges. The self-organizing network of cyano-p-aramid nanofibres holds approximately 5,000 times more water than its solid content. Hydrospongels, even at a water concentration exceeding 90 wt%, are hard as cartilage with an elastic modulus of 50−80 MPa, and are 10–1,000 times stiffer than typical hydrogels. They endure a compressive strain above 85% through poroelastic relaxation and hydrothermal pressure at 120 °C. This performance is produced by amphiphilic surfaces, high rigidity and an interfibrillar, interaction-driven percolating network of nanofibres. These features can inspire the development of future biofunctional materials. Biological tissues are extremely water rich but remain mechanically stiff, behaviour that is difficult to recapitulate in synthetic materials. Here the authors design a hydrogel/sponge hybrid material driven by a self-organized network of cyano-p-aramid nanofibres that combines these properties for biofunctional materials.},

  abstract     = {Nanostructured composite electrode materials play a major role in the fields of catalysis and electrochemistry. The self-assembly of metallic nanoparticles on oxide supports via metal exsolution relies on the transport of reducible dopants towards the perovskite surface to provide accessible catalytic centres at the solid–gas interface. At surfaces and interfaces, however, strong electrostatic gradients and space charges typically control the properties of oxides. Here we reveal that the nature of the surface–dopant interaction is the main determining factor for the exsolution kinetics of nickel in SrTi0.9Nb0.05Ni0.05O3–δ. The electrostatic interaction of dopants with surface space charge regions forming upon thermal oxidation results in strong surface passivation, which manifests in a retarded exsolution response. We furthermore demonstrate the controllability of the exsolution response via engineering of the perovskite surface chemistry. Our findings indicate that tailoring the electrostatic gradients at the perovskite surface is an essential step to improve exsolution-type materials in catalytic converters. The self-assembly of metallic nanoparticles on oxide supports via metal exsolution relies on dopant transport, but strong electrostatic gradients and space charges typically control the properties of surfaces.

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. Some of these processes divide the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions into electrochemical and chemical sub-reactions, enabling them to achieve high efficiency. However, high efficiency has been demonstrated only in a batch process with thermal swings that present operational challenges. This work introduces a breakthrough process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supports continuous operation in a membraneless system. We demonstrate high faradaic and electrolytic efficiency and high rate operation in a near-neutral electrolyte of NaBr in water, whereby bromide is electro-oxidized to bromate concurrent with hydrogen evolution in one cell, and bromate is chemically reduced to bromide in a catalytic reaction that evolves oxygen in another cell. This process may lead the way to high-efficiency membraneless water electrolysis that overcomes the limitations of century-old membrane electrolysis. Hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is key to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Decoupling hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions during electrolysis is attractive but efficiency and operational challenges remain. A process producing hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supporting continuous operation in a membraneless system is now proposed.},

While both steady-state and transient photoluminescence are frequently used to assess recombination in perovskite absorbers, quantitative analyses within a consistent model are seldom reported. We use transient photoluminescence measurements with a large dynamic range of more than ten orders of magnitude on triple-cation perovskite films showing long-lived photoluminescence transients featuring continuously changing decay times that range from tens of nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds. We quantitatively explain both the transient and steady-state photoluminescence with the presence of a high density of shallow defects and consequent high rates of charge carrier trapping, thereby showing that deep defects do not affect the recombination dynamics. The complex carrier kinetics caused by emission and recombination processes via shallow defects imply that the reporting of only single lifetime values, as is routinely done in the literature, is meaningless for such materials. We show that the features indicative for shallow defects seen in the bare films remain dominant in finished devices and are therefore also crucial to understanding the performance of perovskite solar cells. Quantifying recombination in halide perovskites is crucial, but quantitative analysis remains rare. Here the authors observe a long-lived and continuously changing photoluminescence decay time due to the high density of shallow defects and substantial rates of charge carrier trapping.},

  abstract     = {Transparent conducting oxides are a critical component in modern (opto)electronic devices and solar energy conversion systems, and forming textured functional films on them is highly desirable for property manipulation and performance optimization. However, technologically important materials show varied crystal structures, making it difficult to establish coherent interfaces and consequently the oriented growth of these materials on transparent conducting oxides. Here, taking lattice-mismatched hexagonal α-Fe2O3 and tetragonal fluorine-doped tin oxide as the example, atomic-level investigations reveal that a coherent ordered structure forms at their interface, and via an oxygen-mediated dimensional and chemical-matching manner, that is, matched Voronoi cells of oxygen sublattices, [110]-oriented α-Fe2O3 films develop on fluorine-doped tin oxide. Further measurements of charge transport characteristics and photoelectronic effects highlight the importance and advantages of coherent interfaces and well-defined orientation in textured α-Fe2O3 films. Textured growth of lattice-mismatched oxides, including spinel Co3O4, fluorite CeO2, perovskite BiFeO3 and even halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6, on fluorine-doped tin oxide is also achieved, offering new opportunities to develop high-performance transparent-conducting-oxide-supported devices. Depositing textured functional materials on transparent conducting oxides remains a challenge. We demonstrate the formation of a coherent interface between a set of functional oxides and fluorine-doped-tin-oxide-based transparent conducting oxide substrate despite the lattice mismatch, owing to dimensional and chemical matching of oxygen sublattices at the interface.},

  abstract     = {Topological insulators are a concept that originally stems from condensed matter physics. As a corollary to their hallmark protected edge transport, the conventional understanding of such systems holds that they are intrinsically closed, that is, that they are assumed to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world. Here, by demonstrating a parity–time-symmetric topological insulator, we show that topological transport exists beyond these constraints. Implemented on a photonic platform, our non-Hermitian topological system harnesses the complex interplay between a discrete coupling protocol and judiciously placed losses and, as such, inherently constitutes an open system. Nevertheless, even though energy conservation is violated, our system exhibits an entirely real eigenvalue spectrum as well as chiral edge transport. Along these lines, this work enables the study of the dynamical properties of topological matter in open systems without the instability arising from complex spectra. Thus, it may inspire the development of compact active devices that harness topological features on-demand. The authors propose a non-Hermitian topological insulator with a real-valued energy spectrum based on a periodically driven Floquet model implemented in a photonic platform where generalized parity–time symmetry is protected against spontaneous symmetry breaking under a spatiotemporal gain and loss distribution.},

The physical configuration of traditional physical unclonable functions is either fixed or can only be permanently modified, allowing one token per device and limiting their practicality. Here we overcome this limitation by creating reconfigurable structures made by light-transformable polymers in which the physical structure of the unclonable function can be reconfigured reversibly. Our approach allows the simultaneous coexistence of multiple physical unclonable functions within one device. The physical transformation is done all-optically in a reversible and spatially controlled fashion, allowing the generation of more complex keys. At the same time, as a set of switchable individual physical unclonable functions, it enables the authentication of multiple clients and allows for the practical implementations of quantum secure authentication and nonlinear generators of cryptographic keys. Employing light-transformable polymers, multiple physical unclonable functions are demonstrated within a single device with all-optical reversible reconfigurability.

  abstract     = {Crystal lattice fluctuations, which are known to influence phase transitions of quantum materials in equilibrium, are also expected to determine the dynamics of light-induced phase changes. However, they have only rarely been explored in these dynamical settings. Here we study the time evolution of lattice fluctuations in the quantum paraelectric SrTiO3, in which mid-infrared drives have been shown to induce a metastable ferroelectric state. Crucial in these physics is the competition between polar instabilities and antiferrodistortive rotations, which in equilibrium frustrate the formation of long-range ferroelectricity. We make use of high-intensity mid-infrared optical pulses to resonantly drive the Ti–O-stretching mode at 17 THz, and we measure the resulting change in lattice fluctuations using time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering at a free-electron laser. After a prompt increase, we observe a long-lived quench in R-point antiferrodistortive lattice fluctuations. Their enhancement and reduction are theoretically explained by considering the fourth-order nonlinear phononic interactions to the driven optical phonon and third-order coupling to lattice strain, respectively. These observations provide a number of testable hypotheses for the physics of light-induced ferroelectricity. Intense light pulses can induce symmetry breaking, as for the generation of ferroelectricity in SrTiO3. Using ultrafast X-ray diffuse scattering at a free-electron laser, nonlinear phonon interactions that occur on such mid-IR excitation are observed, with a theory for the dynamics presented.},

  abstract     = {The identification and characterization of spontaneous symmetry breaking is central to our understanding of strongly correlated two-dimensional materials. In this work, we utilize the angle-resolved measurements of transport non-reciprocity to investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in twisted trilayer graphene. By analysing the angular dependence of non-reciprocity in both longitudinal and transverse channels, we are able to identify the symmetry axis associated with the underlying electronic order. We report that a hysteretic rotation in the mirror axis can be induced by thermal cycles and a large current bias, supporting the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry. Moreover, the onset of non-reciprocity with decreasing temperature coincides with the emergence of orbital ferromagnetism. Combined with the angular dependence of the superconducting diode effect, our findings uncover a direct link between rotational and time-reversal symmetry breaking. These symmetry requirements point towards exchange-driven instabilities in momentum space as a possible origin for transport non-reciprocity in twisted trilayer graphene. Angle-resolved transport measurements on twisted trilayer graphene reveal evidence for a variety of correlated states with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and offer evidence of momentum polarization.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanotubes offer a unique platform to explore the properties of TMD materials at the one-dimensional limit. Despite considerable efforts thus far, the direct growth of TMD nanotubes with controllable chirality remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the direct and facile growth of high-quality WS2 and WSe2 nanotubes on Si substrates using catalytic chemical vapour deposition with Au nanoparticles. The Au nanoparticles provide unique accommodation sites for the nucleation of WS2 or WSe2 shells on their surfaces and seed the subsequent growth of nanotubes. We find that the growth mode of nanotubes is sensitive to the temperature. With careful temperature control, we realize ~79% WS2 nanotubes with single chiral angles, with a preference of 30° (~37%) and 0° (~12%). Moreover, we demonstrate how the geometric, electronic and optical properties of the synthesized WS2 nanotubes can be modulated by the chirality. We anticipate that this approach using Au nanoparticles as catalysts will facilitate the growth of TMD nanotubes with controllable chirality and promote the study of their interesting properties and applications. The direct and facile growth of WS2 and WSe2 nanotubes with controllable chirality is realized using catalytic chemical vapour deposition with Au nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {The unique physics in moiré superlattices of twisted or lattice-mismatched atomic layers holds great promise for future quantum technologies. However, twisted configurations are thermodynamically unfavourable, making accurate twist angle control during growth implausible. While rotationally aligned, lattice-mismatched moirés such as WSe2/WS2 can be synthesized, they lack the critical moiré period tunability, and their formation mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report the thermodynamically driven van der Waals epitaxy of moirés with a tunable period from 10 to 45 nanometres, using lattice mismatch engineering in two WSSe layers with adjustable chalcogen ratios. Contrary to conventional epitaxy, where lattice-mismatch-induced stress hinders high-quality growth, we reveal the key role of bulk stress in moiré formation and its unique interplay with edge stress in shaping the moiré growth modes. Moreover, the superlattices display tunable interlayer excitons and moiré intralayer excitons. Our studies unveil the epitaxial science of moiré synthesis and lay the foundations for moiré-based technologies. Controlling the periodicity of synthesized moiré materials is vital to harness their unique physics. Here the authors realize the van der Waals epitaxy of tunable moiré heterostructures and reveal the epitaxial science governing their formation.},

Here we describe a viable approach and underlying mechanism for the assisted self-assembly of twisted layer graphene. The process, which can be implemented in standard chemical vapour deposition growth, is best described by analogy to origami and kirigami with paper. It involves the controlled induction of wrinkle formation in single-layer graphene with subsequent wrinkle folding, tearing and re-growth. Inherent to the process is the formation of intertwined graphene spirals and conversion of the chiral angle of 1D wrinkles into a 2D twist angle of a 3D superlattice. The approach can be extended to other foldable 2D materials and facilitates the production of miniaturized electronic components, including capacitors, resistors, inductors and superconductors. A graphene origami–kirigami technique offers an approach for growing intertwined graphene spirals with fixed twist angles, enabling the chirality of one-dimensional wrinkles to be converted into the twist angle of vertically stacked two-dimensional layers.},

Spontaneous structural relaxation alters the behaviour of moiré superlattices considerably and has been suggested to play an important role in the relative stability of superconductivity in trilayers. Here we use an interferometric four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy approach to directly probe the local graphene layer alignment over a wide range of trilayer graphene structures. Our results inform a thorough understanding of how reconstruction modulates the local lattice symmetries crucial for establishing correlated phases in twisted graphene trilayers, evincing a relaxed structure that is markedly different from that proposed previously. The local layer alignment in a wide range of trilayer graphene structures has been extracted by interferometric four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, uncovering the complex picture of lattice reconstruction in twisted trilayers.},

In this Perspective, we first discuss the possible definition and mathematical description of ‘2D chiral materials’, and the intriguing physics enabled by structural chirality in van der Waals 2D homobilayers and heterostructures, such as circular dichroism, chiral plasmons and the nonlinear Hall effect. We then summarize the recent experimental progress and approaches to induce and control structural chirality in 2D materials from monolayers to superlattices. Finally, we postulate a few unique opportunities offered by 2D chiral materials, the synthesis and new properties of which can potentially lead to chiral optoelectronic devices and possibly materials for enantioselective photochemistry. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, despite their small thickness, can display chirality that enables prominent asymmetric optical, electrical transport, and magnetic properties.

  abstract     = {Measuring cellular and tissue mechanics inside intact living organisms is essential for interrogating the roles of force in physiological and disease processes. Current agents for studying the mechanobiology of intact, living organisms are limited by poor light penetration and material stability. Magnetomotive ultrasound is an emerging modality for real-time in vivo imaging of tissue mechanics. Nonetheless, it has poor sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. Here we describe magneto-gas vesicles (MGVs), protein nanostructures based on gas vesicles and magnetic nanoparticles that produce differential ultrasound signals in response to varying mechanical properties of surrounding tissues. These hybrid nanomaterials significantly improve signal strength and detection sensitivity. Furthermore, MGVs enable non-invasive, long-term and quantitative measurements of mechanical properties within three-dimensional tissues and in vivo fibrosis models. Using MGVs as novel contrast agents, we demonstrate their potential for non-invasive imaging of tissue elasticity, offering insights into mechanobiology and its application to disease diagnosis and treatment. Magneto-gas vesicles, protein nanostructures with enhanced ultrasound signal and sensitivity, enable the non-invasive, long-term and quantitative monitoring of the mechanics of three-dimensional tissues and animals.},

  abstract     = {Some animals form transient, responsive and solid-like ensembles through dynamic structural interactions. These ensembles demonstrate emergent responses such as spontaneous self-assembly, which are difficult to achieve in synthetic soft matter. Here we use shape-morphing units comprising responsive polymers to create solids that self-assemble, modulate their volume and disassemble on demand. The ensemble is composed of a responsive hydrogel, liquid crystal elastomer or semicrystalline polymer ribbons that reversibly bend or twist. The dispersions of these ribbons mechanically interlock, inducing reversible aggregation. The aggregated liquid crystal elastomer ribbons have a 12-fold increase in the yield stress compared with cooled dispersion and contract by 34% on heating. Ribbon type, concentration and shape dictate the aggregation and govern the global mechanical properties of the solid that forms. Coating liquid crystal elastomer ribbons with a liquid metal begets photoresponsive and electrically conductive aggregates, whereas seeding cells on hydrogel ribbons enables self-assembling three-dimensional scaffolds, providing a versatile platform for the design of dynamic materials. Autonomous assembly, reconfiguration and disassembly are observed in living aggregates, but are difficult to replicate in synthetic soft matter. Here mechanically interlocked responsive ribbons form transient viscoelastic solids for the on-demand assembly of functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Interfacing molecular machines to inorganic nanoparticles can, in principle, lead to hybrid nanomachines with extended functions. Here we demonstrate a ligand engineering approach to develop atomically precise hybrid nanomachines by interfacing gold nanoclusters with tetraphenylethylene molecular rotors. When gold nanoclusters are irradiated with near-infrared light, the rotation of surface-decorated tetraphenylethylene moieties actively dissipates the absorbed energy to sustain the photothermal nanomachine with an intact structure and steady efficiency. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveal that the photogenerated hot electrons are rapidly cooled down within picoseconds via electron–phonon coupling in the nanomachine. We find that the nanomachine remains structurally and functionally intact in mammalian cells and in vivo. A single dose of near-infrared irradiation can effectively ablate tumours without recurrence in tumour-bearing mice, which shows promise in the development of nanomachine-based theranostics. Gold nanoclusters show promise as photothermal materials, but are often thermally unstable. Here ligand engineering is used to integrate molecular rotors with gold nanoclusters to dissipate thermal energy and improve photothermal therapy performance.},

  abstract     = {Porous metal–organic frameworks have emerged to resolve important challenges of our modern society, such as CO2 sequestration. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) can undergo a glass transition to form ZIF glasses; they combine the liquid handling of classical glasses with the tremendous potential for gas separation applications of ZIFs. Using millimetre-sized ZIF-62 single crystals and centimetre-sized ZIF-62 glass, we demonstrate the scalability and processability of our materials. Further, following the evolution of gas penetration into ZIF crystals and ZIF glasses by infrared microimaging techniques, we determine the diffusion coefficients and changes to the pore architecture on the ångström scale. The evolution of the material on melting and processing is observed in situ on different length scales by using a microscope-coupled heating stage and analysed microstructurally by transmission electron microscopy. Pore collapse during glass processing is further tracked by changes in the volume and density of the glasses. Mass spectrometry was utilized to investigate the crystal-to-glass transition and thermal-processing ability. The controllable tuning of the pore diameter in ZIF glass may enable liquid-processable ZIF glass membranes for challenging gas separations. Porosity of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks can be preserved beyond glass transition and melt processing. Here centimetre-scale porous glasses are demonstrated, whereas liquid processing enables fine-tuning of the size of the gas-transporting channels for molecular sieving.},

  abstract     = {NiFe-based oxo-hydroxides are highly active for the oxygen evolution reaction but require complex synthesis and are poorly durable when deposited on foreign supports. Herein we demonstrate that easily processable, Earth-abundant and cheap Fe–Ni alloys spontaneously develop a highly active NiFe oxo-hydroxide surface, exsolved upon electrochemical activation. While the manufacturing process and the initial surface state of the alloys do not impact the oxygen evolution reaction performance, the growth/composition of the NiFe oxo-hydroxide surface layer depends on the alloying elements and initial atomic Fe/Ni ratio, hence driving oxygen evolution reaction activity. Whatever the initial Fe/Ni ratio of the Fe–Ni alloy (varying between 0.004 and 7.4), the best oxygen evolution reaction performance (beyond that of commercial IrO2) and durability was obtained for a surface Fe/Ni ratio between 0.2 and 0.4 and includes numerous active sites (high NiIII/NiII capacitive response) and high efficiency (high Fe/Ni ratio). This knowledge paves the way to active and durable Fe–Ni alloy oxygen-evolving electrodes for alkaline water electrolysers. NiFe-based oxo-hydroxides are active for the oxygen evolution reaction but suffer from complex synthesis and durability when deposited. Easily processable Fe–Ni alloys with a highly active oxo-hydroxide surface are now shown to pave the way for oxygen-evolving electrodes for alkaline water electrolysers.},

This paper unveils a new phenomenon of constriction susceptibility for materials at such an interface, the utilization of which helps facilitate the design of an active three-dimensional scaffold to host rapid plating and stripping of a significant amount of a thick Li metal layer. Here we focus on the well-known anode material silicon (Si) to demonstrate that, rather than strong Li–Si alloying at the conventional solid–liquid interface, the lithiation reaction of micrometre-sized Si can be significantly constricted at the solid–solid interface so that it occurs only at thin surface sites of Si particles due to a reaction-induced, diffusion-limiting process. The dynamic interaction between surface lithiation and Li plating of a family of anode materials, as predicted by our constrained ensemble computational approach and represented by Si, silver (Ag) and alloys of magnesium (Mg), can thus more homogeneously distribute current densities for the rapid cycling of Li metal at high areal capacity, which is important in regard to solid-state battery application. Interfacial reactions between lithium and anodes are not well understood in an all-solid environment. For the silicon anode we now demonstrate that, rather than strong Li–Si alloying at the conventional solid–liquid interface, the lithiation reaction of micrometre-sized Si can be greatly constricted at the solid–solid interface.},

Electrical degradation of dielectric polymers tends to initiate catastrophic failure of numerous devices and systems, but its detection and early warning remain challenging. Here we report a general material strategy that signals the electrical degradation of dielectric polymers by autonomously presenting a visually discernible warning in the form of a pronounced colour change. This colour change is induced by the chromogenic response of molecular indicators blended with the polymer, which are chemically activated by the oxygen radicals generated in situ during the electrical degradation of the polymer. We unveil that the structural degradation and electrical properties of the dielectric polymer are quantitatively correlated with the colour difference. Such a chromogenic process is autonomous without the need of human intervention or other external energy, thus offering the convenience to lower or even eliminate the risk of dielectric failure. Early detection of electrical degradation in dielectric polymers is crucial but remains challenging. A general strategy of blending the polymer with chromogenic molecules is reported, which generates a visually discernible colour change as chemically activated by oxygen radicals generated in situ, indicating the early stage of electrical degradation in polymers.},

Although these excitations have been observed on several platforms, a system with dynamically tunable moiré potential to tailor their properties is yet to be realized. Here we present a continuously tunable moiré potential in monolayer WSe2, enabled by its proximity to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the magic angle. By tuning local charge density via gating, TBG provides a spatially varying and dynamically tunable dielectric superlattice for modulation of monolayer WSe2 exciton wave functions. We observed emergent moiré exciton Rydberg branches with increased energy splitting following doping of TBG due to exciton wave function hybridization between bright and dark Rydberg states. In addition, emergent Rydberg states can probe strongly correlated states in TBG at the magic angle. Our study provides a new platform for engineering moiré excitons and optical accessibility to electronic states with small correlation gaps in TBG. The authors demonstrate the tunability of moiré potential and emergent moiré exciton Rydberg states in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide governed by an adjacent twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle with gate-tunable local charge density.},

Here we demonstrate the electrostatic imprinting of moiré lattices onto a target monolayer semiconductor. The moiré potential—created by a lattice of electrons that is supported by a Mott insulator state in a remote MoSe2/WS2 moiré bilayer—imprints a moiré potential that generates flat bands and correlated insulating states in the target monolayer and can be turned on/off by gate tuning the doping density of the moiré bilayer. Additionally, we studied the interplay between the electrostatic and structural relaxation contributions to moiré imprinting. Our results demonstrate a pathway towards gate control of moiré lattices. The authors imprint a moiré potential on a remote monolayer semiconductor through the moiré potential created in a remote MoSe2/WS2 moiré bilayer.

The magnetotransport properties reveal multistep magnetization switching with a magnetic hysteresis opening, which is absent in the pristine case. By tuning the magnetic field, we modulate the remanent state and coercivity and select between hysteretic and non-hysteretic magnetoresistance scenarios. This complexity pinpoints spin anisotropy as a key aspect in twisted magnetic superlattices. Our results highlight control over the magnetic properties in van der Waals heterostructures, leading to a variety of field-induced phenomena and opening a fruitful playground for creating desired magnetic symmetries and manipulating non-collinear magnetic configurations.

  abstract     = {Whirling topological textures play a key role in exotic phases of magnetic materials and are promising for logic and memory applications. In antiferromagnets, these textures exhibit enhanced stability and faster dynamics with respect to their ferromagnetic counterparts, but they are also difficult to study due to their vanishing net magnetic moment. One technique that meets the demand of highly sensitive vectorial magnetic field sensing with negligible backaction is diamond quantum magnetometry. Here we show that an archetypal antiferromagnet—haematite—hosts a rich tapestry of monopolar, dipolar and quadrupolar emergent magnetic charge distributions. The direct read-out of the previously inaccessible vorticity of an antiferromagnetic spin texture provides the crucial connection to its magnetic charge through a duality relation. Our work defines a paradigmatic class of magnetic systems to explore two-dimensional monopolar physics, and highlights the transformative role that diamond quantum magnetometry could play in exploring emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Diamond quantum magnetometry is utilized to directly read the vorticity of antiferromagnetic spin textures through coupled multi-polar emergent magnetic charge distributions.},

  abstract     = {The quest for electronic devices that offer flexibility, wearability, durability and high performance has spotlighted two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials as potential next-generation semiconductors. Especially noteworthy is indium selenide, which has demonstrated surprising ultra-high plasticity. To deepen our understanding of this unusual plasticity in 2D van der Waals materials and to explore inorganic plastic semiconductors, we have conducted in-depth experimental and theoretical investigations on metal monochalcogenides (MX) and transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2). We have discovered a general plastic deformation mode in MX, which is facilitated by the synergetic effect of phase transitions, interlayer gliding and micro-cracks. This is in contrast to crystals with strong atomic bonding, such as metals and ceramics, where plasticity is primarily driven by dislocations, twinning or grain boundaries. The enhancement of gliding barriers prevents macroscopic fractures through a pinning effect after changes in stacking order. The discovery of ultra-high plasticity and the phase transition mechanism in 2D MX materials holds significant potential for the design and development of high-performance inorganic plastic semiconductors. The metal monochalcogenides are a group of van der Waals layered semiconductors with ultra-high plasticity. It is now revealed that their plasticity is attributed to the ability to transform their stacking order or phases, coupled with the concurrent generation of a micro-crack network.},

  abstract     = {Electron superlattices allow the engineering of correlated and topological quantum phenomena. The recent emergence of moiré superlattices in two-dimensional heterostructures has led to exciting discoveries related to quantum phenomena. However, the requirement for the moiré pattern poses stringent limitations, and its potential cannot be switched on and off. Here, we demonstrate remote engineering and on/off switching of correlated states in bilayer graphene. Employing a remote Coulomb superlattice realized by localized electrons in twisted bilayer WS2, we impose a Coulomb superlattice in the bilayer graphene with period and strength determined by the twisted bilayer WS2. When the remote superlattice is turned off, the two-dimensional electron gas in the bilayer graphene is described by a Fermi liquid. When it is turned on, correlated insulating states at both integer and fractional filling factors emerge. This approach enables in situ control of correlated quantum phenomena in two-dimensional materials hosting a two-dimensional electron gas. Employing a remote Coulomb superlattice formed by twisted bilayer WS2, the authors demonstrate the engineering and on/off switching of a Coulomb superlattice of correlated states in bilayer graphene with period and strength determined by the remote superlattice.},

  abstract     = {Multiferroic materials, particularly those possessing simultaneous electric and magnetic orders, offer a platform for design technologies and to study modern physics. Despite the substantial progress and evolution of multiferroics, one priority in the field remains to be the discovery of unexplored materials, especially those offering different mechanisms for controlling electric and magnetic orders1. Here we demonstrate the simultaneous thermal control of electric and magnetic polarizations in quasi-two-dimensional halides (K,Rb)3Mn2Cl7, arising from a polar–antipolar transition, as evidenced using both X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data. Our density functional theory calculations indicate a possible polarization-switching path including a strong coupling between the electric and magnetic orders in our halide materials, suggesting a magnetoelectric coupling and a situation not realized in oxide analogues. We expect our findings to stimulate the exploration of non-oxide multiferroics and magnetoelectrics to open access to alternative mechanisms, beyond conventional electric and magnetic control, for coupling ferroic orders. Multiferroics can possess multiple ferroic orders, for example, electric polarization and magnetism, and are of interest for new device applications. Here thermal control is shown to manipulate electric and magnetic orders in a single-phase quasi-two-dimensional halide perovskite.},

  abstract     = {During wound healing and surgical implantation, the body establishes a delicate balance between immune activation to fight off infection and clear debris and immune tolerance to control reactivity against self-tissue. Nonetheless, how such a balance is achieved is not well understood. Here we describe that pro-regenerative biomaterials for muscle injury treatment promote the proliferation of a BATF3-dependent CD103+XCR1+CD206+CD301b+ dendritic cell population associated with cross-presentation and self-tolerance. Upregulation of E-cadherin, the ligand for CD103, and XCL-1 in injured tissue suggests a mechanism for cell recruitment to trauma. Muscle injury recruited natural killer cells that produced Xcl1 when stimulated with fragmented extracellular matrix. Without cross-presenting cells, T-cell activation increases, pro-regenerative macrophage polarization decreases and there are alterations in myogenesis, adipogenesis, fibrosis and increased muscle calcification. These results, previously observed in cancer progression, suggest a fundamental mechanism of immune regulation in trauma and material implantation with implications for both short- and long-term injury recovery. Pro-regenerative biomaterials for the treatment of muscle injury induce the proliferation of a dendritic cell population associated with cross-presentation and self-tolerance, promoting a pro-regenerative immune environment to aid muscle wound healing.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoelectric materials convert magnetic fields into electric fields. These materials are often used in wireless electronic and biomedical applications. For example, magnetoelectrics could enable the remote stimulation of neural tissue, but the optimal resonance frequencies are typically too high to stimulate neural activity. Here we describe a self-rectifying magnetoelectric metamaterial for a precisely timed neural stimulation. This metamaterial relies on nonlinear charge transport across semiconductor layers that allow the material to generate a steady bias voltage in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. We generate arbitrary pulse sequences with time-averaged voltage biases in excess of 2 V. As a result, we can use magnetoelectric nonlinear metamaterials to wirelessly stimulate peripheral nerves to restore a sensory reflex in an anaesthetized rat model and restore signal propagation in a severed nerve with latencies of less than 5 ms. Overall, these results showing the rational design of magnetoelectric metamaterials support applications in advanced biotechnology and electronics. Self-rectifying magnetoelectric metamaterials with nonlinear responses generate electrical pulse sequences that enable precisely timed remote neural stimulation and restoration of sensory motor responses in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Consecutive mechanical loading cycles cause irreversible fatigue damage and residual strain in gels, affecting their service life and application scope. Hysteresis-free hydrogels within a limited deformation range have been created by various strategies. However, large deformation and high elasticity are inherently contradictory attributes. Here we present a nanoconfined polymerization strategy for producing tough and near-zero-hysteresis gels under a large range of deformations. Gels are prepared through in situ polymerization within nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks or molecular sieves. The nanochannel confinement and strong hydrogen bonding interactions with polymer segments are crucial for achieving rapid self-reinforcement. The rigid nanostructures relieve the stress concentration at the crack tips and prevent crack propagation, enhancing the ultimate fracture strain (17,580 ± 308%), toughness (87.7 ± 2.3 MJ m−3) and crack propagation strain (5,800%) of the gels. This approach provides a general strategy for synthesizing gels that overcome the traditional trade-offs of large deformation and high elasticity. Simultaneously highly elastic and deformable gels that maintain their mechanical properties have remained elusive. Here, using in situ polymerization confined within nanochannels, the authors prepare hysteresis-free gels insensitive to crack propagation.},

  abstract     = {Bicontinuous microstructures are essential to the function of diverse natural and synthetic systems. Their synthesis has been based on two approaches: arrested phase separation or self-assembly of block copolymers. The former is attractive for its chemical simplicity and the latter, for its thermodynamic robustness. Here we introduce elastic microphase separation (EMPS) as an alternative approach to make bicontinuous microstructures. Conceptually, EMPS balances the molecular-scale forces that drive demixing with large-scale elasticity to encode a thermodynamic length scale. This process features a continuous phase transition, reversible without hysteresis. Practically, EMPS is triggered by simply supersaturating an elastomeric matrix with a liquid, resulting in uniform bicontinuous materials with a well-defined microscopic length scale tuned by the matrix stiffness. The versatility of EMPS is further demonstrated by fabricating bicontinuous materials with superior mechanical properties and controlled anisotropy and microstructural gradients. Overall, EMPS presents a robust alternative for the bulk fabrication of homogeneous bicontinuous materials. Production of bulk bicontinuous materials is limited by the ability to make uniform microarchitectures across large volumes. Here elastic microphase separation is used to fabricate bicontinuous materials with a homogeneous microstructure, with feature sizes tuned by the matrix stiffness.},

  abstract     = {Carbon monoxide (CO) separation relies on chemical adsorption but suffers from the difficulty of desorption and instability of open metal sites against O2, H2O and so on. Here we demonstrate quasi-open metal sites with hidden or shielded coordination sites as a promising solution. Possessing the trigonal coordination geometry (sp2), Cu(i) ions in porous frameworks show weak physical adsorption for non-target guests. Rational regulation of framework flexibility enables geometry transformation to tetrahedral geometry (sp3), generating a fourth coordination site for the chemical adsorption of CO. Quantitative breakthrough experiments at ambient conditions show CO uptakes up to 4.1 mmol g−1 and CO selectivity up to 347 against CO2, CH4, O2, N2 and H2. The adsorbents can be completely regenerated at 333–373 K to recover CO with a purity of &amp;gt;99.99%, and the separation performances are stable in high-concentration O2 and H2O. Although CO leakage concentration generally follows the structural transition pressure, large amounts (&amp;gt;3 mmol g−1) of ultrahigh-purity (99.9999999%, 9N; CO concentration &amp;lt; 1 part per billion) gases can be produced in a single adsorption process, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach for separation applications. Chemical adsorption of CO on open metal sites enables separation from other gases but leads to selectivity and stability issues. Quasi-open metal sites in metal–organic frameworks are proposed here, which are accessible only by CO-induced structural transformation, enabling CO separation to 9N purity.},

Although numerous theoretical studies have been undertaken, the most promising perovskite-based catalysts continue to emerge from human-driven experimental campaigns rather than data-driven machine learning protocols, which are often limited by the scarcity of experimental data on which to train the models. This work promises to break this impasse by demonstrating that active learning on even small datasets—but supplemented by informative structural-characterization data and coupled with closed-loop experimentation—can yield materials of outstanding performance. The model we develop not only reproduces several non-obvious and actively studied experimental trends but also identifies a composition of a perovskite oxide electrocatalyst exhibiting an intrinsic overpotential at 10 mA cm–2oxide of 391 mV, which is among the lowest known of four-metal perovskite oxides. Multi-metal and perovskite oxides are attractive as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, and thus far the most promising candidates have emerged from experimental methodologies. Active-learning models supplemented by structural-characterization data and closed-loop experimentation can now identify a perovskite oxide with outstanding performance.},

Alternatively, an electrochemical method could enable decentralized, ambient NH3 production that can be paired with renewable energy. The first verified electrochemical method for NH3 synthesis was a process mediated by lithium (Li) in organic electrolytes. So far, however, elements other than Li remain unexplored in this process for potential benefits in efficiency, reaction rates, device design, abundance and stability. In our demonstration of a Li-free system, we found that calcium can mediate the reduction of nitrogen for NH3 synthesis. We verified the calcium-mediated process using a rigorous protocol and achieved an NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 40 ± 2% using calcium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Ca[B(hfip)4]2) as the electrolyte. Our results offer the possibility of using abundant materials for the electrochemical production of NH3, a critical chemical precursor and promising energy vector. The production of ammonia via the Haber–Bosch process is carbon-intensive and centralized, but electrochemical methods such as lithium-mediated processes in organic electrolytes could enable decentralized production using renewable energy.

It has recently been demonstrated that interface asymmetry can induce sizable piezoelectric effects in heterostructures, even those consisting of centrosymmetric semiconductors, which provides flexibility to develop and optimize electromechanical coupling phenomena. Here, by targeted engineering of the interface symmetry, we achieve piezoelectric phenomena behaving as the electrical analogue of the negative Poisson’s ratio. This effect, termed the auxetic piezoelectric effect, exhibits the same sign for the longitudinal (d33) and transverse (d31, d32) piezoelectric coefficients, enabling a simultaneous contraction or expansion in all directions under an external electrical stimulus. The signs of the transverse coefficients can be further tuned via in-plane symmetry anisotropy. The effects exist in a wide range of material systems and exhibit substantial coefficients, indicating potential implications for all-semiconductor actuator, sensor and filter applications. Piezoelectrics have longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients that are opposite in sign. Here, by tuning the interface inversion asymmetry in heterostructures, auxetic systems with positive longitudinal and transverse coefficients are realized, with expansion or contraction along all directions in an electric field.},

Extending VC to state-of-the-art materials may lead to new applications and improved performance for optoelectronic devices. Metal halide perovskites are promising targets for VC due to their mechanical softness and the rich array of vibrational motions of both their inorganic and organic sublattices. Here, we demonstrate the ultrafast VC of FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells via intramolecular vibrations of the formamidinium cation using spectroscopic techniques based on vibrationally promoted electronic resonance. The observed short (~300 fs) time window of VC highlights the fast dynamics of coupling between the cation and inorganic sublattice. First-principles modelling reveals that this coupling is mediated by hydrogen bonds that modulate both lead halide lattice and electronic states. Cation dynamics modulating this coupling may suppress non-radiative recombination in perovskites, leading to photovoltaics with reduced voltage losses. Optically stimulated vibrational control for materials has the potential to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices. The vibrational control of FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells has been demonstrated, where the fast dynamics of coupling between cations and inorganic sublattice may suppress non-radiative recombinations in perovskites, leading to reduced voltage losses.},

In software-based machine learning, computing performance can be readily reconfigured to suit different computational tasks by tuning hyperparameters. This critical functionality is missing in ‘physical’ reservoir computing schemes that exploit nonlinear and history-dependent responses of physical systems for data processing. Here we overcome this issue with a ‘task-adaptive’ approach to physical reservoir computing. By leveraging a thermodynamical phase space to reconfigure key reservoir properties, we optimize computational performance across a diverse task set. We use the spin-wave spectra of the chiral magnet Cu2OSeO3 that hosts skyrmion, conical and helical magnetic phases, providing on-demand access to different computational reservoir responses. The task-adaptive approach is applicable to a wide variety of physical systems, which we show in other chiral magnets via above (and near) room-temperature demonstrations in Co8.5Zn8.5Mn3 (and FeGe). Current physical neuromorphic computing faces critical challenges of how to reconfigure key physical dynamics of a system to adapt computational performance to match a diverse range of tasks.

With this approach, even with a miniaturized spectrometer footprint of only 4 × 4 μm2, we demonstrate a wavelength accuracy of 0.17 nm, spectral resolution of 0.4 nm and a linear dynamic range of 149 dB. Moreover, our spectrometer has a detection limit of 1.2 fJ, and can be patterned to an array for spectral imaging. Placing such a spectrometer array directly at the back focal plane of a metalens, we achieve an angular resolution of 4.88 × 10−3 rad. Our angle-resolved spectrometers empowered by metalenses can be employed towards enhancing advanced optical imaging and spectral analysis applications.

  abstract     = {Moiré superlattices host a rich variety of correlated electronic phases. However, the moiré potential is fixed by interlayer coupling, and it is dependent on the nature of carriers and valleys. In contrast, it has been predicted that twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers can impose a periodic electrostatic potential capable of engineering the properties of adjacent functional layers. Here, we show that this potential is described by a theory of electric polarization originating from the interfacial charge redistribution, validated by its dependence on supercell sizes and distance from the twisted interfaces. This enables controllability of the potential depth and profile by controlling the twist angles between the two interfaces. Employing this approach, we further demonstrate how the electrostatic potential from a twisted hBN substrate impedes exciton diffusion in semiconductor monolayers, suggesting opportunities for engineering the properties of adjacent functional layers using the surface potential of a twisted hBN substrate. The authors demonstrate that the electrostatic potential originating on the surface of twisted bilayer and multilayer hexagonal boron nitride can be used to generate a moiré potential modulation on adjacent semiconductor layers, enabling the possibility of controlling the properties of this adjacent layer.},

  abstract     = {A quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is a topological phase in which the interior is insulating but electrical current flows along the edges of the sample in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, as dictated by the spontaneous magnetization orientation. Such a chiral edge current eliminates any backscattering, giving rise to quantized Hall resistance and zero longitudinal resistance. Here we fabricate mesoscopic QAH sandwich Hall bar devices and succeed in switching the edge current chirality through thermally assisted spin–orbit torque (SOT). The well-quantized QAH states before and after SOT switching with opposite edge current chiralities are demonstrated through four- and three-terminal measurements. We show that the SOT responsible for magnetization switching can be generated by both surface and bulk carriers. Our results further our understanding of the interplay between magnetism and topological states and usher in an easy and instantaneous method to manipulate the QAH state. Thermally assisted spin–orbit torque is used to switch the edge current chirality in mesoscopic quantum anomalous Hall devices.},

  abstract     = {Although metallic nanostructures have been attracting tremendous research interest in nanoscience and nanotechnologies, it is known that environmental attacks, such as surface oxidation, can easily initiate cracking on the surface of metals, thus deteriorating their overall functional/structural properties1–3. In sharp contrast, here we report that severely oxidized metallic glass nanotubes can attain an ultrahigh recoverable elastic strain of up to ~14% at room temperature, which outperform bulk metallic glasses, metallic glass nanowires and many other superelastic metals hitherto reported. Through in situ experiments and atomistic simulations, we reveal that the physical mechanisms underpinning the observed superelasticity can be attributed to the formation of a percolating oxide network in metallic glass nanotubes, which not only restricts atomic-scale plastic events during loading but also leads to the recovery of elastic rigidity on unloading. Our discovery implies that oxidation in low-dimensional metallic glasses can result in unique properties for applications in nanodevices. Oxidation normally deteriorates the mechanical properties of metals. But it is now shown that the formation of a percolating oxide network in metallic glass nanotubes can result in an unprecedented superelasticity of 14% at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {In situ straining tests in high purity α-Fe thin foils at low temperatures1 have demonstrated that crystal line defects, called dislocations, have a jerky type of motion made of intermittent long jumps of several nanometres. This observation conflicts with the standard Peierls mechanism for plastic deformation in body-centred cubic crystals, where the screw dislocation jumps are limited by inter-reticular distances, that is, distances of a few angstroms. Employing atomic-scale simulations, we show that although the short jumps are initially more favourable, their realization requires the propagation of a kinked profile along the dislocation line, which yields coherent atomic vibrations acting as travelling thermal spikes. Such local heat bursts favour the thermally assisted nucleation of new kinks in the wake of primary ones. The accumulation of new kinks leads to long dislocation jumps like those observed experimentally. Our study constitutes an important step towards predictive atomic-scale theory for materials deformation. Plastic deformation requires the propagation of a kinked profile along dislocations. It is shown that each kink acts as a set of travelling thermal spikes, favouring the nucleation of supplementary kinks and long dislocation jumps that are observed experimentally.},
