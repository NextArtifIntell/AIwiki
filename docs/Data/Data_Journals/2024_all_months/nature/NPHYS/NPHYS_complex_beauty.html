  abstract     = {During host infection, Toxoplasma gondii and related unicellular parasites move using gliding, which differs fundamentally from other known mechanisms of eukaryotic cell motility. Gliding is thought to be powered by a thin layer of flowing filamentous (F)-actin sandwiched between the plasma membrane and a myosin-covered inner membrane complex. How this surface actin layer drives the various gliding modes observed in experiments—helical, circular, twirling and patch, pendulum or rolling—is unclear. Here we suggest that F-actin flows arise through self-organization and develop a continuum model of emergent F-actin flow within the confines provided by Toxoplasma geometry. In the presence of F-actin turnover, our model predicts the emergence of a steady-state mode in which actin transport is largely directed rearward. Removing F-actin turnover leads to actin patches that recirculate up and down the cell, which we observe experimentally for drug-stabilized actin bundles in live Toxoplasma gondii parasites. These distinct self-organized actin states can account for observed gliding modes, illustrating how different forms of gliding motility can emerge as an intrinsic consequence of the self-organizing properties of F-actin flow in a confined geometry. Unicellular parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, can use different forms of gliding motions when infecting a host. These motility modes arise from the self-organizing properties of filamentous actin flow at the surface of these parasitic cells.},

  abstract     = {In tokamaks, a leading platform for fusion energy, periodic filamentary plasma eruptions known as edge-localized modes occur in plasmas with high-energy confinement and steep pressure profiles at the plasma edge. These edge-localized modes could damage the tokamak wall but can be suppressed using small three-dimensional magnetic perturbations. Here we demonstrate that these magnetic perturbations can change the magnetic topology just inside the steep gradient region of the plasma edge. We identify signatures of a magnetic island, and their observation is linked to the suppression of edge-localized modes. We compare high-resolution measurements of perturbed magnetic surfaces with predictions from ideal magnetohydrodynamic theory where the magnetic topology is preserved. Although ideal magnetohydrodynamics adequately describes the measurements in plasmas exhibiting edge-localized modes, it proves insufficient for plasmas where these modes are suppressed. Nonlinear resistive magnetohydrodynamic modelling supports this observation. Our study experimentally confirms the predicted role of magnetic islands in inhibiting the occurrence of edge-localized modes. This will be beneficial for physics-based predictions in future fusion devices to control these modes. The suppression of edge-localized modes in tokamak plasmas is crucial to prevent them from damaging the walls of the chamber. Now experiments confirm the role that magnetic islands play in suppressing these detrimental modes.},

  abstract     = {Electron tunnelling in solids, a fundamental quantum phenomenon, lays the foundation for various modern technologies. The emergence of van der Waals magnets presents opportunities for discovering unconventional tunnelling phenomena. Here, we demonstrate quantum tunnelling with tunable spin geometric phases in a multilayer van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4. The spin geometric phase of electron tunnelling is controlled by magnetic-field-dependent metamagnetic phase transitions. The square lattice of a CrPS4 monolayer causes strong t2g-orbital delocalization near the conduction band minimum. This creates a one-dimensional spin system with reversed energy ordering between the t2g and eg spin channels, which prohibits both intralayer spin relaxation by means of collective magnon excitations and interlayer spin hopping between the t2g and eg spin channels. The resulting coherent electron transmission shows pronounced tunnel magnetoresistance oscillations, manifesting quantum interference of cyclic quantum evolutions of individual electron Bloch waves by means of the time-reversal symmetrical tunnelling loops. Our results suggest the appearance of Aharonov–Anandan phases that originate from the non-adiabatic generalization of the Berry’s phase. It is difficult to control the geometric phase of particles as they undergo quantum tunnelling. Now tuning of the geometric phase of electron spin is demonstrated in tunnelling in a multilayer van der Waals antiferromagnet.},

  abstract     = {Universal behaviour often emerges in the low-energy equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems, despite their microscopic differences. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Such dynamics usually involve highly excited states beyond the traditional low-energy theory description. Whether universality can also emerge in such non-equilibrium dynamics is the subject of current research. Here, we report the experimental observation of universal dynamics by monitoring the spin depolarization process in a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance system, described by an ensemble of randomly interacting spins. The spin depolarization can be related to temporal spin–spin correlation functions at high temperatures. We discover that these correlation functions obey a universal functional form. This finding helps us identify the dominant interacting processes in the spin depolarization dynamics that lead to universality. Our observation demonstrates the existence of universality even in non-equilibrium dynamics at high temperatures, thereby complementing the well-established universality in low-energy physics. Universal properties have previously been observed mostly in the equilibrium physics of many-body systems in the low-energy and low-temperature regime. Now universality is observed at high temperature in the spin dynamics of a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance system.},

More recently, high-harmonic generation in solids has been adopted by other communities as a method to study material properties. However, so far high-harmonic generation has only been driven by classical light, despite theoretical proposals to do so with quantum states of light. Here we observe non-perturbative high-harmonic generation in solids driven by a macroscopic quantum state of light, a bright squeezed vacuum, which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. The process driven by a bright squeezed vacuum is considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than classical light of the same mean intensity. Due to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from 0 to 2 × 1013 photons per pulse, and strong subcycle electric field fluctuations, a bright squeezed vacuum gives access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak intensities than accessible with classical light. High-harmonic generation has so far been driven only by classical light. Now, its driving by a bright squeezed vacuum—a quantum state of light—has been observed and shown to be more efficient than using classical light.},

Traditionally, a mechanism is required that exponentially localizes the waves or particles in the confinement region, such as total internal reflection at a boundary. Here we introduce a waveguiding mechanism that relies on a different origin for the exponential confinement and that arises owing to the physics of diffusion. We demonstrate this concept using light and show that the photon density can propagate as a guided mode along a core structure embedded in a scattering opaque material, enhancing light transmission by orders of magnitude and along non-trivial, such as curved, trajectories. This waveguiding mechanism can also occur naturally, for example, in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and along tendons in the human body, and is to be expected in other systems that follow the same physics such as neutron diffusion. Waveguides—often based on total internal reflection—underpin many photonic technologies, including fibre networks for broadband communications. Now a different type of waveguide based on physical diffusion in a scattering medium is demonstrated.},

Here we adopt a more general approach, deploying bootstrap techniques to rule out theories that are inconsistent with microscopic causality. What remains is a universal convex geometry in the space of transport coefficients, which we call the hydrohedron. The landscape of all consistent theories necessarily lies inside or on the edges of the hydrohedron. We analytically construct cross-sections of the hydrohedron corresponding to bounds on transport coefficients that appear in sound and diffusion modes’ dispersion relations for theories without stochastic fluctuations. Causality places fundamental limits on the hydrodynamic behaviour of relativistic systems that are independent of the underlying model.},

A recent theoretical proposal suggests that thermal transport measurements can detect these competing phases. Here we experimentally show that the bulk thermal transport of the ν = 0 state in bilayer graphene vanishes. This is in contrast to the theory, which predicts a finite thermal conductance in the ν = 0 state. By varying the external electric field and conducting temperature-dependent measurements, our results suggest that there are gapped collective excitations in the ν = 0 state. Our findings underscore the necessity for further investigations into the nature of the ν = 0 state. The ground state of charge-neutral bilayer graphene in a strong magnetic field is not fully determined.

Here we demonstrate that quasiperiodicity can change the ground-state properties of one-dimensional moiré systems with respect to their periodic counterparts. We show that although narrow bands play a role in enhancing interactions, for both commensurate and incommensurate structures, only quasiperiodicity is able to extend the ordered phase down to an infinitesimal interaction strength. In this regime, the state enabled by quasiperiodicity has contributions from electronic states with a very large number of wavevectors. This quasi-fractal regime cannot be stabilized in the commensurate case even in the presence of a narrow band. These findings suggest that quasiperiodicity may be a critical factor in stabilizing non-trivial ordered phases in interacting moiré structures and highlight that multifractal non-interacting phases might be particularly promising parent states. An incommensurate moiré pattern in a one-dimensional system is numerically shown to produce a quasi-fractal charge density wave ground state that originates from a parent multifractal critical phase.},

Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that charge density modulations and ionic displacements follow distinct irreducible representations of the space group, despite exhibiting similar wave vectors and a strong coupling. This charge-lattice symmetry frustration induces lattice distortions that further break all symmetries that are not common to both sectors. This ultimately gives rise to chirality. Our theory is verified using Raman spectroscopy and inelastic X-ray scattering. The mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking in condensed matter systems is not well understood.

  abstract     = {The emerging field of orbitronics aims to generate and control orbital angular momentum for information processing. Chiral crystals are promising orbitronic materials because they have been predicted to host monopole-like orbital textures, where the orbital angular momentum aligns isotropically with the electron’s crystal momentum. However, such monopoles have not yet been directly observed in chiral crystals. Here, we use circular dichroism in angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to image orbital angular momentum monopoles in the chiral topological semimetals PtGa and PdGa. The spectra show a robust polar texture that rotates around the monopole as a function of photon energy. This is a direct consequence of the underlying magnetic orbital texture and can be understood from the interference of local atomic contributions. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the polarity of the monopoles can be controlled through the structural handedness of the host crystal by imaging orbital angular moment monopoles and antimonopoles in the two enantiomers of PdGa, respectively. Our results highlight the potential of chiral crystals for orbitronic device applications, and our methodology could enable the discovery of even more complicated nodal orbital angular momentum textures that could be exploited for orbitronics. Chiral topological materials have been predicted to host orbital angular momentum monopoles, which can be useful for orbitronics applications. Now such monopoles have been imaged in chiral materials.},

  abstract     = {A thorough understanding of the topological classifications of non-Hermitian energy bands is essential for advancing non-Hermitian band theory and its applications. As evidenced in various disciplines of physics, including optics, electronics and acoustics, the process of braiding plays a crucial role in the classification of non-Hermitian bands that manifest topological characteristics. Here we demonstrate topological braiding of both reflectionless states and resonant states in non-Hermitian magnons, unveiling a reversal in their braiding handedness. Furthermore, we constitute parity–time symmetric reflectionless scattering modes, along with their degenerate exceptional points. Our results not only underscore the importance of braided scattering states, but also establish magnonics as a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian band theory and developing magnon-based applications, including topological energy transfer, tunable absorbers and logic circuits. Extending topological braids of complex energy bands to non-Hermitian systems of magnons—the quanta of spin waves—is a crucial step in the development of spin-based topological devices. This has now been experimentally demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Transport of angular momentum is a key concept in condensed-matter physics. In solids, electrons can carry both spin and orbital angular momentum, leading to various applications in spintronics and orbitronics. A key difference between spin and orbital transport lies in their characteristic length scales in ferromagnets in which the dynamic orbital response is significantly long ranged compared with its spin counterpart. However, a comprehensive understanding of the physics behind the long-range nature of the orbital response is lacking. Here we demonstrate that the long-range dynamic orbital response in ferromagnets can be controlled by crystal symmetry. Our results manifest a clear difference in the characteristic length scale of orbital torque generation in atomically ordered and disordered CoPt alloys. This observation indicates that the long-range dynamic orbital response relies on the orbital-dependent energy splittings and hybridizations governed by crystal symmetry, which can be manipulated by atomic arrangements. Our results suggest the possibility of simultaneously controlling dynamic and static magnetic phenomena by manipulating orbital hybridization, which could be tailored for spintronic and orbitronic devices. Manipulation of the electron’s orbital contribution to transport experiments is important for potential orbitronics device applications. Now the long-range dynamic orbital response is shown to be controlled by the arrangement of atoms in ferromagnets.},

  abstract     = {Electronic nematicity is a state of matter in which rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken and translational symmetry is preserved. In strongly correlated materials, nematicity often emerges from fluctuations of a multicomponent primary order, such as spin or charge density waves, and is termed vestigial nematicity. One widely studied example is Ising nematicity, which arises as a vestigial order of collinear antiferromagnetism in the tetragonal iron pnictide superconductors. Because nematic directors in crystals are restricted by the underlying crystal symmetry, recently identified quantum materials with three-fold rotational symmetry offer a new platform to investigate nematic order with three-state Potts character. Here we demonstrate strain control of three-state Potts nematicity as a vestigial order of zigzag antiferromagnetism in FePSe3. Optical linear dichroism measurements reveal the nematic state and demonstrate the rotation of the nematic director by uniaxial strain. We show that the nature of the nematic phase transition can also be controlled by strain, inducing a smooth crossover transition between a Potts nematic transition and an Ising nematic flop transition. Elastocaloric measurements demonstrate the signatures of two coupled phase transitions, indicating that the vestigial nematic transition is separated from the antiferromagnetic transition. This establishes FePSe3 as a system to explore three-state Potts vestigial nematicity. Correlated materials can show nematicity, but the nematic state usually exhibits even-fold rotational symmetry. Now, a correlated antiferromagnet is shown to host a three-state Potts vestigial nematicity that can be controlled by external strain.},

Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose–Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys the required properties of electromagnetism: a spatially varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect—the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field—exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field. Arrays of superconducting transmon qubits can be used to study the Bose–Hubbard model. Synthetic electromagnetic fields have now been added to this analogue quantum simulation platform.},

  abstract     = {Quantum metrology uses non-classical states, such as Fock states with a specific number of photons, to achieve an advantage over classical sensing methods. Typically, quantum metrological performance can be enhanced by increasing the involved excitation numbers, for example, by using large-photon-number Fock states. However, manipulating these states and demonstrating a quantum metrological advantage is experimentally challenging. Here we present an efficient method for generating large Fock states approaching 100 photons within a superconducting microwave cavity through the development of a programmable photon number filter. Using these states in displacement and phase measurements, we demonstrate quantum-enhanced metrology approaching the Heisenberg scaling for 40-photon Fock states and achieve a maximum metrological gain of up to 14.8 dB, highlighting the metrological advantages of large Fock states. Our study could be readily extended to mechanical and optical systems, promising potential applications in weak force detection and dark matter searches. Non-classical states with a large, definite number of photons can now be produced in a superconducting cavity and used for quantum-enhanced sensing.},

Some of the issues that are central to the field include how the quantum critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated systems are interconnected. In this Review, we survey some of these issues from the vantage point of heavy-fermion metals. We describe the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to several crucial effects. These include a transformation of the Fermi surface from large to small when the system is tuned across the quantum critical point, a loss of quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface when it is perched at the quantum critical point and a dynamical Planckian scaling in various physical properties including charge responses. We close with a discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics in heavy-fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other correlated materials. The strange-metal state that develops close to a quantum critical point in strongly correlated electron systems is not well understood. This Review summarizes how the notion of Kondo destruction can describe much of the experimental phenomenology.},

  abstract     = {The Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered mass extinction, mega-tsunamis and a spell of global warming that lasted for around 100,000 years. Although the recent Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission by NASA demonstrated that near-Earth objects can be successfully targeted, deflecting the most dangerous asteroids will require energy concentrations akin to nuclear explosions. However, targets suitable for practice missions are scarce. Here we demonstrate the simulation of asteroid deflection with an X-ray pulse from a dense argon plasma generated at the Z machine, a pulsed power device at Sandia National Laboratories. We use so-called X-ray scissors to place surrogate asteroidal material into free space, simultaneously severing supports and vapourizing the target surface. The ensuing explosion accelerates the mock asteroidal material in a scaled asteroid intercept mission. Deflection velocities of around 70 m s–1 for silica targets agree with radiation-hydrodynamic model predictions. We scale these results to proposed interceptor energies and predict that asteroids up to a diameter of (4 ± 1) km can be deflected with this mechanism, showing a viable way to prepare for future planetary defence missions. Deflection is one of the options discussed for preventing catastrophic collisions of asteroids with Earth. Now, a megajoule-class X-ray pulse is used to simulate such scenarios, demonstrating that it is a viable strategy at higher interceptor energies.},

  abstract     = {Living systems are driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium through the continuous consumption of ambient energy. In the cell cortex, this energy is invested in the formation of diverse patterns in chemical and mechanical activities, whose spatial and temporal dynamics determine the cell phenotypes and behaviours. How cells partition internal energy between these activities is unknown. Here we measured the entropy production rate of both chemical and mechanical subsystems of the cell cortex across a variety of patterns as the system is driven further from equilibrium. We do this by manipulating the Rho GTPase pathway, which controls the cortical actin filaments and myosin-II. At lower levels of GTPase-activating protein expression, which produce pulses or choppy Rho and actin filament waves, energy is proportionally partitioned between the two subsystems and is subject to the constraint of Onsager reciprocity. Within the range of reciprocity, the entropy production rate is maximized in choppy waves. As the cortex is driven into labyrinthine or spiral travelling waves, reciprocity is broken, marking an increasingly differential partitioning of energy and an uncoupling of chemical and mechanical activities. We further demonstrate that energy partitioning and reciprocity are determined by the competing timescales between chemical reaction and mechanical relaxation. How cells manage the internal energetic budget to drive mechanical and chemical dynamics is still an open question. Now it is shown that the allocation of energy depends on the distance from thermodynamic equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Immune cells, such as natural killer cells, migrate with high speeds of several micrometres per minute through dense tissue. However, the magnitude of the traction forces during this migration is unknown. Here we present a method to measure dynamic traction forces of fast migrating cells in biopolymer matrices from the observed matrix deformations. Our method accounts for the mechanical nonlinearity of the three-dimensional tissue matrix and can be applied to time series of confocal or bright-field image stacks. It allows for precise force reconstruction over a wide range of force magnitudes and object sizes—even when the imaged volume captures only a small part of the matrix deformation field. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by measuring forces from around 1 nN for axon growth cones up to around 10 μN for mouse intestinal organoids. We find that natural killer cells show bursts of large traction forces around 50 nN that increase with matrix stiffness. These force bursts are driven by myosin II contractility, mediated by integrin β1 adhesions, focal adhesion kinase and Rho-kinase activity, and occur predominantly when the cells migrate through narrow matrix pores. Immune cells are believed not to generate large traction forces during migration. Now, measurements of natural killer cells in dense tissue reveal bursts of large traction forces as they move through narrow pores.},

In lower dimensions, fluctuations increase and lead to the suppression of long-range order. For example, in bosonic gases, Bose–Einstein condensation in one dimension requires stronger confinement than in two dimensions. Here we observe the dimensional crossover from one to two dimensions in a harmonically trapped photon gas and study its properties. The photons are trapped in a dye microcavity where polymer nanostructures provide the trapping potential for the photon gas. By varying the aspect ratio of the harmonic trap, we tune from isotropic two-dimensional confinement to an anisotropic, highly elongated one-dimensional trapping potential. Along this transition, we determine the caloric properties of the photon gas and find a softening of the second-order Bose–Einstein condensation phase transition observed in two dimensions to a crossover behaviour in one dimension. The dimensionality of a many-body system strongly impacts its physical behaviour. Now, a crossover from 1D to 2D has been observed in the Bose–Einstein condensate of a photon gas.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high-fidelity entangling operations between qubits consistently is essential for the performance of multi-qubit systems. Solid-state platforms are particularly exposed to errors arising from materials-induced variability between qubits, which leads to performance inconsistencies. Here we study the errors in a spin qubit processor, tying them to their physical origins. We use this knowledge to demonstrate consistent and repeatable operation with above 99% fidelity of two-qubit gates in the technologically important silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor quantum dot platform. Analysis of the physical errors and fidelities in multiple devices over extended periods allows us to ensure that we capture the variation and the most common error types. Physical error sources include the slow nuclear and electrical noise on single qubits and contextual noise that depends on the applied control sequence. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of qubit design, feedback systems and robust gate design to inform the design of future scalable, high-fidelity control strategies. Our results highlight both the capabilities and challenges for the scaling-up of silicon spin-based qubits into full-scale quantum processors. For solid-state qubits, the material environment hosts sources of errors that vary in time and space. This systematic analysis of errors affecting high-fidelity two-qubit gates in silicon can inform the design of large-scale quantum computers.},

  abstract     = {Some form of quantum error correction is necessary to produce large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers and finds broad relevance in physics. Most studies customarily assume exact correction. However, codes that may only enable approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) could be useful and intrinsically important in many practical and physical contexts. Here we establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and AQEC capability. Our analysis covers systems with both all-to-all connectivity and geometric scenarios like lattice systems. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. For a code encoding k logical qubits in n physical qubits, we find that if the subsystem variance is below an O(k/n) threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify non-trivial phases of codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging important physical scenarios such as topological order and critical quantum systems. Our results suggest that O(1/n) represents a common, physically profound scaling threshold of subsystem variance for features associated with non-trivial quantum order. Approximate—rather than exact—quantum error correction is a useful but relatively unexplored idea in quantum computing and many-body physics. A theoretical framework has now been established based on connections with quantum circuit complexity.},

  abstract     = {When two superconductors are separated by a weak link, a supercurrent is carried by Andreev bound states formed by the phase-coherent reflection of electrons and their time-reversed partners. The two levels associated with a single, highly transmissive Andreev bound state can serve as a qubit due to the potentially large energy difference with the next bound state. Although coherent manipulation of these so-called Andreev pair qubits has been demonstrated, long-range qubit–qubit coupling, which is necessary for advanced quantum computing architectures, has not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate coherent remote coupling between two Andreev pair qubits mediated by a microwave photon in a superconducting cavity coupler. The latter hosts two modes that are engineered to have very different coupling rates to an external port. The strongly coupled mode can be used to perform a fast read-out of each qubit, while we use the weakly coupled mode to mediate the coupling between the qubits. When both qubits are tuned into resonance with the latter mode, we find excitation spectra with characteristic avoided crossings. We identify two-qubit states that are entangled over a distance of 6 mm. This work establishes Andreev pair qubits as a compact and scalable approach to developing quantum computers. Qubits formed from Andreev bound states in a Josephson junction could have performance advantages over existing superconducting qubits. Here proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate long-range coupling between Andreev-level qubits.},

  abstract     = {Magic is a property of quantum states that enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computing using simple sets of gate operations. Understanding the mechanisms by which magic is created or destroyed is, therefore, a crucial step towards efficient and practical fault-tolerant computation. Many proposals for error correction in quantum computing make use of so-called stabilizer codes, which use multiqubit measurements to detect deviations from logical qubit states. Here we observe that a random stabilizer code subject to coherent errors exhibits a phase transition in magic, which we characterize through analytical, numerical and experimental probes. Below a critical error rate, stabilizer measurements remove the accumulated magic in the circuit, effectively protecting against coherent errors; above the critical error rate measurements concentrate magic. A better understanding of this behaviour in the resource theory of magic could help to identify the origins of quantum speedup and lead to methods for more efficient magic state generation. Coherent noise affecting a random error correcting code is now shown to produce a transition between phases that accumulate and destroy magic.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafast photoexcitation can generate internal compressive stress in Mott insulators that lead to strain waves from free surfaces. These photoinduced elastic waves can trigger phase transitions in materials. However, a comprehensive physical picture of the phase transformation dynamics that includes acoustic-scale propagation has not yet been developed. Here we demonstrate that such a strain-wave mechanism drives the ultrafast insulator-to-metal phase transition in granular thin films of the Mott material V2O3. Our time-resolved optical reflectivity and X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that an inverse ferroelastic shear occurs before the insulator-to-metal transition, which propagates in the wake of a compressive strain wave. These dynamics are governed by the domain size and film thickness, respectively. Our results clarify the morphological conditions for the ultrafast phase transition that is favoured in granular thin films and hindered in single crystals. The resulting physical picture sheds light on the ultrafast phase transitions in quantum materials and future devices based on Mott insulators. The mechanism behind the ultrafast insulator-to-metal transition in Mott materials is still not well understood. Now, it is shown that this phase transition propagates along the pathway of a photoinduced compressive strain wave in prototypical V2O3.},

  abstract     = {In the Kondo lattice model, the interaction of a lattice of localized magnetic moments with a sea of conduction electrons induces rich quantum phases of matter, including Fermi liquids with heavily renormalized electronic quasiparticles, quantum critical non-Fermi liquid metals and unconventional superconductors. The recent demonstration of moiré Kondo lattices has presented an opportunity to study the Kondo problem with continuously tunable parameters. Although a heavy Fermi liquid phase has been identified, the magnetic phases remain unexplored in moiré Kondo lattices. Here we report a density-tuned Kondo breakdown in MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers by combining magnetotransport and optical studies. At a critical density, we observe a heavy Fermi liquid to insulator transition and a nearly concomitant emergence of ferromagnetic order. The observation is consistent with the emergence of a ferromagnetic Anderson insulator and suppression of the Kondo screening effect below the critical density. Our results suggest a path for realizing other quantum phase transitions in moiré Kondo lattices. Kondo physics has been observed in moiré bilayers, but the expected magnetic transitions have not been reported. Now, a metal–insulator transition with ferromagnetic order that develops at nearly the same time is reported in a moiré bilayer.},

However, fluctuation-driven magnetic phases in low dimensions have remained relatively unexplored. Here we demonstrate a phase transition from the zigzag antiferromagnetic order in the three-dimensional bulk to a Z3 vestigial Potts nematicity in two-dimensional few-layer samples of van der Waals magnet NiPS3. Our spin relaxometry and optical spectroscopy measurements reveal that the spin fluctuations are enhanced over the gigahertz to terahertz range as the layer number of NiPS3 reduces. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the experimental finding of threefold rotational symmetry breaking but show that the translational symmetry is restored in thin layers of NiPS3. Therefore, our results show that strong quantum fluctuations can stabilize an unconventional magnetic phase after destroying a more conventional one. Magnetic phases that are stabilized by quantum fluctuations in low dimensions are rare. A thickness-dependent crossover from three-dimensional antiferromagnetism to a two-dimensional vestigial nematic state that is driven by fluctuations has now been observed.},

Here we demonstrate current-induced modifications of the electronic states of Ca2RuO4. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction with four-probe electrical transport (transport-ARPES) measurements reveal a clear reduction of the Mott gap and a modification in the dispersion of the Ru bands. Based on a free-energy analysis, we show that the current-induced phase is electronically distinct from the high-temperature zero-current metallic phase. Our results highlight strong interplay of lattice- and orbital-dependent electronic responses in the current-driven insulator-to-metal transition. Ca2RuO4 is a Mott insulator that becomes a metal when a current is passed through it. Now, the changes in its electronic structure are revealed as this transition takes place.},

  abstract     = {Inhomogeneities crucially influence the properties of quantum materials, yet methods that can measure them remain limited and can access only a fraction of relevant observables. For example, local probes such as scanning tunnelling microscopy have documented that the electronic properties of cuprate superconductors are inhomogeneous over nanometre length scales. However, complementary techniques that can resolve higher-order correlations are needed to elucidate the nature of these inhomogeneities. Furthermore, local tunnelling probes are often effective only far below the critical temperature. Here we develop a two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy method to measure Josephson plasmon echoes from an interlayer superconducting tunnelling resonance in a near-optimally doped cuprate. The technique allows us to study the multidimensional optical response of the interlayer Josephson coupling in the material and disentangle intrinsic lifetime broadening from extrinsic inhomogeneous broadening for interlayer superconducting tunnelling. We find that inhomogeneous broadening persists up to a substantial fraction of the critical temperature, above which this is overcome by the thermally increased lifetime broadening. By measuring terahertz photon echoes, multidimensional spectroscopy demonstrates that interlayer tunnelling in a cuprate superconductor remains largely unaffected by electronic disorder, even near the phase transition.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale Rydberg atom arrays are used for highly coherent analogue quantum simulations and for digital quantum computations. However, advanced quantum protocols, such as quantum error correction, require midcircuit qubit operations, including the replenishment, reset and read-out of a subset of qubits. A compelling strategy for unlocking these capabilities is a dual-species architecture in which a second atomic species is controlled independently and entangled with the first through Rydberg interactions. Here, we realize a dual-species Rydberg array consisting of rubidium and caesium atoms and explore regimes of interactions and dynamics not accessible in single-species architectures. We achieve enhanced interspecies interactions by electrically tuning the Rydberg states close to a Förster resonance. In this regime, we demonstrate an interspecies Rydberg blockade and implement a quantum state transfer from one species to another. We then generate a Bell state between Rb and Cs hyperfine qubits through an interspecies controlled-phase gate. Finally, we combine interspecies entanglement with a native midcircuit read-out to achieve quantum non-demolition measurements. Rydberg atoms in optical tweezers are a promising platform for quantum information science. A platform composed of dual-species Rydberg arrays has been realized, offering access to unexplored interaction regimes and crosstalk-free midcircuit control.},

Similarly, chiral dynamics have been observed in quantum simulators under synthetic Abelian gauge fields. These simulators offer flexible control, enabling the engineering of non-Abelian gauge fields, although their influence on chiral dynamics remains unclear. Here, we implement a synthetic SU(2) gauge field in a spinful one-dimensional ladder and investigate the resulting chiral dynamics by developing a Raman momentum-lattice technique. We confirm the non-Abelian nature of the synthetic potential by observing the non-Abelian Aharonov–Bohm effect on a single plaquette. Furthermore, we find that the chiral current along the two legs of the ladder is spin dependent and highly tunable through the gauge potential parameters. We experimentally map out different dynamic regimes of the chiral current, revealing the competition between overlaying flux ladders with different spin compositions. Our experiment demonstrates the impact of non-Abelian gauge fields on chiral dynamics and offers a viable approach to implementing exotic synthetic gauge fields using Raman momentum lattices. The implementation of synthetic Abelian gauge fields in quantum simulators can result in chiral edge currents. The impact of non-Abelian gauge fields on chiral dynamics of ultracold atoms is now explored using a momentum-space lattice technique.},

We perform large-scale quantum simulations that monitor particle-number fluctuations in tunable ladders of hard-core bosons and explore how the build-up of fluctuations changes as the system crosses over from integrable to fully chaotic dynamics. Our results indicate that the growth of large-scale fluctuations in chaotic, far-from-equilibrium systems is quantitatively determined by equilibrium transport coefficients, in agreement with the predictions of fluctuating hydrodynamics. This emergent hydrodynamic behaviour of subsystem fluctuations provides a test of fluctuation–dissipation relations far from equilibrium and allows the accurate determination of equilibrium transport coefficients using far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Fluctuating hydrodynamics posits that thermalization in non-equilibrium systems depends on equilibrium transport coefficients. This hypothesis is now tested by exploring the emergence of fluctuations in non-equilibrium dynamics of ultracold atoms.},

These chiral edge modes lie at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, and their robustness against noise and disorder reflects the quantization of Hall conductivity in these systems. Despite their importance, the controllable injection of edge modes, and direct imaging of their propagation, structure and dynamics, remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the distillation of chiral edge modes in a rapidly rotating bosonic superfluid confined by an optical boundary. By tuning the wall sharpness, we reveal the smooth crossover between soft wall behaviour in which the propagation speed is proportional to wall steepness and the hard wall regime that exhibits chiral free particles. From the skipping motion of atoms along the boundary we infer the energy gap between the ground and first excited edge bands, and reveal its evolution from the bulk Landau level splitting for a soft boundary to the hard wall limit. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of edge propagation against disorder by projecting an optical obstacle that is static in the rotating frame. Edge modes are a key feature of topological materials, but their propagation is difficult to directly observe in condensed matter systems. The controlled injection and propagation of chiral edge modes has now been shown in a rotating ultracold gas.},

In particular, contradictory experimental evidence exists regarding the role of nuclear collectivity in this region of the nuclear chart. Here, we provide further evidence for the doubly magic character of 100Sn by measuring the ground-state electromagnetic moments and nuclear charge radii of indium (Z = 49) isotopes as N approaches 50 from above using precision laser spectroscopy. Our results span almost the complete range between the two major closed neutron shells at N = 50 and N = 82 and reveal parabolic trends as a function of the neutron number, with a clear reduction towards these two closed neutron shells. A detailed comparison between our experimental results and numerical results from two complementary nuclear many-body frameworks (density functional theory and ab initio methods) exposes deficiencies in nuclear models and establishes a benchmark for future theoretical developments. Precision laser spectroscopy of ground-state electromagnetic moments and nuclear charge radii of indium shows that 100Sn has closed proton and neutron shells.

Such organs include the human airways, brain ventricles and reproductive tracts. Although cilia organization and duct morphology vary drastically in the animal kingdom, ducts are typically classified as carpet or flame designs. The reason behind the appearance of these two different designs and how they relate to fluid pumping remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that two structural parameters—lumen diameter and cilia-to-lumen ratio—organize the observed duct diversity into a continuous spectrum that connects carpets to flames across all animal phyla. Using a unified fluid model, we show that carpets and flames represent trade-offs between flow rate and pressure generation. We propose that the convergence of ciliated organ designs follows functional constraints rather than phylogenetic distance and offer guiding design principles for synthetic ciliary pumps. The ducts of many fluid-pumping organs feature cilia. Two structural parameters organize the different types of ducts into a continuous spectrum between ciliary carpet and flame designs depending on the fluid-pumping requirements.},

  abstract     = {Filaments in the cell commonly treadmill. Driven by energy consumption, they grow on one end while shrinking on the other, causing filaments to appear motile even though individual proteins remain static. This process is characteristic of cytoskeletal filaments and leads to collective filament self-organization. Here we show that treadmilling drives filament nematic ordering by dissolving misaligned filaments. Taking the bacterial FtsZ protein involved in cell division as an example, we show that this mechanism aligns FtsZ filaments in vitro and drives the organization of the division ring in living Bacillus subtilis cells. We find that ordering via local dissolution also allows the system to quickly respond to chemical and geometrical biases in the cell, enabling us to quantitatively explain the ring formation dynamics in vivo. Beyond FtsZ and other cytoskeletal filaments, our study identifies a mechanism for self-organization via constant birth and death of energy-consuming filaments. Treadmilling of cytoskeletal filaments is crucial for their functional self-organization. Now the mechanism underpinning this collective organization is shown to be the dissolution of misaligned filaments.},

  abstract     = {During development, wound healing and cancer invasion, migrating cell clusters feature highly protrusive leader cells at their front. Leader cells are thought to pull and direct their cohort of followers, but whether their local action is enough to guide the entire cluster, or if a global mechanical organization is needed, remains controversial. Here we show that the effectiveness of the leader–follower organization is proportional to the asymmetry of traction and tension within cell clusters. By combining hydrogel micropatterning and optogenetic activation, we generate highly protrusive leaders at the edge of minimal cell clusters. We find that the induced leader can robustly drag one follower but not larger groups. By measuring traction forces and tension propagation in clusters of increasing size, we establish a quantitative relationship between group velocity and the asymmetry of the traction and tension profiles. Modelling motile clusters as active polar fluids, we explain this force–velocity relationship in terms of asymmetries in the active traction profile. Our results challenge the notion of autonomous leader cells, showing that collective cell migration requires global mechanical organization within the cluster. Leader cells play an important role in guiding migratory clusters in various biological processes. Now, the mechanical organization of leader and followers within a cell cluster is shown to enable collective migration.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error mitigation has been proposed as a means to combat unwanted and unavoidable errors in near-term quantum computing without the heavy resource overheads required by fault-tolerant schemes. Recently, error mitigation has been successfully applied to reduce noise in near-term applications. In this work, however, we identify strong limitations to the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively ‘undone’ for larger system sizes. Our framework rigorously captures large classes of error-mitigation schemes in use today. By relating error mitigation to a statistical inference problem, we show that even at shallow circuit depths comparable to those of current experiments, a superpolynomial number of samples is needed in the worst case to estimate the expectation values of noiseless observables, the principal task of error mitigation. Notably, our construction implies that scrambling due to noise can kick in at exponentially smaller depths than previously thought. Noise also impacts other near-term applications by constraining kernel estimation in quantum machine learning, causing an earlier emergence of noise-induced barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms and ruling out exponential quantum speed-ups in estimating expectation values in the presence of noise or preparing the ground state of a Hamiltonian. Error mitigation has helped improve the performance of current quantum computing devices. Now, a mathematical analysis of the technique suggests its benefits may not extend to larger systems.},

  abstract     = {Entangled quantum systems feature non-local correlations that are stronger than could be realized classically. This property makes it possible to perform self-testing, the strongest form of quantum functionality verification, which allows a classical user to deduce the quantum state and measurements used to produce a given set of measurement statistics. While self-testing of quantum states is well understood, self-testing of measurements, especially in high dimensions, remains relatively unexplored. Here we prove that every real projective measurement can be self-tested. Our approach employs the idea that existing self-tests can be extended to verify additional untrusted measurements, known as post-hoc self-testing. We formalize the method of post-hoc self-testing and establish the condition under which it can be applied. Using this condition, we construct self-tests for all real projective measurements. We build on this result to develop an iterative self-testing technique that provides a clear methodology for constructing new self-tests from pre-existing ones. Quantum correlations are strong enough that classical users can verify that a device produces quantum entangled states using only the outcomes of local measurements. This self-testing approach has now been extended to verifying quantum measurements.},

  abstract     = {Precise quantum control and measurement of several harmonic oscillators, such as the modes of the electromagnetic field in a cavity or of mechanical motion, are key for their use as quantum platforms. The motional modes of trapped ions can be individually controlled and have good coherence properties. However, achieving high-fidelity two-mode operations and non-destructive measurements of the motional state has been challenging. Here we demonstrate the coherent exchange of single motional quanta between spectrally separated harmonic motional modes of a trapped-ion crystal. The timing, strength, and phase of the coupling are controlled through an oscillating electric potential with suitable spatial variation. Coupling rates that are much larger than decoherence rates enable demonstrations of high-fidelity quantum state transfer and beam-splitter operations, entanglement of motional modes, and Hong–Ou–Mandel-type interference. Additionally, we use the motional coupling to enable repeated non-destructive projective measurement of a trapped-ion motional state. Our work enhances the suitability of trapped-ion motion for continuous-variable quantum computing and error correction and may provide opportunities to improve the performance of motional cooling and motion-mediated entangling interactions. A lack of non-destructive measurements and difficulty in tuning direct coupling between motional modes limits quantum information processing with trapped ions. Both features have now been achieved in an ion crystal using oscillating electric fields.},

We take advantage of the tunability of the optical interactions between the particles in our system and set the optical interaction between the particles to be purely non-reciprocal. By continuously varying the relative power of the trapping beams, we take the system through a transition similar to a parity–time phase transition. A Hopf bifurcation at a critical point results in the formation of collective limit cycle oscillations, resembling those observed in phonon lasers. These coupled levitated oscillators provide a platform for exceptional point optomechanical sensing and can be extended to multi-particle systems, paving the way for the development of topological optomechanical media.

  abstract     = {Identifying ordered phases and their underlying symmetries in materials that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity is an important step towards understanding the mechanism of that phenomenon. Indeed, the critical behaviour related to phase transitions of those ordered phases is expected to be correlated with the superconductivity. In cuprate materials, efforts to find such ordered phases have mainly focused on symmetry breaking in the pseudogap region whereas the Fermi-liquid-like metallic region beyond the so-called critical doping at which the pseudogap disappears has been regarded as a trivial disordered state. Here, we uncover a broken mirror symmetry in the Fermi-liquid-like phase in (Bi,Pb)2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ beyond the critical doping. We do this by tracking the temperature dependence of the rotational-anisotropy of second-harmonic generation for two different dopings. We observe behaviour reminiscent of an order parameter with an onset temperature that coincides with the strange metal to Fermi-liquid-like metal crossover. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows that the quasiparticle coherence between CuO2 bilayers is enhanced in proportion to the symmetry-breaking response as a function of temperature, suggesting that the change in metallicity and symmetry breaking are linked. These observations contradict the conventional quantum disordered scenario for over-critical-doped cuprates. The Fermi liquid state in highly doped superconducting cuprates is normally thought of as disordered. Now, an observation of broken mirror symmetry in that phase suggests otherwise.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid systems represent one of the frontiers in the study of unconventional superconductivity and are a promising platform to realize topological superconducting states. These materials are challenging to probe using many conventional measurement techniques because of their mesoscopic dimensions, and therefore require new experimental probes so that they can be successfully characterized. Here, we demonstrate a probe that enables us to measure the superfluid density of micrometre-size superconductors using microwave techniques drawn from circuit quantum electrodynamics. We apply this technique to a superconductor–ferromagnet bilayer and find that the proximity-induced superfluid density is two-fold anisotropic within the plane of the sample. It also exhibits power-law temperature scaling that is indicative of a nodal superconducting state. These experimental results are consistent with the theoretically predicted signatures of induced triplet pairing with a nodal p-wave order parameter. Moreover, we observe modifications to the microwave response at frequencies near the ferromagnetic resonance, suggesting a coupling between the spin dynamics and induced superconducting order in the ferromagnetic layer. Our experimental technique can be employed more widely, for example to study fragile unconventional superconductivity in low-dimensional materials such as van der Waals heterostructures. Heterostructures of ferromagnets and superconductors may host exotic superconducting states. Now a circuit quantum electrodynamics technique is demonstrated that provides evidence for triplet p-wave pairing in such a heterostructure.},

Here, by utilizing terahertz pump–probe spectroscopy in a scanning tunnelling microscope, we measure the ultrafast collective dynamics of the charge density wave in the transition metal dichalcogenide 2H-NbSe2 with atomic spatial resolution. The tip-enhanced electric field of the terahertz pulses excites oscillations of the charge density wave that vary in magnitude and frequency on the scale of individual atomic impurities. Overlapping phase excitations originating from the randomly distributed atomic defects in the surface create this spatially structured response of the charge density wave. This ability to observe collective charge order dynamics with local probes makes it possible to study the dynamics of correlated materials at the intrinsic length scale of their underlying interactions. The observation of phase modes of charge density wave has been a long-standing challenge. Such low-energy phase excitations have now been seen in a transition metal dichalcogenide.},

  abstract     = {High-temperature superconductivity in cuprates emerges upon doping the parent Mott insulator. Key features of the low-doped cuprate superconductors include an effective carrier density that tracks the number of doped holes, the emergence of an anisotropic pseudogap that is characterized by disconnected Fermi arcs and the closure of the gap at a critical doping level. In Sr2IrO4, a spin–orbit-coupled Mott insulator often regarded as a 5d analogue of the cuprates, surface probes have also revealed the emergence of an anisotropic pseudogap and Fermi arcs under electron doping. However, neither the corresponding critical doping nor the bulk signatures of pseudogap closure have yet been observed. Here we demonstrate that electron-doped Sr2IrO4 exhibits a critical doping level with a marked crossover in the effective carrier density at low temperatures. This is accompanied by a five-orders-of-magnitude increase in conductivity and a sixfold enhancement in the electronic specific heat. These collective findings resemble the bulk pseudogap phenomenology in cuprates. However, given that electron-doped Sr2IrO4 is non-superconducting, it suggests that the pseudogap may not be a state of precursor pairing. Therefore, our results narrow the search for the key ingredient underpinning the formation of the superconducting condensate in doped Mott insulators. The pseudogap in cuprates is often linked to superconductivity. Now bulk evidence for a pseudogap is found in doped non-superconducting Sr2IrO4, revealing that pseudogaps in doped Mott insulators are not necessarily a precursor to superconductivity.},

Inducing Cooper pairing in such a material is a promising way to realize topological superconductivity with the associated chiral Majorana edge states. However, finding evidence of the superconducting proximity effect in such a state has remained a considerable challenge due to inherent experimental difficulties. Here we demonstrate crossed Andreev reflection across a narrow superconducting Nb electrode that is in contact with the chiral edge state of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator. In the crossed Andreev reflection process, an electron injected from one terminal is reflected out as a hole at the other terminal to form a Cooper pair in the superconductor. This is a compelling signature of induced superconducting pair correlation in the chiral edge state. The characteristic length of the crossed Andreev reflection process is found to be much longer than the superconducting coherence length in Nb, which suggests that the crossed Andreev reflection is, indeed, mediated by superconductivity induced on the quantum anomalous Hall insulator surface. Our results will invite future studies of topological superconductivity and Majorana physics, as well as for the search for non-abelian zero modes. The superconducting proximity effect has not been experimentally demonstrated in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator.

  abstract     = {A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed-matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarization and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarized into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead halide perovskites and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics. The identification of dark states—quantum states that do not interact with photons—in real materials may help to address many unsolved issues in condensed-matter physics.

Here, we provide numerical and analytic evidence for the following conjecture: any Hamiltonian exhibiting finite-temperature easy-plane ferromagnetism can be used to generate scalable spin squeezing, thereby enabling quantum-enhanced sensing. Our conjecture is guided by a connection between the quantum Fisher information of pure states and the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We demonstrate that spin squeezing exhibits a phase diagram with a sharp transition between scalable squeezing and non-squeezing. This transition coincides with the equilibrium phase boundary for XY order at a finite temperature. In the scalable squeezing phase, we predict a sensitivity scaling that lies between the standard quantum limit and the scaling achieved in all-to-all coupled one-axis twisting models. A corollary of our conjecture is that short-ranged versions of two-axis twisting cannot yield scalable metrological gain. Our results provide insights into the landscape of Hamiltonians that can be used to generate metrologically useful quantum states. Generating highly squeezed states for quantum sensing requires precise entanglement properties, which makes it a hard task. Now a conjecture identifies a realistic regime of magnetic order at finite temperatures that enables scalable spin squeezing.},

  abstract     = {The Kibble–Zurek mechanism is a theoretical framework that describes the formation and scaling of topological defects in symmetry-breaking phase transitions. It was originally conceptualized for superfluid helium. The theory predicts that the number of quantum vortices should scale as a power law with the rate at which the system passes through the lambda transition, but demonstrating this effect has been elusive in experiments using superfluid systems. Here, we report the observation of Kibble–Zurek scaling in a homogeneous, strongly interacting Fermi gas undergoing a superfluid phase transition. We investigate the superfluid transition using temperature and interaction strength as two distinct control parameters. The microscopic physics of condensate formation is markedly different for the two quench parameters, as shown by the two orders of magnitude difference in the condensate formation timescale. However, regardless of the thermodynamic direction in which the system passes through a phase transition, the Kibble–Zurek exponent is identically observed to be about 0.68, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. This work experimentally demonstrates the theoretical proposal laid out for liquid helium, which is in the same universality class as strongly interacting Fermi gases. An experiment proves that strongly interacting Fermi gases driven into a superfluid phase by two different quenches display the same universal dynamics in the framework of the Kibble–Zurek mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Warm dense matter is at the boundary between a plasma and a condensed phase and plays a role in astrophysics, planetary science and inertial confinement fusion research. However, its electronic structure and ionic structure upon irradiation with strong laser pulses remain poorly understood. Here, we use an intense and ultrafast X-ray free-electron laser pulse to simultaneously create and characterize warm dense copper using L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy over a large irradiation intensity range. Below a pulse intensity of 1015 W cm−2, an absorption peak below the L edge appears, originating from transient depletion of the 3d band. This peak shifts to lower energy with increasing intensity, indicating the movement of the 3d band upon strong X-ray excitation. At higher intensities, substantial ionization and collisions lead to the transition from reverse saturable absorption to saturable absorption of the X-ray free-electron laser pulse, two nonlinear effects that hold promise for X-ray pulse-shaping. We employ theoretical calculations that combine a model based on kinetic Boltzmann equations with finite-temperature real-space density-functional theory to interpret these observations. The results can be used to benchmark non-equilibrium models of electronic structure in warm dense matter. Warm dense copper, created by an X-ray free-electron laser, features a transition from reverse saturable absorption to saturable absorption. The results can be used to benchmark non-equilibrium models of electronic structure in warm dense matter.},

  abstract     = {Accelerated muon beams have been considered for the next-generation studies of high-energy lepton–antilepton collisions and neutrino oscillations. However, high-brightness muon beams have not yet been produced. The main challenge for muon acceleration and storage stems from the large phase-space volume occupied by the beam, derived from the production mechanism of muons through the decay of pions. The phase-space volume of the muon beam can be decreased through ionization cooling. Here we show that ionization cooling leads to a reduction in the transverse emittance of muon beams that traverse lithium hydride or liquid hydrogen absorbers in the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment. Our results represent a substantial advance towards the realization of muon-based facilities that could operate at the energy and intensity frontiers. Current muon beams have a phase-space volume that is too large for applications in muon colliders. Now, the reduction in the beam’s transverse emittance when passed through different absorbers in ionization cooling experiments is quantified.},

  abstract     = {High-harmonic spectroscopy, an ultrafast all-optical technique initially conceptualized in atomic and molecular systems, has now emerged as a powerful platform for studying the structure and dynamics of condensed matter. Unlike that in the gas phase, solid-state high-harmonic generation relies on the fundamental response from high atomic density and periodicity, leading to interband transitions and coherent driving of electrons and holes in their respective bands. These mechanisms make high-harmonic spectroscopy particularly sensitive to the electronic band structure, topological properties and many-body correlations in condensed media. An advantage of high-harmonic spectroscopy over other spectroscopic methods is its ability to probe ultrafast phenomena, capturing femto- to attosecond dynamics of multi-band and strongly correlated electron interactions in solids. In this Review, we discuss the latest experimental and theoretical advances in ultrafast high-harmonic spectroscopy of solids and provide perspectives for future research in this field. High-harmonic spectroscopy on solids is an ultrafast all-optical technique to study the structure and dynamics of materials. This Review discusses areas of condensed-matter physics where this technique can provide particular insight.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria often attach to surfaces and grow densely packed communities called biofilms. As biofilms grow, they expand across the surface, increasing their surface area and access to nutrients. Thus, the overall growth rate of a biofilm is directly dependent on its range expansion rate. A direct trade-off between horizontal and vertical growth impacts the range expansion rate and, crucially, the overall biofilm growth rate. The biophysical connection between horizontal and vertical growth remains poorly understood, in large part due to the difficulty in resolving the biofilm shape with sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions from small length scales to macroscopic sizes. Here we show that the horizontal expansion rate of bacterial colonies is strongly coupled to vertical expansion via the contact angle at the biofilm edge. Using white light interferometry, we measure the three-dimensional surface morphology of growing colonies, and find that small colonies are well described as spherical caps. At later times, nutrient diffusion and uptake prevent the tall colony centre from growing exponentially. We further show that a simple model connecting vertical and horizontal growth dynamics can reproduce the observed phenomena, suggesting that the spherical cap shape emerges due to the biophysical consequences of diffusion-limited growth. The growth of a biofilm—a bacterial colony attached to a surface—is governed by a trade-off between horizontal and vertical expansion. Now, it is shown that this process significantly depends on the contact angle at the biofilm’s edge.},

  abstract     = {Muscle is a complex, hierarchically organized, soft contractile engine. To understand the limits on the rate of contraction and muscle energetics, we construct a coarse-grained multiscale model that describes muscle as an active sponge. Our analysis of existing experiments across species and muscle types highlights the importance of spatially heterogeneous strains and local volumetric deformations. Our minimal theoretical model shows how contractions induce intracellular fluid flow and power active hydraulic oscillations, yielding the limits of ultrafast muscular contractions. We further demonstrate that the viscoelastic response of muscle is naturally non-reciprocal—or odd—owing to its active and anisotropic nature. This enables an alternate mode of muscular power generation from periodic cycles in spatial strain alone, contrasting with previous descriptions based on temporal cycles. Our work suggests a revised view of muscle dynamics that emphasizes the multiscale spatiotemporal origins of soft hydraulic power, with potential implications for physiology, biomechanics and locomotion. A multiscale model of muscle as a fluid-filled sponge suggests that hydraulics limits rapid contractions and that the mechanical response of muscle is non-reciprocal.},

  abstract     = {The directed migration of epithelial cell collectives through coordinated movements plays a crucial role in various physiological processes and is increasingly understood at the level of large confluent monolayers. However, numerous processes rely on the migration of small groups of polarized epithelial clusters in complex environments, and their responses to external geometries remain poorly understood. To address this, we cultivate primary epithelial keratocyte tissues on adhesive microstripes to create autonomous epithelial clusters with well-defined geometries. We show that their migration efficiency is strongly influenced by the contact geometry and the orientation of cell–cell contacts with respect to the direction of migration. A combination of velocity and polarity alignment with contact regulation of locomotion in an active matter model captures quantitatively the experimental data. Furthermore, we predict that this combination of rules enables efficient navigation in complex geometries, which we confirm experimentally. Altogether, our findings provide a conceptual framework for extracting the interaction rules of active systems from their interaction with physical boundaries, as well as design principles for collective navigation in complex microenvironments. The collective migration of cell clusters is modulated by substrate geometry through a combination of velocity and polarity alignment.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates are viscoelastic materials. Here we investigate the determinants of the sequence-encoded and age-dependent viscoelasticity of condensates formed by the prion-like low-complexity domain of the protein hnRNP A1 and its designed variants. We find that the dominantly viscous forms of the condensates are metastable Maxwell fluids. A Rouse–Zimm model that accounts for the network-like organization of proteins within condensates reproduces the measured viscoelastic moduli. We show that the strengths of aromatic inter-sticker interactions determine sequence-specific amplitudes of elastic and viscous moduli and the timescales over which elastic properties dominate. These condensates undergo physical ageing on sequence-specific timescales. This is driven by mutations to spacer residues that weaken the metastability of dominantly viscous phases. The ageing of condensates is accompanied by disorder-to-order transitions, leading to the formation of non-fibrillar, β-sheet-containing, semi-crystalline, elastic, Kelvin–Voigt solids. Our results suggest that sequence grammars, which refer to amino acid identities of stickers versus spacers in prion-like low-complexity domains, have evolved to afford control over metastabilities of dominantly viscous fluid phases of condensates. This selection is likely to render barriers for conversion from metastable fluids to globally stable solids insurmountable on functionally relevant timescales. The time-dependent viscoelastic moduli of biomolecular condensates are connected to the functions that the condensates influence in cells. Now sticker and spacer residues in proteins are shown to regulate condensate viscoelasticity and ageing dynamics.},

Recent developments have highlighted the potential of neural quantum states to solve the quantum many-body problem by encoding the many-body wavefunction into artificial neural networks. However, this method has faced the critical limitation that existing optimization algorithms are not suitable for training modern large-scale deep network architectures. Here, we introduce a minimum-step stochastic-reconfiguration optimization algorithm, which allows us to train deep neural quantum states with up to 106 parameters. We demonstrate our method for paradigmatic frustrated spin-1/2 models on square and triangular lattices, for which our trained deep networks approach machine precision and yield improved variational energies compared to existing results. Equipped with our optimization algorithm, we find numerical evidence for gapless quantum-spin-liquid phases in the considered models, an open question to date. We present a method that captures the emergent complexity in quantum many-body problems through the expressive power of large-scale artificial neural networks. An optimization algorithm reduces the cost of training large-scale neural quantum states. This leads to accurate computations of the ground states of frustrated magnets and provides evidence of gapless quantum-spin-liquid phases.},

It has been proposed that anyons could be used to encode and manipulate information in a topologically protected manner that is immune to local noise, with quantum gates performed by braiding and fusing anyons. Unfortunately, realizing non-Abelian topologically ordered states is challenging, and it was not until recently that the signatures of non-Abelian statistics were observed through digital quantum simulation approaches. However, not all forms of topological order can be used to realize universal quantum computation. Here we use a superconducting quantum processor to simulate non-Abelian topologically ordered states of the Fibonacci string-net model and demonstrate braidings of Fibonacci anyons featuring universal computational power. We demonstrate the non-trivial topological nature of the quantum states by measuring the topological entanglement entropy. In addition, we create two pairs of Fibonacci anyons and demonstrate their fusion rule and non-Abelian braiding statistics by applying unitary gates on the underlying physical qubits. Our results establish a digital approach to explore non-Abelian topological states and their associated braiding statistics with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.

While there is evidence that noiseless Gaussian boson sampling is hard to efficiently simulate using a classical computer, current Gaussian boson sampling experiments inevitably suffer from high photon loss rates and other noise sources. Nevertheless, they are currently claimed to be hard to classically simulate. Here we present a classical tensor-network algorithm that simulates Gaussian boson sampling and whose complexity can be significantly reduced when the photon loss rate is high. Our algorithm enables us to simulate the largest-scale Gaussian boson sampling experiment so far using relatively modest computational resources. We exhibit evidence that our classical sampler can simulate the ideal distribution better than the experiment can, which calls into question the claims of experimental quantum advantage. Gaussian boson sampling reproduces distributions that are hard to calculate classically and were claimed to show quantum advantage in the noiseless limit.

  abstract     = {A critical challenge in developing scalable quantum systems is correcting the accumulation of errors while performing operations and measurements. It is known that systems where dominant errors can be detected and converted into erasures have relaxed requirements for quantum error correction. Recently, it has been proposed that this can be achieved using a dual-rail encoding of quantum information in the microwave photon states of two superconducting cavities. One necessary step to realize this erasure qubit is to demonstrate a measurement and to flag errors as erasures. In this work, we demonstrate a projective logical measurement of a dual-rail cavity qubit with integrated erasure detection and measure the qubit idling errors. We measure the logical state preparation and measurement errors at the 0.01% level and detect over 99% of the cavity decay events as erasures. We use the precision of this measurement protocol to distinguish different types of error in this system, finding that although decay errors occur with a probability of approximately 0.2% per microsecond, phase errors occur 6 times less frequently and bit flips occur at least 150 times less frequently. These findings represent a confirmation of the expected error hierarchy necessary to concatenate dual-rail cavity qubits into a highly efficient erasure code. Dual-rail encodings of quantum information can be used to detect loss errors, allowing these errors to be treated as erasures. The measurement of dual-rail states with error detection has now been demonstrated in superconducting cavities.},

This is achieved by parametrically driving the qubit, which results in an effective two-phonon drive. In addition, we show that the resonator mode inherits a nonlinearity from the off-resonant coupling with the qubit, which can be tuned by controlling the detuning. We, thus, realize a mechanical squeezed Kerr oscillator, in which we demonstrate the preparation of non-Gaussian quantum states of motion with Wigner function negativities and high quantum Fisher information. This shows that our results can also have applications in quantum metrology and sensing. Mechanical modes promise applications in continuous-variable quantum information processing, but only if the final two elements—squeezing and nonlinearity—are achieved.

Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate the manipulation of objects in disordered and dynamic media by optimally tailoring the momentum of sound waves iteratively in the far field. The method does not require information about the object’s physical properties or the spatial structure of the surrounding medium but relies only on a real-time scattering matrix measurement and a positional guide-star. Our experiment demonstrates the possibility of optimally moving and rotating objects to extend the reach of wave-based object manipulation to complex and dynamic scattering media. We envision new opportunities for biomedical applications, sensing and manufacturing.

However, there are considerable challenges with these approaches related to power levels, control, energy efficiency and delays. Here we present a scheme for a neuromorphic system that relies on linear wave scattering and yet achieves nonlinear processing with high expressivity. The key idea is to encode the input in physical parameters that affect the scattering processes. Moreover, we show that gradients needed for training can be directly measured in scattering experiments. We propose an implementation using integrated photonics based on racetrack resonators, which achieves high connectivity with a minimal number of waveguide crossings. Our work introduces an easily implementable approach to neuromorphic computing that can be widely applied in existing state-of-the-art scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave and electrical circuits. As the energy consumption of neural networks continues to grow, different approaches to deep learning are needed.

It is therefore a major priority to develop simple and energy-efficient methods for generating high-fidelity entangled states. In the case of light, entanglement can be realized by interactions with matter but the required nonlinear interaction is often impractically weak. Here we show how a single two-level emitter deterministically coupled to light in a nanophotonic waveguide can be used to realize photonic quantum entanglement by excitation at the single-photon level. Efficient optical coupling enables mediation of two-photon interactions by the emitter, creating a strong nonlinearity that leads to entanglement. We experimentally verify energy–time entanglement by violating a Bell inequality in an interferometric measurement of the two-photon scattering response. The on-chip two-level emitter acts as a passive scatterer, so that no advanced spin control is required. As such, our method may provide a more efficient approach to synthesizing photonic entangled states for quantum simulators or metrology. A semiconductor quantum dot can passively mediate interactions between two photons, enabling the creation of entangled photon states.},

  abstract     = {Topological materials hosting metallic edges characterized by integer-quantized conductivity in an insulating bulk have revolutionized our understanding of transport in matter. The topological protection of these edge states is based on symmetries and dimensionality. While integer-dimensional effects on topological properties have been studied extensively, the interplay of topology and fractals, which may have a non-integer dimension, remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that topological edge and corner modes arise in fractals formed upon depositing thin layers of bismuth on an indium antimonide substrate. Our scanning tunnelling microscopy results and theoretical calculations reveal the appearance and stability of nearly zero-energy modes at the corners of Sierpiński triangles, as well as the formation of outer and inner edge modes at higher energies. This work opens the perspective to extend electronic device applications in real materials at non-integer dimensions with robust and protected topological states. The interplay between topology and fractals in real materials has remained challenging to study. Now, topological states are demonstrated in fractional-dimensional Sierpinski triangles made from bismuth.},

  abstract     = {Rhombohedral graphene multilayers provide a clean and highly reproducible platform to explore the emergence of superconductivity and magnetism in a strongly interacting electron system. Here we reveal a subtle competition between valley-imbalanced orbital ferromagnets and intervalley-coherent states in which electron wavefunctions in the two momentum-space valleys develop a macroscopically coherent relative phase. We focus on a rhombohedral trilayer in the quarter-metal regime—where there is a single Fermi surface that spontaneously breaks spin and valley-isospin symmetry—and employ local magnetometry and global charge sensing techniques. Comparing the in-plane spin susceptibility of the intervalley-coherent and valley-imbalanced phases reveals the influence of graphene’s intrinsic spin–orbit coupling, which drives the emergence of a distinct correlated phase that is their hybrid. Spin–orbit coupling also suppresses the in-plane magnetic susceptibility of the valley-imbalanced phase, allowing us to extract the spin–orbit-coupling strength of approximately 50 μeV for our hexagonal-boron-nitride-encapsulated graphene system. We discuss the implications of a finite spin–orbit coupling on the spin-triplet superconductors observed in both rhombohedral and twisted graphene multilayers. The role of electron–electron interactions in generating superconductivity in few-layer graphene remains controversial. Now, the observation of interaction-driven intervalley coherence may help to explain the Cooper pairing mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Geometric frustration occurs in a lattice system when not all the interactions can be satisfied simultaneously. The simplest example is antiferromagnetically coupled spins on a triangular lattice. Frustrated systems are characterized by having many nearly degenerate ground states, leading to non-trivial phases, such as spin ice and spin liquids. To date, most studies have looked at geometric frustration of spins whereas orbital geometric frustration has been much less explored. For electrons in twisted bilayer graphene, when the electronic bands are filled to a fraction with denominator 3, Coulomb interactions and the Wannier orbital shapes are predicted to strongly constrain spatial charge ordering, leading to geometrically frustrated ground states that produce a new class of correlated insulating states. Here we report the observation of dominant, denominator 3, fractional-filling, insulating states in large-angle twisted bilayer graphene. These states persist in magnetic fields and display magnetic ordering signatures and tripled unit cell reconstruction. These results are in agreement with a strong-coupling theory for symmetry-breaking in geometrically frustrated fractional states. Orbitally frustrated states have been predicted to occur in twisted bilayer graphene. Now these states have been observed for fractional filling of the electronic bands, and exhibit charge- and magnetically ordered phases.},

  abstract     = {The study of many-body quantum dynamics in strongly correlated systems is extremely challenging. To date, few numerical methods exist that are capable of simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of two-dimensional quantum systems, which is partly due to complexity theoretic obstructions. In this work, we present a technique able to overcome this obstacle, by combining continuous unitary flow techniques with the newly developed method of scrambling transforms. We overcome the assumption that approximately diagonalizing the Hamiltonian cannot lead to reliable predictions for relatively long times. Rather, we show that the method achieves good accuracy in both localized and delocalized phases and makes reliable predictions for a number of quantities including infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions. We complement our findings with rigorous incremental bounds on the truncation error. Our approach shows that, in practice, the exploration of intermediate-scale time evolution may be more feasible than is commonly assumed, challenging near-term quantum simulators. The complexity of a many-body quantum state grows exponentially with system size, hindering numerical studies. A unitary flow-based method now enables accurate estimates of long-term properties of one- and two-dimensional quantum systems.},

They form the backbone of the standard model of physics, provide a framework for understanding quantum materials and are of technological importance in helium dilution refrigerators. However, the description of their coupled thermodynamics and collective behaviour is challenging. Bose–Fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms provide a platform to investigate their properties in a highly controllable environment, where the species concentration and interaction strength can be tuned at will. Here we characterize the collective oscillations of spin-polarized fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose–Einstein condensate as a function of the interaction strength and temperature. For strong interactions, the Fermi gas perfectly mimics the superfluid hydrodynamic modes of the condensate, from low-energy quadrupole modes to high-order Faraday excitations. With an increasing number of bosonic thermal excitations, the dynamics of the impurities cross over from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional electron fluids. The complex interactions arising in mixtures of bosons and fermions make it hard to understand their coupled dynamics. The collective oscillations of fermions embedded in a boson condensate have now been characterized in an ultracold-atom experiment.},

  abstract     = {The notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been well established to characterize classical and quantum phase transitions of matter, such as condensation, crystallization or quantum magnetism. Generalizations of this paradigm to the time dimension can lead to a time crystal phase, which spontaneously breaks the time-translation symmetry of the system. Although the existence of a continuous time crystal at equilibrium has been challenged by no-go theorems, this difficulty can be circumvented by dissipation in an open system. Here we report the experimental observation of such a dissipative time-crystalline order in a room-temperature atomic gas, where ground-state atoms are continuously driven to Rydberg states. The emergent time crystal is revealed by persistent oscillations of the photon transmission, and we show that the observed limit cycles arise from the coexistence and competition between distinct Rydberg components. The non-decaying autocorrelation of the oscillation, together with the robustness against temporal noises, indicates the establishment of true long-range temporal order and demonstrates the realization of a continuous time crystal. The observation of continuous time crystals has been hindered by atom loss in the ultracold regime. Long-range time-crystalline order has now been demonstrated in a dissipative Rydberg gas at room temperature.},

In recent years, near-field microscopy of terahertz fields has emerged as an important tool for experiments involving phononic and electronic phenomena, rich spatiotemporal dynamics and highly nonlinear processes. Building on this foundation, this Perspective elucidates the transformative opportunities provided by terahertz near-field microscopy to probe ultrafast phase transitions, helping to tackle previously inaccessible challenges of condensed matter physics. Laser-driven phase transitions in many systems are accompanied by the generation of terahertz pulses with spatiotemporal features governed by the complex physics underlying the phase transition. The characterization of these emitted pulses using terahertz near-field microscopy techniques could therefore support the investigation of ultrafast phase transition dynamics. This approach could, for example, allow the observation of ultrafast topological transitions in quantum materials, showcasing its ability to clarify the dynamic processes underlying phase changes. Optical near-field microscopy has facilitated our understanding of nanophotonics.

  abstract     = {In complex systems, external parameters often determine the phase in which the system operates, that is, its macroscopic behaviour. For nearly a century, statistical physics has been used to extensively study systems’ transitions across phases, (universal) critical exponents and related dynamical properties. Here we consider the functionality of systems, particularly operations in socio-technical ones, production in economic ones and, more generally, any schedule-based system, where timing is of crucial importance. We introduce a stylized model of delay propagation on temporal networks, where the magnitude of the delay-mitigating buffer acts as a control parameter. The model exhibits timeliness criticality, a novel form of critical behaviour. We characterize fluctuations near criticality, commonly referred to as avalanches, and identify the corresponding critical exponents. The model exhibits timeliness criticality also when run on real-world temporal systems such as production networks. Additionally, we explore potential connections with the mode-coupling theory of glasses, depinning transition and directed polymer problem. Timeliness is a crucial property for the optimal functioning of socio-technical systems where delays can propagate. Now it is shown that a stylized model of delay propagation on temporal networks shows a phase transition that can trigger avalanches.},

  abstract     = {Frontogenesis is the process by which fronts, separating fluids of different temperatures, are generated in the terrestrial atmosphere and oceans. It is of interest to consider whether this process appears in other planetary atmospheres. Here we analyse infra-red images taken by the Juno spacecraft at the Jovian poles and reveal ubiquitous vortices with a diameter of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and filaments with a width of tens of kilometres embedded in between the vortices. Our analysis shows that the filaments are dynamically active, reminiscent of terrestrial frontogenesis. Furthermore, our results indicate that Jovian frontogenesis acts in concert with moist convection, with the former mechanism favouring the development of cyclones and the latter the development of anti-cyclones. Even though moist convection is the main driver, frontogenesis accounts for a quarter of the total transfer of potential to kinetic energy, enhancing the upscale transfer of energy to larger vortices. Frontogenesis contributes 40% to the vertical heat transport, efficiently redistributing heat from Jupiter’s interior to its tropopause. This study highlights the broad range of interacting scales from tens to thousands of kilometres and the diverse physical mechanisms active at Jovian high latitudes. An analysis of images from the Juno spacecraft reveals dynamics at high latitudes that are reminiscent of the generation of frontal structures in Earth’s atmosphere and oceans.},

  abstract     = {The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has defied detailed understanding ever since the first observations of the spatially heterogeneous nature of the transition. Recent theoretical studies and experiments in simpler, shear-driven flows suggest that the onset of turbulence is a directed-percolation non-equilibrium phase transition, but whether these findings are generic and also apply to open or pressure-driven flows is unknown. In pipe flow, the extremely long time scales near the transition make direct observations of critical behaviour virtually impossible. Here we find a technical solution to that limitation and show that the universality class of the transition is directed percolation, from which a jammed phase of puffs emerges above the critical point. Our method is to experimentally characterize all pairwise interactions between localized patches of turbulence puffs and use these interactions as input for renormalization group and computer simulations of minimal models that extrapolate to long length and time scales. The strong interactions in the jamming regime enable us to explicitly measure the turbulent fraction and confirm model predictions. Our work shows that directed-percolation scaling applies beyond simple closed shear flows and underscores how statistical mechanics can lead to profound, quantitative and predictive insights on turbulent flows and their phases. The nature of turbulence that occurs when fluids flow in a pipe is still controversial. Now the onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been shown to be a directed-percolation phase transition.},

  abstract     = {The ability to survive starvation is an integral part of bacterial fitness and determines composition, turnover and biodiversity in microbial ecosystems. Starving bacteria enter a state known as plasmolysis in which their cytoplasm contracts from the cell wall. Plasmolysis is often thought to be a pathological, passive condition, arising automatically from the lack of ATP. Here we show that contrary to this notion, maintaining plasmolysis is an active, ATP-consuming state that is essential for starvation survival. We show that ion homeostasis to maintain plasmolysis consumes the largest part of the energy budget of starving cells and directly determines death rates in starvation. Our mathematical model accurately predicts death rates for various starvation conditions and perturbations. This enabled the development of an optimized starvation medium that would be ideally suited for preserving and transplanting natural microbial communities by maintaining viability but preventing outgrowth of a subset of the species. When bacteria starve, their cytoplasm detaches from the cell wall. A model now shows that this process determines bacterial death rates and can be controlled to keep bacteria viable in a starved state.},

  abstract     = {Directed collective cell migration is central to morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression. Although the molecular anisotropy of the microenvironment guides this migration, its impact on cell flow patterns remains unexplored. Here we show that subcellular microgrooves elicit a polar mode of collective migration in bidirectional lanes, whose widths reach hundreds of micrometres. This directed form of flocking is observed in vitro with a confluent monolayer of human bronchial epithelial cells whose dynamics is chaotic on featureless substrates. A hydrodynamic theory of active polar fluids and corresponding numerical simulations account for this disorder-to-laning transition and further predict that anisotropic friction associated with the grooves lowers the transition threshold, which we confirm experimentally. Therefore, the microscopic anisotropy of the environment both directs collective cell motion along the substrate easy axis and shapes cell migration patterns. The flow patterns induced by this collective contact guidance are different from those resulting from supracellular confinement, demonstrating that collective migration is impacted by the different length scales of the microenvironment. Our findings offer a strategy for directing cells to specific geometries and functions in tissue engineering applications such as organoid morphogenesis. Supracellular cues play a key role in directing collective cell migration in processes such as wound healing and cancer invasion. New findings emphasize the importance of all length scales of the microenvironment in shaping cell migration patterns.},

  abstract     = {The formation of holes in epithelial tissue is essential for development, but it can also be associated with epithelial barrier dysfunction and cancer progression. Here we show that active cell contraction in epithelioid monolayer tissues derived from human embryonic stem cells can spontaneously launch a morphological transition cascade consisting of hole nucleation, coalescence and network formation. Accumulated tissue-level tensile stresses drive hole expansion from isotropic round expansion to local fracture of intercellular junctions. This is followed by fast crack propagation, which is later suppressed by the self-organized supracellular actomyosin ring and accompanied by crack blunting and a fracture-to-rounding transition. During hole coalescence, we find a fracture–slip mechanism that enables layer-by-layer breaking of the multicellular bridge but without inducing excessive cell deformation. Our multiscale theory captures these experimental observations and predicts that substrate rigidity sensing and adhesion of cells compete with cellular contraction to mediate the morphological dynamics. These findings suggest that living tissues may coordinate the mechanics across molecular, cellular and tissue scales to drive topological changes while reducing the risk of mechanical damage to cells. Active cell contraction drives hole nucleation, fracture and crack propagation in a tissue monolayer through a process reminiscent of dewetting thin films.},

Conventional bulk topological invariants are insufficient to predict the existence of topological edge modes in such systems. Although ultracold atoms provide excellent settings for clean realizations of Floquet protocols, the observation of real-space edge modes has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate an experimental protocol for realizing chiral edge modes in optical lattices through the periodic modulation of the tunnelling rate between neighbouring sites. In particular, we show how to efficiently prepare particles in edge modes in three distinct Floquet topological regimes in a periodically driven honeycomb lattice. Controlling the height and amplitude of the potential step, we characterize the emergence of edge modes and the dependence of their group velocity on the sharpness of the potential step. Our direct observation of topological edge modes provides a tool to study topological phases of matter in the presence of disorder and interactions, where conventional bulk observables are not applicable. The observation of edge modes in topological systems is challenging because precise control over the sample and occupied states is required. An experiment with atoms in a driven lattice now shows how edge modes with programmable potentials can be realized.},

The nature and frequency of errors depends on the quantum computing platform, and although there is a large literature on qubit-based coding, these are often not directly applicable to devices that store information in bosonic systems such as photonic resonators. Here, we introduce a framework for constructing quantum codes defined on spheres by recasting such codes as quantum analogues of the classical spherical codes. We apply this framework to bosonic coding, and we obtain multimode extensions of the cat codes that can outperform previous constructions but require a similar type of overhead. Our polytope-based cat codes consist of sets of points with large separation that, at the same time, form averaging sets known as spherical designs. We also recast concatenations of Calderbank–Shor–Steane codes with cat codes as quantum spherical codes, which establishes a method to autonomously protect against dephasing noise. Many recent experiments have stored quantum information in bosonic modes, such as photons in resonators or optical fibres. Now an adaptation of the classical spherical codes provides a framework for designing quantum error correcting codes for these platforms.},

In all these fields, the central aim is to gather as much information as possible about an object of interest by sending a probing wave at it and processing the information delivered back to a detector. Here we demonstrate that an electromagnetic wave scattered at an object carries locally defined and conserved information about all of the object’s constitutive parameters. Specifically, we introduce the density and flux of Fisher information for general types of wave fields and identify the corresponding sources and sinks of information through which all these new quantities satisfy a fundamental continuity equation. We experimentally verify our theoretical predictions by studying a movable object embedded in a disordered environment and by measuring the corresponding Fisher information flux at microwave frequencies. Our results improve the understanding of the generation and propagation of information and open up possibilities for tracking and designing the flow of information even in complex environments. Remote detection protocols use waves scattering off a target, but a formal description of how waves acquire and transmit information about objects has been lacking. The density and flux of Fisher information now provide a way to understand this process.},

  abstract     = {Many of the applications of graphene rely on its uneven stiffness and high thermal conductivity, but the mechanical properties of graphene—and, in general, of all two-dimensional materials—are still not fully understood. Harmonic theory predicts a quadratic dispersion for the out-of-plane flexural acoustic vibrational mode, which leads to the unphysical result that long-wavelength in-plane acoustic modes decay before vibrating for one period, preventing the propagation of sound. The robustness of quadratic dispersion has been questioned by arguing that the anharmonic phonon–phonon interaction linearizes it. However, this implies a divergent bending rigidity in the long-wavelength regime. Here we show that rotational invariance protects the quadratic flexural dispersion against phonon–phonon interactions, and consequently, the bending stiffness is non-divergent irrespective of the temperature. By including non-perturbative anharmonic effects in our calculations, we find that sound propagation coexists with a quadratic dispersion. We also show that the temperature dependence of the height fluctuations of the membrane, known as ripples, is fully determined by thermal or quantum fluctuations, but without the anharmonic suppression of their amplitude previously assumed. These conclusions should hold for all two-dimensional materials. The mechanism by which two-dimensional materials remain stable at a finite temperature is still under debate. Now, numerical calculations suggest that rotational symmetry is crucial in suppressing anharmonic effects that lead to structural instability.},

  abstract     = {The quantum fluctuation-induced Casimir force can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the dielectric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities of the materials involved. However, it is challenging to manipulate the dielectric permittivities of most materials using external fields. In contrast, the magnetic permeabilities of ferrofluids can be readily tuned by magnetic fields, which opens up the possibility of magnetic-field tuning of the Casimir force. Here, we demonstrate that this tuning can be achieved for a gold sphere and a silica plate immersed in water-based ferrofluids. Our theoretical calculations predict that, by varying the magnetic field, separation distance and ferrofluid volume fraction, the Casimir force can be tuned from attractive to repulsive over a wide range of parameters in this system. Experimentally, we develop a cantilever designed to conduct measurements within water-based ferrofluids. Using this setup, we observe the predicted transitions. These findings may lead to the development of switchable micromechanical devices based on the Casimir effect. The sign of the Casimir force depends on the electric permittivities and the magnetic permeabilities of the materials involved. For a gold sphere immersed in a ferrofluid, tuneability of the Casimir force by means of a magnetic field is now shown.},

  abstract     = {The Leidenfrost effect—the levitation and hovering of liquid droplets on hot solid surfaces—generally requires a sufficiently high substrate temperature to activate liquid vaporization. Here we report the modulation of Leidenfrost-like jumping of sessile water microdroplets on micropillared surfaces at a relatively low temperature. Compared to traditional Leidenfrost effect occurring above 230 °C, the fin-array-like micropillars enable water microdroplets to levitate and jump off the surface within milliseconds at a temperature of 130 °C by triggering the inertia-controlled growth of individual vapour bubbles at the droplet base. We demonstrate that droplet jumping, resulting from momentum interactions between the expanding vapour bubble and the droplet, can be modulated by tailoring of the thermal boundary layer thickness through pillar height. This enables regulation of the bubble expansion between the inertia-controlled mode and the heat-transfer-limited mode. The two bubble-growth modes give rise to distinct droplet jumping behaviours characterized by constant velocity and constant energy regimes, respectively. This heating strategy allows the straightforward purging of wetting liquid droplets on rough or structured surfaces in a controlled manner, with potential applications including the rapid removal of fouling media, even when located in surface cavities. The Leidenfrost effect—a droplet hovering on a hot surface due to vapour in between—requires a surface temperature of about 230 °C. Now a tailored microstructured surface is shown to enable quick hovering of water droplets at 130 °C.},

  abstract     = {Recent experimental observations have showed some signatures of superconductivity close to 80 K in La3Ni2O7 under pressure and have raised the hope of achieving high-temperature superconductivity in bulk nickelates. However, a zero-resistance state—a key characteristic of a superconductor—was not observed. Here we show that the zero-resistance state does exist in single crystals of La3Ni2O7−δ using a liquid pressure medium at up to 30 GPa. We also find that the system remains metallic under applied pressures, suggesting the absence of a metal–insulator transition proximate to the superconductivity. Moreover, analysis of the normal state T-linear resistance reveals a link between this strange-metal behaviour and superconductivity. The association between strange-metal behaviour and high-temperature superconductivity is very much in line with other classes of unconventional superconductors, including the cuprates and Fe-based superconductors. Further investigations exploring the interplay of strange-metal behaviour and superconductivity, as well as possible competing electronic or structural phases, are essential to understand the mechanism of superconductivity in this system. Some features resembling superconductivity at high temperature have been seen under pressure in La3Ni2O7, but a transition to a zero-resistance state has not been observed. Now transport studies demonstrate this transition, along with strange metallicity.},

Here, we devise a theory that incorporates the quantum geometry of the electron bands into the electron–phonon coupling, demonstrating the crucial contributions of the Fubini–Study metric or its orbital selective version to the dimensionless electron–phonon coupling constant. We apply the theory to two materials, that is, graphene and MgB2, where the geometric contributions account for approximately 50% and 90% of the total electron–phonon coupling constant, respectively. The quantum geometric contributions in the two systems are further bounded from below by topological contributions. Our results suggest that the non-trivial electron band geometry or topology might favour superconductivity with a relatively high critical temperature. Quantum geometry and electron–phonon coupling are two fundamental concepts in condensed matter physics that govern many correlated ground states. Now a generalized theory connects these two ideas.},

At a monolayer step edge, we demonstrate the presence of an in-gap boundary mode persisting up to the charge ordering temperature with modulations along the edge that match the charge density wave wavevector along the edge. Furthermore, these results manifesting the presence of an edge state challenge the existing axion insulator interpretation of the charge-ordered phase in this compound. Topological boundary modes within charge-ordered states have not yet been observed experimentally.

  abstract     = {The even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state at a filling factor of ν = 1/2 is an intriguing many-body phase in two-dimensional electron systems, as it appears in the ground state rather than an excited Landau level. It is observed in wide quantum wells where the electrons have a bilayer charge distribution with finite tunnelling between the layers. Whether this state takes an Abelian two-component form or a non-Abelian one-component form has been debated since its experimental discovery. Here we report the observation of the ν = 1/2 state that is flanked by numerous Jain-sequence composite fermion states at ν = p/(2p ± 1) up to ν = 8/17 and 9/17. As we raise the density, the ν = 1/2 state is strengthened, its energy gap increases up to 4 K and, at the same time, the 8/17 and 7/13 states abruptly become stronger than their neighbouring high-order fractions. The states at ν = 8/17 and 7/13 are the theoretically predicted, simplest daughter states of the one-component Pfaffian ν = 1/2 state. This means that our data suggest a topological phase transition of 8/17 and 7/13 states from the Jain-sequence states to the daughter states of the Pfaffian. The nature of the fractional quantum Hall state when the lowest Landau level is half-filled remains controversial. Now, the observation of a topological phase transition at related filling fractions suggests that the half-filled state is non-Abelian.},

Hybrid quantum-classical computing methods, such as variational quantum eigensolvers, have been designed as promising solutions to quantum chemistry problems. Nonetheless, challenges due to theoretical complexity and experimental imperfections hinder progress in achieving reliable and accurate results. Experimental works for solving electronic structures are consequently still restricted to non-scalable or classically simulable ansatz or limited to a few qubits with large errors. Here, we address the critical challenges associated with solving molecular electronic structures using noisy quantum processors. Our protocol presents improvements in the circuit depth and running time, key metrics for chemistry simulation. Through systematic hardware enhancements and the integration of error-mitigation techniques, we overcome theoretical and experimental limitations and successfully scale up the implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers with an optimized unitary coupled cluster ansatz to 12 qubits. We produce high-precision results of the ground-state energy for molecules with error suppression by around two orders of magnitude. Our work demonstrates a feasible path towards a scalable solution to electronic structure calculation. The application of quantum computing to computational chemistry faces various experimental and theoretical challenges.

  abstract     = {In quantum metrology and quantum simulation, a coherent non-classical state must be manipulated before unwanted interactions with the environment lead to decoherence. In atom interferometry, the non-classical state is a spatial superposition, where each atom coexists in multiple locations as a collection of phase-coherent partial wavepackets. These states enable precise measurements in fundamental physics and inertial sensing. However, atom interferometers usually use atomic fountains, where the available interrogation time is limited to around 3 s for a 10 m fountain. Here we realize an atom interferometer with a spatial superposition state that is maintained for as long as 70 s. We analyse the theoretical and experimental limits to coherence arising from collective dephasing of the atomic ensemble. This reveals that the decoherence rate slows down markedly at hold times that exceed tens of seconds. These gains in coherence may enable gravimetry measurements, searches for fifth forces or fundamental probes into the non-classical nature of gravity. Applications of atom interferometry require sufficiently long coherence times. Now, confining atoms in an optical lattice shows that the decoherence rate slows down markedly at hold times that exceed tens of seconds.},

However, achieving sufficiently high energy levels suitable for applications such as radiation therapy remains a challenge for laser-driven ion accelerators. Here we generate proton beams with a spectrally separated high-energy component of up to 150 MeV by irradiating solid-density plastic foil targets with ultrashort laser pulses from a repetitive petawatt laser. The preceding laser light heats the target, leading to the onset of relativistically induced transparency upon main pulse arrival. The laser peak then penetrates the initially opaque target and triggers proton acceleration through a cascade of different mechanisms, as revealed by three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The transparency of the target can be used to identify the high-performance domain, making it a suitable feedback parameter for automated laser and target optimization to enhance stability of plasma accelerators in the future. Laser-driven proton acceleration experiments achieve energies of up to 150 MeV with particle yields that are relevant for applications such as radiobiology.},

  abstract     = {Accurate estimates of the reproduction ratio are crucial for projecting the evolution of an infectious disease epidemic and for guiding the public health response. Here we prove that estimates of the reproduction ratio based on inference from surveillance data can be inaccurate if the population comprises spatially distinct communities, as the space–mobility interplay may hide the true evolution of the epidemic from surveillance data. Consequently, surveillance may underestimate the reproduction ratio over long periods, even mistaking growing epidemics as subsiding. To address this, we use the spectral properties of the matrix describing the spatial epidemic spread to reweight surveillance data. We propose a correction that removes the bias across all epidemic phases. We validate this correction against simulated epidemics and use COVID-19 as a case study. However, our results apply to any epidemic in which mobility is a driver of circulation. Our findings may help improve epidemic monitoring and surveillance and inform strategies for public health responses. Spatial dynamics can obscure epidemic trends from surveillance data, biasing reproduction ratio estimates over long periods. A spectral correction reweights incidence data to remove this bias, thus improving monitoring to inform response strategies.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical interactions between cells play a fundamental role in the self-organization of organisms. How these interactions drive coordinated cell movement in three dimensions remains unclear. Here we report that cell doublets embedded in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix undergo spontaneous rotations. We investigate the rotation mechanism and find that it is driven by a polarized distribution of myosin within cell cortices. The mismatched orientation of this polarized distribution breaks the doublet mirror symmetry. In addition, cells adhere at their interface through adherens junctions and with the extracellular matrix through focal contacts near myosin clusters. We use a physical theory describing the doublet as two interacting active surfaces to show that rotation is driven by myosin-generated gradients of active tension whose profiles are dictated by interacting cell polarity axes. We also show that three-dimensional shape symmetries are related to broken symmetries of the myosin distribution in cortices. To test for the rotation mechanism, we suppress myosin clusters using laser ablation and generate new myosin clusters by optogenetics. Our work clarifies how polarity-oriented active mechanical forces drive collective cell motion in three dimensions. Cells can form a rotating doublet. This rotation is driven by the symmetry breaking of myosin polarization in the cortices of the two cells.},

  abstract     = {The nuclear pore complex regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport by means of a tightly synchronized suite of biochemical reactions. The physicochemical properties of the translocating cargos are emerging as master regulators of their shuttling dynamics. As well as being affected by molecular weight and surface-exposed amino acids, the kinetics of the nuclear translocation of protein cargos also depend on their nanomechanical properties, yet the mechanisms underpinning the mechanoselectivity of the nuclear pore complex are unclear. Here we show that proteins with locally soft regions in the vicinity of the nuclear-localization sequence exhibit higher nuclear-import rates, and that such mechanoselectivity is specifically impaired upon knocking down nucleoporin 153, a key protein in the nuclear pore complex. This allows us to design a short, easy-to-express and chemically inert unstructured peptide tag that accelerates the nuclear-import rate of stiff protein cargos. We also show that U2OS osteosarcoma cells expressing the peptide-tagged myocardin-related transcription factor import this mechanosensitive protein to the nucleus at higher rates and display faster motility. Locally unstructured regions lower the free-energy barrier of protein translocation and might offer a control mechanism for nuclear mechanotransduction. Protein transport across the nuclear membrane is regulated by the nuclear pore complex. Experiments now show that the rates of nuclear transport rely on the presence of locally mechanically soft regions of the transported proteins.},

  abstract     = {Glasses and gels, common amorphous solids with diverse applications, share intriguing similarities, including rigidity without translational order and dynamic slowing during ageing. However, their various underlying differences have not yet been explained. Here, through simulations, we elucidate distinct elastic properties related to temperature, observation times and ageing in glasses and gels, uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Configurational constraints, characterized by vibrational mean-squared displacements, similarly impact shear and bulk moduli in gels, but uniquely affect the shear modulus in glasses. As glasses age, a persistent trend of stiffening emerges, in contrast to gels, which initially stiffen and subsequently soften. We attribute these differences to mechanisms minimizing free energy: structural ordering in glasses and interface reduction in gels. Our findings not only reveal distinct behaviours but also shed light on the origin and evolution of elasticity in non-equilibrium disordered solids, with implications for amorphous material application and design. As amorphous solids, glasses and gels are similar, but the origins of their different elastic properties are unclear. Simulations now suggest differing free-energy-minimizing pathways: structural ordering for glasses and interface reduction for gels.},

  abstract     = {As first demonstrated by the characterization of the quantum Hall effect by the Chern number, topology provides a guiding principle to realize the robust properties of condensed-matter systems immune to the existence of disorder. The bulk–boundary correspondence guarantees the emergence of gapless boundary modes in a topological system whose bulk exhibits non-zero topological invariants. Although some recent studies have suggested a possible extension of the notion of topology to nonlinear systems, the nonlinear counterpart of a topological invariant has not yet been understood. Here we propose a nonlinear extension of the Chern number based on the nonlinear eigenvalue problems in two-dimensional systems and show the existence of bulk–boundary correspondence beyond the weakly nonlinear regime. Specifically, we find nonlinearity-induced topological phase transitions, in which the existence of topological edge modes depends on the amplitude of oscillatory modes. We propose and analyse a minimal model of a nonlinear Chern insulator whose exact bulk solutions are analytically obtained. The model exhibits the amplitude dependence of the nonlinear Chern number, for which we confirm the nonlinear extension of the bulk–boundary correspondence. Thus, our result reveals the existence of genuinely nonlinear topological phases that are adiabatically disconnected from the linear regime. Linear topological systems can be characterized using invariants such as the Chern number. This concept can be extended to the nonlinear regime, giving rise to nonlinearity-induced topological phase transitions.},

  abstract     = {Andreev spin qubits have recently emerged as an alternative qubit platform with realizations in semiconductor–superconductor hybrid nanowires. In these qubits, the spin degree of freedom of a quasiparticle trapped in a Josephson junction is intrinsically spin–orbit coupled to the supercurrent across the junction. This interaction has previously been used to perform spin readout, but it has also been predicted to facilitate inductive multi-qubit coupling. Here we demonstrate a strong supercurrent-mediated longitudinal coupling between two distant Andreev spin qubits. We show that it is both gate- and flux-tunable into the strong coupling regime and, furthermore, that magnetic flux can be used to switch off the coupling in situ. Our results demonstrate that integrating microscopic spin states into a superconducting qubit architecture can combine the advantages of both semiconductors and superconducting circuits and pave the way to fast two-qubit gates between distant spins. The hybrid architecture of Andreev spin qubits made using semiconductor–superconductor nanowires means that supercurrents can be used to inductively couple qubits over long distances.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor spin qubits offer the potential to employ industrial transistor technology to produce large-scale quantum computers. Silicon hole spin qubits benefit from fast all-electrical qubit control and sweet spots to counteract charge and nuclear spin noise. However, the demonstration of a two-qubit interaction has remained an open challenge. One missing factor is an understanding of the exchange coupling in the presence of a strong spin–orbit interaction. Here we study two hole-spin qubits in a silicon fin field-effect transistor, the workhorse device of today’s semiconductor industry. We demonstrate electrical tunability of the exchange splitting from above 500 MHz to close-to-off and perform a conditional spin-flip in 24 ns. The exchange is anisotropic because of the spin–orbit interaction. Upon tunnelling from one quantum dot to the other, the spin is rotated by almost 180 degrees. The exchange Hamiltonian no longer has the Heisenberg form and can be engineered such that it enables two-qubit controlled rotation gates without a trade-off between speed and fidelity. This ideal behaviour applies over a wide range of magnetic field orientations, rendering the concept robust with respect to variations from qubit to qubit, indicating that it is a suitable approach for realizing a large-scale quantum computer. A successful silicon spin qubit design should be rapidly scalable by benefiting from industrial transistor technology. This investigation of exchange interactions between two FinFET qubits provides a guide to implementing two-qubit gates for hole spins.},

So far, the most reliable way to detect the existence of skyrmions is by using the topological Hall effect, which stems from electron scattering by the emergent magnetic field manifesting the topological charge. Here we employ two-dimensional magnets to establish a magneto-optical hallmark of skyrmions, which we call the topological Kerr effect, using the recently discovered ferromagnet CrVI6 as a material platform. The Kerr angle hysteresis loop of this non-centrosymmetric system exhibits two antisymmetric bumps that are absent in the centrosymmetric CrI3 and VI3. We develop a minimal model to further identify the bumps as direct manifestations of the topological charge, thereby providing a magneto-optical fingerprint of skyrmions with broader applicability. The ferromagnet CrVI6 serves as a material platform to demonstrate the topological Kerr effect in two-dimensional magnets. This can be used to identify skyrmions by magneto-optical means.},

Traditional methods of creating frequency combs hinge on material nonlinearities, which are often weak. These methods require high power densities to surpass their initiation thresholds, subsequently limiting their potential use. Here we demonstrate a nonlinear coupling process that efficiently generates magnonic frequency combs by exploiting exceptional points in a coupled system of two different magnon modes. Our approach is a simple and optimal path to produce magnonic frequency combs at low pump power with excellent tunability of exceptional points. Frequency combs, which are important for applications in precision spectroscopy, depend on material nonlinearities for their function, which can be hard to engineer. Now an approach combining magnons and exceptional points is shown to be effective.},

  abstract     = {Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) is a quantum phenomenon in which a macroscopic number of bosons occupy the lowest energy state and acquire coherence at low temperatures. In three-dimensional antiferromagnets, a magnetic-field-induced transition has been successfully described as a magnon BEC. For a strictly two-dimensional (2D) system, it is known that BEC cannot take place due to the presence of a finite density of states at zero energy. However, in a realistic quasi-2D magnet consisting of stacked magnetic layers, a small but finite interlayer coupling stabilizes marginal BEC but such that 2D physics is still expected to dominate. This 2D-limit BEC behaviour has been reported in a few materials but only at very high magnetic fields that are difficult to access. The honeycomb S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbCl3 exhibits a transition to a fully polarized state at a relatively low in-plane magnetic field. Here, we demonstrate the formation of a quantum critical 2D Bose gas at the transition field, which, with lowering the field, experiences a BEC marginally stabilized by an extremely small interlayer coupling. Our observations establish YbCl3, previously a Kitaev quantum spin liquid material, as a realization of a quantum critical BEC in the 2D limit. Some magnetic phase transitions can be understood as Bose–Einstein condensation of magnons. Close to a quantum critical point, YbCl3 now provides a realization of a Bose–Einstein condensate that is dominated by two-dimensional physical behaviour.},

UTe2 has previously been inferred to have a multi-component order parameter, in part due to the apparent presence of a two-step superconducting transition in some samples. However, recent experimental observations in newer-generation samples have raised questions about this interpretation, pointing to the need for a direct probe of the order parameter symmetry. Here we use pulse-echo ultrasound to measure the elastic moduli of UTe2 in samples that exhibit both one and two superconducting transitions. We demonstrate the absence of thermodynamic discontinuities in the shear elastic moduli of both single- and double-transition samples, providing direct evidence that UTe2 has a single-component superconducting order parameter. We further show that superconductivity is highly sensitive to compression strain along the a and c axes but insensitive to strain along the b axis. This leads us to suggest a single-component, odd-parity order parameter—specifically the B2u order parameter—as most compatible with our data. The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in UTe2 is still debated. Now ultrasound experiments suggest that the order parameter can only have one component.},

  abstract     = {Experiments have shown that several materials, including MgB2, iron-based superconductors and monolayer NbSe2, are multiband superconductors. Superconducting pairing in multiple bands can give rise to phenomena not available in a single band, including Leggett modes. A Leggett mode is the collective periodic oscillation of the relative phase between the phases of the superconducting condensates formed in the different bands. The experimental observation of Leggett modes is challenging because multiband superconductors are rare and because these modes describe charge fluctuations between bands and therefore are hard to probe directly. Also, the excitation energy of a Leggett mode is often larger than the superconducting gaps, and therefore they are strongly overdamped via relaxation processes into the quasiparticle continuum. Here, we show that Leggett modes and their frequency can be detected in a.c. driven superconducting quantum interference devices. We then use the results to analyse the measurements of such a quantum device, one based on a Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, in which superconductivity is induced by proximity to superconducting Al. These results show the theoretically predicted signatures of Leggett modes, and therefore we conclude that a Leggett mode is present in the two-band superconducting state of Cd3As2. Leggett modes can occur when superconductivity arises in more than one band in a material and represent oscillation of the relative phases of the two superconducting condensates. Now, this mode is observed in Cd3As2, a Dirac semimetal.},

Here, we discover a colossal orbital Zeeman effect of topological origin in a bilayer kagome metal, TbV6Sn6. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy, we reveal that the magnetic field leads to a splitting of the gapped Dirac dispersion into two branches with enhanced momentum-dependent g factors, resulting in a substantial renormalization of the Dirac band. These measurements provide a direct observation of a magnetic field-controlled orbital Zeeman coupling to the orbital magnetic moments of up to 200 Bohr magnetons near the gapped Dirac points. Our work provides direct insight into the momentum-dependent nature of topological orbital moments and their tunability via the magnetic field, concomitant with the evolution of the spin Berry curvature. These results can be extended to explore large orbital magnetic moments driven by the Berry curvature governed by other quantum numbers beyond spin, such as the valley in certain graphene-based structures. Controlling orbital magnetic moments for applications can be difficult. Now local probes of a kagome material, TbV6Sn6, demonstrate how the spin Berry curvature can produce a large orbital Zeeman effect that can be tuned with a magnetic field.},

For example, electrons with a Dirac dispersion have been intensively studied in electronic systems such as graphene and topological insulators. However, charge is not a prerequisite for Dirac fermions, and the emergence of Dirac fermions without a charge degree of freedom has been theoretically predicted to be realized in Dirac quantum spin liquids. These quasiparticles carry a spin of 1/2 but are charge-neutral and so are called spinons. Here we show that the spin excitations of a kagome antiferromagnet, YCu3(OD)6Br2[Br0.33(OD)0.67], are conical with a spin continuum inside, which is consistent with the convolution of two Dirac spinons. The predictions of a Dirac spin liquid model with a spinon velocity obtained from spectral measurements are in agreement with the low-temperature specific heat of the sample. Our results, thus, provide spectral evidence for a Dirac quantum spin liquid state emerging in this kagome lattice antiferromagnet. However, the locations of the conical spin excitations differ from those calculated by the nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model, suggesting the Dirac spinons have an unexpected origin. A Dirac quantum spin liquid phase is predicted to have a continuum of fractionalized spinon excitations with a Dirac cone dispersion. A spin continuum consistent with this picture has now been observed in neutron scattering measurements.},

  abstract     = {The nature of particle and entropy flow between two superfluids is often understood in terms of reversible flow carried by an entropy-free, macroscopic wavefunction. While this wavefunction is responsible for many intriguing properties of superfluids and superconductors, its interplay with excitations in non-equilibrium situations is less understood. Here we observe large concurrent flows of both particles and entropy through a ballistic channel connecting two strongly interacting fermionic superfluids. Both currents respond nonlinearly to chemical potential and temperature biases. We find that the entropy transported per particle is much larger than the prediction of superfluid hydrodynamics in the linear regime and largely independent of changes in the channel’s geometry. By contrast, the timescales of advective and diffusive entropy transport vary significantly with the channel geometry. In our setting, superfluidity counterintuitively increases the speed of entropy transport. Moreover, we develop a phenomenological model describing the nonlinear dynamics within the framework of generalized gradient dynamics. Our approach for measuring entropy currents may help elucidate mechanisms of heat transfer in superfluids and superconducting devices. Connecting two superfluid reservoirs leads to both particle and entropy flow between the systems. Now, a direct measurement of the entropy current and production in ultracold quantum gases reveals how superfluidity enhances entropy transport.},

  abstract     = {Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes can achieve high encoding rates and good code distance scaling, potentially enabling low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, implementing qLDPC codes involves nonlocal operations that require long-range connectivity between qubits. This makes their physical realization challenging in comparison to geometrically local codes, such as the surface code. Here we propose a hardware-efficient scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation with high-rate qLDPC codes that is compatible with the recently demonstrated capabilities of reconfigurable atom arrays. Our approach utilizes the product structure inherent in many qLDPC codes to implement the nonlocal syndrome extraction circuit through atom rearrangement, resulting in an effectively constant overhead. We prove the fault tolerance of these protocols, and our simulations show that the qLDPC-based architecture starts to outperform the surface code with as few as several hundred physical qubits. We further find that quantum algorithms involving thousands of logical qubits can be performed using less than 105 physical qubits. Our work suggests that low-overhead quantum computing with qLDPC codes is within reach using current experimental technologies. Quantum low-density parity-check codes are highly efficient in principle but challenging to implement in practice. This proposal shows that these codes could be implemented in the near term using recently demonstrated neutral-atom arrays.},

  abstract     = {Charge conservation and the Pauli exclusion principle result from fundamental symmetries in the standard model of particle physics, and are typically taken as axiomatic. High-precision tests for small violations of these symmetries could point to new physics. Here we consider three models for violation of these processes, which would produce detectable ionization in the high-purity germanium detectors of the Majorana Demonstrator experiment. Using a 37.5 kg yr exposure, we report a lower limit on the electron mean lifetime, improving the previous best limit for the $$e\to {\nu }_{e}\overline{{\nu }_{e}}{\nu }_{e}$$ decay channel by more than an order of magnitude. We also present searches for two types of violation of the Pauli exclusion principle, setting limits on the probability of an electron to be found in a symmetric quantum state. The Majorana Demonstrator experiment reports searches for the violation of the Pauli exclusion principle and of charge conservation. In the absence of a signal, exclusion limits for these processes are reported.},

  abstract     = {The recent rise of plasmonic materials for solar-to-chemical energy conversion places a focus on the mechanisms associated with charge and energy flow at the metal–molecule interface. Understanding the connection between these effects and their roles in the plasmonic excitations of adsorbed molecules has been challenging. In this Review, we strive to provide a general framework—based on the concept of electron scattering—that encompasses the most important effects at the plasmonic metal–molecule interface. First we use the model of adsorbate-induced surface resistivity to understand the chemical specificity of the electron scattering process. We then analyse two of the most prominent effects in plasmonics through the lens of the electron scattering model: chemical interface damping and the chemical model of surface-enhanced Raman scattering. We show how most metal–adsorbate charge- or energy-transfer interactions can be mapped into two major classes—electron scattering through molecular resonances and direct non-resonant electron scattering. Plasmonic excitations can enhance the interaction between a metal and molecules adsorbed onto its surface. This Review summarizes the different effects involved in this process and places them into a framework based on electron scattering.},

  abstract     = {The behaviour of a system is determined by its Hamiltonian. In many cases, the exact Hamiltonian is not known and has to be extracted by analysing the outcome of measurements. We study the problem of learning a local Hamiltonian H to a given precision, supposing either we are given copies of its Gibbs state ρ = e−βH/Tr(e−βH) at a known inverse temperature β or we have access to unitary real-time evolution e−itH for a known evolution time t. Improving on recent results, we show how to learn the coefficients of a local Hamiltonian H to error ε with S = O(logN/(βε)2) Gibbs states or with Q = O(logN/(tε)2) runs of the real-time evolution, where N is the number of qubits in the system and if β &amp;lt; βc and t &amp;lt; tc for some critical inverse temperature βc and critical evolution time tc. We design a classical post-processing algorithm with time complexity linear in the sample size in both cases, namely, O(NS) and O(NQ). In the Gibbs-state input case, we prove a matching lower bound, showing that our algorithm’s sample complexity is optimal, and hence, our time complexity is also optimal. Complexity of learning Hamiltonians from Gibbs states is an important issue for both many-body physics and machine learning. The optimal sample and time complexities of quantum Hamiltonian learning for high temperature has now been proven.},

However, entanglement is also fragile, and its potential advantages are hindered by decoherence effects in experiments. Here we experimentally realize entangled logical qubits with a bosonic quantum module by encoding quantum information into spatially separated microwave modes. The entanglement is protected by repetitive quantum error correction, which improves the coherence time of the entangled logical qubits compared with their unprotected counterparts by 45%. In addition, we demonstrate the violation of the Bell inequality by the purified entangled logical qubits via independent error detection and post-selection on each logical qubit, resulting in measured Bell signals that surpass the classical bound. The protected entangled logical qubits could be applied in future explorations of quantum foundations and applications of quantum networks. Despite being essential to many applications in quantum science, entanglement can be easily disrupted by decoherence. A protocol based on repetitive quantum error correction now demonstrates enhanced coherence times of entangled logical qubits.},

Spiral waves in multicellular organisms are often associated with essential living functions. Although certain eukaryotic microorganisms have long been known to generate spiral waves, evidence of spiral wave pattern has been lacking in the bacterial world. Here we report the discovery of a unique form of propagating spiral waves in dense bacterial populations where cells engage in cyclic force-generating processes driven by a grappling-hook-like motile organelle called type-IV pilus motor. Specifically, we discovered that synchronization of pilus activity in the bacterial living matter leads to large-scale spatiotemporal regulation of tension force in the form of propagating spiral waves. Theoretical modelling reveals that the spiral tension waves result from non-reciprocity in cell–cell interactions. Our findings reveal a mechanism of large-scale force regulation in bacterial world and may shed light on the emergent mechanics of biofilms and microbiomes. Pilus-driven bacterial living matter also provides a mechanical active medium for studying electrical or chemical spiral waves in living systems. The occurrence of propagating spiral waves in multicellular organisms is associated with key biological functions. Now this type of wave has also been observed in dense bacterial populations, probably resulting from non-reciprocal cell–cell interactions.},

  abstract     = {Brittle solids typically fail by growth and propagation of a crack from a surface flaw. This process is modelled using linear elastic fracture mechanics, which parameterizes the toughness of a material by the critical stress intensity factor, or the prefactor of the singular stress field. This widely used theory applies for cracks that are planar, but cracks typically are not planar, and instead are geometrically complex, violating core tenets of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Here we characterize the crack tip kinematics of complex crack fronts in three dimensions using optical microscopy of several transparent, brittle materials, including hydrogels of four different chemistries and an elastomer. We find that the critical strain energy required to drive the crack is directly proportional to the geodesic length of the crack, which makes the sample effectively tougher. The connection between crack front geometry and toughness has repercussions for the theoretical modelling of three-dimensional cracks, from engineering testing of materials to ab-initio development of novel materials, and highlights an important gap in the current theory for three-dimensional cracks. Experiments probing three-dimensional crack propagation show that the critical strain energy needed to drive a crack is directly proportional to its geodesic length. This insight is a step towards a fully three-dimensional theory of crack propagation.},

Controlling the transformation between different types of these quasiparticles is an important challenge. To date, these transitions have mostly been limited to a few non-centrosymmetric systems, where they are driven by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. Here we demonstrate multistep topological transitions among a variety of meron and skyrmion crystal states in a centrosymmetric magnet GdRu2Ge2. These are governed by the competition between Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida interactions at inequivalent wave vectors. These findings demonstrate that even a simple centrosymmetric magnet with competing interactions can be a promising material platform to realize a richer variety of magnetic quasiparticles with distinctive symmetry and topology, whose stability can be tuned by various external stimuli. Topological magnetic spin structures such as skyrmions and merons have the potential to be used in magnetic information devices. Now multistep transformations between such structures are demonstrated in a centrosymmetric material.},

However, despite frequent reports of various spin textures composed of magnetic dipoles, investigations on long-range ordered electric dipoles have been scarce, until recently. Here we discover spontaneous toroidal polar topology in an emerging ferroelectric liquid state with polarization helices, dubbed ‘helielectric nematic’. The interplay between liquid-crystal elasticity and polar interactions results in a continuous in-plane rotation of the polarization, producing a periodic toroidal assembly. In partial analogy with magnetism, the neighbouring toroidal domains are separated by circularly shaped domain walls. The local polarization switching enables unique shrinkage and expansion dynamics of the toroidal domains. The discovery provides opportunities for developing designable and switchable ferroelectric-liquid-matter opto-electronics. Exploring and exploiting electric dipole arrangements analogously to what is possible with magnetic spin textures is an emerging prospect. Now a spontaneous toroidal polar topology is observed in ferroelectric liquid crystals.},

Such a state can be induced by controlling the spin-splitting field in Josephson junction devices, allowing access to a wide range of the phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov state can be induced in Josephson junctions based on the two-dimensional dilute magnetic topological insulator (Hg,Mn)Te. We do this by observing the dependence of the critical current on the magnetic field and temperature. The substitution of Mn dopants induces an enhanced Zeeman effect, which can be controlled with high precision by using a small external magnetic field. We observe multiple re-entrant behaviours of the critical current as a response to an in-plane magnetic field, which we assign to transitions between ground states with a phase shifted by π. This will enable the study of the Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov state in much more accessible experimental conditions. Despite their potential device applications, experimental realizations of proximity-induced Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov states are rare. Now Josephson junctions based on a dilute magnetic topological insulator provide evidence of such a state.},

  abstract     = {Attaining viable thermoelectric cooling at cryogenic temperatures is of considerable fundamental and technological interest for electronics and quantum materials applications. In-device temperature control can provide more efficient and precise thermal environment management compared with conventional global cooling. The application of a current and perpendicular magnetic field gives rise to cooling by generating electron–hole pairs on one side of the sample and to heating due to their recombination on the opposite side, which is known as the Ettingshausen effect. Here we develop nanoscale cryogenic imaging of the magneto-thermoelectric effect and demonstrate absolute cooling and an Ettingshausen effect in exfoliated WTe2 Weyl semimetal flakes at liquid He temperatures. In contrast to bulk materials, the cooling is non-monotonic with respect to the magnetic field and device size. Our model of magneto-thermoelectricity in mesoscopic semimetal devices shows that the cooling efficiency and the induced temperature profiles are governed by the interplay between sample geometry, electron–hole recombination length, magnetic field, and flake and substrate heat conductivities. The observations open the way for the direct integration of microscopic thermoelectric cooling and for temperature landscape engineering in van der Waals devices. Cooling efficiency in thermoelectric devices decreases considerably at lower temperatures. Now thermoelectric cooling at cryogenic temperatures is directly imaged in a van der Waals semimetal.},

Here we demonstrate that ultrafast lasers can generate incoherent structural fluctuations that are more efficient for material control than coherent vibrations, extending optical control to a wide range of materials. We observe that local non-equilibrium lattice distortions generated by a weak laser pulse reduce the energy barrier to switch between insulating and metallic states in vanadium dioxide. Seeding inhomogeneous structural fluctuations presents an alternative, more energy-efficient, route for controlling materials that may be applicable to all solids, including those used in data- and energy-storage devices. Controlling phase transitions in solids is crucial for many applications. Ultrafast laser pulses have now been shown to enable the energy-efficient generation of structural fluctuations in VO2 by harnessing the correlated disorder in the material.},

Examples of topological defects include dislocations in charge density waves and vortices in a superconductor or pair density wave, where the latter is a condensate of Cooper pairs with finite momentum. Here we demonstrate the role of topological defects in the magnetic-field-induced disappearance of a charge density wave in the heavy-fermion superconductor UTe2. We reveal pairs of topological defects of the charge density wave with positive and negative phase winding. The pairs are directly correlated with zeros in the charge density wave amplitude and increase in number with increasing magnetic field. A magnetic field generates vortices of the superconducting and pair density wave orders that can create topological defects in the charge density wave and induce the experimentally observed melting of this charge order at the upper critical field. Our work reveals the important role of magnetic-field-generated topological defects in the melting of the charge density wave order parameter in UTe2 and provides support for the existence of a pair density wave order on the surface.

  abstract     = {The intimate connection between magnetism and superconducting pairing plays a central role in determining the occurrence of unconventional superconducting states. In particular, magnetism can cause a modulation of superconducting pairing in real space in both copper-based and iron-based materials. Exploring this effect can shed light on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. Here we report on the discovery of a spatially varying superconducting state residing at the interface between KTaO3 and ferromagnetic EuO. Electrical transport measurements reveal different values of the critical temperature and magnetic field at which the superconductivity breaks down when current is applied along the two orthogonal in-plane directions. This anisotropy occurs in low-carrier-density samples that are characterized by strong coupling between the Ta 5d and Eu 4f electrons, whereas in high-carrier-density samples, the coupling is weakened and the superconducting properties become isotropic. Our observations imply the emergence of superconducting stripes where phase coherence is established ahead of the rest of the interface, arising from a band-filling-dependent ferromagnetic proximity. Copper-based and iron-based compounds exhibit an interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. Now, this idea is extended to two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, where a spatially varying superconducting order is demonstrated at the EuO/KTaO3 interface.},

One prevalent form of topological state that can occur are Chern insulators that display a quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here we manipulate Chern domains in an interaction-driven quantum anomalous Hall insulator made from twisted monolayer–bilayer graphene and observe chiral interface states at the boundary between different domains. By tuning the carrier concentration, we stabilize neighbouring domains of opposite Chern number that then provide topological interfaces devoid of any structural boundaries. This allows the wavefunction of chiral interface states to be directly imaged using a scanning tunnelling microscope. Our theoretical analysis confirms the chiral nature of observed interface states and allows us to determine the characteristic length scale of valley polarization reversal across neighbouring Chern domains. The local electronic structure of interface states between topologically distinct domains is imaged and controlled, allowing visualization of the interplay between strong interactions and non-trivial topology.},

  abstract     = {Photon number distributions of classical and non-classical light sources have been studied extensively, yet their impact on photoemission processes is largely unexplored. In this article, we present measurements of electron number distributions from metal needle tips illuminated with ultrashort light pulses with various photon quantum statistics. By varying the photon statistics of the exciting light field between classical (Poissonian) and quantum (super-Poissonian), we demonstrate that the measured electron distributions are changed substantially. Using single-mode bright squeezed vacuum light, we measure extreme statistics events with up to 65 electrons from one light pulse at a mean of 0.27 electrons per pulse—the likelihood for such an event equals 10−128 with Poissonian statistics. By changing the number of modes of the exciting bright squeezed vacuum, we can tailor the electron number distribution on demand. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the photon statistics is imprinted from the driving light to the emitted electrons, opening the door to new sensor devices and to strong-field optics with quantum light and electrons. Photoemission experiments demonstrate that the photon number statistics of the exciting light can be imprinted on the emitted electrons, allowing the controlled generation of classical or non-classical electron number statistics of free electrons.},

  abstract     = {At the interface between two fluid layers in relative motion, infinitesimal fluctuations can be exponentially amplified, inducing vorticity and the breakdown of laminar flow. While shear flow instabilities in classical fluids have been extensively observed in various contexts, controlled experiments in the presence of quantized circulation are quite rare. Here we observe how the contact interface between two counter-rotating atomic superflows develops into an ordered circular array of quantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into vortex clusters. We extract the instability growth rates and find that they obey the same scaling relations across different superfluid regimes, ranging from weakly interacting bosonic to strongly correlated fermionic pair condensates. Our results establish connections between vortex arrays and shear flow instabilities, suggesting a possible interpretation of the observed quantized vortex dynamics as a manifestation of the underlying unstable flow. Moreover, they open the way for exploring out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as vortex matter phase transitions and the spontaneous emergence and decay of two-dimensional quantum turbulence. Two adjacent layers flowing at different velocities in the same fluid are subject to flow instabilities. This phenomenon is now studied in atomic superfluids, revealing that quantized vortices act as both sources and probes of the unstable flow.},

This is particularly evident in quantum systems, where interactions and fluctuations are enhanced in lower dimensions, leading to various different quantum effects. Here we show that strongly interacting ultracold bosons perceive their dimensionality as either one or two, depending on whether they are probed on short or long distances, respectively. We probe this dimensional crossover using a thorough analysis of the momentum distribution to study the characteristic decay of the one-body correlation function in the two dimensionalities and track how the decay is modified during the crossover. We find a varying two-slope structure, which substantiates the main result. These observations demonstrate how quantum properties in the strongly correlated regime evolve in the dimensional crossover as a result of the interplay between dimensionality, interactions and temperature. Quantum systems exhibit vastly different properties depending on their dimensionality. An experimental study with ultracold bosons now tracks quantum correlation properties during the crossover from two dimensions to one dimension.},

  abstract     = {The motion of systems with linear restoring forces and recurring nonlinear perturbations is of central importance in physics. When a system’s natural oscillation frequencies and the frequency of the nonlinear restoring forces satisfy certain algebraic relations, the dynamics become resonant. In accelerator physics, an understanding of resonances and nonlinear dynamics is crucial for avoiding the loss of beam particles. Here we confirm the theoretical prediction of the dynamics for a single two-dimensional coupled resonance by observing so-called fixed lines. Specifically, we use the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron to measure the position of a particle beam at discrete locations around the accelerator. These measurements allow us to construct the Poincaré surface of section, which captures the main features of the dynamics in a periodic system. In our setting, any resonant particle passing through the Poincaré surface of section lies on a curve embedded in a four-dimensional phase space, the fixed line. These findings are relevant for mitigating beam degradation and thus for achieving high-intensity and high-brightness beams, as required for both current and future accelerator projects. Nonlinear resonances can cause particle loss in accelerators. Experiments confirm that a coupled nonlinear resonance traps beam particles on a four-dimensional closed curve. This finding allows the development of mitigation strategies.},

  abstract     = {The investigation of the absolute scale of the effective neutrino mass remains challenging due to the exclusively weak interaction of neutrinos with all known particles in the standard model of particle physics. At present, the most precise and least-model-dependent upper limit on the electron antineutrino mass is set by the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) from the analysis of the tritium β-decay. Another promising approach is the electron capture in 163Ho, which is under investigation using microcalorimetry by the Electron Capture in Holmium (ECHo) and HOLMES collaborations. An independently measured Q value for this process is vital for the assessment of systematic uncertainties in the neutrino mass determination. Here we report a direct, independent determination of this Q value by measuring the free-space cyclotron frequency ratio of highly charged ions of 163Ho and 163Dy in the Penning-trap experiment PENTATRAP. Combining this ratio with atomic physics calculations of the electronic binding energies yields a Q value of 2,863.2 ± 0.6 eV c−2, which represents a more than 50-fold improvement over the state of the art. This will enable the determination of the electron neutrino mass on a sub-electronvolt level from the analysis of the electron capture in 163Ho. Electron capture in 163Ho can be used to determine the electron neutrino mass. The Q value of this process is crucial for the evaluation of the systematic uncertainty in such a measurement, and a 50-fold improvement is now reported.},

If the metric of spacetime has a quantum mechanical description, its fluctuations at the Planck scale are expected to introduce non-unitary effects that are inconsistent with the standard unitary time evolution of quantum mechanics. Neutrinos interacting with such fluctuations would lose their quantum coherence, deviating from the expected oscillatory flavour composition at long distances and high energies. Here we use atmospheric neutrinos detected by the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory in the energy range of 0.5–10.0 TeV to search for coherence loss in neutrino propagation. We find no evidence of anomalous neutrino decoherence and determine limits on neutrino–quantum gravity interactions. The constraint on the effective decoherence strength parameter within an energy-independent decoherence model improves on previous limits by a factor of 30. For decoherence effects scaling as E2, our limits are advanced by more than six orders of magnitude beyond past measurements compared with the state of the art. Interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with quantum-gravity-induced fluctuations of the metric of spacetime would lead to decoherence. The IceCube Collaboration constrains such interactions with atmospheric neutrinos.},

Through the bulk–edge correspondence principle, these invariants predict the presence of robust states that are localized at the termination of the material. A key example is a Chern insulator, which supports backscatter-free edge states that lead to sharply quantized conductance in the electronic case, and allows for robustness against fabrication imperfections in photonic devices. There has been a great deal of research into the linear properties of topological photonic structures, but it has been only recently that interest in the nonlinear domain has bloomed. Nonlinearity has been of particular interest because it is only in nonlinear and interacting systems that the true bosonic character of photons emerges, giving rise to physics with no direct correspondence in solid-state materials. In this Perspective, we discuss recent results concerning nonlinearity in topological photonics—with an emphasis on laser-written waveguide arrays as a model discrete system. Although topological photonics has been an active field of research for some time, most studies still focus on the linear optical regime. This Perspective summarizes recent investigations into the nonlinear properties of discrete topological photonic systems.},

An analogous architecture has been proposed for quantum networks, using optical photons to distribute entanglement between remote superconducting quantum processors. Here we report a step towards such a network by observing non-classical correlations between photons in an optical link and a superconducting quantum device. We generate these states of light through a spontaneous parametric down-conversion process in a chip-scale piezo-optomechanical transducer, and we measure a microwave–optical cross-correlation exceeding the Cauchy–Schwarz classical bound for thermal states. As further evidence of the non-classical character of the microwave–optical photon pairs, we observe antibunching in the microwave state conditioned on detection of an optical photon. Such a transducer can be readily connected to an independent superconducting qubit module and serve as a key building block for optical quantum networks of microwave-frequency qubits. A transducer that generates microwave–optical photon pairs is demonstrated. This could provide an interface between optical communication networks and superconducting quantum devices that operate at microwave frequencies.},

Multidimensional photonic graph states, such as cluster states, have a special entanglement structure that makes them a valuable resource for quantum metrology, secure quantum communication and measurement-based quantum computation. However, to date, the generation of multidimensional photonic cluster states has relied on probabilistic methods that limit the scalability of typical optical generation methods. Here we present an experimental implementation in the microwave domain of a resource-efficient scheme for the deterministic generation of two-dimensional photonic cluster states. Using a coupled resonator array as a slow-light waveguide, a single flux-tunable transmon qubit as a quantum emitter and a second auxiliary transmon as a switchable mirror, we achieve rapid, shaped emission of entangled photon wavepackets, and selective time-delayed feedback of photon wavepackets to the emitter qubit. We use these capabilities to generate a two-dimensional cluster state of four photons with 70% fidelity, as verified by the tomographic reconstruction of the quantum state. Cluster states made from multiple photons with a special entanglement structure are a useful resource for quantum technologies. Two-dimensional cluster states of microwave photons have now been deterministically generated using a superconducting circuit.},

Levitated optomechanical systems have recently entered the multiparticle regime, which promises the use of arrays of strongly coupled massive oscillators to explore complex interacting systems and sensing. Here we demonstrate programmable cavity-mediated interactions between nanoparticles in vacuum by combining advances in multiparticle optical levitation and cavity-based quantum control. The interaction is mediated by photons scattered by spatially separated particles in a cavity, resulting in strong coupling that is long-range in nature. We investigate the scaling of the interaction strength with cavity detuning and interparticle separation and demonstrate the tunability of interactions between different mechanical modes. Our work will enable the exploration of many-body effects in nanoparticle arrays with programmable cavity-mediated interactions, generating entanglement of motion, and the use of interacting particle arrays for optomechanical sensing. Combining multiparticle levitation with cavity control enables cavity-mediated interaction between levitated nanoparticles, whose strength can be tailored via optical detuning and position of the two particles.},

  abstract     = {Mode-locked lasers play a crucial role in modern science and technology. They are essential to the study of ultrafast and nonlinear optics, and they have applications in metrology, telecommunications and imaging. Recently, there has been interest in studying topological phenomena in mode-locked lasers. From a fundamental perspective, such study promises to reveal nonlinear topological physics, and from a practical perspective it may lead to the development of topologically protected short-pulse sources. Despite this promising outlook, the interplay between topological photonic lattices and laser mode-locking has not been studied experimentally. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally realize a topological temporally mode-locked laser. We demonstrate a nonlinearity-driven non-Hermitian skin effect in a laser cavity and observe the robustness of the laser against disorder-induced localization. Our experiments demonstrate fundamental point-gap topological physics that was previously inaccessible to photonics experiments, and they suggest potential applications of our mode-locked laser to sensing, optical computing and robust topological frequency combs. The experimental architecture employed in this work also provides a template for studying topology in other mode-locked photonic sources, including dissipative cavity solitons and synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillators. Mode locking, which is a common technique to produce short laser pulses, is demonstrated in a topological laser.},

  abstract     = {Topological effects are characterized by topological invariants, which are typically integer-valued, and lead to robust quantized transport channels in space, time and other degrees of freedom. The temporal channel in particular allows one to achieve higher-dimensional topological effects by driving the system with several incommensurate frequencies. However, dissipation is generally detrimental to such topological effects. Here we introduce a photonic molecule subjected to dissipation and several radio-frequency and optical drives as a candidate system for observing quantized transport along Floquet synthetic dimensions. We describe preliminary experiments contrasting the topological and trivial phases. Topological energy pumping in the incommensurately modulated photonic molecule is enhanced by the driven and dissipative nature of our platform. Furthermore, we provide a path for realizing Weyl points and measuring the Berry curvature emanating from these reciprocal-space magnetic monopoles and illustrate the capabilities for higher-dimensional topological Hamiltonian simulation in this platform. Our approach enables direct k-space engineering of a wide variety of Hamiltonians using modulation bandwidths that are well below the free spectral range of integrated photonic cavities. Although dissipation is often detrimental to the observation of topological effects, a photonic molecule driven at several incommensurate frequencies is shown to be a candidate system for quantized topological transport in synthetic dimensions.},

However, the simultaneous positioning and tuning of several lifetime-limited emitters into resonance remains a challenge. Here we report the creation of superradiant and subradiant entangled states in pairs of lifetime-limited and subwavelength-spaced organic molecules by permanently shifting them into resonance with laser-induced tuning. The molecules are embedded as defects in an organic nanocrystal. The pump light redistributes charges in the nanocrystal and dramatically increases the likelihood of resonant molecules. The frequency spectra, lifetimes and second-order correlation functions agree with a simple quantum model. This scalable tuning approach with organic molecules provides a pathway for observing collective quantum phenomena in subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters. Laser-induced tuning of pairs of lifetime-limited organic emitters allows the controlled creation of superradiant and subradiant entangled states.},

Here we show that the classical near-field dynamics of surface plasmons are defined by nonclassical processes of scattering among their constituent multiparticle subsystems. We isolate multiparticle plasmonic subsystems to demonstrate that their quantum dynamics are governed by either bosonic or fermionic processes of coherence. We also discuss the quantum-coherence properties of plasmonic fields excited by the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Our findings uncover multiparticle properties of electromagnetic near fields with important implications for quantum technology.

  abstract     = {The Bragg glass phase is a nearly perfect crystal with glassy features predicted to occur in vortex lattices and charge-density-wave systems in the presence of disorder. Detecting it has been challenging, despite its sharp theoretical definition in terms of diverging correlation lengths. Here we present bulk probe evidence supporting a Bragg glass phase in the systematically disordered charge-density-wave material of PdxErTe3. We do this by using comprehensive X-ray data and a machine-learning-based analysis tool called X-ray diffraction temperature clustering (X-TEC). We establish a diverging correlation length in samples with moderate intercalation over a wide temperature range. To enable this analysis, we introduced a high-throughput measure of inverse correlation length that we call peak spread. The detection of Bragg glass order and the resulting phase diagram advance our understanding of the complex interplay between disorder and fluctuations. Moreover, the use of our analysis technique to target fluctuations through a high-throughput measure of peak spread can revolutionize the study of fluctuations in scattering experiments. The existence of Bragg glasses—featuring nearly perfect crystalline order and glassy features—has yet to be experimentally confirmed for disordered charge-density-wave systems. A machine-learning-based experimental study now provides evidence for a Bragg glass phase in the charge density waves of PdxErTe3.},

  abstract     = {Approaches to developing large-scale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solid-state devices. State-of-the-art superconducting qubits employ aluminium oxide (AlOx) tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations. Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized, purely sinusoidal current–phase relation. However, this relation is expected to hold only in the limit of vanishingly low-transparency channels in the AlOx barrier. Here we show that the standard current–phase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. Instead, a mesoscopic model of tunnelling through an inhomogeneous AlOx barrier predicts percent-level contributions from higher Josephson harmonics. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlOx-based quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers. As an example, we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude while preserving their anharmonicity. The standard current–phase relation in tunnel Josephson junctions involves a single sinusoidal term, but real junctions are more complicated. The effects of higher Josephson harmonics have now been identified in superconducting qubit devices.},

  abstract     = {There is significant technological interest in developing ever faster switching between different electronic and magnetic states of matter. Manipulating properties at terahertz rates requires accessing the intrinsic timescales of both electrons and associated phonons, which is possible with short-pulse photoexcitation. However, in many Mott insulators, the electronic transition is accompanied by the nucleation and growth of percolating domains of the changed lattice structure, leading to empirical timescales dominated by slowly coarsening dynamics. Here we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction and reflectivity measurements to show that the photoinduced insulator-to-metal transition in an epitaxially strained Mott insulating thin film occurs without observable domain formation and coarsening effects, allowing the study of the intrinsic electronic and lattice dynamics. Above a fluence threshold, the initial electronic excitation drives a fast lattice rearrangement, which is followed by a slower electronic evolution into a metastable nonequilibrium state. Microscopic model calculations based on time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory and semiclassical lattice dynamics explain the threshold behaviour and elucidate the delayed onset of the electronic phase transition. This work highlights the importance of combined electronic and structural studies in unravelling the physics of dynamic transitions and the timescales of photoinduced processes. During a photoinduced phase transition, electronic rearrangements are usually faster than lattice ones. Time-resolved measurements now show that the insulator-to-metal transition in a thin-film Mott insulator is preceded by lattice reconfiguration.},

Revealing the interactions among these collective modes is crucial for the understanding of fundamental many-body effects in such systems and the development of high-speed information transport and processing devices based on them. Nevertheless, identifying couplings between individual magnon modes remains a long-standing challenge. Here we demonstrate spectroscopic fingerprints of anharmonic coupling between distinct magnon modes in an antiferromagnet, as evidenced by coherent photon emission at the sum and difference frequencies of the two modes. This discovery is enabled by driving two magnon modes coherently with a pair of tailored terahertz fields and then disentangling a mixture of nonlinear responses with different origins. Our approach provides a route for generating nonlinear magnon–magnon mixing. Magnons—quanta of spin waves—have potential applications in signal processing technology. But it is challenging to obtain coupling between different magnons. Now a study achieves this by demonstrating nonlinear magnon mixing in an antiferromagnet.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets are promising platforms for transduction and transmission of quantum information via magnons—the quanta of spin waves—and they offer advantages over ferromagnets in regard to dissipation, speed of response and robustness to external fields. Recently, transduction was shown in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, where strong spin-exciton coupling enables readout of the amplitude and phase of coherent magnons by photons of visible light. This discovery shifts the focus of research to transmission, specifically to exploring the non-local interactions that enable magnon wave packets to propagate. Here we demonstrate that magnon propagation is mediated by long-range dipole–dipole interaction. This coupling is an inevitable consequence of fundamental electrodynamics and, as such, will likely mediate the propagation of spin at long wavelengths in the entire class of van der Waals magnets currently under investigation. Successfully identifying the mechanism of spin propagation provides a set of optimization rules, as well as caveats, that are essential for any future applications of these promising systems. Understanding the mechanism by which magnons—the quanta of spin waves—propagate is important for developing practical devices. Now it is shown that long-range dipole–dipole interactions mediate the propagation in a van der Waals antiferromagnet.},

Generalizing from coherent phonon–phonon interactions to nonlinear couplings among other types of collective mode would open additional opportunities to design the dynamic properties of solids. For example, the collective excitations of magnetic order—magnons—can carry information with little energy dissipation, and their coherent and nonlinear control would provide an attractive route to achieve collective-mode-based information processing and storage in forthcoming spintronics and magnonics. Here we discover that intense terahertz fields can initiate the processes of magnon upconversion mediated by an intermediate magnetic resonance. By utilizing two-dimensional terahertz polarimetry, we demonstrate the unidirectional nature of coupling between distinct magnon modes of a canted antiferromagnet. The calculations of spin dynamics further suggest that this coupling is a universal feature of antiferromagnets with canted magnetic moments. These results demonstrate a route to induce desirable energy transfer pathways and a terahertz-induced coupling between coherent magnons in solids. Inducing coherent interactions between distinct magnon modes—collective excitations of magnetic order—has been challenging.

While virtual electron hopping promotes antiferromagnetism in an insulator, real hopping processes usually favour ferromagnetism. However, in kinetically frustrated systems such as hole-doped triangular lattice Mott insulators, real hopping has instead been shown to favour antiferromagnetism. Kinetic frustration has also been predicted to induce a new quasiparticle, a bound state of the doped hole and a spin flip called a spin polaron, at intermediate magnetic fields, which could form an unusual metallic state. Here we report the direct observation of spin polarons in triangular lattice MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers. A spin polaron phase emerges at a lattice filling factor just below 1 and is separated from the fully spin-polarized phase by a metamagnetic transition. We determine that the spin polaron is a spin-3/2 particle and that its binding energy is commensurate with the kinetic hopping energy. Our results will enable the exploration of spin polaron pseudogap metals, spin polaron pairing and other new phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.

Here we provide evidence for quantum transport in gapless topological hinge states existing within the insulating bulk and surface energy gaps in the intrinsic topological insulator α-Bi4Br4. Our magnetoresistance measurements reveal pronounced Aharonov–Bohm oscillations that are periodic in h/e (where h denotes Planck’s constant and e is the electron charge). The observed periodicity evinces quantum interference of electrons circumnavigating around the hinges. We also demonstrate that the h/e oscillations evolve as a function of magnetic field orientation, following the interference paths along the hinge modes that are allowed by topology and symmetry. Our findings reveal the quantum transport response of topological hinge modes with both topological nature and quantum coherence, which can eventually be applied to the development of efficient topological electronic devices. Topologically protected hinge modes could be important for developing quantum devices, but electronic transport through those states has not been demonstrated.

Here we report on the generation of continuous-variable graph states of atomic spin ensembles, which form the nodes of the graph. We program the entanglement structure encoded in the graph edges by combining global photon-mediated interactions in an optical cavity with local spin rotations. By tuning the entanglement between two subsystems, we either localize correlations within each subsystem or enable Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen steering—a strong form of entanglement that enables the extraction of precise information from one subsystem through measurements on the other. We further engineer a four-mode square graph state, highlighting the flexibility of our approach. Our method is scalable to larger and more complex graphs, laying groundwork for measurement-based quantum computation and advanced protocols in quantum metrology. Photon-mediated entanglement in atomic ensembles coupled to cavities enables the engineering of quantum states with a graph-like entanglement structure.

  abstract     = {Photoionization as a half-scattering process is not instantaneous. Usually, time delays in photoionization are on the order of tens of attoseconds. In going from a single atom to a nano-object, one can expect the delay to increase, since the photoelectron scatters over a larger distance. Here we show that this intuition is not correct when comparing three-dimensional and planar molecules. Using attosecond interferometry, we find that the time delays in two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based molecules can be significantly shorter than those of three-dimensional counterparts. The measured time delay carries the signature of the spatial distribution of the 2D hole created in the residual molecular cation, allowing us to obtain its dimensions with angstrom accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the photoionization delay depends on the symmetry and shape of the created hole, as we show by identifying a quadrupole contribution in the measured delay of 2D molecules. Attosecond interferometry measurements of photoionization delays in planar carbon-based molecules can provide information on the dimension and shape of the two-dimensional hole generated in the process.},

  abstract     = {Irradiating a small capsule containing deuterium and tritium fuel directly with intense laser light causes it to implode, which creates a plasma hot enough to initiate fusion reactions between the fuel nuclei. Here we report on such laser direct-drive experiments and observe that the fusion reactions produce more energy than the amount of energy in the central so-called hot-spot plasma. This condition is identified as having a hot-spot fuel gain greater than unity. A hot-spot fuel gain of around four was previously accomplished at the National Ignition Facility in indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments where the capsule is irradiated by X-rays. In that case, up to 1.9 MJ of laser energy was used, but in contrast, our experiments on the OMEGA laser system require as little as 28 kJ. As the hot-spot fuel gain is predicted to grow with laser energy and target size, our work establishes the direct-drive approach to inertial fusion as a promising path towards burning and ignited plasmas in the laboratory. Additionally, we report a record (direct-drive) fusion yield of 0.9 kJ on OMEGA, which we achieved with thin-ice deuterium–tritium liner targets. Inertial confinement fusion experiments in a direct-drive configuration report more energy produced in deuterium–tritium fusion reactions than the amount of energy in the central part of the plasma created by laser irradiation of the fuel capsule.},

  abstract     = {Focussing laser light onto the surface of a small target filled with deuterium and tritium implodes it and leads to the creation of a hot and dense plasma, in which thermonuclear fusion reactions occur. In order for the plasma to become self-sustaining, the heating of the plasma must be dominated by the energy provided by the fusion reactions—a condition known as a burning plasma. A metric for this is the generalized Lawson parameter, where values above around 0.8 imply a burning plasma. Here, we report on hydro-equivalent scaling of experimental results on the OMEGA laser system and show that these have achieved core conditions that reach a burning plasma when the central part of the plasma, the hotspot, is scaled in size by at least a factor of 3.9 ± 0.10, which would require a driver laser energy of at least 1.7 ± 0.13 MJ. In addition, we hydro-equivalently scale the results to the 2.15 MJ of laser energy available at the National Ignition Facility and find that these implosions reach 86% of the Lawson parameter required for ignition. Our results support direct-drive inertial confinement fusion as a credible approach for achieving thermonuclear ignition and net energy in laser fusion. Hydro-equivalent scaling of recent direct-drive inertial confinement fusion implosions shows that a burning plasma can be achieved with a higher laser energy.},

  abstract     = {Quantum sensing and metrology use coherent superposition states of quantum systems to detect and measure physical effects of interest. Their sensitivity is typically limited by the standard quantum limit, which bounds the achievable precision in measurements involving nominally identical but uncorrelated quantum systems. Fully quantum metrology involves entanglement in an array of quantum systems, enabling uncertainty reduction below the standard quantum limit. Although ultracold atoms have been widely used for applications such as atomic clocks or gravitational sensors, molecules show higher sensitivity to many interesting phenomena, including the existence of new, symmetry-violating forces mediated by massive particles. Recent advancements in molecular cooling, trapping and control techniques have enabled the use of molecules for quantum sensing and metrology. This Review describes these advancements and explores the potential of the rich internal structure and enhanced coupling strengths of molecules to probe fundamental physics and drive progress in the field. Ultracold atoms are a well-established platform for quantum sensing and metrology. This Review discusses the enhanced sensing capabilities that molecules offer for a range of phenomena, including symmetry-violating forces and dark matter detection.},

Molecules offer several advantages for these applications. They have a large set of stable states with strong transitions between them and long coherence times. Molecules can be prepared in a chosen state with high fidelity, and the state populations can be measured efficiently. Control over their long-range dipole–dipole interactions can enable the entanglement of pairs of molecules, generating interesting and technologically useful many-body states.

Global coordination is no less important in single cells, especially in large oocytes and newly formed embryos, which commonly use fast fluid flows for dynamic reorganization of their cytoplasm. These cytoplasmic streaming flows have been proposed to spontaneously arise from hydrodynamic interactions among cortically anchored microtubules loaded with cargo-carrying molecular motors. Here, we combine modelling and simulation with live imaging to investigate such flows in the Drosophila oocyte. Using a fast, accurate and scalable numerical approach to investigate fluid–structure interactions of thousands of flexible fibres, we demonstrate the robust emergence and evolution of cell-spanning vortices—or twisters—in three-dimensional cellular geometries. These twister flows, dominated by a near-rigid-body rotation with secondary toroidal components, reproduce the variety of experimental observations. In cells, these flows are probably involved in rapid mixing and transport of ooplasmic components. Cytoplasmic flows in the fruit fly oocyte can reorganize cellular components. These structured vortical flows arise through self-organizing dynamics of microtubules, molecular motors and cytoplasm.},

  abstract     = {Fractures are ubiquitous and can lead to the catastrophic material failure of materials. Although fracturing in a two-dimensional plane is well understood, all fractures are extended in and propagate through three-dimensional space. Moreover, their behaviour is complex. Here we show that the forward propagation of a fracture front occurs through an initial rupture, nucleated at some localized position, followed by a very rapid transverse expansion at velocities as high as the Rayleigh-wave speed. We study fracturing in a circular geometry that achieves an uninterrupted extended fracture front and use a fluid to control the loading conditions that determine the amplitude of the forward jump. We find that this amplitude correlates with the transverse velocity. Dynamic rupture simulations capture the observations for only a high transverse velocity. These results highlight the importance of transverse dynamics in the forward propagation of an extended fracture. Understanding the three-dimensional nature of fracture formation and dynamics is challenging. Experiments now show that a fracture front, after originating at a particular locus in a material, propagates jump-wise and expands transversely at high speed.},

  abstract     = {Dense suspensions are a prototype of fluid that can dynamically enhance their viscosity to resist strong forcing. Recent work established that the key to a large viscosity increase—often in excess of an order of magnitude—is the ability to switch from lubricated, frictionless particle interactions at low stress to a network of frictional contacts at higher stress. However, to isolate network features responsible for the large viscosity has been difficult, given the lack of an appropriate physics-inspired network measure. Here we apply rigidity theory to simulations of dense suspensions in two dimensions and identify a subset of mechanically rigid clusters at each strain step from the frictional contact network. We find that rigid clusters emerge at large shear stress well before the onset of jamming and that the continual breakup and reconfiguration of system-spanning rigid clusters is responsible for the flow states of the highest viscosity. By showing how viscosity is correlated with the rigidity of the underlying network of contact forces, our results provide insights beyond mean-field models and uncover a new contribution to dissipation in dense suspensions. Dense suspensions are granular materials suspended in a liquid at high packing fractions, exhibiting high viscosity. The latter is now shown to be related to the formation of a network of rigid clusters at large shear stress.},

  abstract     = {Dense granular flow is common in nature and industrial applications. A hallmark behaviour of granular flow is the emergence of a critical state when sufficient strain is applied, which has traditionally been understood with empirical constitutive theories. However, these theories are macroscopic ones without microscopic basis and, therefore, the physical origin of the critical state remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that the critical state corresponds to the random loose packing state where all the microstates are sampled with equal probability. X-ray tomography and shear force measurements allow us to monitor the microscopic processes of sheared granular materials and show that interparticle frictional contacts alter the density of states. This, consequently, leads to different critical state volume fractions. Despite this qualitative difference, we find universal equations of rescaled state variables (effective temperature, entropy and contact number as functions of volume fraction) for systems with different friction coefficients (μ = 0.52, 0.66 and 0.86), which suggests that frictional granular packings can be mapped directly to the frictionless hard-sphere system. In addition, we show that shear force barely affects the Edwards ensemble statistics, while its behaviour can be empirically explained by simply adding the contributions from particle structural rearrangements and frictional dissipation on contacts. When applying sufficient strain, the flow of dense granular matter becomes critical. It is now shown that this state corresponds to random loose packing for spheres with different friction coefficients and that these packings can be mapped onto the frictionless hard-sphere system.},

  abstract     = {Physical ageing is the generic term for irreversible processes in glassy materials resulting from molecular rearrangements. One formalism for describing such ageing processes involves the concept of material time, which may be thought of as time measured on a clock whose rate changes as the glass ages. Experimental determination of material time has so far not been realized, however. Here we show how dynamic light-scattering measurements provide a way forward. We determined the material time for an ageing sample of the glass-former 1-phenyl-1-propanol after temperature jumps close to the glass transition from the time-autocorrelation function of the intensity fluctuations probed by multispeckle dynamic light scattering. These fluctuations are shown to be stationary and reversible when regarded as a function of the material time. The glass-forming colloidal synthetic clay Laponite and a chemically ageing curing epoxy are also shown to display material-time-reversible scattered-light intensity fluctuations, and simulations of an ageing binary system monitoring the potential energy confirm material-time reversibility. In addition to demonstrating direct measurements of the material time, our findings identify a fundamental property of ageing in quite different contexts that presents a challenge to the current theories of ageing. Physical ageing in glassy materials can be described in a linear way through the concept of material time. Multispeckle dynamic light scattering is now shown to provide experimental access to the material time, in terms of which fluctuations become statistically reversible.},

Continuous, time-independent external driving of the sample produces periodic auto-oscillations with a coherence time exceeding hours. Varying the experimental parameters reveals wide ranges in which the time crystal remains stable. At the edges of these ranges, we find chaotic behaviour with a lifted periodicity corresponding to the melting of the crystal. The time crystal state enables fundamental studies of nonlinear interactions and has potential applications as a precise on-chip frequency standard. Time crystals spontaneously produce periodic oscillations that are robust to perturbations. A time crystal phase with a long coherence time has now been produced using the electron and nuclear spins of a semiconductor sample.},

  abstract     = {Quantum spin models have been extensively used to study the properties of strongly correlated systems and to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Trapped-ion systems have reliably demonstrated the quantum simulation of various quantum spin models in one-dimensional chains. The extension of trapped-ion simulators to two dimensions has been an enticing goal for decades. Here we present the quantum simulation of Ising models with two-dimensional ion crystals in a Paul trap. We benchmark the simulator by implementing various spin models with complex interaction networks and adiabatically prepare the corresponding ground states. Spin–spin interactions with different signs and sufficiently large strengths are generated by driving different vibrational modes. We probe the quantum coherence of the simulation by reversing the ramping profile of the transverse field to the initial value and then quantify the probability of returning to the initial state. Then, we test the scalability of the system for a large-scale quantum simulation.

  abstract     = {Magnetic skyrmions are localized, stable topological magnetic textures that can move and interact with each other like ordinary particles when an external stimulus is applied. The efficient control of the motion of spin textures using spin-polarized currents opened an opportunity for skyrmionic devices such as racetrack memory and neuromorphic or reservoir computing. The coexistence of skyrmions with high topological charge in the same system promises further possibilities for efficient technological applications. In this work, we directly observe dipolar skyrmions and antiskyrmions with arbitrary topological charge in Co/Ni multilayers at room temperature. We explore the dipolar-stabilized spin objects with topological charges of up to 10 and characterize their nucleation process, their energy dependence on the topological charge and the effect of the material parameters on their stability. Furthermore, our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate spin-transfer-induced motion of these spin objects, which is important for their potential device application. Control over magnetic skyrmions at room temperature has important applications in technology. Now the observation of skyrmions with high topological charge widens the potential for them to be used in unconventional computing techniques.},

  abstract     = {The introduction of localized electronic states into a metal can alter its physical properties, for example enabling exotic metal physics including heavy fermion and strange metal behaviour. A common source of localized states in such systems are partially filled 4f and 5f shells because of the inherently compact nature of those orbitals. The interaction of electrons in these orbitals with the conduction sea is well described by the Kondo framework. However, there have also been observations of Kondo-like behaviour in 3d transition metal oxides and in 4d- and 5d-containing van der Waals heterostructures. This calls for a broader consideration of the physical requirements for Kondo systems. Here we show transport and thermodynamic hallmarks of heavy fermion and strange metal behaviour that arise in the kagome metal Ni3In, wherein the source of localized states is destructive interference-induced band flattening of partially filled Ni 3d states. With magnetic field and pressure tuning, we also find evidence that the system is proximate to quantum criticality, extending the analogy to f-electron Kondo lattices. These observations highlight the role of hopping frustration in metallic systems as a potential source for strong correlations. Additionally, this suggests a lattice-driven approach to realizing correlated metals with non-trivial band topology. Electrons in f orbitals can create localized states that interact strongly and drive strange metal and critical behaviour via the Kondo mechanism. Now a mechanism of geometric frustration enables similar phenomena with d electrons.},

  abstract     = {Electronic correlation effects are manifested in quantum materials when either the on-site Coulomb repulsion is large or the electron kinetic energy is small. The former is the dominant effect in cuprate superconductors and heavy-fermion systems whereas it is the latter in twisted bilayer graphene and geometrically frustrated metals. However, the simultaneous cooperation of both effects in the same quantum material remains rare. The design aim is to produce correlated topological flat bands pinned at the Fermi level. Here, we observe a flat band at the Fermi level in a 3d pyrochlore metal CuV2S4. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data reveal that destructive quantum interference associated with the V pyrochlore sublattice and further renormalization to the Fermi level by electron interactions induce this flat band. Consequently, we discover transport signatures that evidence a deviation from Fermi liquid behaviour as well as an enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient. Our work illustrates the combined cooperation of local Coulomb interactions and geometric frustration in a pyrochlore lattice system to induce correlated topology by constructing and pinning correlated flat bands near the Fermi level. Observations of strong electron correlation effects have been mostly confined to compounds containing f orbital electrons. Now, the study of the 3d pyrochlore metal CuV2S4 reveals that similar effects can be induced by flat-band engineering.},

  abstract     = {In solids, the condensation of electron and hole pairs with finite momentum leads to an ordered state known as a charge density wave, in which the charge has spatial modulation. However, lattice symmetry breaking and the accompanying relocation of the ions, which changes the charge distribution, can also occur simultaneously, making it difficult to disentangle the origin of the transition. Here we demonstrate a condensed phase in low-dimensional HfTe2. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal a metal–insulator transition upon lowering the temperature. The observation of an opening gap, the renormalization of the bands and the emergence of replica bands in the low-temperature regime suggests that a charge density wave formed in the ground state. Raman spectroscopy shows no sign of lattice distortion within the detection limit. A small amount of electron doping substantially raises the transition temperature due to a reduced screening effect and a more balanced carrier density for electrons and holes. Our results indicate that the formation mechanism of the charge density wave is consistent with the excitonic insulator phase in low-dimensional HfTe2 without any structural modification. The mechanism of charge density wave formation has been hard to explain due to accompanying structural distortions. Now low-dimensional HfTe2 is revealed to host a purely electronic exitonic charge density wave driven by reduced screening effects.},

  abstract     = {The interplay of charge, spin, lattice and orbital degrees of freedom leads to a variety of emergent phenomena in strongly correlated systems. In transition-metal-dichalcogenide-based moiré heterostructures, recent observations of correlated phases can be described by triangular-lattice single-orbital Hubbard models based on moiré bands derived from the Brillouin-zone corners—the so-called K valleys. Richer phase diagrams described by multi-orbital Hubbard models are possible with hexagonal lattices that host moiré bands at the zone centre—called Γ valleys—or an additional layer degree of freedom. Here we report the tunable interaction between strongly correlated hole states hosted by Γ- and K-derived bands in a heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 and bilayer 2H WSe2. We characterize the behaviour of exciton–polarons to distinguish the layer and valley degrees of freedom. The Γ band gives rise to a charge-transfer insulator described by a two-orbital Hubbard model. An out-of-plane electric field re-orders the Γ- and K-derived bands and drives the redistribution of carriers to the layer-polarized K orbital, generating Wigner crystals and Mott insulating states. Finally, we obtain degeneracy of the Γ and K orbitals at the Fermi level and observe interacting correlated states with phase transitions dependent on the doping density. Our results establish a platform to investigate multi-orbital Hubbard model Hamiltonians. Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides are known to simulate the triangular-lattice Hubbard model. Now, by combining a monolayer and bilayer of different materials, this idea is extended to multi-orbital Hubbard models.},

  abstract     = {A thermal Hall effect occurs in an increasing number of insulators and is often attributed to phonons, but the underlying mechanism is not known in most cases. Two main scenarios have been proposed: either a coupling of phonons to spins or scattering of phonons by impurities or defects, but there is no systematic evidence to support either of them. Here we present evidence for the phonon impurity scattering picture by studying the effect of adding rhodium impurities to the antiferromagnetic insulator Sr2IrO4, substituting for the spin-carrying iridium atoms. We find that adding small concentrations of rhodium impurities increases the thermal Hall conductivity, but adding enough rhodium to suppress the magnetic order eventually decreases it until it nearly vanishes. In contrast, introducing lanthanum impurities that substitute for the strontium atoms, which lie outside the IrO2 planes that are the seat of magnetism, produces a much smaller enhancement of the thermal Hall conductivity. We conclude that the thermal Hall effect in this material is caused by the scattering of phonons by impurities embedded within a magnetic environment. The thermal Hall effect of phonons does not yet have a definitive explanation. Now a careful study of doped Sr2IrO4 suggests that the mechanism involves the scattering of phonons by impurities embedded in an antiferromagnetic environment.},

  abstract     = {Spontaneously broken symmetries are at the heart of many phenomena of quantum matter and physics more generally. However, determining the exact symmetries that are broken can be challenging due to imperfections such as strain, in particular when multiple electronic orders are competing. This is exemplified by charge order in some kagome systems, where evidence of nematicity and flux order from orbital currents remains inconclusive due to contradictory measurements. Here we clarify this controversy by fabricating highly symmetric samples of a member of this family, CsV3Sb5, and measuring their transport properties. We find that a measurable anisotropy is absent at any temperature in the unperturbed material. However, a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy appears when either weak magnetic fields or strains are present. A symmetry analysis indicates that a perpendicular magnetic field can indeed lead to in-plane anisotropy by inducing a flux order coexisting with more conventional bond order. Our results provide a unifying picture for the controversial charge order in kagome metals and highlight the need for materials control at the microscopic scale in the identification of broken symmetries. The electronic transport properties of charge-ordered kagome metals are controversial. Now careful measurements on unperturbed samples show that previously measured anisotropy in the transport occurs only when external perturbations are present.},

In the iron-based superconductors that have hole pockets around the Brillouin zone centre and electron pockets around the zone corners, the pairing symmetry is generally considered to be s±, which indicates a sign change in the superconducting gap between the hole and electron pockets. For the iron-based superconductors with only hole pockets, however, a couple of pairing scenarios have been proposed, but the exact symmetry is still controversial. Here we determine that the pairing symmetry in KFe2As2—which is a prototypical iron-based superconductor with hole pockets both around the zone centre and around the zone corners—is also of the s± type. Our laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements have determined the superconducting gap distribution and identified the locations of the gap nodes on all the Fermi surfaces around the zone centres and the zone corners. These results unify the pairing symmetry in hole-doped iron-based superconductors and point to spin fluctuation as the pairing glue in generating superconductivity. High-precision photoemission measurements determine that the superconducting pairing symmetry in KFe2As2 is the same as in other types of iron-based superconductors, despite having different features in the band structure.},

Mechanical resonators have several practical advantages for this purpose, because they confine many high-quality-factor modes into a small volume and can be easily integrated with different quantum systems. However, it is challenging to create direct interactions between different mechanical modes that can be used to emulate quantum gates. Here we demonstrate an in situ tunable beamsplitter-type interaction between several mechanical modes of a high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonator. The engineered interaction is mediated by a parametrically driven superconducting transmon qubit, and we show that it can be tailored to couple pairs or triplets of phononic modes. Furthermore, we use this interaction to demonstrate the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect between phonons. Our results lay the foundations for using phononic systems as quantum memories and platforms for quantum simulations. Quantum gates require controlled interactions between different degrees of freedom. A tunable coupling has now been demonstrated between the phonon modes of a mechanical resonator designed for storing and manipulating quantum information.},

  abstract     = {Metastability stems from the finite lifetime of a state when a lower-energy configuration is available but only by tunnelling through an energy barrier. It is observed in many natural situations, including in chemical processes and in electron field ionization. In classical many-body systems, metastability naturally emerges in the presence of a first-order phase transition. A prototypical example is a supercooled vapour. The extension to quantum field theory and quantum many-body systems has attracted significant interest in the context of statistical physics, protein folding and cosmology, for which thermal and quantum fluctuations are expected to trigger the transition from the metastable state (false vacuum) to the ground state (true vacuum) through the probabilistic nucleation of spatially localized bubbles. However, the long-standing theoretical progress in estimating the relaxation rate of the metastable field through bubble nucleation has not been validated experimentally. Here we experimentally observe bubble nucleation in isolated and coherently coupled atomic superfluids, and we support our observations with numerical simulations. The agreement between our observations and an analytic formula based on instanton theory confirms our physical understanding of the decay process and promotes coherently coupled atomic superfluids as an ideal platform to investigate out-of-equilibrium quantum field phenomena. The transition from a metastable state to the ground state in classical many-body systems is mediated by bubble nucleation. This transition has now been experimentally observed in a quantum setting using coupled atomic superfluids.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems must respond to external perturbations and, at the same time, internally distribute information to coordinate their components. Although networked backbones help with the latter, they limit the components’ individual degrees of freedom and reduce their collective dynamical range. Here we show that real-world networks balance the loss of response diversity with gain in information flow. Encoding network states as density matrices, we demonstrate that such a trade-off mathematically resembles the thermodynamic efficiency characterized by heat and work in physical systems, providing a variational principle to macroscopically explain the sparsity and empirical scaling law observed in hundreds of real-world networks across multiple domains, both analytically and numerically. We show that the emergence of topological features such as modularity, small-worldness and heterogeneity agrees with maximizing the trade-off between information exchange and response diversity from middle to large temporal scales. Our results suggest that the emergence of some of the most prevalent topological features of real-world networks might have a thermodynamic origin. Topological features such as modularity and small-worldness are common in real-world networks. The emergence of such features may be driven by a trade-off between information exchange and response diversity that resembles thermodynamic efficiency.},

We present a theoretical model of cellular polarization for a cell migrating along a one-dimensional line, arriving at a symmetric Y junction and extending protrusions along the different paths that originate at the junction. The model predicts the spontaneous emergence of deterministic oscillations of growth and cellular polarization between competing protrusions during the directional decision-making process. The oscillations are modified by cellular noise but remain a dominant feature that affects the time it takes the cell to migrate across the junction. These predictions are confirmed experimentally for two different cell types (non-cancerous endothelial and cancerous glioma cells) migrating on a patterned network of thin adhesive lanes with junctions. Cell motion along linear confinements is deterministic. Now a model predicts deterministic oscillations in cellular polarization at a Y junction in a set-up with adhesive patterns.},

  abstract     = {Active processes drive biological dynamics across various scales and include subcellular cytoskeletal remodelling, tissue development in embryogenesis and the population-level expansion of bacterial colonies. In each of these, biological functionality requires collective flows to occur while self-organised structures are protected. However, the mechanisms by which active flows can spontaneously constrain their dynamics to preserve structure are not known. Here, by studying collective flows and defect dynamics in active nematic films, we demonstrate the existence of a self-constraint, namely a two-way, spontaneously arising relationship between activity-driven isosurfaces of flow boundaries and mesoscale nematic structures. We show that self-motile defects are tightly constrained to viscometric surfaces, which are contours along which the vorticity and the strain rate are balanced. This in turn reveals that self-motile defects break mirror symmetry when they move along a single viscometric surface. This is explained by an interdependence between viscometric surfaces and bend walls, which are elongated narrow kinks in the orientation field. These findings indicate that defects cannot be treated as solitary points. Instead, their associated mesoscale deformations are key to the steady-state coupling to hydrodynamic flows. This mesoscale cross-field self-constraint offers a framework for tackling complex three-dimensional active turbulence, designing dynamic control into biomimetic materials and understanding how biological systems can employ active stress for dynamic self-organisation. Active flows in biological systems swirl. A coupling between active flows, elongated deformations and defect dynamics helps preserve self-organised structures against disordered swirling.},

  abstract     = {The connections in networks of neurons are heavy-tailed, with a small number of neurons connected much more strongly than the vast majority of pairs. However, it remains unclear whether this heavy-tailed connectivity emerges from simple underlying mechanisms. Here we propose a minimal model of synaptic self-organization: connections are pruned at random, and the synaptic strength rearranges under a mixture of preferential and random dynamics. Under these generic rules, networks evolve to produce distributions of connectivity strength that are asymptotically scale-free, with a power-law exponent that depends only on the probability of preferential (rather than random) growth. Extending our model to include neuronal activity and Hebbian plasticity, we find that clustering in the network also emerges naturally. We confirm these predictions in the connectomes of several animals, suggesting that heavy-tailed and clustered connectivity may arise from general principles of network self-organization rather than mechanisms specific to individual species or systems. The strengths of connections in networks of neurons are heavy-tailed, with some neurons connected much more strongly than most. Now a simple network model can explain how this heavy-tailed connectivity emerges across four different species.},

Quantum kernels exist that, subject to computational hardness assumptions, cannot be computed classically. The learning problems for these cases are constructed artificially and it is an important challenge to find quantum kernels that have the potential to be relevant for real-world data. Here we identify a suitable class of learning problems on data that have a group structure, which are amenable to kernel methods. We introduce a family of quantum kernels that can be applied to such data, generalizing from a kernel that is known to have a quantum–classical separation when solving a particular set of problems. We use 27 qubits of a superconducting processor to demonstrate our method with a learning problem that embodies the structure of many essential learning problems on groups. The kernel method in machine learning can be implemented on near-term quantum computers. A 27-qubit device has now been used to solve learning problems using kernels that have the potential to be practically useful.},

They are useful to the extent to which superpositions of 0 and 1 persist despite a noisy environment. The standard prescription to avoid decoherence of solid-state qubits is their isolation by means of extreme dilution in ultrapure materials. We demonstrate a different strategy using the rare-earth insulator LiY1−xTbxF4 (x = 0.001) which realizes a dense random network of TLS. Some TLS belong to strongly interacting Tb3+ pairs whose quantum states, thanks to localization effects, form highly coherent qubits with 100-fold longer coherence times than single ions. Our understanding of the underlying decoherence mechanisms—and of their suppression—suggests that coherence in networks of dipolar coupled TLS can be enhanced rather than reduced by the interactions. Quantum coherence is hard to maintain in solid-state systems, as interactions usually lead to fast dephasing. Exploiting disorder effects and interactions, highly coherent two-level systems have now been realized in a rare-earth insulator compound.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-crystals are aperiodic structures with crystallographic properties that are not compatible with that of a single unit cell. Their discovery in a metallic alloy more than four decades ago has required a full reconsideration of our definition of a crystal structure. Quasi-crystalline structures have also been discovered at much larger length scales in different microscopic systems for which the size of the elementary building blocks ranges from the nanometre to the micrometre scale. Here we report the first experimental observation of spontaneous quasi-crystalline self-assembly at the millimetre scale. This result is obtained in a fully athermal system of macroscopic spherical grains vibrating on a substrate. Starting from a liquid-like disordered phase, the grains begin to locally arrange into three types of square and triangle tile that eventually align, forming an eight-fold symmetric quasi-crystal that has been predicted in simulation but not yet experimentally observed in non-atomic systems. These results not only demonstrate an alternative route for the spontaneous assembly of quasi-crystals but are of fundamental interest for the connection between equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics. In quasi-crystals, constituents do not form spatially periodic patterns, but their structures still give rise to sharp diffraction patterns. Now, quasi-crystalline patterns are found in a system of spherical macroscopic grains vibrating on a substrate.},

  abstract     = {Water confined in nanopores is ubiquitous in geological, planetary and biological environments and in nanofluidic settings. Understanding the phase behaviour and proton dynamics of nanoconfined water under high-pressure conditions is therefore important from both fundamental and applied points of view. Here we report a machine learning potential and present evidence from large-scale path-integral molecular dynamics simulations of the proton dynamics and phase behaviours of monolayer and bilayer ice under nanoconfinement and high pressures. We find that the symmetry breaking of the underlying hydrogen-bonding network of the two-dimensional (2D) ices together with strong nuclear quantum effects are responsible for the rich proton dynamics, such as the ultrafast one-dimensional proton-hopping within 2D ices. We also predict ten 2D ice phases. Notably, a 2D dynamic partially ionic phase and a superionic phase can be produced in the laboratory at pressures one order of magnitude lower than those measured for the bulk superionic phase or predicted for the partially ionic phase. We also identify a 2D solid-melting behaviour, namely consecutive double or triple continuous phase transitions from bilayer molecular ice to plastic ice and then to hexatic ice and the superionic fluid. The phase diagram of confined ice is different from that of bulk ice. Simulations now reveal several 2D ice phases and show how strong nuclear quantum effects result in rich proton dynamics in 2D confined ices.},

Here we circumvent this limitation by utilizing a pseudo-electric field generated by inhomogeneous lattice strain, namely a flexoelectric field, as a means of polarizing and controlling a metal. Using heteroepitaxy and atomic-scale imaging, we show that flexoelectric fields polarize the bulk of an otherwise centrosymmetric metal SrRuO3, with off-centre displacements of Ru ions. This further impacts the electronic bands and lattice anisotropy of the flexo-polar SrRuO3, potentially leading to an enhancement of electron correlation, ferromagnetism and its anisotropy. Beyond conventional electric fields, flexoelectric fields may be used to create and control electronic states through pure atomic displacements. Electric polarization is well defined for insulators but not for metals. Electric-like polarization is now realized via inhomogeneous lattice strain in metallic SrRuO3, generating a pseudo-electric field. This field affects the material’s electronic bands.},

  abstract     = {In magnetic crystals, despite the explicit breaking of time-reversal symmetry, two equilibrium states related by time reversal are always energetically degenerate. In ferromagnets, this time-reversal degeneracy is reflected in the hysteresis of the magnetic field dependence of the magnetization and, if metallic, in that of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Under time-reversal, both these quantities change signs but not their magnitude. Here we show that a time-reversal-like degeneracy appears in the metallic kagome spin ice HoAgGe when magnetic fields are applied parallel to the kagome plane. We find vanishing hysteresis in the field dependence of the magnetization at low temperature, but finite hysteresis in the field-dependent AHE. This suggests the emergence of states with nearly the same energy and net magnetization but different sizes of the AHE and of the longitudinal magnetoresistance. By analysing the experimental data and a minimal tight-binding model, we identify a time-reversal-like operation connecting these near-degenerate states, which is related to the non-trivial distortion of the kagome lattice in HoAgGe. Our work demonstrates the diagnostic power of transport phenomena for identifying hidden symmetries in frustrated spin systems. Transport measurements of the metallic kagome spin ice HoAgGe show that it has an emergent discrete symmetry that is not apparent from measurements of its magnetization.},

  abstract     = {Bilayer graphene is a promising platform for electrically controllable qubits in a two-dimensional material. Of particular interest is the ability to encode quantum information in the valley degree of freedom, a two-fold orbital degeneracy that arises from the symmetry of the hexagonal crystal structure. The use of valleys could be advantageous, as known spin- and orbital-mixing mechanisms are unlikely to be at work for valleys, promising more robust qubits. The Berry curvature associated with valley states allows for electrical control of their energies, suggesting routes for coherent qubit manipulation. However, the relaxation time of valley states—which ultimately limits these qubits’ coherence properties and therefore their suitability as practical qubits—is not yet known. Here we measure the characteristic relaxation times of these spin and valley states in gate-defined bilayer graphene quantum dot devices. Different valley states can be distinguished from each other with a fidelity of over 99%. The relaxation time between valley triplets and singlets exceeds 500 ms and is more than one order of magnitude longer than for spin states. This work facilitates future measurements on valley-qubit coherence, demonstrating bilayer graphene as a practical platform hosting electrically controlled, long-lived valley qubits. Using the valley degree of freedom in analogy to spin to encode qubits could be advantageous as many of the known decoherence mechanisms do not apply. Now long relaxation times are demonstrated for valley qubits in bilayer graphene quantum dots.},

As a prime example, continuing advances in device quality have facilitated the observation of a variety of spontaneously ordered quantum states in bilayer graphene. Its natural extension, rhombohedral trilayer graphene—in which the layers are stacked in an ABC fashion—is predicted to host stronger electron–electron interactions than bilayer graphene because of its flatter low-energy bands and larger winding number. Theoretically, five spontaneous quantum Hall phases have been proposed to be candidate electronic ground states. Here we observe evidence for four of the five competing ordered states in interaction-maximized, dual-gated, rhombohedral trilayer graphene. In particular, at small magnetic fields, two states with Chern numbers 3 and 6 can be stabilized at elevated and low perpendicular electric fields, respectively, and both exhibit clear magnetic hysteresis. We also show that the quantum Hall ferromagnets of the zero-energy Landau levels are ferroelectrics with spontaneous layer polarizations even at zero electric field, as evidenced by electric hysteresis. Bilayer graphene is known to host states where interactions dominate the electronic behaviour. Now, transport measurements show that this is also true for trilayer graphene and give evidence for ferroelectric states and states with high Chern number.},

In particular, the rotational states of polar molecules confined in optical tweezers or optical lattices may be used to encode interacting qubits for quantum computation or pseudo-spins for simulating quantum magnetism. As with all quantum platforms, the engineering of robust coherent superpositions of states is vital. However, for optically trapped molecules, the coherence time between rotational states is typically limited by inhomogeneous differential light shifts. Here we demonstrate a rotationally magic optical trap for 87Rb133Cs molecules that supports a Ramsey coherence time of 0.78(4) s in the absence of dipole–dipole interactions. This is estimated to extend to &amp;gt;1.4 s at the 95% confidence level using a single spin-echo pulse. In our trap, dipolar interactions become the dominant mechanism by which Ramsey contrast is lost for superpositions that generate oscillating dipoles. By changing the states forming the superposition, we tune the effective dipole moment and show that the coherence time is inversely proportional to the strength of the dipolar interaction. Our work unlocks the full potential of the rotational degree of freedom in molecules for quantum computation and quantum simulation. Coherence between rotational states of polar molecules has previously been limited by light shifts in optical traps. A magic-wavelength trap is able to maximize the coherence time and enables the observation of tunable dipolar interactions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum transport can distinguish between dynamical phases of matter. For instance, ballistic propagation characterizes the absence of disorder, whereas in many-body localized phases, particles do not propagate for exponentially long times. Additional possibilities include states of matter exhibiting anomalous transport in which particles propagate with a non-trivial exponent. Here we report the experimental observation of anomalous transport across a broad range of the phase diagram of a kicked quasicrystal. The Hamiltonian of our system has been predicted to exhibit a rich phase diagram, including not only fully localized and fully delocalized phases but also an extended region comprising a nested pattern of localized, delocalized and multifractal states, which gives rise to anomalous transport. Our cold-atom realization is enabled by new Floquet engineering techniques, which expand the accessible phase diagram by five orders of magnitude. Mapping transport properties throughout the phase diagram, we observe disorder-driven re-entrant delocalization and sub-ballistic transport, and we present a theoretical explanation of these phenomena based on eigenstate multifractality. Phases of matter can host different transport behaviours, ranging from diffusion to localization. Anomalous transport has now been observed in an interacting Bose gas in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a pulsed incommensurate potential.},

  abstract     = {Scale invariance and self-similarity in physics provide a unified framework for classifying phases of matter and dynamical properties near equilibrium in both classical and quantum systems. This paradigm has been further extended to isolated many-body quantum systems driven far from equilibrium, for which the physical observables exhibit dynamical scaling with universal scaling exponents. Universal dynamics appear in a wide range of scenarios, including cosmology, quark–gluon matter, ultracold atoms and quantum spin magnets. However, how the universal dynamics depend on the symmetry of the underlying Hamiltonian in non-equilibrium systems remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report on the classification of universal coarsening dynamics in a quenched two-dimensional ferromagnetic spinor Bose gas. We observe spatio-temporal scaling of spin correlation functions with distinguishable scaling exponents that characterize binary and diffusive fluids. The universality class of the coarsening dynamics is determined by the symmetry of the order parameter and the dynamics of the topological defects, such as domain walls and vortices. Our results categorize the universality classes of far-from-equilibrium quantum dynamics based on the symmetry properties of the system. The dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium is the object of intense research. Magnetization measurements in a spinor atomic gas now offer a way to classify universal dynamics based on symmetry and topology.},

  abstract     = {Quantum devices characterized by non-Hermitian topology are predicted to show highly robust and potentially useful properties for precision sensing and signal amplification. However, realizing them has remained a daunting experimental task, as non-Hermiticity is often associated with gain and loss, which would require precise tailoring to produce the signatures of non-trivial topology. Here, instead of gain and loss, we use the non-reciprocity of quantum Hall edge states to directly observe non-Hermitian topology in a multi-terminal quantum Hall ring. Our transport measurements evidence a robust, non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by currents and voltages showing an exponential profile that persists across Hall plateau transitions away from the regime of maximum non-reciprocity. Our observation of non-Hermitian topology in a quantum device introduces a scalable experimental approach to construct and investigate generic non-Hermitian systems. Non-Hermitian systems can be described in terms of gain and loss with a coupled environment—a hard feature to tune in quantum devices. Now an experiment shows non-Hermitian topology in a quantum Hall ring without relying on gain and loss.},

  abstract     = {Ultracold molecules have been proposed as a candidate platform for quantum science and precision measurement because of their rich internal structures and interactions. Direct laser-cooling promises to be a rapid and efficient way to bring molecules to ultracold temperatures. However, for trapped molecules, laser-cooling to the quantum motional ground state remains an outstanding challenge. A technique capable of reaching the motional ground state is Raman sideband cooling, first demonstrated in trapped ions and atoms. Here we demonstrate Raman sideband cooling of CaF molecules trapped in an optical tweezer array. Our protocol does not rely on high magnetic fields and preserves the purity of molecular internal states. We measure a high ground-state fraction and achieve low motional entropy per particle. The low temperatures we obtain could enable longer coherence times and higher-fidelity molecular qubit gates, desirable for quantum information processing and quantum simulation. With further improvements, Raman sideband cooling will also provide a route to quantum degeneracy of large molecular samples, which could be extendable to polyatomic molecular species. Raman sideband cooling is a method used to prepare atoms and ions in their vibrational ground state. This technique has now been extended to molecules trapped in optical tweezer arrays.},

  abstract     = {Comparison of precise predictions of the energy levels of the molecular hydrogen ion $${\rm{H}}_{2}^{+}$$ —the simplest molecule—with measured vibrational transition frequencies would allow a direct determination of the proton-to-electron mass ratio and of the proton’s charge radius. Here we report vibrational laser spectroscopy of trapped and sympathetically laser-cooled $${{{{\rm{H}}}}}_{2}^{+}$$ , which represents a step towards this goal. We studied a first-overtone electric-quadrupole transition and measured its two hyperfine components. The determined spin-averaged vibrational transition frequency has a fractional uncertainty of 1.2 × 10−8 and is in agreement with the theoretically predicted value. We measured an analogous electric-quadrupole transition in HD+ to estimate systematic uncertainties. Here, we observed a vastly improved line quality factor compared to previous electric-quadrupole spectroscopy of molecular ions. Our work demonstrates that first-overtone electric-quadrupole transitions are suitable for precision spectroscopy of molecular ions, including $${{{{\rm{H}}}}}_{2}^{+}$$ , and that determining the proton-to-electron mass ratio with laser spectroscopy could become competitive with mass spectrometry using Penning traps. Furthermore, achieving precision spectroscopy of $${{{{\rm{H}}}}}_{2}^{+}$$ is an essential prerequisite for a future test of combined charge, parity and time reversal symmetry based on a comparison with its antimatter counterpart. Vibrational laser spectroscopy of the molecular hydrogen ion $${\rm{H}}_{2}^{+}$$ offers new prospects for fundamental physics studies.},

It explores innovative teaching approaches that empower students to take initiative in their learning. These approaches leverage digital technologies to handle complex data and address authentic (real life, complex) problems, ultimately enhancing students’ epistemic agency.

  abstract     = {Directional flows of cells have been observed during development in a variety of systems ranging from Drosophila to zebrafish. These flows shape living matter in phenomena involving cell mechanics and regulation of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton and are important for morphogenesis. However, the onset of the observed coherent motion is still poorly understood. Here we identify the inherent coherence length to show that coherence is associated with spontaneous alignments of cell polarity. We use cellular rings of controlled dimensions and live tracking of cellular shapes and motions under various experimental conditions, finding that a tug-of-war between cell polarities within the ring dictates the onset of coherence. In addition, we identify an internally driven constraint set by cellular acto-myosin cables at the inner and outer ring boundaries. As these structures have a high RhoA protein activity, they confine the cells and are essential to ensure coherence. The finding that acto-myosin cables are required to trigger coherence is supported by numerical simulations based on a Vicsek-type model that includes free active boundaries. We quantitatively reproduce coherence onsets. We propose that spontaneous coherent motion results from basic competitions between cell orientations and active cables at boundaries. Coherent motion of cells plays an important role in morphogenesis. Experiments with cellular rings, supported by numerical simulations, suggest that cell polarity and acto-myosin cables are important factors in the onset of coherence.},

  abstract     = {Contraction and flow of the actin cell cortex have emerged as a common principle by which cells reorganize their cytoplasm and take shape. However, how these cortical flows interact with adjacent cytoplasmic components, changing their form and localization, and how this affects cytoplasmic organization and cell shape remains unclear. Here we show that in ascidian oocytes, the cooperative activities of cortical actomyosin flows and deformation of the adjacent mitochondria-rich myoplasm drive oocyte cytoplasmic reorganization and shape changes following fertilization. We show that vegetal-directed cortical actomyosin flows, established upon oocyte fertilization, lead to both the accumulation of cortical actin at the vegetal pole of the zygote and compression and local buckling of the adjacent elastic solid-like myoplasm layer due to friction forces generated at their interface. Once cortical flows have ceased, the multiple myoplasm buckles resolve into one larger buckle, which again drives the formation of the contraction pole—a protuberance of the zygote’s vegetal pole where maternal mRNAs accumulate. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism where cortical actomyosin network flows determine cytoplasmic reorganization and cell shape by deforming adjacent cytoplasmic components through friction forces. Friction forces at the interface between tissues play a key role in tissue morphogenesis. Now friction at the cellular scale is shown to influence cell shape and cell rearrangements.},

  abstract     = {Viscous flows are laminar and deterministic. Robust linear laws accurately predict their streamlines in geometries as complex as blood vessels, porous media and pipe networks. However, biological and synthetic active fluids defy these fundamental laws. Irrespective of their microscopic origin, confined active flows are intrinsically bistable, making it challenging to predict flows in active fluid networks. Although early theories attempted to tackle this problem, quantitative experiments to validate their relevance to active hydraulics are lacking. Here we present a series of laws that accurately predict the geometry of active flows in trivalent networks. Experiments with colloidal rollers reveal that active hydraulic flows realize dynamical spin ices: they are frustrated, non-deterministic and yield degenerate streamline patterns. These patterns split into two geometric classes of self-similar loops, which reflect the fractionalization of topological defects at subchannel scales. Informed by our measurements, we formulate the laws of active hydraulics in trivalent networks as a double-spin model. We then use these laws to predict the random geometry of degenerate streamlines. We expect our fundamental understanding to provide robust design rules for active microfluidic devices and to offer avenues to investigate the motion of living cells and organisms in complex habitats. Experiments with active colloidal fluids in large-scale hydraulic networks reveal a connection between emergent flows and dynamical spin-ice patterns.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems are high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems with heterogeneous interactions among their constituents. To make interpretable predictions about their large-scale behaviour, it is typically assumed that these dynamics can be reduced to a few equations involving a low-rank matrix describing the network of interactions. Our Article sheds light on this low-rank hypothesis and questions its validity. Using fundamental theorems on singular-value decomposition, we probe the hypothesis for various random graphs, either by making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the exponential decrease of their singular values. We verify the hypothesis for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of their singular values, which has major consequences for their effective ranks. We then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical systems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to prove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and we can connect the rapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction error of the nonlinear dynamics they support. Finally, we prove that higher-order interactions naturally emerge from the dimension reduction, thus providing insights into the origin of higher-order interactions in complex systems. Although using low-rank matrices is the go-to approach to model the dynamics of complex systems, its validity remains formally unconfirmed. An analysis of random networks and real-world data now sheds light on this low-rank hypothesis and its implications.},

  abstract     = {Since the discovery of crispations on a vibrating fluid layer, numerous types of patterns formed on fluid surfaces have been revealed. Here we report the observation of polygonal patterns of Faraday waves in vibrating water containers with parabolic and other concave bottoms. These patterns manifest themselves as simple geometric figures of symmetries ranging from elliptical up to heptagonal, with wavelengths much larger than the capillary length. Hence, they are intrinsically different from the previously studied patterns in vibrating drops or puddles and represent a particular variety of nonlinear shallow-water gravity waves or tidal waves in concave basins. Of specific interest is their resemblance to the collective excitations recently discovered in a driven Bose–Einstein condensate, not only sharing identical square-root scaling dispersion and pattern dynamics but also possessing similar nonlinear features like hard-spring nonlinearity. Based on the close correspondence, we propose an analogue of the patterning dynamics for classical and quantum fluid systems subject to confinement and argue that the analogy is mathematically valid even in the nonlinear regime. Faraday waves are standing waves on the surface of a vibrating liquid. Large-wavelength polygonal Faraday waves are now observed in concave water containers, the dynamics of which bear resemblance to Faraday waves seen in Bose–Einstein condensates.},

However, a crystallized framework used for stabilizing parallel spin alignment through an ordered lattice is indispensable to ferromagnetism. Here we demonstrate room-temperature ferromagnetic order in two-dimensional confined molecule-based monolayers. The confinement effect of the van der Waals interlayer space enables cobaltocene molecules to self-assemble into a monolayer with a honeycomb-like configuration. The spontaneous uniform spin orientation—ferromagnetic coupling—is established by an intermolecular vibronic superexchange interaction, involving a cooperative dynamic Jahn–Teller effect in the confined cobaltocene monolayer. The molecular cobaltocene monolayers exhibit a ferromagnetic transition temperature above room temperature and have a large saturation magnetization. Realizing robust ferromagnetic order in two dimensions is challenging as an underlying crystalline framework is normally required. Now room-temperature ferromagnetism is demonstrated in a two-dimensional honeycomb self-assembly of confined molecules.},

  abstract     = {The Chern insulator displays a quantized Hall effect without Landau levels. Theoretically, this state can be realized by engineering complex next-nearest-neighbour hopping in a honeycomb lattice—the so-called Haldane model. Despite its profound effect on the field of topological physics and recent implementation in cold-atom experiments, the Haldane model has not yet been realized in solid-state materials. Here we report the experimental realization of a Haldane Chern insulator in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which form a honeycomb moiré lattice with two sublattices residing in different layers. We show that the moiré bilayer filled with two holes per unit cell is a quantum spin Hall insulator with a tunable charge gap. Under a small out-of-plane magnetic field, it becomes a Chern insulator with a finite Chern number because the Zeeman field splits the quantum spin Hall insulator into two halves with opposite valleys: one with a positive and the other with a negative moiré band gap. We also demonstrate experimental evidence of the Haldane model at zero external magnetic field by proximity coupling the moiré bilayer to a ferromagnetic insulator. The Haldane model is a paradigmatic example of topological behaviour but has not previously been implemented in condensed-matter experiments. Now a moiré bilayer is shown to realize this model with the accompanying quantized transport response.},

  abstract     = {The transitions from a superconductor to a resistive state in two dimensions provide a valuable platform for studying continuous quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena. Here we uncover anomalous quantum fluctuations and identify an unconventional superconducting quantum critical point in a gate-tuned excitonic quantum spin Hall insulator, the monolayer tungsten ditelluride. We do this by extending Nernst experiments down to millikelvin temperatures. The vortex Nernst effect that we observe reveals singular superconducting fluctuations in the resistive normal state induced by magnetic fields or temperature, even well above the transition. Near the doping-induced quantum critical point, the Nernst signal driven by quantum fluctuations is large in the millikelvin regime, an indication of the proliferation of vortices. Unexpectedly, the Nernst signal abruptly disappears when the doping falls below the critical value, in contrast with conventional expectations. This series of phenomena calls for careful examination of the mechanism of the quantum critical point in the monolayer. Thermoelectric measurements show an unusual form of critical behaviour at the superconducting quantum phase transition in monolayer WTe2.},

  abstract     = {In topological materials, the edge states are readily distinguished from the bulk states. The situation where a topological semimetal becomes superconducting so that Cooper pairs occupy both the bulk and the edge states is not well understood. In particular, we do not know if we can force their pairing symmetries to be different. Here we show that, when supercurrent is injected into the superconducting Weyl semimetal MoTe2 from Nb contacts, the invasive s-wave pairing potential from Nb is incompatible with the intrinsic Cooper pair condensate in MoTe2. This incompatibility leads to strong stochasticity in the switching current and an unusual anti-hysteretic behaviour in the current–voltage loops. There is also an asymmetry in the edge oscillations where, as the magnetic field crosses zero, the phase noise switches from one with a noisy spectrum to one that is noise free. Using the noise spectrum as a guide, we track the anomalous features to field-induced switching of the device gap function between s-wave symmetry and the unconventional symmetry intrinsic to MoTe2. We infer that the behaviour of the gap function along the edges is different from that in the bulk. How superconducting states with different order parameter symmetries can interact with each other is not well understood. Now, the edge mode of a Weyl superconductor serves as a probe for competing condensates.},

Controlling the polarity of the thermoelectric voltage that such a device generates is an important part of enhancing its thermoelectric output. Constructing thermopile devices where the mechanism is based on the anomalous Nernst effect in topological magnets and where one can control the bipolarity is still hard to do. Here we demonstrate the bipolarity of a large anomalous Nernst effect in a series of Weyl ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2-based alloy films by tuning the Fermi energy. We illustrate the bipolarity of the anomalous Nernst signal originating from the intrinsic Berry curvature contribution by systematically regulating the Fermi energy by nickel or indium substitution while maintaining a topological band feature of the Weyl ferromagnet. The bipolarity enables the construction of the Weyl magnet-based anomalous Nernst thermopile that generates large thermoelectric output at zero magnetic field. These demonstrations of bipolar large anomalous Nernst effect in Co3Sn2S2-based films will stimulate the device development of efficient thermoelectric energy conversion exploiting topological magnets. The key to enhance the output of a thermoelectric device is to be able to regulate the thermoelectric voltage generation.

  abstract     = {Scaling up quantum computers to attain substantial speedups over classical computing requires fault tolerance. Conventionally, protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation demand excessive space overheads by using many physical qubits for each logical qubit. A more recent protocol using quantum analogues of low-density parity-check codes needs only a constant space overhead that does not grow with the number of logical qubits. However, the overhead in the processing time required to implement this protocol grows polynomially with the number of computational steps. To address these problems, here we introduce an alternative approach to constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing using a concatenation of multiple small-size quantum codes rather than a single large-size quantum low-density parity-check code. We develop techniques for concatenating different quantum Hamming codes with growing size. As a result, we construct a low-overhead protocol to achieve constant space overhead and only quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead simultaneously. Our protocol is fault tolerant even if a decoder has a non-constant runtime, unlike the existing constant-space-overhead protocol. This code concatenation approach will make possible a large class of quantum speedups with feasibly bounded space overhead yet negligibly short time overhead. Large quantum computers will require error correcting codes, but most proposals have prohibitive requirements for overheads in the number of qubits, processing time or both. A way to combine smaller codes now gives a much more efficient protocol.},

In particular, quantum architectures are often designed to achieve high coherence at the expense of tunability. Many current qubit designs have fixed energy levels and consequently limited types of controllable interactions. Here by adiabatically transforming fixed-frequency superconducting circuits into modifiable Floquet qubits, we demonstrate an XXZ Heisenberg interaction with fully adjustable anisotropy. This interaction model can act as the primitive for an expressive set of quantum operations, but is also the basis for quantum simulations of spin systems. To illustrate the robustness and versatility of our Floquet protocol, we tailor the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and implement two-qubit iSWAP, CZ and SWAP gates with good estimated fidelities. In addition, we implement a Heisenberg interaction between higher energy levels and employ it to construct a three-qubit CCZ gate, also with a competitive fidelity. Our protocol applies to multiple fixed-frequency high-coherence platforms, providing a collection of interactions for high-performance quantum information processing. It also establishes the potential of the Floquet framework as a tool for exploring quantum electrodynamics and optimal control. External driving of qubits can exploit their nonlinearity to generate different forms of interqubit interactions, broadening the capabilities of the platform.},

Maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging at large scales, leading to a reduction in the quality of operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we use inverse design techniques to embed optical circuits in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode mixer such as a commercial multimode fibre. This approach allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, and retain a high degree of programmability. We use our circuits as quantum gates to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions. Their programmability allows us to turn a multimode fibre into a generalized multioutcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. With the support of numerical simulations, we show that our method is a scalable approach to obtaining high circuit fidelity with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode mixer. Light passing through complex media is subject to scattering processes that mix together different photonic modes. This complexity can be harnessed to implement quantum operations.},

Now, the major next step is to channel the potential quantum advantage to solve practical applications rather than proof-of-principle experiments. It has recently been proposed that a Gaussian boson sampler can efficiently generate molecular vibronic spectra, which are an important tool for analysing chemical components and studying molecular structures. The best-known classical algorithm for calculating the molecular spectra scales super-exponentially in the system size. Therefore, an efficient quantum algorithm could represent a computational advantage. However, here we propose an efficient quantum-inspired classical algorithm for molecular vibronic spectra with harmonic potentials. Using our method, the zero-temperature molecular vibronic spectra problems that correspond to Gaussian boson sampling can be exactly solved. Consequently, we demonstrate that those problems are not candidates for quantum advantage. We then provide a more general molecular vibronic spectra problem, which is also chemically well motivated, for which our method does not work and so might be able to take advantage of a boson sampler. It has been suggested that Gaussian boson sampling may provide a quantum computational advantage for calculating the vibronic spectra of molecules. Now, an equally efficient classical algorithm has been identified.},

By encoding k logical qubits into k + 2 physical qubits, this code presents fault-tolerant state-initialization and syndrome-measurement circuits that can detect any single-qubit error. It provides a universal set of local and global logical rotations that have physical support on only two qubits. A high-fidelity—although non fault-tolerant—compilation of this universal gate set is possible thanks to the two-qubit physical rotations present in trapped-ion computers with all-to-all connectivity. Given the particular structure of the logical operators, we nickname it the Iceberg code. We demonstrate the protection of circuits of eight logical qubits with up to 256 layers, saturate the logical quantum volume of 28 and show the positive effect of increasing the frequency of syndrome measurements in the circuit. These results illustrate the practical usefulness of the Iceberg code to protect expressive circuits on existing trapped-ion quantum computers.

Two-photon cascaded emission has been instrumental in pioneering experiments to test Bell inequalities and generate entangled photon pairs. More recently, correlated and entangled photon pairs in the visible and microwave domains have been demonstrated using solid-state systems. These experiments rely on the nonlinear nature of the underlying energy ladder, which enables the direct excitation and probing of specific single-photon transitions. Here we use exciton–polaritons to explore the cascaded emission of photons in the regime where individual transitions of the ladder are not resolved. We excite a polariton quantum cascade by off-resonant laser excitation and probe the emitted luminescence using a combination of spectral filtering and correlation spectroscopy. The measured photon–photon correlations exhibit a strong dependence on the polariton energy and therefore on the underlying polaritonic interaction strength, with clear signatures of many-body Feshbach resonances. Our experiment establishes photon cascade correlation spectroscopy as a highly sensitive tool to study the underlying quantum properties of novel semiconductor materials and many-body quantum phenomena. Quantum-correlated photons typically characterize strongly nonlinear quantum emitters.

  abstract     = {Building scalable quantum systems that demonstrate performance enhancement based on entanglement is a major goal in quantum computing and metrology. The main challenge arises from the fragility of entanglement in large quantum systems. Optical atomic clocks utilizing a large number of atoms have pushed the frontier of measurement science, building on precise engineering of quantum states and control of atomic interactions. However, state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks are limited by a fundamental source of noise stemming from fluctuations of the population of many atoms—the quantum projection noise. Here, we present an optical clock platform integrated with collective strong-coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics for quantum non-demolition measurements. Optimizing the competition between spin measurement precision and loss of coherence, we measure a metrological enhancement for a large ensemble of atoms beyond the initial coherent spin state. Furthermore, a movable lattice allows the cavity to individually address two independent subensembles, enabling us to spin squeeze two clock ensembles successively and compare their performance without the influence of clock laser noise. Although the clock comparison remains above the effective standard quantum limit, the performance directly verifies 1.9(2) dB clock stability enhancement at the 10−17 level without subtracting any technical noise contributions. Noise is a fundamental obstacle to the stability of atomic optical clocks. An experiment now realizes the design of a spin-squeezed clock that improves interrogation times and enables direct comparisons of performance between different clocks.},

Here we report measurements of the rovibronic structure of radium monofluoride molecules, which allow the determination of their laser cooling scheme. We demonstrate an improvement in resolution of more than two orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. Our developments allowed measurements of minuscule amounts of hot molecules, with only a few hundred per second produced in a particular rotational state.

  abstract     = {Current optical atomic clocks do not utilize their resources optimally. In particular, an exponential gain in sensitivity could be achieved if multiple atomic ensembles were to be controlled or read out individually, even without entanglement. However, controlling optical transitions locally remains an outstanding challenge for neutral-atom-based clocks and quantum computing platforms. Here we show arbitrary, single-site addressing for an optical transition via sub-wavelength controlled moves of atoms trapped in tweezers. The scheme is highly robust as it relies only on the relative position changes of tweezers and requires no additional addressing beams. Using this technique, we implement single-shot, dual-quadrature readout of Ramsey interferometry using two atomic ensembles simultaneously, and show an enhancement of the usable interrogation time at a given phase-slip error probability. Finally, we program a sequence that performs local dynamical decoupling during Ramsey evolution to evolve three ensembles with variable phase sensitivities, a key ingredient of optimal clock interrogation. Our results demonstrate the potential of fully programmable quantum optical clocks even without entanglement and could be combined with metrologically useful entangled states in the future. Addressing optical transitions at the level of a single site is crucial to unlock the potential of quantum computers and atomic clocks. A scheme based on atom rearrangement now demonstrates such control with demonstrable metrological benefits.},

  abstract     = {Few techniques are available for studying the nature of forces that drive subcellular dynamics. Here we develop two complementary ones. The first is femtosecond stereotactic laser ablation, which rapidly creates complex cuts of subcellular structures and enables precise dissection of when, where and in what direction forces are generated. The second is an assessment of subcellular fluid flows by comparison of direct flow measurements using microinjected fluorescent nanodiamonds with large-scale fluid-structure simulations of different force transduction models. We apply these techniques to study spindle and centrosome positioning in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos and to probe the contributions of microtubule pushing, cytoplasmic pulling and cortical pulling upon centrosomal microtubules. Based on our results, we construct a biophysical model to explain the dynamics of centrosomes. We demonstrate that cortical pulling forces provide a general explanation for many behaviours mediated by centrosomes, including pronuclear migration and centration, rotation, metaphase spindle positioning, asymmetric spindle elongation and spindle oscillations. This work establishes methodologies for disentangling the forces responsible for cell biological phenomena. Cell division is governed by the positioning of a cytoskeletal structure called the spindle. Two methods, one based on laser ablation and the other on fluid flow assessments, are now shown to be useful tools for studying spindle positioning.},

  abstract     = {First-principle network models are crucial to understanding the intricate topology of real complex networks. Although modelling efforts have been quite successful in undirected networks, generative models for networks with asymmetric interactions are still not well developed and unable to reproduce several basic topological properties. Progress in this direction is of particular interest, as real directed networks are the norm rather than the exception in many natural and human-made complex systems. Here we show how the network geometry paradigm can be extended to the case of directed networks. We define a maximum entropy ensemble of random geometric directed graphs with a given sequence of in-degrees and out-degrees. Beyond these local properties, the ensemble requires only two additional parameters to fix the levels of reciprocity and the frequency of the seven possible types of three-node cycles in directed networks. A systematic comparison with several representative empirical datasets shows that fixing the level of reciprocity alongside the coupling with an underlying geometry is able to reproduce the wide diversity of clustering patterns observed in real directed complex networks. Network geometry is an emerging framework used to describe several topological and organizational features of complex networks. Now this approach has been extended to directed networks, which contain both symmetric and asymmetric interactions.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of detailed maps of physical networks, such as the brain connectome, vascular networks or composite networks in metamaterials, whose nodes and links are physical entities, has demonstrated the limits of the current network science toolset. Link physicality imposes a non-crossing condition that affects both the evolution and the structure of a network, in a way that the adjacency matrix alone—the starting point of all graph-based approaches—cannot capture. Here, we introduce a meta-graph that helps us to discover an exact mapping between linear physical networks and independent sets, which is a central concept in graph theory. The mapping allows us to analytically derive both the onset of physical effects and the emergence of a jamming transition, and to show that physicality affects the network structure even when the total volume of the links is negligible. Finally, we construct the meta-graphs of several real physical networks, which allows us to predict functional features, such as synapse formation in the brain connectome, that agree with empirical data. Overall, our results show that, to understand the evolution and behaviour of real complex networks, the role of physicality must be fully quantified. Physical networks are systems composed of physical entities, which conventional graph-based approaches fail to capture. Theoretical work now introduces a meta-graph technique to uncover the impact of physicality on the structure of networks.},

  abstract     = {According to conventional wisdom, a system placed in an environment with a different temperature tends to relax to the temperature of the latter, mediated by the flows of heat or matter that are set solely by the temperature difference. It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, by using an optically trapped colloidal particle, we show that microscale systems under such conditions heat up faster than they cool down. We find that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling but the respective processes, in fact, evolve along fundamentally distinct pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework that we call thermal kinematics. Our results change the view of thermalization at the microscale and will have a strong impact on energy-conversion applications and thermal management of microscopic devices, particularly in the operation of Brownian heat engines. Heating and cooling are shown to happen along distinct thermodynamic pathways, which makes the former faster than the latter. This finding calls for a rethink of the fundamentals of thermalization processes at the microscale and of devices like Brownian heat engines.},

  abstract     = {Actomyosin networks play essential roles in many cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell division and cell motility, and exhibit many spatiotemporal patterns. Despite extensive research, how the interplay between network mechanics, turnover and geometry leads to these different patterns is not well understood. We focus on the size-dependent behaviour of contracting actomyosin networks in the presence of turnover, using a reconstituted system based on cell extracts encapsulated in water-in-oil droplets. We show that the system can self-organize into different global contraction patterns, exhibiting persistent contractile flows in smaller droplets and periodic contractions in the form of waves or spirals in larger droplets. The transition between continuous and periodic contraction occurs at a characteristic length scale that is inversely dependent on the network contraction rate. These dynamics are captured by a theoretical model that considers the coexistence of different local density-dependent mechanical states with distinct rheological properties. The model shows how large-scale contractile behaviours emerge from the interplay between network percolation, which is essential for long-range force transmission, and rearrangements due to advection and turnover. Our findings thus demonstrate how varied contraction patterns can arise from the same microscopic constituents, without invoking specific biochemical regulation, merely by changing the system geometry. The behaviour of actomyosin networks with turnover emerges from the interplay between advection and percolation. The contraction pattern is shown to be size-dependent with continuous contraction in small droplets and periodic waves in larger systems.},

However, electron charge qubits built on conventional semiconductors and superconductors suffer from severe charge noise that limits their coherence time to the order of one microsecond. Here we report electron charge qubits that exceed this limit, based on isolated single electrons trapped on an ultraclean solid neon surface in a vacuum. Quantum information is encoded in the motional states of an electron that is strongly coupled with microwave photons in an on-chip superconducting resonator. The measured relaxation and coherence times are both on the order of 0.1 ms, surpassing all existing charge qubits and rivalling state-of-the-art superconducting transmon qubits. The simultaneous strong coupling of two qubits with a common resonator is also demonstrated, as the first step towards two-qubit entangling gates for universal quantum computing. Individual electrons trapped on the surface of solid neon can operate as charge qubits with very long coherence times.},

Prominent non-Hermitian phenomena include coherent perfect absorption and its generalization, reflectionless scattering modes, in which electromagnetic scattering at the input ports is suppressed due to critical coupling with the power leaked to output ports, and interference phenomena. These concepts are ideally suited to enable real-time dynamic control over absorption, scattering and radiation. Nonetheless, reflectionless scattering modes have not been observed in complex photonic platforms involving open systems and multiple inputs. Here we demonstrate the emergence of reflectionless scattering modes in a chaotic photonic microcavity involving over a thousand optical modes. We model the optical fields in a silicon stadium microcavity within a quasi-normal mode expansion, which is able to capture a dense family of reflection zeros at the input ports, associated with reflectionless scattering modes. We observe non-Hermitian degeneracies of reflectionless scattering modes in the telecommunication wavelength band, enabling efficient dynamic control over light radiation from the cavity. Non-Hermitian physics enables dynamic control of optical behaviour in real time, such as reflectionless scattering modes, which have now been demonstrated in a chaotic photonic microcavity.},

  abstract     = {Manipulating topological invariants is possible by modifying the global properties of optical devices to alter their band structures. This could be achieved by statically altering devices or dynamically reconfiguring devices with considerably different geometric parameters, even though it inhibits switching speed. Recently, optical nonlinearity has emerged as a tool for tailoring topological and non-Hermitian (NH) properties, promising fast manipulation of topological phases. In this work, we observe topologically protected NH phase transitions driven by optical nonlinearity in a silicon nanophotonic Floquet topological insulator. The phase transition occurs from forbidden bandgaps to NH conducting edge modes, which emerge at a nonlinearity-induced gain–loss junction along the boundaries of a topological insulator. We find static NH edge modes and dynamic phase transitions involving exceptional points at a speed of hundreds of picoseconds, which inherently retain topological protections against fabrication imperfections. This work shows an interplay between topology and non-Hermiticity by means of nonlinear optics, and it provides a way of manipulating multiple phase transitions at high speeds that is applicable to many other materials with strong nonlinearities, which could promote the development of unconventionally robust light-controlled devices for classical and quantum applications. The phase transition from a topologically trivial state to non-Hermitian conducting edge modes can be controlled by optical nonlinearities, achieving picosecond switching speeds.},

  abstract     = {The guided transmission of optical waves is critical for light-based applications in modern communication, information processing and energy generation systems. Traditionally, the guiding of light waves in structures such as optical fibres has been predominantly achieved through the use of total internal reflection. In periodic platforms, a variety of other physical mechanisms can also be deployed to transport optical waves. However, transversely confining light in fully dielectric, non-periodic and passive configurations remains a challenge in situations where total internal reflection is not supported. Here we present an approach to trapping light that utilizes the exotic features of Lagrange points—a special class of equilibrium positions akin to those responsible for capturing Trojan asteroids in celestial mechanics. This is achieved in twisted arrangements in which optical Coriolis forces induce guiding channels even at locations where the refractive index landscape is defocusing or entirely unremarkable. These findings may have implications beyond standard optical waveguiding schemes and could also apply to other physical systems such as acoustics, electron beams and ultracold atoms. Twisted structures are shown to confine and guide light without total internal reflection, using an effect analogous to the stable Lagrange points in celestial mechanics.},

The same interaction mechanisms produce strong collision rates in the normal phase of correlated metals, causing sizable reductions in d.c. conductivity and reflectivity. As a consequence, low-energy excitations like phonons, which are crucial for materials characterization, become visible in the optical infrared spectra. A quantitative assessment of vibrational resonances requires the evaluation of dynamical Born effective charges, which quantify the coupling between macroscopic electric fields and lattice deformations. We show that the Born effective charges of metals crucially depend on the collision regime of conducting electrons. In particular, we describe—within a first-principles framework—the impact of electron scattering on the infrared vibrational resonances, from the undamped, collisionless regime to the overdamped, collision-dominated limit. Our approach enables the interpretation of vibrational reflectance measurements of both superconducting and bad metals, as we illustrate for the case of strongly electron–phonon-coupled superhydride H3S. A computational method capable of capturing the effects of electronic interactions and scattering can help interpret the vibrational reflectance measurements in superconducting and bad metals.},

This is the Kondo effect, originally introduced to explain the abnormal resistivity behaviour in bulk magnetic alloys, and it has been realized in many quantum systems over the past decades, ranging from heavy-fermion lattices down to adsorbed single atoms. Here we describe a Kondo system that allows us to experimentally resolve the spectral function consisting of impurity levels and a Kondo resonance in a large Kondo temperature range, as well as their spatial modulation. Our approach is based on a discrete half-filled quantum confined state within a MoS2 grain boundary, which—in conjunction with numerical renormalization group calculations—enables us to test the predictive power of the Anderson model that is the basis of the microscopic understanding of Kondo physics. Interactions between a localized magnetic moment and electrons in a metal can produce an emergent resonance that affects the metal’s properties.

Here we demonstrate that a spin-half delafossite material, namely, KYbSe2, shows close proximity to the triangular-lattice Heisenberg quantum spin liquid. Using neutron scattering, we identify a diffuse continuum with a sharp lower bound within the measured spectra. Applying entanglement witnesses to the data indicates multipartite entanglement spread between its neighbours, and an analysis of its magnetic-exchange couplings reveals close proximity to the theoretical quantum spin-liquid phase. The key features of the data are reproduced by Schwinger boson theory and tensor network calculations with a substantial next-nearest-neighbour coupling. The strength of the dynamical structure factor at the Brillouin-zone K point shows a scaling collapse down to 0.3 K, indicating the existence of a second-order quantum phase transition. Comparing this with previous theoretical work suggests that the proximate phase at a larger next-nearest-neighbour coupling is a gapped $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ spin liquid, resolving a long-debated issue. A detailed analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data, including the evaluation of entanglement witnesses used in quantum information theory, supports the proposal that the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet KYbSe2 is close to a spin-liquid phase.},

  abstract     = {The notion of quasi-particles is essential for understanding the behaviour of complex many-body systems. A prototypical example of a quasi-particle is a polaron, formed by an impurity strongly interacting with a surrounding medium. Fermi polarons, created in a Fermi sea, provide a paradigmatic realization of this concept. Importantly, such quasi-particles interact with each other via the modulation of the medium. However, although quantum simulation experiments with ultracold atoms have substantially improved our understanding of individual polarons, the detection of their interactions has so far remained elusive. Here we report the observation of mediated interactions between Fermi polarons consisting of K impurities embedded in a Fermi sea of Li atoms. Our results confirm two predictions of Landau’s Fermi-liquid theory: the shift in polaron energy due to mediated interactions, which is linear in the concentration of impurities; and its sign inversion with impurity quantum statistics. For weak-to-moderate interactions between the impurities and the medium, our results agree with the static predictions of Fermi-liquid theory. For stronger impurity–medium interactions, we show that the observed behaviour at negative energies can be explained by a more refined many-body treatment including retardation and dressed molecule formation. Polarons are quasi-particles formed by impurities together with induced excitations in a surrounding medium. Now, mediated interactions between polarons have been detected using atomic impurities embedded in a Fermi gas of ultracold atoms.},

In particular, their large quality factor in the strong-coupling regime has recently enabled the demonstration of Bose–Einstein condensation of bound-state-in-the-continuum polaritons. Here we show that polariton condensation into a negative-mass bound state in the continuum exhibits interaction-induced state confinement, opening opportunities for optically reprogrammable molecular arrays of quantum fluids of light. We exploit this optical-trapping mechanism to demonstrate that such artificial molecular complexes show hybridization into macroscopic modes with unusual topological charge multiplicity. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our technique by constructing extended mono- and diatomic chains of bound-state-in-the-continuum polariton fluids that display non-Hermitian band formation and the opening of a minigap. Our findings offer insights into large-scale, reprogrammable, driven, dissipative many-body systems in the strong-coupling regime. Bound states in the continuum are topological states with useful symmetry protection properties.

  abstract     = {Topological defects play a central role in dynamical systems undergoing a non-adiabatic transition. In solids, topological defects as a result of femtosecond laser excitation have attracted increasing interest not only because they are key to understanding phase transitions but also because they can generate a variety of hidden orders that are not accessible in thermal equilibrium. Despite the common occurrence of these defects in a non-equilibrium system, the fundamental limit on how fast they can emerge in solids and the generic pathway for defect creation at such fast timescales have remained open questions. Here we apply ultrafast electron diffraction to study the reciprocal-space signatures of transient defects in a two-dimensional charge density wave, where simultaneous measurements of both defect and phonon dynamics yield a microscopic view of defect formation in the femtosecond regime. We find that one-dimensional domain walls are generated well within 1 ps following photoexcitation, during which the defect growth is not dictated by the amplitude of the order parameter, but is mediated by a non-thermal population of longitudinal optical phonons. Our work provides a framework for the ultrafast engineering of topological defects that are coupled to specific collective modes, which will prove useful for the dynamical control of non-equilibrium phases in correlated materials. Topological defects play a crucial role in the behaviour of strongly correlated materials out of equilibrium. Now, ultrafast electron diffraction measurements on 1T-TiSe2 shed light on the defect formation process at sub-picosecond timescales.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the origin of electron–phonon coupling in lead halide perovskites is key to interpreting and leveraging their optical and electronic properties. Here we show that photoexcitation drives a reduction of the lead–halide–lead bond angles, a result of deformation potential coupling to low-energy optical phonons. We accomplish this by performing femtosecond-resolved, optical-pump–electron-diffraction-probe measurements to quantify the lattice reorganization occurring as a result of photoexcitation in nanocrystals of FAPbBr3. Our results indicate a stronger coupling in FAPbBr3 than CsPbBr3. We attribute the enhanced coupling in FAPbBr3 to its disordered crystal structure, which persists down to cryogenic temperatures. We find the reorganizations induced by each exciton in a multi-excitonic state constructively interfere, giving rise to a coupling strength that scales quadratically with the exciton number. This superlinear scaling induces phonon-mediated attractive interactions between excitations in lead halide perovskites. Time-resolved measurements show that coupling between electrons and phonons in lead halide perovskites can mediate attractive interactions between excitons, although the interaction strength depends on the specific material.},

  abstract     = {The search for quantum states arising from the interplay between correlation, frustration and topology is a central topic for condensed-matter physics. Recently discovered non-magnetic kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs or Rb) with charge-density-wave and superconducting instabilities may host such exotic states. Here we report evidence that an odd-parity electronic nematic state emerges at a higher temperature than the charge density wave in CsV3Sb5. Our torque measurements reveal a two-fold in-plane magnetic anisotropy that breaks the crystal rotational symmetry. Moreover, in the temperature range between the formation of the charge density wave and a nematic state, rotating an external magnetic field in a conical fashion yields a distinct first-order phase transition, indicating time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results provide thermodynamic evidence for the emergence of an odd-parity nematic order. In addition, elastoresistance shows no discernible anomalies near the onset of nematicity, consistent with the odd-parity order. These findings suggest that an exotic loop current state precedes the charge-density-wave transition in CsV3Sb5. Metallic kagome compounds are known to host several different electronic phases. Now, evidence for a form of nematic order that breaks time-reversal symmetry and is odd under a parity transformation is found in CsV3Sb5.},

  abstract     = {The strongly enhanced electron–electron interactions in semiconducting moiré superlattices formed by transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers have led to a plethora of intriguing fermionic correlated states. Meanwhile, interlayer excitons in a type II aligned heterobilayer moiré superlattice, with electrons and holes separated in different layers, inherit this enhanced interaction and suggest that tunable correlated bosonic quasiparticles with a valley degree of freedom could be realized. Here we determine the spatial extent of interlayer excitons and the band hierarchy of correlated states that arises from the strong repulsion between interlayer excitons and correlated electrons in a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice. We also find evidence that an excitonic Mott insulator state emerges when one interlayer exciton occupies one moiré cell. Furthermore, the valley polarization of the excitonic Mott insulator state is enhanced by nearly one order of magnitude. Our study demonstrates that the WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice is a promising platform for engineering and exploring new correlated states of fermion, bosons and a mixture of both. Interactions between excitons and correlated electrons can lead to the formation of interesting states. Now, evidence suggests that these interactions can give rise to a Mott insulator of excitons.},

  abstract     = {Cobalt atoms on the (111) surfaces of noble metals are considered to be prototypical systems for the Kondo effect in scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments. Recent first-principles calculations, however, suggest that the experimentally observed spectroscopic zero-bias anomaly can be interpreted in terms of excitations of the spin of the Co atom and the formation of a novel many-body state, namely, the spinaron, rather than from a Kondo resonance. The spinaron is a magnetic polaron that results from the interaction of spin excitations with conduction electrons. However, the experimental confirmation for the existence of spinarons remains elusive. Here we present experimental evidence for spinaronic states in Co atoms on the Cu(111) surface. Our spin-averaged and spin-polarized scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements in high magnetic fields allow us to discriminate between the different existing theoretical models and to invalidate the prevailing Kondo-based interpretation of the zero-bias anomaly. Our extended ab initio calculations instead suggest the presence of multiple spinaronic states. Thus, our work provides the foundation to explore the characteristics and consequences of these intriguing hybrid many-body states as well as their design in artificial nanostructures. Despite the theoretical prediction of spinaron quasiparticles in artificial nanostructures, experimental evidence has not yet been seen. Now it has been observed in a hybrid system comprising Co atoms on a Cu(111) surface.},
