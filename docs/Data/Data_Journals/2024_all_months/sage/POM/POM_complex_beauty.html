  abstract     = {Educational equity serves as a cornerstone for a fair and flourishing society. However, existing research consistently highlights the presence of educational disparities between developed and developing regions. Remote learning, a transformative educational approach altering knowledge dissemination and access, takes center stage. Our study delves into the potential of remote learning to bridge this educational divide. Analyzing students’ performance in China’s National College Entrance Examination from 2018 to 2020, we exploit the pandemic-induced shift to remote learning as an external catalyst. Employing a difference-in-differences methodology, we gage remote learning’s impact on performance gaps across regions. Our findings illuminate a marked enhancement in learning outcomes for students in developing regions, surpassing their counterparts in developed ones. Furthermore, we unearth that the digital divide in access to technological resources constrains remote learning’s efficacy in reducing educational disparities. Our study underscores remote learning’s implications and underscores the pivotal role of digital technology capabilities.},

  abstract     = {It is a common practice that business and economy compartments share the seating capacity of a short or medium-haul European flight, with the middle seats in the business compartment kept vacant to enhance comfort and privacy for business passengers. The two compartments are separated by a movable curtain whose position determines the capacity allocated to each compartment. By postponing the decision on curtain position until departure, airlines gain extra flexibility in their capacity allocation. We formulate an airline’s problem of dynamically determining the curtain position and the subset of fare products to offer in each compartment to maximize the combined revenue from business and economy passengers. We show that the airline should offer a business (resp., economy) fare product if and only if its fare exceeds a business (resp., economy) threshold or bid price. We then establish monotonicity properties which are useful in expediting the computation of the optimal policy. An extended model where the airline has the option to offer a free upgrade (from economy to business class) to a new arriving economy passenger is presented, and a necessary condition on when to offer upgrades is provided. Using a large-scale and real-life case study based on a proprietary dataset, we demonstrate significant revenue improvements from postponing the decision on curtain position, compared to the current practice of fixing it at the beginning of the booking horizon. Furthermore, we provide guidance for the implementation of our policy, taking into account passengers’ seat selection and substitution towards lower fare classes. We also discuss the implications of our work in practice.},

  abstract     = {In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical role in productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with complex biological mechanisms, leading to high variability in the process outputs, namely, the protein and impurity levels. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process. However, a common challenge in the industry is the availability of only a very limited amount of data, especially in the development and early stages of production. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited data. In this article, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation process (i.e., when to stop the fermentation and collect the production reward) under model risk. We adopt a Bayesian approach to update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on fermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a Markov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the posterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in decision-making. Our case studies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution approach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving substantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower batch-to-batch variability.},

  abstract     = {Nonprofit organizations amplify impact through relationships with K-12 schools, and these schools benefit from provided resources and services. Nonprofit provision of resources and services via schools is theoretically mutually beneficial, efficient, and effective. In practice, however, schools struggle to make the necessary investments to maintain relationships. Why? Through an inductive multimethods study of 81 nonprofit organizations and nine schools that partner with them, we find that schools struggle because it is difficult to effectively manage the temporal costs of the relationships. Principals, teachers, and staff have many demands on their time, and spending additional time coordinating and administrating nonprofit relationships is a challenge. Intersecting survey, interview, and archival data from schools and nonprofit organizations, we find the nine schools take on this operational challenge of managing temporal costs with one of two time logics , defined as a sociocultural belief about time resources at the school. The three charter schools in our study have a fixed logic that views time as a static resource, while the public and Catholic schools have an adaptable logic that views time as a flexible resource. We observe that these logics correspond to the school’s workforce operations, specifically whether or not they rely on external affiliates, such as district/community leaders or parents, to dedicate time to help manage school–nonprofit relationships. Schools with an adaptable-time logic have more time flexibility for managing nonprofit relationships when they rely on this external “workforce” compared to schools with a fixed-time logic that do not. The evidence suggests more generally how organizational culture and time logics relate to workforce operations. We conclude with preliminary evidence of long-term relationship outcomes from a follow-up survey of the same schools in our original study and discuss the implications for improving nonprofit provision of resources and services via schools.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the effect of cost learning on the manufacturer&#39;s procurement strategy in the presence of multiple local divisions and market competition, and the strategy preferences of stakeholders, such as the supplier. Firms are often confronted with a critical procurement decision: centralization versus decentralization. For this paper, we incorporate the learning effect into this crucial strategy and demonstrate its ubiquity and significant practical implications in today&#39;s technological environment. We develop a two-period model with an upstream supplier and a downstream manufacturer with multiple divisions and examine the equilibrium outcomes under the two procurement methods. The results show that, due to the cost learning effect, the manufacturer might switch his choice from centralized procurement to decentralized one; and the manufacturer may switch back to centralized one when the rate of product substitution is small. However, the preferences of the supplier, channel, and consumers may shift from decentralized procurement to a centralized one. When the product homogenization between local divisions becomes large enough and as the learning rate increases, the manufacturer shifts its optimal procurement strategy from centralization to decentralization. However, the supplier, channel, and consumers are always better off under decentralized procurement. When the learning rate is large, the preferences of the supplier and the manufacturer achieve consistency and a win-win relationship benefiting the channel and consumers. This paper is the first to take the upstream learning effect into account in the firms’ optimal purchasing strategy and advise managers of group corporations consisting of multiple local sales divisions with business expansion needs. Our findings suggest that the effect of cost learning has a critical impact on firms’ purchasing preferences, the profitability of both parties, and consumer surplus.},

  abstract     = {We empirically examine the effect of customers’ social capital on the financial performance of suppliers. Social capital, as captured by the strength of secular norms and the density of social networks in local geographical regions, reflects social influences surrounding corporate headquarters. Because customers’ social capital could constrain their opportunistic behaviors and improve supply chain collaboration through its influence on managers’ moral values and external monitoring, we hypothesize and find a positive association between customer social capital and supplier profitability. The association is more pronounced when customers reside closer to suppliers, have more short-horizon incentives, and possess stronger bargaining power. Collectively, our findings suggest that social capital arising from institutions in local areas may mitigate customer opportunism and highlight its real effects that spill over to suppliers’ operational performance.},

  abstract     = {Two empirical observations motivate the focus of this article. First, stemming from the increased demand for electronics, there is a significant change in the number of substitute product offerings. For example, within a product category, Eaton and Dell both offer remanufactured/refurbished products and new products to consumers. Second, to better manage expenses for e-waste, social planners levy fees on producers or consumers of electronic products. Integrating these two aspects, the key issue addressed is whether the social planner should levy a fee on the producer or consumer and whether such a fee should target one or both products. Through a rigorous analysis of the social planner’s fee decision, insights into differences between alternative policy choices are discussed. As expected, if the producer or consumer fee is levied on the same set of products, there are no differences in the impact on all stakeholders. Thus, the social planner would be indifferent in choosing whether to levy a fee on the producer or the consumer. On the other hand, analyzing current policies (e.g., Connecticut collects e-waste management fees from producers based on new product sales while California collects the fees from consumers purchasing new and refurbished/remanufactured products), we find significant differences for all stakeholders. Analytically, we show that pass-through fee effects of each policy are different. Through extensive numerical experiments, we find that the policy of a consumer fee on purchases of both products offers a greater chance of alignment between social planner and producer objectives; there are regions defined by parameters associated with remanufacturing activities where there exists a trade-off between the benefits to producers versus those for consumers; and there exist regions where the optimum policy for the social planner is aligned with the original equipment manufacturer’s preferred policy choice.},

In addition, research investigating the relationship between upper-echelon leadership and supply chain phenomena is extremely scant. To address these limitations, we collected archival data from 433 publicly traded Fortune 500 firms from 2007 to 2015 (3464 firm-year observations) and analyzed them using fixed-effect regressions. Our findings indicate that female top management team representation directly and positively influences a firm&#39;s supplier orientation. This influence of female representation is attenuated for firms that have a Chief Supply Chain Officer present in their top management team and for firms operating in environments characterized by high dynamism and low munificence. Furthermore, our findings show that supplier orientation mediates the impact of female top management team representation on firm performance. We put forth several interesting theoretical and managerial contributions. Most importantly, we hope that our findings, highlighting the positive impact of female executives on supplier orientation and providing additional evidence regarding women&#39;s managerial capabilities, will contribute towards eliminating bias and discrimination faced by women in the area of supply chain management and business in general.},

  abstract     = {To help small firms secure bank financing, large sellers often orchestrate joint finance programs, linking their small dealers with major banks that lend to all participating dealers based on the information the seller provides. We examine supply chain decisions (pricing and inventory) and lending terms under such seller-orchestrated financing programs. In loan pricing, we highlight a form of financial friction that is of particular importance under such schemes—bank capital regulation. Banks are globally mandated to maintain regulatory capital to mitigate unforeseen loan losses, using either the standardized approach (where regulatory capital is a fixed percentage of the loan amount) or the internal rating-based (IRB) approach (where it depends on the loan’s value-at-risk). We consider a game-theoretic model consisting of a large seller and multiple capital-constrained newsvendor-type dealers, who obtain financing from banks that are subject to capital regulation. The seller decides the wholesale price and whether to orchestrate a joint finance program for its dealers by collaborating with a bank, and the dealers choose their inventory level and the financing channel. We find that a seller should only orchestrate the joint financing program when the bank adopts the IRB approach and the dealers are of low risk. Such a program is more profitable to the seller when the demand correlation among dealers is low, and there is a large number of dealers. Although always benefiting the seller, these programs may hurt dealers with intermediate risk. Facing dealers with varying financial situations, the terms under the joint finance program should be designed as if the financially strong dealers subsidize the weak ones. Finally, allowing the seller to share part of the loan loss could further enhance the performance of joint financing, but only when the seller’s opportunity cost of capital is low. Our findings provide guidance to large sellers on how to orchestrate joint finance schemes, and to small dealers on making their corresponding operational decisions.},

In this article, we study the roles of such sales and effort commitments on the performance of a “supply chain” in which a seller sells its product via a live-streamer. Product demand at the live-show is random while depending on the live-streamer’s pre-show effort and the seller needs to decide the amount of inventory for sale at the live-show. We consider three scenarios, in which the live-streamer makes sales-only, effort-only, and hybrid commitments, and compare the decisions and profits of both parties. We show that the commitment on sales volume or effort is mutually beneficial to the seller and the live-streamer. Moreover, the hybrid commitment can motivate the seller to stock more inventory and induce more effort from the live-streamer compared to sales-only or effort-only commitment. The live-streamer always prefers the hybrid commitment whereas the seller may prefer the sales-only commitment, for example, when the penalty is at a medium level.},

  abstract     = {Live streaming has significantly transformed the landscape of both offline and online retail operations. This article explores the optimal timing and circumstances under which a firm with a specific product should launch a live streaming channel, and if so, whether it should use third-party streaming, self-run streaming, or a combination of both. We demonstrate that no single channel structure is universally superior to the others: the firm&#39;s optimal channel strategy depends on the third-party streamer&#39;s popularity and bargaining power, the investment and broadcasting effort cost for the live streaming channel, consumer&#39;s channel preference and extra cost for watching live streaming, cross-channel spillover, as well as the price sensitivity of a product. In general, live streaming is most beneficial for firms selling products that aren&#39;t highly price sensitive, where traditional pricing tool is less important for attracting consumers. Start-ups should collaborate with either highly popular streamers or those with a small but dedicated following, avoiding those with intermediate popularity. In contrast, established firms should partner with streamers who have a moderate level of popularity. An established firm considering leveraging two or more channels concurrently should additionally take into consideration the cross-channel spillover, channel encroachment cost, and channel competition. Our research reveals that, contrary to expectation, price in live streaming channels may not always be lower than those in traditional channels. Furthermore, highly popular streamers do not always demand higher revenue-sharing ratios and slotting fees. This research sheds light on the key decisions for firms considering live streaming commerce: whether to adopt it, when to integrate it into their strategy, and how to effectively implement it.},

  abstract     = {To encourage small business inclusion in public procurement, the U.S. federal government has established the set-aside program that mandates government agencies to award a portion of their contracts to small businesses. We study whether and to what extent the performance of R&amp;D contracts awarded through this program differs from those awarded through open competition. Analyzing a large dataset of federal R&amp;D contracts, we find that despite restricting competition to small businesses, set-aside R&amp;D contracts experience lower schedule and cost overrun than R&amp;D contracts awarded through open competition. Furthermore, although set-aside R&amp;D contracts experience lower schedule and cost overrun when they are awarded to more experienced contractor firms, this benefit arises primarily from a contractor firm&#39;s experience in executing R&amp;D contracts across different agencies compared to the firm&#39;s experience with the same agency. Finally, set-aside R&amp;D contracts awarded early in a fiscal year experience lower schedule and cost overrun than those awarded later. Post-hoc analysis examining the underlying dimensions of different-agency experience highlights the asymmetric effects of related-agency experience and unrelated-agency experience of contractor firms on the performance of set-aside R&amp;D contracts awarded by the Department of Defense. While related-agency experience improves contract performance, unrelated-agency experience has a detrimental effect on contract performance. These findings demonstrate that small business inclusion policies may not necessarily compromise contract performance. Importantly, they emphasize the need for federal agencies and contracting officers to consider the underlying dimensions of contractor firm experience and contract award timing to improve contract performance and taxpayer money utilization.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, logistics service providers (LSPs) increasingly consider using a crowdsourced workforce on the last mile to fulfill customers’ expectations regarding same-day or on-demand delivery at reduced costs. The crowdsourced workforce’s availability is, however, uncertain. Therefore, LSPs often hire additional fixed employees to perform deliveries when the availability of crowdsourced drivers is low. In this context, the reliability versus flexibility trade-off which LSPs face over a longer period, for example, a year, remains unstudied. Against this background, we jointly study a workforce planning problem that considers salaried drivers (SDs) and the temporal development of the crowdsourced driver (CD) fleet over a long-term time horizon. We consider two types of CDs, dedicated gig-drivers (DDs) and opportunistic gig-drivers (ODs). While DDs are not sensitive to the request’s destination and typically exhibit high availability, ODs only serve requests whose origin and destination coincide with their own private route’s origin and destination. Moreover, to account for time horizon-specific dynamics, we consider stochastic turnover for both SDs and CDs as well as stochastic CD fleet growth. We formulate the resulting workforce planning problem as a Markov decision process whose reward function reflects total costs, that is, wages and operational costs arising from serving demand with SDs and CDs, and solve it via approximate dynamic programming. Applying our approach to an environment based on real-world demand data from GrubHub, we find that in fleets consisting of SDs and CDs, approximate dynamic programming (ADP)-based hiring policies can outperform myopic hiring policies by up to 19 % and lookahead policies with perfect knowledge of future information by up to 10 % in total costs. In the studied setting, we observed that DDs reduce the LSP’s total costs more than ODs. When we account for CDs’ increased resignation probability when not being matched with enough requests, the amount of required SDs increases.},

  abstract     = {In retail operations, free sample trial (FST) and product return with money-back guarantee (MBG) both serve as important strategies to reduce consumers’ worries and valuation uncertainty. This paper is the first study which analytically examines when and whether an online retailer should provide both strategies simultaneously, and when one strategy outperforms the other. We consider an online retailer selling to consumers who are uncertain about the product values when making purchasing decisions. The retailer decides whether to offer MBG or FST. We develop analytical models to examine four strategies: strategy NN (both FST and MBG are not provided), strategy NS (FST is provided and MBG is not offered), strategy MN (FST is not provided and MBG is provided), and strategy MS (both FST and MBG are offered). Comparing among these four strategies, we find that when only FST is offered, the retailer surprisingly should decrease the price if the product cost is low. If the retailer only provides MBG, he will charge a higher price compared with the situation when MBG is not provided. When the size of free sample is very small, strategy NS (MS) is the optimal strategy if the product&#39;s cost is low (high). When the size of free sample is large, strategy MN is the optimal strategy. Then, we extend our model to consider three situations, namely: (a) the retailer offers coupons to consumers to experience the free sample, (b) consumer returns incur a cost, and (c) the size of free sample is endogenous. We find the main conclusion remains robust. Our findings may help explain some real-world practices, such as why some retailers (e.g., Amazon and Walmart) provide consumers with low volume toners to decrease the free sample cost; skincare product retailers such as Lancôme, Estee Lauder, and Guerlain implement both MBG and FST. We also interestingly show that a bigger size of free sample may not necessarily benefit consumers.},

  abstract     = {We assess how a retailer can manage inventories and labor under an extreme condition such as a temporary negative demand shock due to a pandemic or an economic turmoil. This analysis incorporates labor market frictions whereby firms incur deadweight costs associated with hiring and firing employees, as well as the option to furlough labor. We examine the impact of these frictions on a retail firm&#39;s optimal operating policies around inventory level, furlough, and layoffs. We find that labor market frictions condition the inventory and the level of employment in two ways. First, they lead to underinvestment in inventories, which limits recovery and employment in the postshock period. Second, high labor market frictions motivate the firm to conservatively downsize workforce during the negative demand period leading to higher employment, when compared to downsizing without friction. A significant contribution of our study lies in delineating the optimal furlough decisions and quantifying the impact of the furlough option on inventory and labor decisions. We demonstrate the conditions under which it is optimal for the retailer to either (i) fully downsize labor and leverage the furlough option in the labor market, or (ii) maintain excess labor while also opting to furlough a portion of the workforce. During an extreme event such as a temporary negative demand shock, our results highlight the need for a coordinated effort when implementing governmental subsidy policies on alleviating labor and inventory reductions by accounting for labor market frictions and furlough support.},

  abstract     = {Under a relational contract, the value placed on expected future business must outweigh the short-term temptations to deviate for the buyer–supplier relationship to persist. Operational and relational factors that influence this trade-off have been explored, however, there is a considerable lack of research on the moderating effects of supplier and market characteristics. We offer insights into how supplier service models and market dynamics impact suppliers’ decisions to renege on the relational contract. Limited access to transactional and contractual data has restricted previous exploration. We overcome this limitation with a detailed dataset in the for-hire truckload transportation sector. We find that a third-party brokerage service model is better able to overcome operational demand challenges and maintain service due to lower capacity constraints and pooling effects as compared to asset-based providers. Furthermore, when the overall market is capacity-constrained, long-term relationships become less of a deterrent for suppliers to reject business. In addition, during tightly constrained markets, suppliers respond with higher rejection rates to short-term demand surges but not to historical demand variability.},

  abstract     = {In practice, it is common, especially for online retailers, to bundle different products together during procurement to save transportation and handling costs. It is important to understand and theorize how to manage dynamic procurement by taking advantage of joint ordering in the presence of joint and individual setup costs. In this article, we characterize the structure of optimal policy for a periodic review multiproduct inventory system with multiple setup costs, including a joint setup cost and an individual setup cost for each product. By proposing the notion of ( K K , η ) -quasi-convexity, we show that an optimal procurement policy for such a system follows the so-called ( σ , ω , S ) policy when demands increase stochastically over time: order up to S for states in the region σ , do not order for states in the region ω , and order certain quantities for states in neither σ nor ω . To better understand the optimal policy, we provide the bounds for the optimal order-up-to levels and the boundary sets of the optimal policy. Under the convex single-period inventory costs, we also provide a lower bound deterministic system which can be asymptotically optimal as the coefficient of variations decreases to zero. Leveraging these operational insights, we propose five simple heuristic policies: the independent ( s , S ) policy, vector ( s , S ) policy, linear interpolation ( s , S ) policy, the deterministic approximation, and the weighted deterministic approximation policy. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the last three heuristics perform well. In particular, the weighted deterministic approximation policy, whose average performance gap is &lt; 1%, dominates the others in almost all our numerical experiments. Finally, we show that how our results can be extended to systems with more complex setup cost functions, such as time-varying, set-based, and quantity-dependent setup costs.},

  abstract     = {We study the assortment optimization problem under general linear constraints, where the customer choice behavior is captured by the cross-nested logit model. In this problem, there is a set of products organized into multiple subsets (or nests), where each product can belong to more than one nest. The aim is to find an assortment to offer to customers so that the expected revenue is maximized. We show that, under the cross-nested logit model, the unconstrained assortment problem is NP-hard even when there are only two nests, and the problem is generally NP-hard to approximate to any constant factors. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop a new discretization mechanism to approximate the problem by a linear fractional program with a performance guarantee of ( 1 − ϵ ) / ( 1 + ϵ ) , for any accuracy level ϵ &gt; 0 . We then show that optimal solutions to the approximate problem can be obtained by solving mixed-integer linear programs. We further show that our discretization approach can also be applied to solve a joint assortment optimization and pricing problem, as well as an assortment problem under a mixture of cross-nested logit models to account for multiple classes of customers. Our empirical results on a large number of randomly generated test instances demonstrate that, under a performance guarantee of 90% (i.e., expected revenues are guaranteed to be at least 90% of the optimal revenue), the percentage gaps between the objective values obtained from our approximation methods and the optimal expected revenues are no larger than 1.2%.},

  abstract     = {Antibiotic resistance is an ongoing public health crisis fueled by overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The goal of this article is to examine the impact of action-based incentive payments on reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in primary care, where 30%–50% of antibiotic prescriptions are inappropriate. Various financial incentive programs to reduce the rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions have been implemented and studied empirically. However, there have not been analytical studies to evaluate payment model contract design features and the potential for payment models to impact diagnosis decision making. We develop a stylized physician compensation model to study the interaction between a payer and a provider. The payer offers a payment contract, with a bonus tied to the prescription, to maximize social welfare, considering total costs of providing care and social harm from antibiotic resistance. Given the contract offered and their own opportunity cost associated with factors such as fear of misdiagnosis and time spent explaining to patients why antibiotics are not indicated, the provider chooses whether or not to prescribe antibiotics to patients for whom antibiotics are not clinically indicated. We consider four cases: when diagnostic accuracy relies on symptom presentation versus additional diagnostic testing and when the opportunity cost of not prescribing antibiotics is public versus private information of the provider. When there is no information asymmetry, an action-based incentive payment can co-ordinate care and achieve the first-best policy, decreasing the rate of inappropriate prescribing, even when incentive payments can affect the diagnosis behavior. However, when the diagnosis depends on additional testing, the first-best policy results in fewer inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, when the test has high specificity. Therefore, when an accurate technical diagnostic is available, a simple to implement action-based incentive payment can be effective in reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. In the realistic setting where the provider’s opportunity cost is private information, an action-based incentive payment cannot eliminate inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. In these settings, the introduction of point of care diagnostics to aid in objective diagnostic criteria will reduce the unintended consequences of the contract.},

When the firm receives an update, it has the flexibility to revise its initial response action. We model a two-stage stochastic program to study this problem where risk aversion is modeled in the form of a Service-at-Risk constraint. Our paper makes four important contributions. First, it characterizes the optimal recourse strategies given an update and identifies the conditions when the firm benefits from the recourse. Second, we characterize the optimal investment and initial response strategies where we find that the investment behavior is non-monotone. Third, our paper shows an interesting impact of risk aversion on the investment decision such that the firm may benefit from investing in event monitoring at moderate degrees of risk aversion, but not necessarily at low or high degrees of risk aversion.

We show that setting a higher wage can surprisingly lead to less human-driver participation. Moreover, we show that having the option to augment its AV fleet after observing human participation levels can, counterintuitively, hurt the platform’s bottom line. Our findings emphasize the need for ride-hailing platforms to carefully navigate the complex interactions between their roles as supply providers (of AV-served rides) and supply seekers (of human drivers), as failure to do so can be costly.},

We study GB under different power structures (i.e., Nash and Stackelberg) and investigate how the power structures can be endogenized along with the resulting GB outcome. We employ a game-theoretic framework in which two firms under Cournot competition can group their purchases if it is beneficial compared to individual purchasing. We show that under exogenous power structures, when the two firms have highly asymmetric market bases, Nash GB is unattainable due to severe co-opetition conflict, and Stackelberg GB can better resolve the conflict. Our results suggest that power structures may fundamentally affect firms’ GB incentives, and no power structure is always superior to others. We then endogenize the power structures of the two firms based on a two-stage extended game. Using Pareto-risk dominance, we identify conditions under which one firm endogenously emerges as the Stackelberg leader with the rival as the follower, as well as the conditions under which both firms endogenously choose Nash GB or opt for independent purchasing. We demonstrate that the two firms can largely resolve the battle for GB leadership and achieve an efficient outcome in most cases.

  abstract     = {We depart from the classic bundling literature on single-unit purchases and develop a multi-unit demand model in which customers decide both the variety and volume of their purchased products. We integrate product bundling with two commonly used usage-based pricing schemes in the service industry, pay-per-use and subscriptions, and examine pricing tactics that span both variety and usage. Our model captures customers’ diminishing margins of consumption, and we demonstrate an intricate interplay between product variety and usage that enriches existing results on the dominance of pure bundling over component selling in the classic single-unit demand model. Specifically, with multi-unit demands, component selling can outperform pure bundling under pay-per-use, whereas the reversal is true under subscriptions. We also analyze mixed bundling (on either variety or usage) and nonlinear pricing, and demonstrate how to leverage these more advanced pricing schemes for better revenues. Our results provide novel insights into firms’ bundling strategies jointly on variety and usage. Collectively, they highlight the critical role of the customer demand model (single-unit vs. multi-unit) in driving monopoly firms’ strategic choice of product (un)bundling.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of the digital economy, many firms are enhancing product line flexibility (i.e., the ability to adjust product line length or depth) to better manage demand uncertainties brought about by disruptive technologies. Concurrently, the booming digital economy has widened the information gap in supply chains. Retailers/platforms can now gather more detailed data to predict demand, but such data remains unavailable to manufacturers. This article studies how a manufacturer’s product line flexibility influences a retailer’s incentive to voluntarily share private demand information. We show that upstream product line flexibility encourages a retailer to voluntarily share information when product substitutability is low and the product line extension fee is moderate. This insight challenges the conventional belief that retailers should keep demand information private to maintain an advantage over manufacturers. Our work is the first to suggest that upstream product line flexibility can significantly motivate retailer information sharing. Additionally, we show that, although a social planner might prefer to withhold demand information from the manufacturer in the absence of product line flexibility, sharing this information becomes preferable when the manufacturer can adjust the product line length. The retailer’s decision on information sharing can align with the social planner’s in such scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, given upstream product line flexibility, except when product substitutability is not sufficiently high and the product line extension fee is moderate, the retailer’s information sharing decision is unaffected by whether the manufacturer determines the product line design before or after demand is realized and shared accordingly.},

Despite this, there is limited understanding of how these career incentives impact the operational dynamics of the firms involved. This empirical study delves into this gap, revealing that city leaders with fewer promotional incentives are more inclined to mobilize state-owned enterprises (SOEs) within their jurisdiction to pursue sustainable development, as indicated by heightened corporate operational efficiency. Our analysis further indicates that the career prospects of city leaders significantly influence the operational efficiency of SOEs by driving a shift in focus from rapid growth to sustainable development and firms’ adoption of disruptive technologies. We posit that this increase in operational efficiency not only benefits the SOEs but also generates unique value for stakeholders, resulting in elevated market capitalization and reduced stock price crash risk. Our findings carry direct relevance to the ongoing discourse on political incentives and contribute to operations management research, shedding light on the intricate ways in which the political environment can impact the operational performance of firms.},

Specifically, we study the problem of maximizing the firm’s operating profits when these profits depend on movements in the financial markets, and where the decision maker—the firm’s manager—is risk averse. Critically, our framework (i) imposes risk aversion through a generic class of risk constraints, and (ii) considers explicitly the differences that can exist between the shareholders’ and manager’s beliefs about future market risks. Together, these aspects allow us to remove speculation so that financial instruments can only be used for hedging purposes. We analyze our problem in an incomplete financial market setting and consider different informational assumptions. Within this framework, we characterize the optimal financial hedging strategy so that the problem reduces to a constrained maximization over operational policies. Our results show how financial hedging can be effectively used to expand the set of admissible operating policies, and identify conditions under which the risk constraint can be completely ignored when solving for an optimal operating policy. We illustrate our methodology in the context of an exporter firm which faces exchange rate risk in trading.},

First, we study the problem of releasing a piece of good news versus bad news, where a firm may incrementally reveal the news over a preemptive period. We characterize the optimal release strategy for both types of news and show that when the ultimate news is good (resp., bad) and the audience is sufficiently gain-seeking, it is optimal first to release information of a negative (resp., positive) sentiment. Second, we consider the problem of organizing an event such as a concert with performances of known valuations, where an event organizer needs to arrange the sequence of all performances. We show that for both loss-averse and gain-seeking audiences, interior peaks can be optimal, where pleasant and aversive performances are arranged to alternate throughout the event. Lastly, we investigate the problem of simultaneous versus sequential release of a series, such as songs or TV episodes, where a content  provider does not know a priori the audience’s exact valuation of each item. We show that if the audience’s sensitivity to losses is sufficiently small (resp., large), the optimal strategy is to release all items in the series sequentially (resp., simultaneously). Across all of the settings, we show that the audience’s sensitivity to losses relative to a reference point is a critical factor that governs how to design and manage the audience’s evolving experience dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Achieving cognitive coordination in cross-functional teams is a perennial challenge in organizations. It is especially challenging in the context of information systems, where strategic alignment remains a top concern of leaders despite decades of research on the topic. In this study, we develop and empirically validate a theoretical model that explores the role of communicating about performance metrics in fostering cognitive coordination between the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and top management team (TMT). Building on a theoretical lens of transactive memory systems, we hypothesize how the use of unit-specific metrics of information technology (IT) performance and collective metrics of organizational performance can differentially influence mutual trust and shared understanding in the CIO–TMT relationship. Through a survey of 268 CIOs, an experiment with 106 participants using a novel IT leadership game, and an algorithmic analysis of 3200+ articles in a trade publication, we find that communications using narrowly focused IT unit metrics improve mutual trust between the CIO and the TMT, while communications using broader organizational metrics (along with mutual trust) increase shared understanding of IT&#39;s role in improving organizational performance. Our multimethod study adds an important new facet to the rich literature on IT strategic alignment as well as the use of performance metrics in operations management. We discuss its implications for both theory and practice in improving cognitive coordination among the CIOs and TMT. Our model and findings are also relevant to other cross-functional teams where specialized individuals must collaborate to achieve collective goals.},

  abstract     = {Past research in operations management and marketing on inventory levels and product variety has predominantly focused on their effects on brand performance indicators, such as sales and market share while overlooking the influence on consumers’ perceptions of brands. Brand perceptions, encompassing reputation, quality, credibility, and emotional associations, go beyond typical revenue metrics and offer foresight into a brand’s future performance. Hence, understanding the effects of inventory and product variety on brand perceptions is crucial, and that constitutes the main contribution of this paper. Through a consumer-facing automobile search platform, we collect data on new cars’ inventories of more than 20,000 dealerships in the United States from August 2020 to March 2021. We measure brand perceptions using 273,991 responses by in-market consumers collected by YouGov. To address endogeneity concerns, we model the effects of inventory and variety on perceived brand strength using three different empirical approaches: (1) High-dimensional fixed effects, (2) instrumental variables, and (3) causal forest. Across all analyses, we find that inventory has a positive effect on perceived brand strength but the main effect of product variety is not significant. Our second contribution is related to the fact that past research on inventory and variety does not, for the most part, investigate systematic heterogeneity due to brand- or consumer-specific factors that impact the effectiveness of inventory or variety; to help fill this gap in the literature, we investigate the role of two important and theoretically motivated moderators: Consumer income and luxury status of the brand. We find that consumers’ income levels and brands’ luxury status negatively (positively) moderate the effects of product inventory (variety) on perceived brand strength. Our results have managerial implications for effective assortment planning under scarcity, determining the right range of product offerings for luxury versus nonluxury brands, optimizing the customer’s online browsing experience, and targeting advertisements based on brand and consumer characteristics.},

The results provide strong evidence for ESRs being strategic (vs. myopic) in their pricing and effort decisions; and in both cases, strategic behaviour is inversely proportional to customer risk. Moreover, once optimized, commissions are an effective tool for firms to bridge the profitability gap between centralized pricing and pricing delegation. Our analyses on social justice and fairness reveal that customer groups along the dimensions of customer risk, income class, and gender, which have been traditionally marginalized in society, suffer from inequities in the indirect-lending ecosystem. While, the optimization of commissions does not intensify these biases, we found females to be the exception, and that the inequities due to gender bias not only persist in the optimized regime, but also deepen. Through counterfactual simulations, we propose two policies for firms to minimize social inequity, which helps them balance immediate profit-maximizing goals with responsible AI initiatives.},

  abstract     = {The push for more battery-powered electric vehicles, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other global supply chain destabilizing events (e.g., the war in Ukraine) have made it necessary for manufacturers to consider innovative approaches to sourcing and materials management. This study assesses the value of sharing delivery due date updates, which are then used to convert spent time into a fraction of the expected total time for order fulfillment (i.e., progress updates ), to synchronize the delivery of components for an automotive manufacturer who, amid long and variable lead times for semiconductor chips, maintains a strategy of waiting for the delivery of all needed parts before commencing production. Having progress updates in a fractional form puts numerical bounds (i.e., 0% to 100%) on the shared information, and this facilitates closed-form analytical comparisons. We develop analytical models to show decreases in expected assembly-related costs based on the progress update information shared between two suppliers—one supplier has a shorter and more reliable order fulfillment lead time than the other. When there are more than two suppliers, we use a simulation model to estimate the expected value of sharing progress updates. Our results show that increasing the frequency of shared progress updates, and having more suppliers share progress updates, results in increased cost-savings percentages. However, the opposite occurs with increasing uncertainty in suppliers’ delivery lead times. The computational study provides support for the existence of a critical mass level of suppliers needed to achieve a given percentage cost saving. This study can help automakers to make informed decisions on encouraging information sharing among suppliers, by first creating a critical mass of suppliers to share progress updates. Our investigations also help show the conditions in which to best leverage such information sharing strategies while waiting for the delivery of all needed components prior to production.},

  abstract     = {We develop a novel statistical method to estimate customer choice among a firm’s portfolio of offerings when the firm cannot directly observe customers who choose not to purchase any product. This censored demand problem is prevalent in many industries such as hotels, airlines, and retail. Although several methods have been proposed to address this problem, they require some level of data aggregation across arrivals and/or choice sets, which results in information loss and potentially biased estimates. Therefore, they have limited applicability in an environment where the prices of a firm’s portfolio of offerings vary over time and sometimes even across different customers. Our proposed method combines several desirable properties, which makes it a better fit for realistic datasets where the available choice sets or attributes of the products in the choice sets change over time. We consider two additional types of information for identification of our model parameters: (1) additional mild assumptions on the customers’ utility function, and (2) external information about a firm’s market share. We then develop a robust estimation procedure that accounts for inaccuracies in either information type and let the data determine the best approach. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that our approach provides promising predictions of customer choice behavior when compared with other generally used methods and clearly outperforms those methods in scenarios where the product prices change frequently over time. Utilizing a real hotel transaction dataset provided by Oracle Labs, we further illustrate the improved estimation accuracy of our method compared to benchmark methods. Relative to existing approaches for estimating customer choice-based models, our proposed methodology better suits environments employing dynamic pricing and personalized offering practices, such as hospitality or online retailing.},

The firms decide whether to disclose their private demand information and make quantity decisions based on the available demand information, either simultaneously or sequentially. We analyze the optimal production timing decisions for the strategic firm under different information sharing scenarios and find that a pre-emptive move is generally not optimal. We demonstrate that endogenous production timing can create incentives for information sharing and characterize the conditions under which both firms share information, one firm shares information, or neither firm shares information. Additionally, we uncover several interesting implications of information sharing under endogenous production timing: firms are more likely to share information in intensified competition, a firm may benefit from its rival’s superior information capability, and the option of information sharing enhances social welfare, which may also benefit from more intense competition.},

We study a retailer’s strategy for consumer information sharing in a supply chain. We find that a retailer’s information sharing strategy can prevent manufacturers from extracting excessive profit when consumers are heterogeneous in their valuations of the selling product. Specifically, a retailer can achieve a higher profit margin by targeting all consumer segments. By strategically choosing the information sharing strategy to influence consumer beliefs, the retailer can induce the manufacturer to conform to the retailer’s preferred targeting segment through a low wholesale price. Thus, a high-end retailer, whose consumers have a high ex-ante quality belief, favors hindering information sharing among consumers because it enables the retailer to target all consumer segments. Interestingly, deterring consumers from learning about the product quality may generate more consumer surplus. Our main results are robust under extensions such as consumer search behavior, consumer waiting, and multiple product selling. When selling multiple products, a retailer with a large quality variation is better off hindering consumers from sharing information. Our work shows that strategically choosing a consumer information sharing strategy enables retailers to enhance profit margins in their interactions with upstream manufacturers.},

  abstract     = {Digital platforms have improved the efficiency and quality of smart city operations by soliciting more customer inputs, for example, in the form of suggestions. One innovative option in urban transportation is the shared shuttle service, which lies between traditional public transportation and ride-hailing services. Platforms that offer these services can gather customer suggestions in a “crowd-starting” manner, which provides valuable insights into customer needs. However, this also presents a challenge in balancing service coverage and quality to meet customer needs implied by their suggestions. To address this issue, we introduce an optimization framework designed to maximize expected profit by leveraging customer response models which characterize how customers will respond to different service attributes and how their suggestions inform these responses. When estimating these response models, we present methods involving isotonic penalty and shrinkage tailored for handling small datasets. To demonstrate the practical implications, we apply our model to a shared shuttle service case study and discuss practical considerations, such as the value of information, the effectiveness of our estimation approaches, and the benefits of involving customers in the service design process.},

  abstract     = {We consider an order fulfillment problem of an omni-channel retailer that ships online orders from its distribution center (DC) and brick-and-mortar stores. Stores use their local information, not observed by the retailer, that can lead them to accept or reject fulfillment requests of items in an online order. We investigate the problem of sequencing requests to stores and inventory rationing decisions at the DC to minimize expected costs under uncertain store acceptance behavior and when items are indistinguishable in terms of shipping. First, under the scenario that stores are used only when the DC has insufficient inventory, we propose a Markov Decision Process formulation and analyze the performance of myopic policies that are preferable because of their interpretability. We show that the performance rate of a myopic approach that orders stores by cost only depends on the number of items in an order, which is small in practice. We also determine conditions for the range of acceptance probabilities for the myopic policy to be optimal for small-sized orders. Using optimality conditions for a special case of the problem, we develop an adaptive variant of the myopic policy, and propose a new degree-based strategy that balances shipping costs and acceptance probabilities. Numerical testing suggests that the best-performing sequencing policy is within 1% of optimality on average. Moreover, using two years of data from a large omni-channel retailer in North America, we observe that adaptive policies, albeit more complex, are beneficial in reducing costs and split deliveries if acceptance rates can be estimated accurately. Second, we determine when the retailer should ship from stores or ration the inventory at the DC. We show that for single-item orders, the optimal policy has a threshold structure, where, remarkably, the highest priority region is also subject to rationing. We then consider the novel multi-unit-single-item rationing problem, and leverage the structure of the single-unit model to develop a heuristic. We numerically establish the efficacy of rationing models and our heuristic.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturing cost plays a crucial role in suppliers’ encroachment decisions. A high manufacturing cost impedes suppliers’ capacity to encroach. However, cost learning may reduce this cost sufficiently enough to make encroachment profitable for the supplier at a later point in time. Accordingly, he may have an incentive to boost production so as to promote cost learning. Thus, he may drop the wholesale price to induce the retailer to buy more. On the one hand, cost learning may enable encroachment, which may be detrimental to the retailer. On the other hand, cost learning results in a lower manufacturing cost which may translate into a lower future wholesale price, benefiting the retailer. Therefore, the retailer faces a dilemma: should she increase her order quantity to advance cost learning or not? As the retailer may order fewer units in the initial period to limit future direct channel sales, the supplier faces a challenge: should he, instead of dropping his initial wholesale price, raise it to signal his intention of not encroaching so as to induce the retailer to sell a higher quantity in the first period? We model the supplier–retailer interaction as a two-period Stackelberg game to address the retailer’s dilemma and to identify the optimal supplier response. We uncover a new outcome, which arises in the presence of cost learning, where the supplier encroaches but decides not to sell anything through the direct channel. In addition, we find that supplier encroachment may reduce or eliminate the retailer’s incentive to advance cost learning. This results in lower sales by the retailer, which impedes cost learning, leading to a higher future manufacturing cost (compared to the no encroachment setting). As a result, encroachment, which is typically viewed as advantageous for the supplier, may become detrimental to him. Surprisingly, the supplier continues to encroach and sell directly unless he can credibly assure the retailer that he will not encroach in the future.},

  abstract     = {Although risk management is widely regarded as an important topic within supply chain (SC) management, little research studies the contagious effect of risk factors along SC networks. By using stock price crashes as an indicator of risk factors, our study reveals that stock price crash risk can be transmitted from major customers to suppliers with a delay of up to two weeks. We show that the information opacity of suppliers is a factor that potentially contributes to the delayed crash contagion. We also find that the contagion effect becomes more pronounced as the importance of customers increases. Moreover, customer operational incidents have a more pronounced contagion effect on suppliers compared to customer financial incidents. Additionally, we find that suppliers tend to take strategic measures following the stock price crashes of their major customers, including diversifying their customer base, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving product quality. However, among these actions, only the improvement of operational efficiency effectively mitigates the adverse impact of customer stock price crashes on suppliers. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the distribution of risk factors across SC networks, highlighting the critical role of operational improvements in bolstering the resilience of firms to SC risks.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by emerging financing techniques that offer additional financing options for entrepreneurs, we establish a stylized model to compare two prevalent crowdfunding strategies: Reward-based crowdfunding and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). First, we highlight that the fundamental difference between reward-based crowdfunding and ICO lies in the distinct types of price distortion, resulting in different agency costs. Specifically, compared to the first-best benchmark, reward-based crowdfunding sets a lower funding price to attract more consumers to pre-order, while ICO sets a higher market price due to speculators’ revenue-sharing in the market stage. Second, we show that the financing limit (i.e., the maximum funds raised) of reward-based crowdfunding is driven by the platform traffic, whereas that of ICO is driven by the marginal production cost. Therefore, even with numerous speculators, ICO may result in a lower financing limit than reward-based crowdfunding when the platform traffic or the marginal production cost is high. Third, we explore how products’ cost structures shape entrepreneurs’ financing preferences. ICO suits intangible products with high fixed cost and low marginal production cost, while reward-based crowdfunding aligns better with products exhibiting the opposite cost structure. Finally, we extend our model to show the robustness of our findings and offer some additional insights. For example, ICO may amplify the risk of market uncertainty compared to reward-based crowdfunding; Security Token Offerings (STO) benefits from the absence of agency costs between the entrepreneur and speculators compared to ICO while it may suffer from equity loss, particularly in risky and regulated markets, etc.},

  abstract     = {Equity investment in agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) is typically limited to farmer-members; yet farmers are usually cash-constrained. In addition to the common stock that is held by farmer-members, many co-ops are changing their financial structure by raising equity from external investors. This helps co-ops to collect capital, but also brings to the fore the conflicting benefits of farmers and external investors. In this paper, we develop a two-stage game-theoretic model to examine a start-up co-op’s farm-gate pricing and financing strategies, considering two types of external fund: preferred stock that bears a fixed return rate and outside stock that shares the net profit (in proportion to equity) with common stock. We characterize the co-op’s strategies in different scenarios and generate the following insights. First, while both types of external equity outperform the case with common stock only, the preferred stock generally outperforms outside stock due to its lower financial cost, higher tolerance for fund size limits, and flexibility in setting farm-gate prices. However, outside stock can outperform preferred stock if it allows a higher fund size limit. Second, the co-op’s financial strategy exhibits a similar structure in equilibrium regardless of whether it is preferred stock or outside stock, despite their distinct financial terms. Finally, farm-gate pricing has a unique role in co-ops affecting the returns to farmers and external investors, which also highlights the conflicting roles of farmers as both patrons and investors when external equity is used.},

  abstract     = {Exercise-tracking apps are digital tools for delivering personalized behavioral interventions. Despite the growing usage of exercise applications, the efficacy of in-exercise app features in driving usage and athletic outcomes remains poorly understood. To remain competitive, sports organizations now need to leverage tracking tools to efficiently allocate resources and streamline training regimens and interventions for their core assets (i.e., athletes). In response to these operational needs, we examine two specific forms of such in-exercise interventions, namely performance feedback and social feedback. We conducted an 18-month-long field study with 1,037 uniformed group servicemen to assess the effect of these feedback types on running and usage outcomes. Results from the field study provided evidence that these two app features improved the servicemen’s running times and frequency of application usage, on average. Contrary to the common belief that more features are better, the joint usage of two feedback features does not produce additive effects. Tests at more granular levels suggest that users who received both feedback types in exercise episodes exhibit overconfidence behavior by participating in fewer subsequent exercises. The receipt of both feedback may be redundant and can cause user annoyance. Heterogeneity tests revealed that while performance feedback benefited most runners, social features were effective only for already stronger runners. Also, only positive social feedback had a significant impact on running performance. The results further indicate that performance feedback generated a slow but sustained increase in usage frequency, while social feedback spurred quick initial growth in usage but dwindled in effectiveness over time. Implications for theory and practice, as well as directions for further research, are discussed.},

Relocation can yield significant cost savings and other benefits, but there are also risks including potential damage to the brand image. Thus, firms need to carefully evaluate when to relocate and when to stop production in a particular location. We formulate an optimal control model and derive analytical as well as numerical results to provide insights into the optimal relocation timing and production stoppage decisions. We show that factors like higher relocation costs, higher production costs in the relocation country but high brand image in the country of origin, can postpone production relocation. Competitive effects alter relocation timing, particularly when the firm faces direct competition and asymmetric negative cross-image spillover effects with the rival brand in the home or relocation country. The paper discusses illustrative examples and derives implications for the timing of relocation and the duration of production in the relocation country.},

First, in a scheduled carpooling scenario, two MASTER S mechanisms that masterfully blend the ideas of the famed trade reduction method and multi-stage approach are proposed which implement distinct group bid determination approaches for responding to different market conditions. Second, in an on-demand carpooling scenario, two parameterized MASTER O mechanisms that integrate frustration-based promotion to proactively prioritize matching and deferentially compensate riders based on their waits are contrived which also endow the platform with operational flexibility to agilely pursue alterable operational objectives by adjusting promotion strength. We prove theoretically that the proposed mechanisms satisfy strategy proofness, budget balance, individual rationality, and asymptotic efficiency under mild conditions. Experimental results reveal that multi-party carpooling constitutes a multi-win solution under higher rider-driver ratios whilst it could be detrimental to drivers otherwise, which can be ameliorated by favoring the driver side in determining promotion strength. Simulation studies manifest that our proposed auction mechanisms could bring benefits concerning allocation efficiency and service responsiveness compared with their academic and practical counterparts. We also shed light on choosing among alternative mechanisms according to market conditions and operational orientations.},

  abstract     = {Extensive studies have revealed that newsvendor decisions by human decision-makers are often biased by cognitive limitations, and, therefore, fail to achieve optimal profits prescribed by normative models. These biases are typically considered as liabilities in individual inventory decision-making, and much research has focused on developing methods to debias the decision-maker—for example, by providing decision support tools. However, in competitive settings biases can provide a competitive advantage, such that a biased newsvendor may earn a higher profit than an unbiased one. This raises the question of whether and when firms should debias their decision-makers. In this paper, we analyze decision biases that are endogenous rather than exogenous in competing newsvendor games. Specifically, we develop a two-stage game-theoretic model in which competing firms first select their decision-makers typefied by their bias levels, and then engage in a classic inventory competition game. Our analysis confirms the positive effect of the decision-maker’s bias on a firm’s economic outcome. However, this effect only appears in competitions in which decision biases are exogenously given. When biases are endogenously selected, firms are always (weakly) worse off than if they all had rational decision-makers. Our results suggest that debiasing at the industry level (e.g., adopting advanced inventory planning software) could benefit all players; however, individual firms do not have the incentive to do so in the absence of coordination mechanisms.},

Based on the property, the problem can be solved efficiently by reducing it to a single-dimensional search problem. Moreover, the optimal pricing policy has an important property, namely, the product with a higher adjusted markup in earlier stages should always lead to lower prices in subsequent stages. We also show that compared to customers who are myopic, the seller should offer higher first-stage prices and lower second-stage prices to forward-looking customers, which will lead to a higher profit.

The two operations possess random dedicated capacities. The firm’s objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over the planning horizon. We partially characterize the firm’s optimal inventory policy when the two capacities are positively dependent and completely characterize it when only one capacity is random. When there is ample manufacturing capacity, we connect the model with an auxiliary dual-sourcing inventory model and derive a more detailed structure of the optimal policy. Finally, our numerical study provides actionable insights into the effects of random capacities. Among others, we find that approximating a slightly/moderately variable remanufacturing capacity as its deterministic mean capacity or ignoring the correlation between two random capacities under a multi-period setting incurs a limited cost to the firm.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates competition between a branded firm selling a durable good over two periods and a deceptive counterfeiter entering the market in the second period. The two firms engage in a price signaling game in which the branded firm designs its price strategy over two periods, and strategic consumers decide whether to buy the authentic product upfront or wait until the second period. We find that the branded firm may benefit from the counterfeit competition if the quality gap between the two products is sufficiently large. The intuition is that the branded firm would charge a high second-period price to signal its authenticity, inducing more consumers to buy the genuine product upfront. This strategy allows the branded firm to increase its first-period price and demand simultaneously, thus effectively mitigating the time-inconsistency problem. Otherwise, when the quality gap is small, counterfeit competition leads to reduced profits for the authentic product. These results remain robust throughout several extensions of the base model, including partially informed or naive consumers, asymmetric retail channels, post-purchase regret, and endogenized counterfeit.},

  abstract     = {Keeping up with competitors’ prices is one of the top operational challenges in pricing. However, competitive interactions in revenue management have not received much research attention in the past due to their complexity. We conduct a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the dynamic pricing behavior of two capacity-constrained firms under competition. Our experiments initially control for strategic interactions between the sellers and then allow for them. To gain a broader understanding, we also manipulate demand uncertainty and the expected market size. Our results confirm the dependency of dynamic pricing decisions on the competitor&#39;s behavior. We find that the theory is much more forgiving—in the sense that it predicts a lower level of competition among the sellers—than what we actually observe in the laboratory. The modeling literature indicates that the seller with the lower capacity has a competitive advantage, but our results reveal the opposite. Further, there is potential for high-capacity sellers to benefit from competition. Sellers tend to underprice (resp., overprice) their units at the beginning (resp., end) of a selling season. Also, competition lasts longer than the theory predicts, and customers benefit from the biases of the competing sellers. The higher-capacity seller following the best-response policy is not harmed due to the biases of the competitor. However, the lower-capacity seller&#39;s performance is greatly influenced by the competitor&#39;s degree of rationality.},

  abstract     = {We study a multi-server queueing system where a customer is satisfied (and generates a unit revenue) if their queueing time is at most a given constant. If the queueing time of the admitted customer exceeds this constant, the customer gets served, but is unsatisfied and generates no revenue. Such queueing systems arise in the context of modeling service systems where excessive delays are of concern. A key challenge is how to design an admission control policy to maximize the number of satisfied customers per unit time in the long run, assuming that we can observe the number of customers in the system at any time. We call this the binary reward structure system and show that a threshold-type admission policy is optimal. The optimal threshold policy has to be computed numerically. Hence we propose a square-root admission policy to approximate the optimal admission control policy, and compare the performance of these two policies. We derive an analytical upper bound on the performance of optimal admission control policy by deriving an optimal admission policy assuming we have full information over the queueing time of the admitted customers. This is equivalent to a queueing system where customers abandon the queue (i.e., leave without service) if their queueing time exceeds the given constant. We demonstrate that the optimal policy that includes customer abandonment, or alternatively, the optimal policy under full information, the optimal threshold policy, and the square-root admission policy, all exhibit identical performance in the asymptotic regions of the parameter space. Our numerical results indicate that the worst optimality gap of the square-root admission policy is within 3.9% of the optimal revenue, and implementing the square-root admission policy in the observable queueing system leads to a revenue loss that is at most 5.6% of the maximum possible revenue rate in the full information system. We also compare the binary reward structure with the more common linear reward structure where the system incurs holding cost per unit queueing time per customer. In addition, we also show that the analysis based on queueing time is applicable to the system time as well.},

To enable an environment of cocreation, device providers are now renting 3D printers via the 3D-as-a-Service (3DaaS) model. Although prior research has examined pricing and quality issues in the traditional manufacturing setup, these studies have not analyzed such decisions in the 3D printing supply chain setting, where end users possess the ability to customize product designs. Therefore, several important questions remain unanswered from the perspective of the 3D printing device provider. For example, what is the appropriate pricing model for providing 3DaaS? How do factors such as the extent of design customization and the complexity influence the pricing strategy of the 3DaaS firm? Our analysis shows that if the customers’ impact on the product quality is relatively high or low, the pay-per-build pricing model generates a higher profit than the fixed-fee pricing model. Interestingly, we also find that if customers frequently print highly intricate product designs, the firm might choose the pay-per-build pricing model, only if the likelihood of design failure for these complex structures is low. Otherwise, the firm might opt for the fixed-fee pricing model.},

In this environment, economic inefficiency arises when customers are not fully aware of their horizontally differentiated preferences. With its expertise or data dominance, a platform can be more informed about customers’ hidden preferences. We focus on an instrumental social technology, that is, targeting , which is a type of data-driven personalized information provision to manipulate customers’ beliefs about service quality. We propose a Hotelling model wherein customers are sensitive to the delays for service while making Bayesian belief updates based on a platform’s recommendations. When customers self-select their favorite service, their choices impose negative externalities through congestion and welfare loss. Our results indicate that service recommendations allow customers to navigate toward the more appropriate service, thus improving matching efficiency, reducing congestion costs, and enhancing aggregate customer welfare. We further identify the role of “information transparency” and study how the platform should strategically release information by making personalized service recommendations to customers. Interestingly, when a customer-centric platform maximizes aggregate customer welfare, we identify the “value of opaqueness” by strategically withholding service recommendations from a subset of customers and notice that this effect is more pronounced for a profit-seeking platform. Our results offer a better understanding of information transparency policies in the joint design of service recommendation systems and pricing mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The first‐sale doctrine, which protects consumers’ rights to resell purchased products, has been recognized by the US Supreme Court since 1908. In recent years, consumers have begun to purchase an increasing amount of virtual goods, which renders the first‐sale doctrine unclear. There are two main challenges leading to the uncertainty of the first‐sale doctrine in the digital age: lack of proper technology, and economic implications for developers and consumers. The advent of the blockchain solves the technology challenge, as it can track provenance and establish the chain of custody. In this study, we construct an analytical model to investigate the economic impact of trading preowned virtual items. Specifically, our model captures the decentralized nature of blockchain technology by allowing consumer‐to‐consumer trading, and considers the possibility that consumers prefer preowned virtual items over new ones because preowned items may be upgraded between purchase and resale. Lawmakers seek to strike a balance between the interests of virtual item developers and individual consumers. We show that, surprisingly, the introduction of a blockchain‐based preowned virtual item transaction can actually benefit both developer and consumer. The main intuition is that the developer can adjust the price when forward‐looking consumers incorporate the expected future transaction into their purchase decision. Our analysis also reveals that developers are more willing to embrace the secondary market when they can take a cut during the transaction. Our results provide important policy implications to the burgeoning debate of the first‐sale doctrine in the new digital world.},

  abstract     = {Several major on-line platforms operate two channels: An agency channel in which suppliers retain control over prices and quantities and pay a portion of sales revenue to the platform, and a reselling channel in which the platform purchases goods from the supplier and resells them to consumers. These two channels run in parallel and many suppliers interact with only one of them. Although it is quite easy for a supplier to sell through a platform’s agency channel, they must typically be invited to participate in the reselling channel. We develop a model of a powerful platform that can offer a supplier a two-part contract to induce it to participate in its reselling channel instead of its agency channel. When the supplier sells through the platform’s agency channel, we find that if the competition among the traditional resellers is at least moderate and the on-line platform is a close enough substitute for traditional resale channel, then the equilibrium quantities sold through the on-line and traditional channels both exceed the first best quantities. This would not occur if the supplier sold through either the on-line or the traditional channel in isolation. Nor would it occur if the supplier sold through the platform’s reselling channel. As a consequence, we find that when competition among traditional resellers is at least moderate, and both the commission rate and the substitutability between the on-line platform and the traditional resale channel are sufficiently high, there is a Pareto improving reselling contract between the supplier and the platform.},

  abstract     = {The rise of online marketplaces has raised customer expectations regarding customization and lead time. It poses significant challenges to manufacturing firms and prompts a move from make-to-stock to a more flexible make-to-order system. Compared to make-to-stock settings, make-to-order systems cannot smooth fluctuations in demand using available stock. While viewing dynamic pricing as a useful strategy to balance supply with demand, many manufacturing firms can also create capacity flexibility. In that scenario, system costs could be cut by managing capacity and demand simultaneously. In this paper, we consider a make-to-order production environment with base and surge capacity as well as the ability to adjust product pricing. Our main focus is on operational decision-making, assuming that the base capacity and surge capacity are fixed, but activating the surge capacity incurs a setup cost. Initially, we propose a stochastic control model to reflect this complex decision problem. However, our initial model leads to an intractable dynamic programming problem. To overcome this, we convert the problem to a more tractable diffusion control problem. This approach helps to reveal the conditions under which utilizing flexible capacity is more advantageous than relying solely on fixed capacity. When flexible capacity is advantageous, we provide a solution to the diffusion control problem that can guide optimal capacity and price adjustments. We discover an interesting interplay between capacity adjustment and dynamic pricing. In particular, we find that the price, which aims at reducing congestion, may not monotonically increase with the congestion level when capacity adjustments incur a fixed cost.},

  abstract     = {In theory, discretionary pricing enhances company performance by enabling managers to incorporate local information. However, in practice, managers may be prone to behavioral biases that can lead to suboptimal decisions. This paper investigates the effectiveness of discretionary pricing and behavioral elements on pricing decisions via field and lab experiments. Collaborating with a pharmacy chain retailer, we first analyzed a field experiment that delegated pricing authority to store managers. We find that managers began engaging in discretionary pricing after two months of experiment implementation and tended to raise the prices of high-priced drugs, resulting in significant sales and revenue losses. This effect was particularly prominent among less-experienced managers and in low-competition stores. We further designed a set of lab experiments to generalize our field observations and explore possible behavioral drivers. We requested lab participants to make pricing decisions under different information display scenarios and compared the average price adjustments between the direct display and click-to-view designs. We observe that participants also tended to raise product prices, and the magnitude of elevation was higher in the click-to-view group where the demand function information is less salient and accessible. Follow-up lab experiments support our field observations, suggesting that experience through repeated decisions and real-time feedback could alleviate the bias effect. Additionally, participants focused on high-priced products when given a list of items for discretionary pricing. Our results highlight the need to consider behavioral biases in human–algorithm collaborations and provide practical insights for improving information provision and training in discretionary settings.},

Especially, we allow for contract unobservability, where the contract terms between the supplier and each retailer are secret to the rival retailer. Intuitively, given the downstream asymmetry, WD should be more advantageous than the uniform wholesale price (UW) scheme for the supplier. This is true under observable contracts, as we show that WD benefits the supplier and less efficient retailer but hurts the more efficient retailer, supply chain, and consumers. Under unobservability, however, we find that the supplier may be better off by committing to UW. The intuition is that contract unobservability induces the supplier to set lower discretionary wholesale prices, which can outweigh the benefits of pricing flexibility. Consequently, a lack of commitment to UW can benefit both retailers, improve supply chain efficiency, and increase consumer surplus. Our findings suggest that policymakers should be cautious about imposing restrictions on WD. We also consider three extensions for robustness and offer new insights.},

We find that these firms display a more rigid cost structure by incurring higher strategic fixed investments in R&amp;D and choosing higher committed capacity to reduce congestion risk. We also document that firms following the other two strategies on average exhibit a less rigid cost structure. This is possibly because customer-intimate firms tend to invest in specialized resources in small chunks and take on-demand inputs to tailor offerings, while operational-excellence firms may adopt real options and flexible models to achieve production efficiency and mitigate default risk. Our results are robust to using a difference-in-difference approach based on a quasinatural shock caused by the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine adoption and a change analysis based on firms’ internal strategic shifts.

To deal with such challenges, a firm can employ reserved instances with the standard contract length (e.g., one year) to meet the stationary base demand, which we refer to as the base contracts, complemented by additional reserved instances with either standard or shorter contract lengths, which we refer to as the supplementary contracts, to cope with the demand surges. We first analyze a model whereby the surge and inter-surge durations are deterministic, demand magnitude is random, and cancellation of the reservations is allowed. We develop a capacity management plan for the firm including not only the optimal capacity levels, which follow a newsvendor-type solution, but also the optimal policy for managing the purchase, renewal, cancellation, or expiration of the supplementary contracts, which can be characterized as a two-threshold policy. Due to the complexity of the structure of the optimal policy, we also construct an effective heuristic policy by excluding the renewal option from the action space, which can be applied to a more general setting where the surge and inter-surge durations are random. We examine two model extensions: (1) when trades of reserved instances are allowed in a secondary marketplace; (2) when the firm does not have exact information about the distributions of the surge magnitude and duration while it can adjust the capacity levels as data unveils. Our analysis shows that the optimal policy for managing the supplementary contracts depends on the relative magnitude of the surge and inter-surge durations in relationship to the cancellation fee. Moreover, our numerical results show that cloud platforms that offer a secondary marketplace are more attractive to firms from a cost standpoint than those that allow cancellation only. The latter, without the secondary marketplace, however, can achieve parity with the former by offering a deeper discount rate for the reserved instances, thereby bypassing the cost of administering the secondary marketplace.},

  abstract     = {Demand forecasting for seasonal products becomes especially challenging in the case of fast innovations, where the product portfolio is upgraded every season. In addition to the problem of forecasting demand without any historical data, companies also have to deal with frequent stockouts, which bias past sales and provide an unreliable anchor for making new forecasts. We show how one can use machine learning models to leverage information on comparable products from the past together with experts’ forecasts to improve forecasting accuracy. A machine learning forecast using only statistical features results in a forecast error reduction of 24%, measured by weighted mean absolute percentage error, compared to a purely judgmental prediction on data from Canyon Bicycles. Better yet, an integrated human-machine forecast leads to a further 14% reduction in forecast error, indicating that experts’ predictions remain essential for forecasting demand for rapidly innovating seasonal products. The combination of the experts’ knowledge of the future and the machine learning algorithms’ ability to leverage historical information works best in this setting.},

Classic multigeneration diffusion models do not incorporate within-generation repeat purchases, making them unusable for product lines with high rates of such purchases. Concentrating on technology products, we develop a multigeneration sales model to fill this void. We demonstrate that the new model can be used for predictive and prescriptive analytics. Our empirical results show that the new model estimates and forecasts sales more accurately than a state-of-the-art benchmark model that does not account for within-generation repeat purchases, underscoring the importance of incorporating repeat purchases. Furthermore, we use two different versions of our model to examine market entry timing under two main strategies, that is, (i) a phase-out transition strategy in which firms continue to sell the old generation after the release of the new generation, and (ii) a total transition strategy in which firms discontinue the old generation after the introduction of the new generation. Our results indicate that the repeat purchases rate determines whether it is optimal to expedite or delay the new product launch, underscoring the importance of incorporating repeat purchases in market entry strategies.},

  abstract     = {The literature in sustainability has emphasized external pressures as a main driver of firms’ environmental responsibility. However, under similar external pressures, some firms search for environmental technology, while others do not. By focusing on information and communication technology (ICT) firms, we try to answer the question of when firms are motivated to search for renewable energy technology. Drawing on the framework of the behavioral theory of the firm, we propose that a mismatch between ICT firms’ CO 2 emissions performance and their aspiration to a certain level of emissions induce firms to evaluate their environmental performance status—whether they are aligned well with environmental requirements and their peer firms—and their technology status—whether they possess sufficient technologies to reduce emissions—which in turn affects their search for renewable energy technology. We corroborate our hypotheses using data on CO 2 emissions and renewable energy patents of U.S. ICT firms from 2010 to 2018. When we compare two groups of firms—one group whose emissions performance is poor and the other group whose emissions performance is good compared to their own past emissions—we find that the former is more likely to search for renewable energy technology compared to the latter. When we focus on each of the two groups, we find that firms decrease their search for renewable energy technology as the degree of poor emissions performance exacerbates (firms’ emissions increase above aspiration) or the degree of good emissions performance increases (firms’ emissions decrease below aspiration). Our findings have implications for public policy as well as firms’ environmentally sustainable operations.},

Our study is motivated by the common practice of firms conducting public pilot tests or soliciting reviews from opinion leaders before launching a new product to inform potential customers about its quality. To analyze this problem, we construct a game-theoretic model of Bayesian persuasion between the firm and its customers. We characterize the firm’s optimal information policy and show that it can range from fully disclosing quality to exaggerating or downplaying quality to not disclosing quality at all depending on market characteristics. We delineate the impact of market heterogeneity and access to additional information on the optimal information disclosure policy of the firm.

  abstract     = {Firms’ multilevel access to information plays a significant role in improving operating performance. Increasingly, firms are enhancing their operational integration through information technology (IT) as they grapple with intense competition. Competition networks are an essential but often overlooked source of information that, if leveraged correctly, can provide firms with significant competitive and operational advantages. In this study, we develop a multilevel research model of operating performance (firm level) that simultaneously considers the effects of IT for operational integration (ITOI, firm level) and competitive brokerage (competition network level). We explicate how ITOI and competitive brokerage afford firms’ synergy through complementarities and relatedness of competitive actions, information, and resources to improve their operating performance. We assess the model using a 7-year longitudinal secondary data set that includes firms from multiple industries and find support for our thesis that ITOI and competitive brokerage have a synergistic effect on operating performance. Our exploratory analysis uncovers innovation efficiency as a theoretical mechanism underlying the relationships between ITOI, competitive brokerage, and operating performance. Further exploratory analyses with disaggregated measures of ITOI highlight that synergies arise from IT-enabled coordination and integration across the supply chain and within functional areas of an organization. These findings are robust to concerns of endogeneity and alternative model specifications. We make three critical contributions to our collective understanding of the relationship between IT and operating performance—synergy as a means through which operating performance is realized, a multilevel model of relationships, and a nuanced understanding of the relationships between ITOI, competitive brokerage, and operating performance. Overall, we provide a summative view of the multilevel effects of IT on operating performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the challenges involved in production planning in coproduction systems, specifically the production of semiconductor chips for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The production output in this industry is characterized by a stochastic distribution over the targeted production metric; thus the whole range of production is not suitable for a specific application. We formulate a novel stochastic profit optimization problem with random production output and random demand—based on information gleaned from interactions with a large integrated LED manufacturer—and determine the optimal production parameter setting and the batch size analytically; we solve the problem exactly in the special case of a single customer specification, and approximately in the case of an arbitrary number of customer specifications. We find that the optimal production setting depends on the sharpness of the density function governing the production output distribution and the range of parameter settings that are acceptable to customers. We show analytically that even under perfectly symmetric conditions, the optimal production setting is not necessarily symmetrically located with respect to the output range. We complement our analytical results with a Monte Carlo simulation of an augmented model with service level constraints. Our simulation results show that the approximate model that we develop serves as an excellent proxy for the intractable exact model, and illustrates the interplay between production output randomness, demand randomness, service levels, and production yield.},

  abstract     = {While chief executive officer (CEO) competitive aggressiveness can be frequently observed in competitive industries with heavy R&amp;D (research and development) investment, studies on its impact on R&amp;D strategies and hiring strategies for competing firms are rare. This article builds a Cournot-based game model to examine this issue and obtain many novel findings in a competitive duopolistic market. In particular, compared with two firms hiring noncompetitive CEOs, hiring competitive CEOs may hinder rather than stimulate R&amp;D investment when the aggressiveness of competitive CEOs remains relatively weak. Our analysis reveals that despite conflicting interests, firms may choose to hire competitive CEOs. Specifically, when competitive CEOs’ aggressiveness is rather low, both firms hire competitive CEOs to gain an output advantage; otherwise, they hire different types of CEOs to avoid head-to-head competition. A prisoner dilemma occurs when two firms choose competitive CEOs because they would be better off when hiring noncompetitive CEOs. Then, although the presence of competitive CEOs always improves total industry output, bilateral competition brings about the lowest total industry profit because fierce output competition substantially reduces prices. Interestingly, unilateral competition enhances total industry profit when the aggressiveness of competitive CEOs remains rather strong. Finally, this study shows that the endogenous aggressive nature of competitive CEOs does not qualitatively alter these main results.},

  abstract     = {Much of the responsibility for advancing the circular economy has been directed towards firms, yet many reuse opportunities can only be achieved through environmentally compliant, household-level recycling behaviors. In response, policymakers and recycling organizations are using a range of feedback mechanisms to promote household recycling that meets local quality standards. However, the effectiveness of these tactics remains unclear, and stakeholders are divided on the appropriateness of their use. In this research, we examine the role of two popular feedback mechanisms—information-only and information-plus-penalty—in correcting households’ curbside recycling behaviors. With information-only feedback, households are provided with best practices for recycling and are not penalized for their errors. With information-plus-penalty feedback, households also receive information, but temporarily forfeit their recycling services. While previous studies have explored the use of information and penalties as feedback mechanisms to guide behavioral changes, there is mixed evidence of their effectiveness, particularly in the recycling context. We address this research gap by analyzing unique data collected from a 2019 curbside auditing effort that occurred in a large, Mid-Western city. Our analysis leverages econometric methods, and recycling feedback and performance data from 25,359 audits across 11,899 households and 15 recycling routes. We find that information-only feedback mechanisms, while preferred by some stakeholders, are not associated with improvements in recycling quality (measured using household contamination rates). By contrast, our results indicate that punitive mechanisms (i.e., information-plus-penalty) involving cart refusals are associated with significant reductions in contamination rates: that is, households that receive punitive feedback reduce their contamination rate severity by 59%, and are 75% less likely to commit a violation in the future. More importantly, we do not find evidence that punitive feedback mechanisms generally discourage households’ participation in recycling programs (measured using future set out rates). Our study informs sustainable operations management literature by investigating how curbside feedback mechanisms, with differing levels of severity, influence critical dimensions of households’ recycling performance (i.e., recycling quality and participation). We also inform policymakers on how curbside feedback mechanisms can be more effectively leveraged to enhance opportunities for material reuse.},

  abstract     = {In supermarkets, customers choose the unit(s) they purchase, which leads to inventory being sold in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order for perishable products. Furthermore, for such products, the demand for inventory may depend on its age since customers may choose to walk away if the freshest available inventory is too old for them. Despite the widespread occurrence of LIFO-based inventory systems, few studies have analyzed them. In this study, we contribute by developing insights on joint replenishment and clearance policy for a perishable product with a general, finite lifetime using a periodic review model such that the inventory is sold in a LIFO order and demand is age-dependent. The model seeks to optimize two decisions every period: how much of fresh inventory to order and how much of existing inventory to clear. A key objective of the model is to understand the effect of age-dependence of demand on the optimal replenishment and clearance policy. We find that the optimal clearance policy for all but the oldest inventory is a multiindex policy such that between any pair of adjacent indexes, either no inventory is cleared or all the inventory is cleared till the lower index. For the oldest inventory, we show that the optimal policy may have multiple forms depending on how sensitive demand is to inventory’s age. This is a notable result in inventory theory since parameters usually affect only the policy value(s) and not the policy structure. Since the optimal policy has a complex structure in general, which makes it difficult to compute, we develop an efficient heuristic to compute the replenishment and clearance quantities. The heuristic underperforms the optimal policy by ∼ 0.92% on average.},

  abstract     = {In choosing healthcare services, price and waiting time are two important factors that matter to patients. Price is set by healthcare providers, while waiting time is usually endogenously determined by patient choice and the healthcare provider&#39;s capacity investment. We study the pricing and capacity design for profit-driven hospitals offering two types of healthcare services—regular and premium—serving heterogeneous patients who choose from either of the two types of services. Patients make their choices based on both price and endogenously determined equilibrium waiting time. We then benchmark profit-driven hospitals to welfare-driven hospitals to reveal how the behaviors of for-profit hospitals deviate from the socially optimal outcomes in patients waiting, service capacity, and price. We find that fewer patients are treated by premium services in profit-driven hospitals, and thus profit-driven hospitals invest less in premium service capacity and charge a higher premium for premium services than welfare-driven hospitals. These inefficiency distortions exist in profit-driven hospitals primarily because they are incentivized to differentiate between the waiting times of the two types of service to induce patients to pay a higher premium for premium services. Our results also show that if the inefficiency in patient partition is corrected, profit-driven hospitals would choose the welfare-maximizing level of premium service capacity and thus achieve socially optimal results. However, we also find that regulations such as price ceiling and capacity regulation cannot fully correct the inefficiency in patient partition and capacity decisions of profit-driven hospitals. Lastly, the model is extended in several ways to ensure robustness.},

  abstract     = {Although safety within operational systems depends on compliance with regulations, non-compliance is common in many settings. Trucking is a meaningful industry for studying operational safety compliance given that the industry is large and important, truck accidents kill thousands annually, and such accidents collectively cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars. Although the truck driving occupation is dominated by men, significant efforts are underway to recruit more women into the profession. If women are safer behind the wheel than men, increasing their ranks could improve overall safety compliance. Building on theory and evidence suggesting that men have a greater willingness to take risky actions and break rules, we used data on 22 million truck inspections from 2010 to 2022 to identify an operational safety compliance gap between men and women truckers. Overall, men were 7.4% more likely to be cited for a major violation of rules governing working hours (known as hours-of-service or HOS rules) and 13.2% more likely to have a major unsafe driving violation. We then examined whether gap changes based on carrier size and type. We found that the HOS compliance gap is smaller for small carriers (vs. large) and private carriers (vs. for-hire), but not the unsafe driving gap. Finally, we tested whether the introduction of an intervention—electronic logging devices (ELDs) that automatically record truckers’ driving hours—closes the gap by increasing men&#39;s compliance. In line with predictions, differences between men and women disappeared after the mandate; but again, only for HOS compliance. Surprisingly, women had significantly more HOS violations in 2021 and 2022 than men—an outcome that may be tied to women truckers’ personal safety issues. In summary, the results and additional robustness checks indicate that men committed more unsafe driving violations (e.g., speeding) than women across the entire study period, while the pattern of HOS violations varied based on external events. We conclude by highlighting possible pathways for reducing the number of collisions involving trucks and thus lowering the number of fatalities and extent of economic losses.},

  abstract     = {To alleviate the financial shortage for public service provision, a government agency may jointly finance, own, and run a service system with a private firm (in the manner of a joint venture) or delegate service provision to the firm subject to regulation in service price or wait time. We model the service system as a queueing system in which customers are heterogeneous in service valuation and sensitive to price and delay. While the government aims to maximize social welfare, the firm’s goal is to maximize profit. Hence, the joint venture has the objective of a mix of profit maximization and social welfare creation. Under the regulation, two types of interaction between the government and the firm, that is, sequential move (in the absence of the government’s myopic adjustment) and simultaneous move (in the presence of myopic adjustment), are considered. We find that while wait time regulation is more efficient than price regulation in the presence of myopic adjustment, the relationship is reversed in the absence of myopic adjustment. Somewhat surprisingly, price regulation with myopic adjustment may backfire. However, in some instances, the government must take a large share in a joint venture to achieve the same performance under price regulation without myopic adjustment. Our work uncovers whether the government adopts myopic adjustment plays a critical role in choosing the regulation instrument.},

  abstract     = {Many firms that offer home delivery of products purchased online now provide consumers the option of subscribing to a membership plan for free delivery of limited or unlimited number of orders instead of customers paying delivery charges for each order. This paper seeks to understand the benefits to firms and consumers of introducing such free-delivery subscription (FDS) plans to complement their traditional pay-for-delivery (PFD) option, characterize the firm&#39;s optimal FDS subscription pricing strategy, and study the effects of product, consumer, and market characteristics on the subscription fees and firm&#39;s profits. We develop and analyze an economic model that incorporates salient features of product delivery settings that prior models of subscription pricing do not fully capture. The features include simultaneous availability of PFD and FDS options, lift in a consumer&#39;s demand when she switches from PFD to FDS, the possibility of attracting new consumers when the firm introduces FDS, and order batching by customers due to per-order delivery charges and free-delivery order allowances. Our utility-based approach to model consumers’ purchasing choices incorporates consumer heterogeneity both in terms of their utility for the product and their shopping preference under the PFD option. For homogeneous consumers, we show that introducing a FDS plan raises the firm&#39;s profit, establish the optimality of offering unlimited free-delivery allowance, and analyze comparative statics. With multiple customer types, our analysis of two subscription pricing strategies for FDS plans—a single “Universal” plan and multiple “Tiered” plans with varying subscription fees and free-delivery limits—leads to several interesting insights on delivery pricing strategies, as well as drivers and sensitivity of the optimal policy, profits, and number of subscribers. We supplement this analysis with extensive computational experiments that reveal a substantial increase in profits when a firm adds one or more FDS plans to its PFD option even though the optimal subscription fee(s) only covers part of the firm&#39;s actual shipping costs. These results also permit us to gauge the influence and understand the trends in the profitability of the Universal and Tiered plans as various parameters change.},

  abstract     = {Fashion sellers are sometimes critiqued for selling low durability products, resulting in waste. Blame is also directed at consumers, who purchase new fashions despite having accumulated a closet full of prior fashions. The “slow fashion” movement encourages sellers to produce higher durable products, thus supporting less frequent purchases by consumers. Using an infinite-time model and considering strategic consumer behavior, including their ability to accumulate a “closet” of varieties over time, we analyze the seller’s profit-maximizing price and product-durability decisions. We initially assume a static price but later analyze the potential profit gains from dynamic pricing. When analyzing a heterogeneous consumer market, we initially allow customers to vary (distributed uniformly) in their sensitivity to fashion. Subsequently, we explore alternative distributions for consumers’ fashion sensitivity and the correlation between their fashion sensitivities and product valuations. Using this framework, we show how the seller’s optimal price and durability decisions yield distinct shopping segments, which we refer to as the minimalist versus trend-chasers. We find that if the degree of fashion uncertainty is moderate, the seller’s optimal choice of product durability will support the emergence of both behaviors. As the variety uncertainty expands, if the seller’s costs are sufficiently low, it will support a throwaway culture via disposable products. Otherwise, given high costs, the seller optimally targets a slow fashion-type outcome, with consumers targeting reuse (with durability) rather than variety. Our findings shed light on consumers’ optimal purchasing behaviors in relation to both market parameters and the firm’s pricing and durability decisions.},

  abstract     = {Due to the U.S.-China trade war, multinational firms may develop new contract manufacturers outside China to hedge against high tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. market. However, tariffs exhibit high uncertainty in recent years and developing a contract manufacturer incurs costs; hence, it is challenging to decide whether to develop a new contract manufacturer. We study two competing firms’ contract manufacturer development decisions in a sequential game. First, we find that multinational firms prefer to develop new contract manufacturers when tariffs are expected to rise moderately rather than sharply. This is because the value of developing a new contract manufacturer for a multinational firm is the largest when the new contract manufacturer and the existing one compete most intensely, which happens for similar tariff-inclusive costs. This implies, when taking into account competition, an overly high tariff on Chinese exports to the United States does not necessarily serve the purpose of switching suppliers from China to other regions. Furthermore, higher tariff uncertainty can decrease development value and hence the incentive to develop a contract manufacturer. When there is an upward tariff shock that induces the equilibrium where both multinational firms develop a contract manufacturer, both firms must be worse off; only when it induces the asymmetric development equilibrium is it possible for the multinational firm developing a contract manufacturer to be better off, even with tariff increase and development cost. Second, the impact of development cost on multinational firms’ incentives to develop new contract manufacturers is nonmonotone. As the development cost increases, the equilibrium can switch from both not developing new contract manufacturers to one developing a new contract manufacturer. Third, when the future tariff is expected to be high, multinational firms should diversify their development strategies in environments with fierce competition. Furthermore, increasing competition is not necessarily harmful for multinational firms. We also extend the analysis to consider asymmetric development costs and unobservable wholesale prices, and find the major insights are robust.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates how to sustain process improvement (PI) initiatives in healthcare. Despite the abundant knowledge on PI, we know very little on why and how PI sustains over time. This is particularly true in the context of heterogeneous frontline teams of physicians and nurses with different operational characteristics such as attrition rates, skill sets, training, and goals. Our study builds a model that simulates the mutual, dynamic interaction of these stakeholders with each other and with processes with different characteristics in the presence of endogenous management prioritization. We build confidence in the model by calibrating it to data from PI teams at several family medicine clinics at a large US Midwestern healthcare system. The computational experiments performed using data from these teams yield several important insights for theory and practice. First, we find that process metrics, which are leading metrics related to the day-to-day functioning of the units, and outcome metrics, which are lagging metrics often tied to the unit&#39;s bottom line, are both critical for the functioning of the PI teams. Emphasizing one over the other can reduce sustainability while a mixed case in which one group of employees is incentivized to leading and another group to lagging can create a regime that is more effective in many scenarios. Second, we find that management interventions that improve short-term PI gains generally also reduce the likelihood of long-run sustainment. Third, we find that attrition and turnover among the team members affect sustainability of PI initiatives and reducing turnover for one class of employee, which attends lagging metrics, facilitates sustainment while reducing it for the other class, which attends leading metrics, can hinder sustainment. We conclude by discussing these implications to the practice of PI among healthcare teams.},

  abstract     = {Governments across the developing world are adopting digital technologies to improve the performance of public sector supply chains. However, empirical evidence regarding the impact of these technologies on performance is mixed. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using biometric authentication (BA) devices on the performance of India’s food security program. The program aims to deliver subsidized food grains to nearly 160 million low-income households through approximately 500,000 fair price shops (FPSs). Nearly half of those grains do not reach the beneficiaries and are diverted to the open market for private benefit. We estimate the impact of installing BA devices on reducing diversion in more than 3,300 FPSs in the Indian state of Karnataka between 2013 and 2015 using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that BA devices reduce up to 4% of the current diversion at the last mile. We argue that this relatively low impact is due to the presence of a workaround mechanism which results in imperfect monitoring and validate the decrease in diversion mechanism by estimating the differential impact of BA devices. We complement the empirical analysis with a simulation exercise to estimate the additional value that can be unlocked by using the BA devices. We find that the value of better replenishment planning using sales and inventory information captured by BA devices can be significant. The value of better planning can be as high as six times the value of reduction in diversion, depending on the preintervention levels of demand from genuine beneficiaries and diversion at the FPSs.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the trend that a gray market such as overseas shopping is thriving on E-commerce platforms, this paper investigates the impacts of the gray market on global supply chain management. We consider a multinational firm (MNF) that outsources product manufacturing to a contract manufacturer (CM) in China and sells products in both the China market and overseas market. Owing to the price gap between the two markets, gray firms may purchase products in the low-price market and compete with the MNF in the high-price market. We build MNF-led Stackelberg game models under the two cases where the wholesale price between the CM and MNF is exogenously given or endogenously set by the CM. We also consider the impacts of China’s partial value-added tax (VAT) refund policy and consumers’ valuation discount for gray products. Our analysis shows that the gray market emerges if the two markets are highly asymmetric in size. Moreover, the gray market is more likely to emerge with lower values of valuation discount, substitutability, and VAT loss. We find that both the MNF and CM may be better off with the emergence of the gray market. When the gray market does not emerge but poses a threat, the MNF strategically adjusts her global pricing strategy to prevent the gray market. In this case, the threat of the gray market always hurts the MNF and CM under exogenous wholesale price, but may improve the MNF’s profit under endogenous wholesale price, since the CM is motivated to lower wholesale price to restore demand.},

  abstract     = {Government plays a critical role in developing and adopting new products with social benefits. We study how the government should mix two different subsidies—a technology-push subsidy, which awards manufacturers for cost-reducing R&amp;D efforts, and a demand-pull subsidy, which directly rewards customers—when multiple firms compete in the presence of spillover. We develop a model with the government and two firms: The government first announces a subsidy policy, then the two firms decide R&amp;D investments to reduce production costs and sell the products. We analyze how the optimal subsidy policy and resultant market outcomes change in the social benefit of the product and the spillover level. We find that the government should use a different subsidy policy depending on the social benefit of the product. When the social benefit is low, no subsidy should be given, letting the two firms make discretionary R&amp;D efforts without any inducement. When the social benefit is modest, the government should only give a push subsidy and let the firms lead production adoptions with cost-reducing R&amp;D. When the social benefit is large, the government should provide both subsidies, but the dependence on the pull subsidy increases. We also study how the spillover level influences the optimal subsidy. As knowledge spillover increases, we find that the government should increase the push subsidy to offset the losses incurred by the cost leader. We contribute to the literature by offering policy insights on how the government should design subsidies to maximize the adoption of products with social benefits.},

  abstract     = {The sponsorship of sports or entertainment events is a long-established marketing promotion technique. The goals of sponsoring these events are to generate exposure and to transfer brand equity. A more assertive type of sponsored competition is when the competition is built around the products and brands of the sponsoring firm. The number of firms using sponsored product-based competitions (SPCs) is rising. Firms invest in these competitions to create content that highlights the capabilities of their products and build committed fan bases. However, evaluating the economic value of this type of sponsorship activity is challenging due to the absence of a direct link between event viewing and subsequent product consumption. We present an empirical approach to investigate the impacts of SPC on customer engagement using esports viewing and video game consumption data. We find that sponsored competitions provide firms with substantial benefits. Specifically, the results suggest that viewing an SPC event (i.e., esports competition) reduces consumers’ time between game plays by 3.2% (i.e., increased visit frequency), increases per-visit duration by 3.5%, and boosts the paid content purchase rate by 26%. These findings are corroborated using an alternate dataset from a second esports event from the game publisher. We find that the effect of an SPC event viewing is a nonlinear function of consumer expertise and is more pronounced among customers less familiar with the video game product category. In a supplementary analysis, we also identify an educational role of SPC that may explain the observed incremental consumption. The analyses reveal that esports audiences tend to choose frequently featured game characters with superior performance during the event. In addition, we find that when event viewers play the game with these characters, their performance improves. The results have substantial implications for event sponsorship management and follow-up product promotions.},

  abstract     = {The flexibility of choosing the ad action as a function of the consumer state is critical for modern-day marketing campaigns. We study the problem of identifying the optimal sequential personalized interventions that maximize the adoption probability for a new product. We model consumer behavior by a conversion funnel that captures the state of each consumer (e.g., interaction history with the firm) and allows the consumer behavior to vary as a function of both her state and firm’s sequential interventions. We show our model captures consumer behavior with very high accuracy (out-of-sample area under the curve of over 0.95) in a real-world email marketing dataset. However, it results in a very large-scale learning problem, where the firm must learn the state-specific effects of various interventions from consumer interactions. We propose a novel attribution-based decision-making algorithm for this problem that we call model-free approximate Bayesian learning . Our algorithm inherits the interpretability and scalability of Thompson sampling for bandits and maintains an approximate belief over the value of each state-specific intervention. The belief is updated as the algorithm interacts with the consumers. Despite being an approximation to the Bayes update, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm and analyze its convergence rate. We show that our algorithm significantly outperforms traditional approaches on extensive simulations calibrated to a real-world email marketing dataset.},

  abstract     = {Durable goods customers expect long-term availability of spare parts to maintain their product. This puts a strain on supply chains. Part suppliers want to obsolete older generations of parts with declining demand and reassign resources to new, growing generations. Meanwhile, durable goods manufacturers that purchase and sell spare parts to customers want suppliers to keep producing old parts. When suppliers offer a “last time buy” opportunity for legacy parts in anticipation of their retirement, manufacturers push back. We study the strategic interaction and equilibria of a supplier and a manufacturer during the rollover between a legacy part and its successor in a durable good supply chain. Evidence from our interviews shows that manufacturers attempt to use the future business of the new part to delay a supplier’s last time buy of the old part. However, this tactic is often ineffective in practice. We propose a two-stage noncooperative game that reproduces the behaviors observed in interviews. Our analysis of this game distills the conditions under which a manufacturer can leverage the future business to delay a last time buy. There exist only six strategies that achieve this delay. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for these six strategies to be subgame perfect Nash equilibria. The condition reduces to a closed-form threshold on the new part volume. We conclude with practical insights that can guide managers during a rollover discussion.},

We allow customers to make strategic joining decisions based on their anticipated delays under an information structure where walk-ins observe partial queue length information. We draw from a wide array of techniques, including steady-state, transient, busy period, hitting-time analyses, and matrix analytic methods. We showcase the significance of prioritization on the system throughput and social welfare. We demonstrate settings where a traditional service system’s (typically beneficial) transformation to an omnichannel reduces throughput. Our analysis highlights the importance of prioritization policy choice for an efficient transition to an omnichannel service system. The throughput-optimal policy choice highly depends on the operational parameters and customer patience levels; implementing a wrong policy can yield a significant loss in throughput and profitability.},

  abstract     = {This study examines two retailer-initiated pre-shipment financing programs to assist capital-constrained suppliers in securing external funds for production. The first program is retailer-sponsored financing (RSF), an emerging practice in developing economies. Under RSF, the retailer commits to sharing the loan repayment obligation with the supplier by agreeing to pay up to a specific portion of the supplier’s bank loan repayment. The second program is advance payment (AP), a common payment arrangement wherein the retailer pays a part of the wholesale amount upfront to support the supplier’s production costs. We analyze a supply chain comprising a supplier and retailer. The retailer must choose between offering RSF, AP, or neither. Without RSF or AP, the supplier must opt for bank-direct financing when it is short of funds and bear the full responsibility of repaying the loan principal and interest. Our findings reveal a divergence in supplier and retailer preferences. Specifically, the supplier favors RSF as it not only lowers the marginal production cost but also permits the supplier to charge a higher risk premium to the retailer compared to AP. Conversely, the retailer prefers AP primarily due to the latter reason. Our research underscores the significance of RSF as a distinct financing alternative, enabling retailers to aid a supplier segment that cannot rely solely on AP. RSF also proves to be advantageous for banks by expanding their supplier clientele and boosting their lending volume. Interestingly, the supplier’s and retailer’s bankruptcy risks tend to have opposite impacts on the value of RSF.},

In contrast to the classic inventory literature, we assume that the information of the demand distribution is not known a priori, and the decision-maker observes demand realizations over the planning horizon. We propose a nonparametric algorithm that generates a sequence of adaptive ordering decisions based on the stochastic gradient descent method. We compare the T -period cost of our algorithm to the clairvoyant, who knows the underlying demand distribution in advance, and we prove that the expected T -period regret is at most O ( T ) , matching a lower bound for this problem.},

  abstract     = {Fuel is an essential commodity in society with an amplified role during disasters. Disasters often cause a spike in demand for fuel and impose physical and operational constraints on fuel distribution. Accordingly, public and private sector stakeholders seek disaster preparedness and response interventions to ensure an adequate supply of fuel for emergency activities. We develop models to quantify downstream operational flow capacity, i.e., the volume of fuel that can be distributed from bulk storage terminals to retail gas stations via tanker trucks. We do this for both steady state conditions and nonsteady state conditions during disasters. The operational flow capacity measures can serve as inputs to optimal relief distribution and resource allocation problems, as well as enable a cost-benefit assessment of interventions aimed at increasing system capacity. We identify the best interventions for each type of bulk storage terminal structure and determine how to prioritize bulk storage terminals for each type of intervention when resources are limited. As the downstream fuel distribution system from bulk storage terminals to retail gas stations is similar across regions, our methodology and insights are generalizable not only within the US but also in countries with comparable distribution systems. To demonstrate impact on practice, we present a case study drawn from the application of our methodology to support US federal disaster preparedness. More generally, we contribute to system level understanding of multiserver tandem cyclic queues with time-limited customers found in relief distribution systems, which is often overlooked in the disaster management literature.},

By analyzing data from 8,087 unique manufacturing firms and 1,546,216 patents over a 30-year timeframe, we find that a higher level of service activity results in a higher level of patented innovation, which is stronger for contact-intensive and knowledge-intensive services. Post hoc analyses reveal that such innovations tend to be more radical in nature and depart from the firm&#39;s historical innovation patterns. Our study offers a critical managerial insight that, to maximize their innovation potential, manufacturers should expand into high-contact, knowledge-intensive services and treat their service operations as strategic market intelligence media.},

  abstract     = {Hospital-physician integration has been increasingly considered a potential solution for the underlying challenges hospitals face as they are adapting to value-based healthcare services. We adopt an activity-based measure of integration (ABI) to investigate the relationship between integration and care outcomes, namely in-hospital mortality risk, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission risk. ABI is measured based on a group of physicians who handle a specific procedure, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), that is, CABG physicians, and is operationalized as the proportion of cases handled by the CABG physicians who single-site (or concentrate all their activity) at a focal hospital. To test hypotheses that posit a U-shaped relationship between ABI and patient care outcomes, we utilize patient-visit level information for Florida patients who underwent cardiac surgery performed by CABG physicians during 2011–2014. We find that ABI has a U-shaped relationship with both mortality risk and LOS, such that patient mortality risk and LOS are minimized at ABI tipping points of about 55%. In contrast, 30-day readmission risk continues to decrease as ABI increases. We also find that hospital teaching status and bed utilization moderate the relationship between ABI and LOS, such that the U-shaped relationship is flatter, basically linear in teaching and/or high-utilization hospitals. Our results suggest that a medium level of integration could be desirable, since a strategy of high integration trades off potentially higher patient volumes and revenues for suboptimal care outcomes. Overall, this study offers new insights for theory and practice, as the non-linear association between integration and care outcomes has not been investigated previously.},

More specifically, we provide an operating policy for Depository Institutions (DIs) to improve their efficiency in packaging, distributing, coordinating, and managing the inventory of coins. We further propose a new policy (via a Rewards Program) to increase coin circulation in the economy and optimally determine a reward price, which, if implemented by the Federal Reserve System (FRS), can incentivize DIs to process the coins themselves and/or frequently deposit excess coins at the FRS. We identify the structures of DIs’ best response to the reward price and FRS’s optimal pricing policy. The results and insights developed in this study can be beneficial to both the FRS and DIs in increasing the efficiency of the nation’s coin circulation and thereby reducing their operating costs. Additionally, to estimate the societal benefit from the Rewards Program, we formulate the coin flow for an entire FRS region as an optimization problem from the supply side perspective and quantify the societal costs (and benefits) with and without the reward. We show via numerical experiments that both the FRS and Dis reduce their operating costs as a result of the program and produce a surplus benefit for the society. The reward price that maximizes this surplus is determined optimally. We also propose a robust optimization framework to help DIs and the FRS to manage their inventory under uncertain demand while attaining their cost reduction goals.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between product variety and sales has been extensively researched, but almost exclusively from the perspective of a new goods retail firm. Closed-loop supply chains for used goods, such as automobiles, offer unique challenges in terms of using reverse flows to create product variety at the retail location. Firms in used goods industries are unable to define their product mix a priori and may not even know which goods will be available to add to their sellable inventory. In this article, we use data from a used automobile retailer to explore these issues. A better understanding of the relationship between variety and sales can help used automobile retailers improve how they define and structure product variety at retail locations. Improved management of used automobile sales has obvious financial implications, but it also has important environmental implications, given the large contribution of passenger vehicles to overall emissions. This study implements a cluster analysis using consumer-facing variables to understand how customers view product variety for used automobiles. Our results show that three distinct classes of inventory exist, primarily driven by a key characteristic—body type—which differs from the traditional definition of product variety for new vehicles in the existing literature. A two-way fixed effects regression is then used to understand the relationship between product variety at the firm&#39;s retail locations and sales. The results demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between product variety and sales and, intriguingly, suggest that increasing product variety in some classes can be used to drive sales in others. Our findings yield important contributions for managers in used automobile firms and extend the broader literature on closed-loop supply chains. Specifically, our research demonstrates important differences in how product variety should be managed with used goods relative to new goods by a firm seeking to maximize sales.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the impact of a competing firm&#39;s substantial expansion in product variety, achieved through modularity and delayed differentiation, on the sales and inventory of the focal firm in the market. Intuitively, the firm&#39;s sales are expected to decrease when a competitor increases its product variety, as existing consumers are drawn to the greater range of competing products, resulting in a substitution effect. However, we also emphasize a simultaneous spillover effect, where the dramatic increase in a competitor&#39;s product variety can expand the overall market for all firms (including the focal firm) by attracting new consumers to the market. The net impact thus depends on the tradeoff between the substitution effect and spillover effect, forming an empirical question. To explore this tradeoff and quantify the net impact of a competitor&#39;s substantial increase in product variety on the focal firm&#39;s sales and inventory, we exploit the launch of Coca-Cola&#39;s Freestyle dispenser that offers over 120 beverage products via modularity and delayed differentiation. Our analysis focuses on the treatment effects of the launch of Freestyle on changes in the focal firm&#39;s sales quantity, sales dispersion, and inventory levels. Contrary to common intuition, we find that the focal firm&#39;s total sales remain unchanged following the launch of Freestyle dispensers, but its sales dispersion increases by 2.2%, which in turn leads to a 1.0% increase in inventory levels at distribution centers. The unchanged total sales and increased sales dispersion imply a redistribution of sales among the focal firm&#39;s stock keeping units (SKUs). By analyzing data at the SKU level and the business customer level, we uncover the mechanism behind this sales re-allocation: a 1.9% increase in the sales of the focal firm&#39;s long-tail products at the expense of its star product sales. Meanwhile, we identify a 0.9% increase in sales to retailers and entertainment locations, while sales to restaurants decline. These empirical results help disentangle the substitution and spillover effects on the focal firm&#39;s sales resulting from its competitor&#39;s substantially increased product variety. Managerial implications derived from these findings are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Self-interested customers’ form of reasoning and its consequences for system performance affect the planning decisions of service providers. We study procedurally rational customers—customers who make decisions based on a sample containing anecdotes of the system times experienced by other customers. Specifically, we consider procedurally rational customers in two-station service networks with open routing, that is, customers can choose the order in which to visit the stations. Because some actions may be less represented in the population, a given customer may not succeed in obtaining anecdotes about all possible actions. We introduce a novel sampling framework that extends the procedurally rational framework to incorporate the possibility that a customer may not receive any anecdotes for one of the actions; in this case, the customer uses a prior point estimate in lieu of the missing anecdotes. Under this framework, we study the procedurally rational equilibrium in open routing. We show first that as the sample size grows large, customers’ estimates become more accurate, and the procedurally rational equilibrium converges to the fully rational equilibrium (which is also socially optimal). We then uncover two main findings. First, we obtain bounds on the distance between the procedurally rational and fully rational equilibrium, aiding operational planning and showing the rate of convergence to the fully rational outcome as the sample size of anecdotes of each individual customer grows. Second, if customers obtain anecdotes of both actions with high probability, then the equilibrium will approximate the fully rational outcome, despite the sampling error inherent to procedural rationality.},

  abstract     = {This work is motivated by the practice of add-on services, where an add-on is not valuable unless purchased with a main service. Discrepancies in pricing have been observed in various settings such as restaurants, museums, and attractions regarding whether the add-on should be sold together with the main service, or separately from the main service at an additional charge. While there has been a vast literature on add-on pricing, its application in service-oriented businesses with congestion-prone externalities and delay-sensitive customers is less understood. We develop a queueing model and examine the optimal pricing of add-on services in such systems, and in line with practice, we focus on analyzing two pricing schemes: bundling that charges a single price to sell main and add-on services altogether, and separate selling that charges distinct prices for each service. We establish that in the absence of congestion, separate selling strictly dominates bundling across the board. When there is congestion at the main service but not the add-on, bundling can be more lucrative under a large customer demand. When congestion takes place at both services, separate selling can return to being dominant under a large customer demand. We explain these plots of reversals by illustrating an intricate interplay between pricing, market coverage, and congestion. Collectively, they reveal novel operational advantages of each pricing scheme in exploiting the fundamentals of add-on structures.},

This behavioral pattern can be captured by a reference-dependent behavioral model incorporating the retailer&#39;s optimism level in the reference point. Additional analyses, such as robustness experiments and model extensions, provide further support for the promotion-effort bias in the low-profit condition.

  abstract     = {“Cloud Kitchens” are delivery-only facilities that house multiple restaurants. Food-delivery platforms operate such kitchens to exploit two advantages: (a) Location advantage, arising due to a cloud-kitchen’s central location—this enables lower delivery times to customers. (b) Consolidation advantage, which accrues when multiple restaurants choose to co-locate at the cloud kitchen—this enables the platform to use a common pool of delivery drivers, thereby reducing costs. However, a cloud-kitchen’s eventual impacts on both the restaurants and the platform are intricately connected through their respective decisions—namely, the restaurants’ location decisions and the platform’s delivery capacity and delivery time. We examine conditions under which a cloud kitchen simultaneously benefits the primary stakeholders: delivery platform, restaurants, and customers. Our game-theoretic analysis considers two restaurants and a delivery platform. The restaurants simultaneously decide whether to stay at their initial (extreme) locations or relocate to a centrally located cloud kitchen. The platform decides the driver headcount and the delivery times for customers. In line with industry trends, we show that as population density increases beyond a threshold, the restaurants co-locating at the cloud kitchen is first a Pareto-dominant equilibrium and then the unique equilibrium. The platform and customers also prefer this equilibrium, leading to a win-win-win for the stakeholders. A cloud-kitchen’s benefit to the platform further increases as the drivers’ operational environment becomes more constrained, i.e. drivers’ carry-limit and speed decrease, and driver cost increases.},

For instance, in the retailing industry, ensuring a balanced consumption of resources from different suppliers enhances fairness and helps maintain a healthy channel relationship; in the cloud computing industry, resource-consumption balance helps increase customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs. Motivated by these practical needs, this paper studies the price-based network revenue management (NRM) problem with both demand learning and fair resource-consumption balancing. We introduce the regularized revenue, that is, the total revenue with a balancing regularization, as our objective to incorporate fair resource-consumption balancing into the revenue maximization goal. We propose a primal-dual-type online policy with the upper-confidence-bound demand learning method to maximize the regularized revenue. We adopt several innovative techniques to make our algorithm a unified and computationally efficient framework for the continuous price set and a wide class of balancing regularizers. Our algorithm achieves a worst-case regret of O ~ ( N 5 / 2 T ) , where N denotes the number of products and T denotes the number of time periods. Numerical experiments in a few NRM examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simultaneously achieving revenue maximization and fair resource-consumption balancing.},

We study group warranty contracts for the manufacturer to induce suppliers to improve their quality levels. When information is symmetric and the manufacturer can contract on his own quality level, we show that a group warranty contract can achieve the first-best outcome. When the manufacturer’s quality level is not contractible, we show that the manufacturer and all the suppliers under-invest in qualities. We then extend our model to the asymmetric information case where suppliers have private quality cost information. Further, we consider whether the manufacturer benefits from sourcing multiple components from a single supplier, that is, supply consolidation. We find that supply consolidation benefits the manufacturer when his quality level is not contractible, but hurts him in the presence of asymmetric quality cost information of the suppliers.},

(2) What theory-based principles can be derived from this metaphor to enhance our understanding of supply chain resilience? After rigorously establishing the conceptual equivalence between endotherm resilience and supply chain resilience, we identify a set of theory-based principles that provide insights into the evolving field of supply chain resilience. These principles help illuminate the adaptive and predictive dimensions of supply chain resilience.

Customers do not perceive these platforms valuable if they do not experience adequate levels of quality and security from both the platform and applications (apps) they use. Therefore, the IoT platform provider as well as app developers need to go beyond collaboration and cocreate quality and security for each app on the platform. In this setting, we study the dynamics of the financial sustainability of the platform provider and app developers and find that the collaborative nature of the IoT platform has a significant role in the behavior and profitability of all parties. Specifically, a neutral entrant to the platform not only increases the effort levels of all existing parties, but also increases the profits due to network effects that are intertwined with economies of scale. We further find that a substantial number of apps are needed in the platform for an economically viable platform and that a less efficient platform leader needs even a larger application base. However, based on the number of apps on the platform and which party is more effective in the collaboration, the platform provider might need to provide additional incentives, or sometimes, extract additional rent from the app developers to financially sustain the platform. Furthermore, we verify our results in the presence of competition or complementarity among apps and further derive additional interesting results and managerial insights. For example, we find that the entry of a competing app may be beneficial for existing apps under some conditions.},

The salary reward for publishing in “A” journals is unaffected by number of coauthors. Publications in other academic journals, top-tier practitioner journals, and top journals in sister-fields, and measures of impact, such as citations, H -index, and research awards provide no additional explanatory value of salary. Likewise, service and teaching awards do not add explanatory value. Female Full Professors are paid roughly $23,000 less in base salary than their male counterparts.

We introduce an at-risk network to evaluate optimal cost–benefit strategies for creating dikes and levees to mitigate flood hazard over multiple years. Our proposed model includes the expected flood costs, estimated using possible climate-change-induced sea-level states throughout the planning horizon, and the investment costs for developing dikes and levees via land elevations across the at-risk network. Further, given the limitations on infrastructure investment, our model incorporates a budget constraint. The problem is modeled as a multistage stochastic program with recourse that minimizes overall expected costs over the planning horizon. Exploiting open-source and freely accessible data sets, the flood risk mitigation model elaborated here can be applied to most urban coastal situations due to its general nature. Using Boston as a case study, our proposed method resulted in a cost reduction of as much as 92.2%, with an average of 63.2%, compared to a “do nothing” strategy in a simulation-based experiment. Under a high sea-level rise scenario, the average cost savings observed by implementing the solution suggested by our model could be even 15% higher. This proposed approach offers decision-makers a tool to frequently assess the costs and risks faced by their cities enabling them to effectively mitigate the potential flooding risks.},

  abstract     = {Hate crimes, which stem from prejudiced attitudes, have a distributionally detrimental impact on societal stability. Although inter-group contacts are potentially an effective means for reducing prejudice and subsequently decreasing the number of hate crimes, scholars have recently recognized the possibility of negative contacts that might actually amplify prejudice. As a result, the question of whether intergroup contacts truly possess the ability to effectively decrease hate crime numbers remains inconclusive. In addition, prior contact research primarily relies on laboratory experiments because the establishment of intergroup contacts in a field setting is challenging. Examination of the effectiveness of intergroup contacts hence merits further investigation in a real-world setting. In this article, we propose that ride-hailing services, which naturally connect individuals from different backgrounds, offer an avenue to facilitate intergroup contacts in practice, which could potentially reduce prejudice and the volume of hate crimes. Leveraging the staggered introduction of this technology into counties in the United States, we conducted a series of analyses to empirically evaluate the contact effects in the open field. Our analysis reveals a notable decrease in the number of hate crimes (particularly a 5.75% reduction in racial hate crimes) after the introduction of ride-hailing services. These findings remained consistent across various robustness tests. Additional moderation analysis suggests that the increased interaction between different groups, facilitated by ride-hailing services, is the most likely explanation for the observed decrease in hate crimes. We further conducted an extensive survey involving real ride-hailing drivers and passengers. The results from our survey provide direct evidence that ride-hailing services create natural and constructive environments where positive interactions and mutual understanding can develop among diverse groups of people. This, in turn, helps mitigate prejudice and hate crimes within society, as observed in our analysis. This study not only extends the existing body of literature on contact theory but also sheds light on how modern technologies can play a pivotal role in curtailing hate crime, yielding both theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract     = {If a firm afflicted by a disaster chooses to donate to disaster relief, how will this decision affect the firm&#39;s market value? From a self-protection perspective, diverting resources to support the public may jeopardize a firm&#39;s continuity and thereby reduce its value. Yet from a reputation-building perspective, supporting the public in need may enhance corporate reputation and thus increase firm value. In this study, we contrasted the two perspectives to develop a conceptual framework consisting of various competing hypotheses. We tested these hypotheses using data on Chinese firms’ donations to disaster relief during the first coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Our analysis shows that firms’ donations generally led to an increase in firm value. This was especially true for firms that were smaller or less profitable, firms that donated goods in addition to cash, and firms that donated before an increasing number of industry peers had done so. These results support the reputation-building perspective, suggesting that even when firms are afflicted by disaster exposure, their donations are still recognized as a value-adding investment. In contrast, donating a larger amount of cash and donating on an earlier day after the onset of the outbreak resulted in a lower firm value. These results align with the self-protection perspective, pointing to the need to consider resource preservation.},

  abstract     = {The bullwhip effect (BWE) is an important phenomenon in the operations and supply chain management field. Although it is commonly accepted that the BWE is widespread and can have a significant adverse impact on financial performance, there is surprisingly limited objective evidence on the financial consequences of the BWE. This paper examines the impact of the BWE on financial performance by examining the relationship between the BWE and stock price performance. The empirical analysis is based on data from 1985 to 2018 from about 7200 publicly traded firms and about 64,000 firm-years. We find that most results on the impact of the BWE on stock returns are statistically indistinguishable from zero. The few marginally significant results that we find suggest a positive relationship between the BWE and stock returns rather than the expected negative relationship. However, these marginally significant results do not hold when alternate methods are used to test the relationships. These conclusions are robust when we segment the sample by size, industry, and time periods. We also do not find a significant relationship between the BWE and stock returns for samples based on the propagation of the BWE from customers to suppliers. We do find some evidence to suggest that the BWE has a negative impact on inventory turnover. However, we do not find similar evidence for capacity utilization. The relationships between the BWE and return on assets measures are statistically insignificant. For margin measures, the relationships are positive and statistically significant but not economically significant.},

  abstract     = {Should an incumbent for-profit retailer deter a “socially responsible” store from entering the market? As a differentiation strategy to avoid direct price competition with well-established retailers, some socially responsible stores (or brands) enter the market with a “pre-commitment” to donate a certain proportion of their (A) profits or (B) revenues to charities. Because these charitable donations generate a “warm-glow” effect for consumers, these socially responsible stores can use pre-committed donations to gain market access. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model in which a socially responsible retailer enters the market to compete with an incumbent for-profit retailer . We determine and compare the incumbent retailer’s deterrence strategies (i.e., deter or tolerate) across different types of socially responsible stores. Our equilibrium analysis generates the following insights. First, the incumbent retailer’s deterrence strategy depends on its cost advantage over the socially responsible store, and hinges upon the socially responsible store’s entry cost, pre-commitment level, and its warm-glow effect . Second, even if the incumbent retailer can profitably deter the socially responsible retailer’s entry, the incumbent retailer can actually be better off by tolerating instead of deterring its entry when the socially responsible store’s entry cost is low and the incumbent store’s cost advantage is not significant. Third, relatively speaking, a type (B) store that donates a portion of its revenue is more vulnerable unless it can generate a much higher warm-glow effect. We extend our analysis numerically to examine the case when the pre-committed proportion is endogenously determined and obtain similar structural results.},

These intermediaries often possess superior demand information and decide whether to share it with their sellers. In practice, the manufacturers can employ two possible selling formats: reselling ( R S ), under which they sell the products to the intermediaries who subsequently resell to customers and agency selling ( A S ), under which they sell the products to customers through the intermediaries by paying a proportional fee. Additionally, the manufacturers can also sell the products to their resellers who subsequently resell to customers through the intermediaries. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate an e-commerce supply chain in which an online intermediary first decides whether to disclose information option to a manufacturer and/or reseller; thereafter, the manufacturer selects between the R S or A S format. Regardless of the information-sharing decision made by the intermediary, the manufacturer’s selling format selection remains qualitatively unchanged. However, the intermediary can compel the manufacturer to change his selling format by sharing information with only the manufacturer or reseller in certain market environments. When the intensity is small but the proportional fee is intermediate, the intermediary should share information with only the manufacturer to compel him to change his selling format choice from A S to R S . When both the intensity and fee are intermediate, the intermediary should share information exclusively with the manufacturer (or reseller) to prompt a change in the manufacturer’s selling format, switching from R S to A S (or from A S to R S ), contingent upon whether the magnitude of demand fluctuation is small or large.},

  abstract     = {Natural disasters and disease outbreaks cause substantial social turbulence and economic damage. The survival and continued operation of local small businesses and entrepreneurs are critical to the development activities in post-disaster recovery. However, these small businesses and entrepreneurs face greater challenges in accessing funding through traditional channels during a crisis. Crowdlending, also known as peer-to-peer microfinancing, has been successfully used to bypass traditional channels and raise funds directly from crowd lenders. However, it is unclear if such platforms can also be effectively used in the aftermath of crises, given that disasters induce both prosocial motivations and risk considerations in lender responses. To understand the operational implications of crowdlending for small businesses, we examine how crowdlenders respond to loan requests during a crisis and what factors moderate their responses. Drawing on the literature on disaster management and crowdlending, we hypothesize that lenders respond positively to loan requests from crisis-affected areas, and such responses are moderated by fundraising objectives and the lender&#39;s national culture. With observational data from an influential crowdlending platform and the 2014 Ebola outbreak as the treatment in a natural experiment design, we find that, on average, lenders respond positively to loan requests from crisis-affected areas, and they tend to favor loan requests emphasizing economic rather than social objectives. Furthermore, lenders from collectivistic cultures are more likely to respond positively during a crisis than lenders from individualistic ones. Our study contributes to research and practice in disaster management, particularly small business operations management during crises, by showing that crowdlending can be a useful fundraising channel for small businesses, which is meaningful for post-disaster economic development and recovery. We also offer implications for the recent conversation on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by analyzing and discussing the similarities and differences between the Ebola outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic.},

We estimate the direct effects on water consumption from in-factory cumulative production experience and the vicarious learning from peer factories in the same product category. We consider vicarious learning from three potential sources: observation of peer factories’ cumulative production experience; and benchmarking of water consumption performance with the best and worst performing peer factories. For each learning channel, we test for the moderating effects of water scarcity and geographic proximity. We find that factories learn to reduce their water consumption from their own experience but at a greater rate in water-scarce locations. Although we find that factories learn significantly from observing the cumulative production experience of peer factories, this effect does not hold in water-scarce locations or across geographic regions. We document that learning effects from observing others’ experience are quite distinct from learning effects by benchmarking others’ performance. We find vicarious learning effects from benchmarking the best-performing peer factories result in significant reductions in water consumption, and this effect is greater when the factory is in a water-scarce location, and when benchmarking other regions rather than within the same region. Finally, we find less significant vicarious learning from observing the worst-performing factories.},

  abstract     = {On-demand service platforms are interested in having gig workers use self-set, nonbinding performance goals to improve efforts and performance. To examine the effects of such self-set goal mechanisms, we build a behavioral model, derive theoretical results and testable hypotheses, and conduct a field experiment using a large gig platform for food delivery. Our model analysis finds that individual workers’ optimal self-set goals may exhibit a spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from trivial to impossible, depending on workers’ reference-dependent utility coefficients and self-control cost. Moreover, workers’ efforts are higher with properly set goals rather than no-goals. Consistently, our experimental data show significant treatment effects of self-goal setting, and a causal tree algorithm identifies subgroups who are mostly motivated by self-set goals. Furthermore, our study compares two common types of performance metrics for goal setting: the number of completed orders and total revenue. Our model suggests different cases of effort and performance improvement for the two goal types. The experimental data suggests that both goal types improve efforts equally but lead to different attainment rates. Specifically, the goal attainment rate is lower for the revenue-goal treatment than for the order-quantity-goal treatment. Further analysis reveals that this disparity is due to workers setting excessively high revenue goals. Our study demonstrates the efficacy and limitations of self-goal-setting mechanisms and yields two important managerial implications. First, the implementation of self-goal-setting mechanisms could improve gig workers’ efforts and performance. Second, encouraging order-quantity goals instead of revenue goals could help gig workers achieve higher attainment rates.},

By leveraging the randomness of the number of potential customers, we develop a nonsequential appointment scheduling policy as an alternative to the conventional first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy. This allows for more flexibility in managing appointment scheduling. To calculate the optimal policy, we develop a branch-and-bound algorithm in which the lower bound is estimated using multiple approaches, such as optimality conditions, dynamic programming for calculating FCFS policy, and the shortest path reformulation. Through numerical studies, we observe that nonsequential appointment scheduling is particularly advantageous in systems characterized by highly fluctuating customer numbers or low congestion. In such cases, leaving gaps between appointments for potential future arrivals proves to be a more appropriate strategy. We also evaluate the performance of heuristics proposed in prior literature and provide insights into situations where these heuristics can be effectively applied.},

Particularly, we explore the value of two types of emotional appeals retargeting strategies tailored for financial services: empathetic support and privacy commitment retargeting. Our field experiment involving a microloan platform reveals the effectiveness of emotional appeals retargeting in the financial service market. Specifically, empathetic support retargeting successfully recovers 11.93% of consumers, whereas privacy commitment retargeting recovers 17.27% of consumers. These effects translate to 5.19 and 10.53 percentage-point increases in the rate of return, respectively, over the no-message operation. This study further evaluates the quality of consumers retained by these retargeting strategies and finds that consumers called back by the empathetic support and privacy commitment retargeting present high credibility, with loan approval rates 11.4 and 13.69 percentage points higher than those of nonabandoning consumers, respectively. Accordingly, a more specific retargeting strategy is explored.

  abstract     = {The uncertainty in the supplier’s material flows has become a norm rather than an exception in supply chains. The supply uncertainty can result in unexpected inventory shortfall, amplifying lost sales. However, the design of inventory replenishment and product pricing policy to mitigate both supply uncertainty and demand loss remains unexplored. This is because the resulting dynamic planning problem is highly nonconcave and thus intractable. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that focuses on a class of intuitively appealing and practically plausible policies. Specifically, as the level of on-hand inventory increases, we expect an increased amount of demand fulfillment and a decreased product price. Applying the notions of stochastic functions, we show that, under general conditions of the stochastic supply and demand functions, the dynamic planning problem becomes a concave optimization problem over the restricted policy class. We further reduce the set of candidate policies to a refined class by excluding the dominated policies. A refined policy can be easily computed, and appropriately selected refined policies produce close-to-optimal profits. These developments allow us to evaluate the consequences of demand loss. In particular, demand retention through backordering can be beneficial when overstocking is costly in relation to understocking, but the benefit is insensitive to supply and demand uncertainties. Moreover, inventory-based dynamic pricing is more valuable in mitigating supply risk under lost sales than under backordering.},

  abstract     = {The underserved population—i.e., individuals who identify themselves as non-female, non-heterosexual, or non-White—have long faced inequities when accessing traditional clinic-based mental health services. Individuals from the underserved population tend to use and benefit from these services less than their better-served counterparts (i.e., those who identify themselves as female, heterosexual, and White). This study investigates whether similar inequities exist within the context of mobile apps specifically designed to provide self-support and peer-support. To this end, we conduct an empirical analysis using longitudinal user-level data collected from a mental health mobile app (MHMA). Our results indicate that: (i) in contrast to the traditional clinic-based mental health services, in a MHMA setting, users from the underserved population engage with the app services and derive similar benefits as much as their better-served counterparts; and (ii) there is a positive relationship between app usage frequency and the mental condition of app users. Our post-hoc analysis uncovers that the MHMA promotes equitable usage and benefit for users: (i) from the underserved population via self-management functions that enable self-support; and (ii) from the better-served population via online community functions that facilitate peer-support. These findings suggest that MHMAs have the potential to achieve equity through both user engagement and the benefits derived from such engagement. We conclude by discussing the implications for mobile app firms, policymakers, and organizations in their efforts to achieve mental health equity for the underserved population.},

  abstract     = {E-commerce platforms have an informational advantage over their third-party sellers, leading to the common belief that a platform&#39;s market entry would harm sellers with similar products. However, unlike traditional retail competition, the platform and its sellers have aligned incentives : the platform&#39;s commission depends on the seller&#39;s revenue, and sellers rely on the platform to strengthen their online presence.  Hence, the platform has no incentive to enter the market to harm the seller&#39;s revenue severely.  This paper introduces a duopoly model where the seller is the &quot;incumbent&quot; and the platform is the &quot;potential entrant&quot;.  Our model captures two salient features: (a) the &quot;reputation effect&quot; that enables the platform to obtain a higher consumer valuation than the seller, and (b) the &quot;spillover effect&quot; that expands the market size when an additional entity (e.g., the platform) enters the market.  Our equilibrium analysis debunks the prevailing belief about platform&#39;s entry, showing that platform&#39;s entry can enable both the platform and the seller to obtain a higher profit when the unit cost is sufficiently low and the spillover effect is sufficiently high. For robustness checks, we consider three different extensions: an alternative duopoly model with reversed roles where the platform is the incumbent and the seller is the potential entrant, a scenario with an endogenously determined spillover effect, and a simultaneous market entry/exit decision-making process. We find a consistent result across all three extensions that both seller and platform entries can mutually benefit under similar market conditions, fostering a symbiotic relationship.},

  abstract     = {We consider a periodical equilibrium pricing problem for multiple firms over a planning horizon of T periods. At each period, firms set their selling prices and receive stochastic demand from consumers. Firms do not know their underlying demand curve, but they wish to determine the selling prices to maximize total revenue under competition. Hence, they have to do some price experiments such that the observed demand data are informative to make price decisions. However, uncoordinated price updating can render the demand information gathered by price experimentation less informative or inaccurate. We design a nonparametric learning algorithm to facilitate coordinated dynamic pricing, in which competitive firms estimate their demand functions based on observations and adjust their pricing strategies in a prescribed manner. We show that the pricing decisions, determined by estimated demand functions, converge to underlying equilibrium as time progresses. We obtain a bound of the revenue difference that has an order of O ( F 2 T 3 / 4 ) and a regret bound that has an order of O ( F T ) with respect to the number of the competitive firms F and T . We also develop a modified algorithm to handle the situation where some firms may have the knowledge of the demand curve.},

  abstract     = {The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) includes a number of incentive-based programs (e.g., tax credits) designed to motivate firms to develop new clean technologies for fighting climate change. However, the IRA also includes a fee firms incur for excessive methane emissions. This represents the first time the United States government has ever levied a fee on greenhouse gas emissions, and it raises an interesting research question—how should a budget-constrained regulator balance the use of both incentive and penalty-based levers for stimulating investment in clean technology development? In this paper, we examine a regulator’s optimal penalty and subsidy decisions for motivating firms to invest in clean technology development. We illustrate how the level of competitive intensity in the market can influence a budget-constrained regulator with multiple competing objectives—the environment, firm profits, and consumer welfare. We find that a subsidy is always beneficial, irrespective of the regulator’s objective. While imposing a firm penalty always benefits the environment, it always negatively impacts the sum of firm profits and consumer welfare. However, depending on the level of competition in the market, instances can occur where imposing a high penalty actually benefits total firm profits or consumer welfare (separately). Interestingly, a regulator that cares about all three dimensions of its objective equally, should always set the penalty to either its minimum or maximum value, depending on whether the environmental cost of the harmful product is high or low.},

  abstract     = {To address the growing obesity crisis, governments are promoting home cooking to improve dietary habits. Home-cooked food-sharing platforms, a manifestation of the sharing economy, offer consumers healthy food options. While the economic benefits of the sharing economy have been extensively studied, little is known about its impact on non-economic factors, such as consumers’ health. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study using data from a mobile kitchen-sharing platform and four controlled experiments to investigate whether the sharing economy helps consumers develop healthy eating habits. We use manual coding and machine learning methods to evaluate the healthiness of over 180,000 unique dishes and examine food provision and consumption on the platform. Our findings indicate that as consumers use the platform more frequently, they tend to consume more unhealthy food. Additionally, sellers who receive more orders and earn more revenue tend to offer less healthy food over time. Two controlled experiments prove consumers are more likely to order unhealthy food online. Furthermore, these experiments provide causal evidence that consumer food consumption patterns drive seller food provision rather than vice versa. Our results suggest that the sharing economy may have negative consequences due to misaligned interests between sellers and consumers. Fortunately, we identify conditions that may mitigate these effects in empirical analyses and two experiments. Specifically, consumers who choose dine-in options (as opposed to takeaway) and those who order for groups (as opposed to individual orders) tend to make healthier food choices on the platform due to impression management motivation.},
