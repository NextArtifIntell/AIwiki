  abstract     = {The real world is nonlinear and in the control application field, this aspect needs to be resolved to build models so we need to refer to nonlinear system modeling techniques. Neuro-fuzzy systems and modular neural networks (NNs) are among the best modeling approaches for nonlinear systems. The combined features of both approaches provide better models. Thus, we propose in this paper a neuro-fuzzy modular architecture for modeling nonlinear systems. The modular architecture consists of dividing a nonlinear problem into several simpler subproblems. We assigned to each subproblem an NN. Each NN provides individual solutions that will be combined to provide a general solution to the original problem. In this respect, the decomposition of the original problem is based on a fuzzy decision mechanism. This mechanism consists of a set of fuzzy rules for processing nonlinear problems using two different strategies. The first involves training only the network weights, and the second adds the fuzzy set parameters to the training step. A comparative study of both strategies reveals the competence of the second strategy in providing better accuracy and simplicity. Using the neuro-fuzzy combination among the modular NNs reduces the complexity of the original problem and achieves much better performance. The proposed architecture is evaluated by two second-order nonlinear systems, a numerical system and a real system called “the chemical reactor,” which is used to carry out a chemical reaction not only in chemical and biochemical engineering, but also in the petrochemical industry. For both systems, the proposed approach provides better performance in terms of the learning time, learning error, and number of neurons.},

  abstract     = {Microarray expression datasets generate a huge number of genes, but only a few genes provide information about cancer diseases. In this context, feature selection approaches have been developed to deal with this problem. Filter-based methods, in particular, select the relevant genes and remove the irrelevant ones using different evaluation metrics. In this study, we shed light on nine univariate filter methods. Three categories of filter methods were investigated using eight microarray datasets, including binary and multi-class samples. The support vector machine and Naive Bayes classifiers were used to assess classification accuracy. Different comparison methods were used to assist the researchers in visualizing the performance of each studied filter. Precisely, statistical tests were applied in terms of classification accuracy, and the feature ranking similarity of the filter methods was studied based on a rank correlation measure.},

The results achieved are articulated as follows: the notion of pseudo almost automorphic in Weyl’s sense on timescales is suggested, which is a natural generalization of some recently published papers. The qualitative properties of the solution are realized using appropriate inequalities. Therefore, fixed-time synchronization was realized by considering appropriate feedback and Lyapunov functional. Two numerical examples to prove the merits of key results are presented at the end of this work.},

With the rapid development of multimedia and cloud computing, it has become popular for resource-constrained users to outsource the storage and denoising of massive images. However, it may cause privacy concerns and response delays. In this scenario, we propose an ef F icient priv A cy-prese R ving I mage de N oising sch E me (FARINE) for outsourcing digital images. By introducing a key conversion mechanism, FARINE allows removing noise from a given noisy image using a non-local mean way without leaking any information about the plaintext content. Due to its low computational latency/communication cost, edge computing is considered to improve the user experience. To achieve a dynamic user set efficiently, we design a fine-grained access control mechanism to support user authorization and revocation in multi-user scenarios. Extensive experiments over several benchmark data sets show that FARINE obtains comparable performance to plaintext image denoising.},

In fact, the population of borrowers is divided into two compartments: Safe and Risky having an interaction, it is a SR model. With numerical simulations of the SR model, we can describe the evolution of some safe and risky borrowers. The result provides to manage the portfolios of all agencies controlled from the MFIs, by predictions of safe and risky borrowers. Then, define or redefine the management strategies of development and investment, and thus strengthen financial inclusion.},

We derive a mixed variational formulation of the problem, which is in the form of a coupled system for the displacement field, the electric potential, and a Lagrange multiplier. Then we prove the existence of a unique weak solution to the model by combining saddle-point theory and the fixed-point technique. Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for approximating the weak solution for the contact problem, including friction and electrical contact conditions.

However, this mode of production entails numerous uncertainties, necessitating accurate predictions in various aspects such as market demand, supply chain, warehousing, and workshop logistics. Therefore, it is of great engineering significance to establish a high-performance time forecasting model for enhancing logistics planning and operations. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid time series forecasting method. This method can select appropriate decomposition methods and prediction models based on the characteristics of the sequence itself, and use hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best prediction effect. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through rigorous validation with diverse types of time series data. Consequently, this method holds promise as a suitable forecasting model for logistics planning and operations.},
