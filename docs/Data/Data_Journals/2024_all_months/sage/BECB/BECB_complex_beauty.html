  abstract     = {It is common to use very high electric fields (E) to defibrillate hearts, which can damage cardiomyocytes, showing the importance of developing methods that can decrease the E applied in defibrillation protocols. We used COMSOL Multiphysics software to model, simulate, and analyze the application of an E in an isolated heart with monodirectional and multidirectional stimuli, using 2 pairs of electrodes and the superposition principle as a way to decrease the E applied and reduce the required number of stimulation electrodes. When applying an E of 3 V/cm in the 0°, 30°, and 60° directions, individually in the stimulation chamber, E was equal to 3.2 V/cm and its phases were equal to 0°, 30°, and 60°, respectively, validating the superposition principle. We observed a reduction up to 31.8% in | E | when applying a multidirectional stimulus when comparing to the monodirectional stimulus, in order to stimulate the same area of the heart. For the same amount of stimuli directions, we obtained up to 11.7% reduction of | E |, just by modifying the directions of the applied stimuli. In the simulation developed in this work, the superposition principle was validated in a stimulation chamber. For the same stimulated area, the multidirectional E has been always lower than the monodirectional. We observed that, in order to decrease the intensity of E, both the number of applied stimuli and their directions were relevant issues.},

The aim of this study was to develop an automated lung and colon cancer classification system using histopathological images. An automated lung and colon classification system was developed using histopathological images from the LC25000 dataset. The algorithm development included data splitting, deep neural network model selection, on the fly image augmentation, training and validation. The core of the algorithm was a Swin Transform V2 model, and 5-fold cross validation was used to evaluate model performance. The model performance was evaluated using Accuracy, Kappa, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare the performances of different neural networks including both mainstream convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. The Swin Transform V2 model achieved a 1 (100%) on all metrics, which is the first single model to obtain perfect results on this dataset. The Swin Transformer V2 model has the potential to be used to assist pathologists in classifying lung and colon cancers using histopathology images.},

Because children body’s dimensions are smaller than adults’ ones, results indices of the Moshkov test are less as well. These results have been corrected proportionally to a half sum of rhombus sides’ lengths. Mechanical and mathematical modeling using Wolfram Mathematica computer package has been done during Moshkov rhombus modification. The modified rhombus model made it possible to improve validity of the test regarding smaller dimension of young patients’ bodies.

Our study intended to select HGSC patients with unfavorable prognoses and therapeutic responses based on CAF-enriched prognostic genes. The bulk RNA and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of tumor tissues were collected from the TCGA and GEO databases. The infiltrated levels of immune and stromal cells were estimated by multiple immune deconvolution algorithms and verified through immunohistochemical analysis. The univariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify prognostic genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was conducted to annotate enriched gene sets. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database was used to explore potential alternative drugs. We found the infiltered levels of CAFs were remarkedly elevated in advanced and metastatic HGSC tissues and identified hundreds of genes specifically enriched in CAFs. Then we selected 6 CAF-enriched prognostic genes based on which HGSC patients were reclassified into 2 subclusters with discrepancy prognoses. Further analysis revealed that the HGSC patients in cluster-2 tended to undergo poor responses to traditional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Subsequently, we selected 24 novel potential therapeutic drugs for cluster-2 HGSC patients. Moreover, we discovered a positive correlation of infiltrated levels between CAFs and monocytes/macrophages in HGSC tissues. Collectively, our study successfully reclassified HGSC patients into 2 different subgroups that have discrepancy prognoses and responses to current therapeutic methods.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor (BT) is an awful disease and one of the foremost causes of death in human beings. BT develops mainly in 2 stages and varies by volume, form, and structure, and can be cured with special clinical procedures such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical mediation. With revolutionary advancements in radiomics and research in medical imaging in the past few years, computer-aided diagnostic systems (CAD), especially deep learning, have played a key role in the automatic detection and diagnosing of various diseases and significantly provided accurate decision support systems for medical clinicians. Thus, convolution neural network (CNN) is a commonly utilized methodology developed for detecting various diseases from medical images because it is capable of extracting distinct features from an image under investigation. In this study, a deep learning approach is utilized to extricate distinct features from brain images in order to detect BT. Hence, CNN from scratch and transfer learning models (VGG-16, VGG-19, and LeNet-5) are developed and tested on brain images to build an intelligent decision support system for detecting BT. Since deep learning models require large volumes of data, data augmentation is used to populate the existing dataset synthetically in order to utilize the best fit detecting models. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to set the optimum parameters for training the models. The achieved results show that VGG models outperformed others with an accuracy rate of 99.24%, average precision of 99%, average recall of 99%, average specificity of 99%, and average f 1-score of 99% each. The results of the proposed models compared to the other state-of-the-art models in the literature show better performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f 1-score. Moreover, comparative analysis shows that the proposed models are reliable in that they can be used for detecting BT as well as helping medical practitioners to diagnose BT.},

  abstract     = {One of the leading causes of death for women worldwide is breast cancer. Early detection and prompt treatment can reduce the risk of breast cancer-related death. Cloud computing and machine learning are crucial for disease diagnosis today, but they are especially important for those who live in distant places with poor access to healthcare. While machine learning-based diagnosis tools act as primary readers and aid radiologists in correctly diagnosing diseases, cloud-based technology can also assist remote diagnostics and telemedicine services. The promise of techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for sickness diagnosis has attracted the attention of several re-searchers. The 4 methods for the proposed research include preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. A Smart Window Vestige Deletion (SWVD) technique is initially suggested for preprocessing. It consists of Savitzky-Golay (S-G) smoothing, updated 2-stage filtering, and adaptive time window division. This technique separates each channel into multiple time periods by adaptively pre-analyzing its specificity. On each window, an altered 2-stage filtering process is then used to retrieve some tumor information. After applying S-G smoothing and integrating the broken time sequences, the process is complete. In order to deliver effective feature extraction, the Deep Residual based Multiclass for architecture (DRMFA) is used. In histological photos, identify characteristics at the cellular and tissue levels in both tiny and large size patches. Finally, a fresh customized strategy that combines a better crow forage-ELM. Deep learning and the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are concepts that have been developed (ACF-ELM). When it comes to diagnosing ailments, the cloud-based ELM performs similarly to certain cutting-edge technology. The cloud-based ELM approach beats alternative solutions, according to the DDSM and INbreast dataset results. Significant experimental results show that the accuracy for data inputs is 0.9845, the precision is 0.96, the recall is 0.94, and the F1 score is 0.95.},

  abstract     = {Cao et al. introduce PANDA, an AI model designed for the early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using non-contrast CT scans. While the model shows great promise, it faces several challenges. Notably, its training predominantly on East Asian datasets raises concerns about generalizability across diverse populations. Additionally, PANDA’s ability to detect rare lesions, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), could be improved by integrating other imaging modalities. High specificity is a strength, but it also poses risks of false positives, which may lead to unnecessary procedures and increased healthcare costs. Implementing a tiered diagnostic approach and expanding training data to include a wider demographic are essential steps for enhancing PANDA’s clinical utility and ensuring its successful global implementation, ultimately shifting the focus from late diagnosis to proactive early detection.},

  abstract     = {The growth and advancements done in solid mechanics and metallurgy have come up with various characterization techniques that help in prediction of elastic properties of different types of materials—isotropic, anisotropic, transverse isotropic, etc. Soft tissues which refer to fibrous tissues, fat, blood vessels, muscles and other tissues that support the body were found to have some control over its mechanical properties. This mechanical behavior of soft tissues has recently shifted the attention of many researchers to develop methods to characterize and describe the mechanical response of soft tissues. The paper discusses the biomechanical nature of soft tissues and the work done to characterize their elastic properties. The paper gives a review of the behavior and characteristics of soft tissues extracted from various experimental tests employed in their characterization. Soft tissues exhibit complex behavior and various complexities are involved in their experimental testing due to their small size and fragile nature. The paper focuses on the conventionally used tensile and compression tests and the difficulties encountered in soft tissue characterization. It also describes the utility of ultrasound technique which is a non-destructive method to characterize soft tissues. Tensile and compression test used to characterize materials are destructive in nature. Ultrasound technique can provide a better way to characterize material in a non-destructive manner},

  abstract     = {A temporal neural code reliant on the pattern of spike times rather than spike rates offers a feasible mechanism for encoding information from weak periodic external stimuli, such as static or extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields. Our model focuses on the influence of magnetic fields on neurotransmitter dynamics near the neuron membrane. Neurotransmitter binding to specific receptor sites on membrane proteins can regulate biochemical reactions. The duration a neurotransmitter spends in the bonded state serves as a metric for the magnetic field’s capacity as a chemical regulator. By initiating a physical analysis of ligand-receptor binding, utilizing the alpha function for synaptic conductance, and employing a modified version of Bell’s law, we quantified the impact of magnetic fields on the bond half-life time and, consequently, on postsynaptic spike timing.},

  abstract     = {Trends in health care delivery systems have shifted as a result of the modern uses of biomaterials in medicine. Contrary to traditional medicine, modern healthcare are now useful in solving problems that were considered impossible some years back. One of the most significant factors to the most recent advancements in implant development has been the use of calcium based materials in the creation of necessary implants in the form of soft and hard tissues. With the advent of naturally sourced materials in the manufacturing of biomaterials, lots of attention are now focused on the different sources of agro-based resources that can be used for the product developments. These agro-based materials are now been considered for sustainable and ecological purposes in several areas of applications globally in the recent times. Hence, the review was carried out with focus on the sources, relevance, processing techniques and applications of tricalcium phosphate based biomaterials in modern day healthcare delivery. This review provides a historical and prospective picture of the crucial functions that materials based on tricalcium phosphate will play in fulfilling human requirements for medication.},

  abstract     = {Schistosomiasis, which causes over 200 000 deaths annually, has since the 1970s been controlled by praziquintel. The reliance on a single drug to combat schistosomiasis, and reports of laboratory resistance to the drug, has created an urgent need in the scientific community to develop new chemotherapies to complement or supplement praziquantel. Medicinal plants are a potential reservoir of compounds with schistosomicidal activity. In the current study, we carried out computer-aided screening of Abrus precatorius compounds to discover compounds with potential to inhibit Schistosoma mansoni purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( Sm PNP). Thus, 99 compounds retrieved from Lotus Natural Compounds Database were docked into the active site of Sm PNP. The top-ranked compounds were subjected to Lipinski’s druglikeness and toxicity risk predictions. Three lead compounds, abrusogenin, cirsimaritin and hispidulin, were identified as having high binding affinities, favourable interactions with Sm PNP active site residues and good toxicity risk prediction results. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to assess the stability of the interactions of these lead compounds with Sm PNP. Collectively, analyses of the MD trajectories confirms that the lead compounds bound and interacted stably with active site residues of Sm PNP. We conclude that abrusogenin, cirsimaritin and hispidulin could serve as hit compounds for the development of new antischistosomal drugs, based on plant-derived natural products. However, experimental studies are required to further evaluate the potentials of these compounds as possible therapeutics against schistosomiasis.},
