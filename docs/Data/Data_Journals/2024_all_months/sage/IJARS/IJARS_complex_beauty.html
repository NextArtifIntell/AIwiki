  abstract     = {The precise bagging of immature peaches by the fruit bagging robot requires the identification of the target young fruits as well as the acquisition of their growth angles. The network models employed in single detection algorithms exhibit complexity and pose challenges for deployment on mobile terminals as they heavily rely on the availability of labeled samples. A semi-supervised learning and lightweight strategy based on YOLOv8n-seg was proposed to identify the growth posture of immature peaches in the work. Firstly, the self-training method and data enhancement in semi-supervised learning were used to generate efficient pseudo-label data. A tremendous labeling workload was solved. Secondly, the YOLOv8n-seg backbone network was replaced with an improved MobileNetv3 structure for better real-time detection on MT to reduce network parameters and calculations. The model was easily deployed with improved detection speed. Meanwhile, the original upsampling module was replaced with the CARAFE module to enhance the recognition capability of global features, which considered the impact of immature peaches on the nearby color background. The CIOU loss function was ultimately substituted with the SIOU loss function to further optimize the boundary frame loss and target detection accuracy. The enhanced model could predict the coordinate information of immature peaches and calculate growth angles. The experimental results show that the improved peach seedling growth posture network model has a weight size of only 23.1% of the original model. Additionally, the algorithm achieved a remarkable rate of 87.8% in identifying young peach fruits, with an average error of ±3.3° in estimating the growth angle. It took an average of 31 ms to detect a 3024 × 4032 pixels image in the edge computing device JETSON AGX ORIN CLB development kits. The method could rapidly identify immature peaches and estimate the growth angle, which ensured accurate bagging.},

  abstract     = {In the multi-robot swarm control algorithm, the traditional rigid formation algorithm has low formation redundancy, and it is difficult to flexibly adapt to the external environment. In this study, centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) was used to control a group of robots for forming the required flexible formations and increasing the structural redundancy and internal carrying capacity of the multi-robot system. When the CVT area is divided in a non-convex environment, the Voronoi and non-convex areas will overlap, which will cause the robot to collide with the obstacles and hinder the optimization of the cost function. In this study, constrained CVT was used to solve the problem of region overlap in non-convex environments. The proposed path planning algorithm ensured the safe movement of the robot and explored the applicability of the algorithm in different scenarios. Finally, the performance of the algorithm in the non-convex area was verified and discussed by analyzing the simulation and experimental results for the convex and non-convex environments. The results showed that the constrained CVT could control the robot to generate the formation as quickly as possible in the non-convex area, and it was easy to dynamically switch the formation according to the external environment.},

A new compensation signal is calculated to adjust the control inputs produced by the dynamic path tracking control module at each time interval. Through the adaptation algorithm, the identical initial conditions can be relaxed to some extent with the AILC scheme. Moreover, the stability analysis of the proposed AILC scheme is presented.

The mechanical system and the control system of the robot are designed and analyzed in detail. In order to detect whether the insulation skin is wrapped successfully, the robot uses machine vision technology to automatically detect the wrapping effect. In the experiments and engineering applications, the proposed robot is applied to the experimental line and 10 kV overhead distribution line.

This approach alleviates the problem of local optima to a significant extent. To reduce the time cost of deep reinforcement learning in the initial stages, we employ transfer learning by training a model capable of avoiding static obstacles in a simulated environment to accomplish local dynamic navigation tasks. By combining the locally learned dynamic navigation policy with global motion planning, we achieve autonomous exploration for the robot. During the fully autonomous navigation process, we record the robot’s movement trajectory and the generated map. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to similar exploration methods, this approach exhibits advantages in complex dynamic environments, even with the sole use of two-dimensional laser, without the need for maps or excessive information.},

Conventional mobile robot positioning and navigation system relies heavily on fusion of multiple costly sensors, which does not promote mass production.

The system used are based on indoor positioning system (IPS) by using a crowdsourced fingerprinting method. This seeks to improve crowdsourced fingerprinting database performance by solving the issue of the device diversity or heterogeneity of difference devices. To cope with the crowdsourced fingerprinting database as the location estimation method for the robot application, deep neural network (DNN) is employed. The proposed method namely ratio and ranged-based (RRB) shows an improvement of 60% increments by implementing the pre-processing technique of the raw data before feeding it to the DNN. The comparison between other method shows that RRB is better in term of accuracy in three validation techniques, which are root mean square error (RMSE), distance error and accuracy between true and estimate position. This improvement effectively could facilitate the actual positioning system utilizing the WiFi infrastructure for the mobile robot in very near future.},

However, those methods create many holes in the places, where the movable objects are located, reducing the reliability of the estimated pose. In this paper, we propose a model with detailed classification criteria for moving objects and point cloud restoration to handle hole generation and pose errors. Our model includes a moving object segmentation network and an inpainting network with a light detection and ranging sensor. By providing residual images to the segmentation network, the model can classify idle and moving objects. Moreover, we propose a smoothness loss to ensure that the inpainting result of the model naturally connects to the existing background. Our proposed model uses the movable object’s information in an idle state and the inpainted background to accurately estimate the sensor’s pose. To use a ground truth dataset for inpainting, we created a new dataset using the CARLA simulation environment. We use our virtual datasets and the KITTI dataset to verify our model’s performance. In a dynamic environment, our proposed model demonstrates a notable enhancement of approximately 24.7% in pose estimation performance compared to the previous method.},

However, it is challenging to satisfy real-time requirements and implement them on embedded platforms due to their high complexity of solving and reliance on optimization solvers. This letter reports a lightweight and efficient two-stage solving algorithm for the model predictive control planner. Firstly, the general form of the model predictive control local planning problem was specified and simplified by the motion primitives. Then, a two-stage solving method of multi-layer perceptron pre-solving and particle swarm optimization re-optimizing is developed after splitting the cost function into two pieces. An multi-layer perceptron neural network was designed and trained offline to learn the solution of the model predictive control local planner without considering obstacles after selecting the inputs and outputs. Next, to accomplish obstacle avoidance, the particle swarm optimization algorithm re-optimizes the trajectory based on the outputs of the neural network. The experiment results demonstrate that the multi-layer perceptron-particle swarm optimization algorithm can quickly and accurately solve local planning problems, guiding robots to complete global paths with the same efficiency as expert solvers. The average solving time has been reduced by over 90%, enabling the robot to increase its control frequency or adopt higher-quality complex motion primitives. The multi-layer perceptron-particle swarm optimization algorithm can also be used for various robots and motion primitives, with a wide range of potential applications.},

The controller is designed based on the idea of variable-structure control, which achieves independent real-time adjustments of the control gains of the six legs and takes the sign of the proportional and differential errors as the switching function to realize the feed-forward correction of the proportional gain. This control input can track the expected value more precisely, thus strengthening the system&#39;s ability to cope with high dynamics. To validate the results of the proposed approach, numerical simulations are compared with those obtained from PD and NPD controls. The findings confirmed that the designed S-NPD controller shows commendable stability and robustness, and the vibration attenuation of the upper platform under low- and medium-frequency conditions is substantially improved. In addition, it obtains smoother vibration waveforms and lower control force under random disturbance conditions. Consequently, it is proved that the S-NPD control can obtain better regulation accuracy.

The characteristics of underwater target detection error compensation data are extracted, and the characteristic parameters reflecting the significant difference between them are obtained. In order to ensure the accuracy of compensation results, a multi-scale attention mechanism is introduced into the improved binocular vision, and feature parameters are taken as the input of binocular vision model. After continuous learning and training, high-precision error compensation for underwater targets is realized. Experimental results show that different underwater targets can be detected when the average error value compensated by this method is less than 0.1 mm, and the maximum error value is always less than 1.5 mm.

Accurate perception of the terrain force through a forward wheel-on-limb detection system can provide crucial data for assessing the traversability of the terrain ahead. Existing constant force control methods, largely based on static terra mechanics models, struggle to meet the operational needs of planetary rovers in unknown environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved adaptive impedance control method for robotic arms in unknown soft terrain. First, a dynamic soft terrain model is established to simulate the unknown soft terrain environment. Based on this model, an improved adaptive impedance control method is designed, and its stability is rigorously proven. The proposed method is then comprehensively validated through simulation experiments, hardware-in-the-loop tests, and experiments using a planetary rover model in flat, inclined, and curved terrain scenarios.

It presents and analyzes both numerical and experimental findings, along with quantitative tests to assess the level of hyperchaos inherent in the generated trajectories. Furthermore, the article examines the scenario where two quadcopters simultaneously patrol the same workspace, exploring both numerical simulations and experimental outcomes.},

  abstract     = {3D object instance segmentation plays a vital role in various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics and virtual reality. However, tabletop scenes exhibit diverse object complexities and size variations. The challenge is to enhance the accuracy of segmenting these scenes for multiple object instances. This limitation directly impacts robots’ capabilities to effectively grasp and manipulate objects. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale deep learning and clustering-based approach for object instance segmentation in tabletop scenes. Our approach incorporates a multi-scale neighborhood feature sampling (MNFS) module specifically designed to extract local features, and a clustering algorithm to eliminate noise and preserve instance integrity. Furthermore, we combine the strength of both methods through ScoreNet and non-maximal suppression. We conducted extensive experiments on TO-Scene, the first large-scale dataset of 3D tabletop scenes, and observed an average mIoU improvement of approximately 4.07% compared to existing methods. This highlights the superior performance of our proposed method. In addition, we tested our algorithm on a real-scene robotics platform and showed that it has good performance and generalization capabilities to support future applications such as robot grasping.},

In this paper, an improved artificial potential field (IAPF) method is presented, in which the local path information is defined and used. And the calculation formulas for various forces in IAPF are given, which include repulsive force (R-force) of obstacle on the robot, the attractive force (A-force) of target on the robot, and the resultant force of R-force and A-force. Then, based on the local path information, a method for solving the robot falling into local optimality problem is proposed and used into IAPF. Finally, IAPF is respectively simulated and discussed in general scenario, complex scenario, and scenarios with the same and different size of circular obstacles. The results show that IAPF has higher efficiency than traditional artificial potential field (TAPF) method and can overcome the local optimality problem. At the same time, IAPF is compared with dynamic window method in the scenarios with the same and different size of circular obstacles. The results show that IAPF is more efficient than the dynamic window approach (DWA) for robot path planning.},

  abstract     = {At present, traditional analysis methods sometimes show incompatibility when analyzing the degree of freedom (DOF) of parallel mechanisms. In this research, a new DOF analysis method (MV-DOF method) based on primary-ancillary motion theory is developed. The 4PPRRR series-parallel mechanism is taken as an example, the analysis results by using the MV-DOF method are compared with those of traditional inverse helix theory and modified Grübler-Kutzbach formula, respectively. The comparison shows that this MV-DOF method can always analyze the DOF of the 4PPRRR series-parallel mechanism accurately, while the other two traditional methods show inapplicability sometimes. During the analysis, an important rule is also found that the ancillary motion is equivalent to local constraint helix motion, but it is not always true in turn. Based on this MV-DOF method, a DOF cutting analysis way is also suggested. Any output point on a complex mechanism can be taken as a cutting point, along which the mechanism can be cut into two independent sub-mechanisms. The output DOF of each sub-mechanism can be analyzed separately by using the MV-DOF method, then the intersection can be obtained as the DOF of the whole mechanism at this output point. This research provides a new and effective analytical way for DOF analysis of parallel mechanisms.},

In addition, by using forced oscillation control, it is possible to assist the movement of the wearer&#39;s periodic arm swing even if the weight and output moment of the reaction wheel is not large. Although a large torque of 2.65 Nm is required for the system to swing the arm, it was confirmed that the developed device can be used to increase the amplitude of arm oscillation and achieve an oscillation frequency equivalent to that of a human arm swing, even with a single reaction wheel exerting a torque of 0.4 Nm.},

Therefore, the relative positioning technology based on visual method is also widely used in UAV landing, but due to the influence of cross wind and the motion of the landing plane, the traditional visual landing sign and positioning method is prone to lose the positioning target at the end stage of the landing. Therefore, this article proposes a landing sign based on double-layer unique coding, which can realize continuous positioning in the horizontal direction and accurate positioning of large-scale changes in the vertical direction. Firstly, real-time image acquisition and image processing are carried out through the airborne camera. Based on the flight altitude and encoding extraction effect of the UAV, the red or blue channel component is extracted, and then the image is preprocessed, edge detection, line detection, coding grid extraction, etc. As long as any 5 × 5 small squares of the whole pattern can be extracted, the perspective-n-point algorithm is used to obtain the relative pose estimation between the UAV and the landing sign. Experiments show that the landing sign and recognition algorithm effectively improve the UAV landing reliability.},

Addressing this issue, we propose a novel feature fusion module that can efficiently leverage the color and geometry information in RGB-D images. Unlike prior fusion methods, our method employs a two-stage fusion process. Initially, we extract color features from RGB images and integrate them into a point cloud. Subsequently, an anisotropic separable set abstraction network-like network is utilized to process the fused point cloud, extracting both local and global features, which are then combined to generate the final fusion features. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight color feature extraction network to reduce model complexity. Extensive experiments conducted on the LineMOD, Occlusion LineMOD, and YCB-Video datasets conclusively demonstrate that our method significantly enhances prediction accuracy, reduces training time, and exhibits robustness to occlusion. Further experiments show that our model is significantly smaller than the latest popular 6D pose estimation models, which indicates that our model is easier to deploy on mobile platforms.},

In this study, we proposed a parameter optimization method for feedforward compensation of the link-length deviation and operator&#39;s habitual body movements in leader–follower control in 3D space. To optimize the parameters, we used Digital Annealer developed by Fujitsu Ltd, which could rapidly solve the combinatorial optimization problem.

In this paper, we present a sliding reinforcement learning (RL) method control for an upper-limb exoskeleton, enabling it to learn following a desired trajectory in the Cartesian space. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) using an actor-critic architecture is employed to continuously adjust the non-singular terminal sliding mode control (NSTSMC) control inputs, based on previous experiences. The designed actor network learns the policy and the critic evaluates the quality of the actions chosen by the actor. The robustness of the proposed approach is studied when the system is subjected to random disturbances. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach based on the RL method effectively fulfills exoskeleton tracking tasks. Moreover, a comparative analysis with the standard NSTSMC, computed torque (CT), and RL-based CT shows the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of position tracking error. These findings are further confirmed by various performance evaluation metrics.},

Existing methods are excellent when manipulator links are simple and obstacles are convex. But they cannot keep the accuracy and the efficiency at the same time when manipulator links or obstacles are nonconvex. To decrease the computing time and keep a high accuracy, this article presents a collision detection method based on point clouds and stretched primitives (PCSP). In traditional methods, obstacles are often represented either by a convex body or enormous amounts of points. But this needs a trade-off between the accuracy and the computing time when obstacles are concave. In the proposed method, we represent obstacles and complex manipulator links as stretched geometric bodies while simple manipulator links are enclosed by capsules with different sizes. The stretched body is constructed by the original point cloud from sensors but it only requires a small number of points to approximate the original object. We conducted the simulation experiment in our specific scenarios, and the results indicated that PCSP required less computing time while maintaining a high level of accuracy compared to existing methods. We also conducted standard benchmark tests in general scenarios, which showed that PCSP had advantages over libraries based on bounding volume hierarchies when concave objects are close together. Finally, we implemented PCSP for a manipulator obstacle-avoidance motion planning in a real-world environment, which demonstrated that PCSP was effective.},

Firstly, a multilevel docking marker is designed to achieve adaptive target matching within different distances during the docking process. The marker has strong robustness and can adapt to complex scenes such as occlusion, strong light, and large angle tilting, providing the redundant corner points required for machine vision detection pose information accurately. Secondly, a three-dimensional pose estimation algorithm is proposed, which can introduce depth information to correct the homography matrix. The algorithm combines the advantages of strong robustness to multilevel marker detection and high accuracy of depth information, and can output millimeter-level precision pose information in different environments, different inclination angles, and different occlusions. Finally, a flying car model experiment was carried out, and the results showed that the guidance technology can obtain millimeter-level precise pose information during the entire process of long distance-near distance-completion of docking, thus realizing precise docking.},

  abstract     = {To elucidate the dynamic coupling mechanism involved in multipoint/arbitrary point contact during human–robot interactions with redundant manipulators, we introduce a compliant control strategy that adapts to variable parameters. This strategy is based on the flexible contact dynamic equivalent twin system for human–robot interactions. Using the Virtual Elastic Element Representation model for arbitrary point contact dynamics and leveraging the skeleton principle for contact force conversion, we construct a flexible contact dynamic equivalent twin system tailored for redundant manipulators with multipoint/arbitrary point contact capabilities. Within this system, we implement real-time adjustments to the impedance stiffness coefficient in conjunction with the virtual end velocity of the manipulator. We optimize the joint angular velocity of the manipulator while considering the motion allocation of redundant degrees of freedom. This optimization enables multipoint contact variable parameter compliance control for safe human–robot interactions. To validate our approach, we analyze the multipoint contact dynamic model of the redundant manipulator&#39;s interaction with humans and assess the feasibility of the variable parameter compliance control method using robot operating system simulations. Ultimately, we verify the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed compliance control method through simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {According to the grasping requirements for fragile workpieces with cylindrical inner walls, a manipulator with internal bracing has been designed. The manipulator utilizes a constant-speed push cylinder to drive the linkage mechanism and accomplish the related works. Considering the fragile nature of the workpieces, reducing the impact velocity between the manipulator finger and the workpiece is a primary objective in the mechanism design. To achieve this, an optimization design is carried out, which maintains the overall average speed of the manipulator, while reducing the average speed only during the contact between the finger and the workpiece. The goal of optimization is to minimize the impact velocity at the contact point, using the linkage structure parameters as variables. The genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for the optimization process. The results show that optimization reduces the impact velocity at the contact point by 44.80%. To gain further insight into the influence of the process, a finite element model of a finger grasping a fragile object was created using joint modeling with the SolidWorks, Hyper Mesh, and LS-DYNA software. Simulations reveal that, after optimization, the maximum internal stress of three workpieces with thicknesses of 2.00 mm, 1.00 mm, and 0.50 mm was reduced by 47.42%, 41.53%, and 44.20%, respectively. To study the general law of the mechanical hand grasping fragile workpieces, the relationship between the cylinder driving speed and the impact speed is established. Based on the simulation results of maximum contact impact velocity, workpiece wall thickness, and maximum contact force, a prediction model of workpiece internal force is established using the Kriging prediction model theory. Additionally, the feasible range of grasping parameters under different wall thickness conditions is determined and discussed. The reliability of the designed structure is experimentally verified, providing valuable insights for ensuring the lifting work reliability of manipulators handling fragile workpieces.},

Despite the existence of robust methods such as ORBSLAM3, their effectiveness is limited in dynamic scenarios. The influence of moving entities in these scenarios poses challenges to data association, leading to compromised pose estimation accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes spatial reasoning to reduce the influence of dynamic entities present in an environment. Our approach, known as human–object interaction detection, identifies the dynamic nature of an object by evaluating the intersecting area between the bounding boxes of a person and the object. We tested our approach by extending the ORBSLAM3 RGB-D SLAM algorithm. Consequently, all ORB features associated with dynamic objects are filtered out from the ORBSLAM3 tracking thread. To validate our approach, we conducted evaluations on highly dynamic sequences extracted from the TUM RGB-D dataset. Our results exhibited a significant performance enhancement over ORBSLAM3. Furthermore, in comparison to other state-of-the-art research, our results remained competitive, given the simplicity of our approach.},

A means to achieve that is to use mobile robots in transportation-related tasks. However, their effectiveness is only achieved if the system has an efficient work distributor. This research developed a centralized coordination architecture using the island model genetic algorithm for multi-robot logistic task allocation. The coordination receives, allocates, and monitors tasks performed by robots with different payload capacities and average speeds. The architecture was developed upon the robotic operating system. Thus, any robot with a robotic operating system-based internal system can work under the coordination of this architecture. On the results, the task scheduler, developed in previous work, had the evaluation complemented. The scheduler based on the island model genetic algorithm allocates more tasks than the standard genetic algorithm when using the same heuristic. Regarding coordination architecture, the system successfully managed a group of robots in a simulated environment. It also detected and notified failures during task execution. Therefore, this system provides a complete task scheduling, allocation, and monitoring solution.},

  abstract     = {Mobile robots often follow humans in warehouse environments or indoor office spaces. A mobile robot requires a control system that stably follows humans without colliding with them. A human-following robot is composed of target detection, target tracking, and control. Conventional 2D laser-based human following systems exploit information from 2D planar laser data to detect human legs through machine learning methods, such as support vector data description and random forest. However, in crowded or cluttered environments, 2D LiDAR data is limited by the lack of features that distinguish human legs from obstacles. Due to the lack of features, false-positive detection is a problem in crowded or cluttered environments. Recent studies using 3D LiDAR have used sensors mounted at an elevated height to measure the overall shape of a person to extract features. Typical mobile robots are mounted in the bottom due to the vibration of the sensors, so there is a cost problem that additional sensors are required. We propose a framework for human following using 3D LiDAR. Our method is able to detect human legs using a LiDAR sensor attached at a low position without additional sensors. This study proposes a 3D laser-based human leg detection and tracking framework to improve the robustness of human-following for autonomous mobile robots. With a deep learning-based human leg detector, using the Point-Voxel-RCNN model, the proposed 3D human leg tracking system can help robots robustly follow humans in cluttered and crowded environments. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method in a practical cluttered environment by comparing the performance of a conventional human leg detection and following system.},

Since children and adolescents with this condition may present cognitive difficulties, there is a need for further investigation, with the aim of identifying a neuropsychological profile. Traditionally, the most used interventions in the literature involve drug treatment as well as cognitive behavioral therapy. In support of traditional treatment, new and sophisticated technologies are being explored to improve the results already achieved. Examples of these technologies involve software systems and augmented reality used to support cognitive behavioral therapy. In line with new technologies, this article presents an unprecedented clinical trial, in the context of neuropsychological assessment, involving the use of a humanoid robot as a verbal communication tool between the psychologist and the child. The pilot study involved four children with selective mutism, where in two cases the approach showed very promising results. In the other two cases, the children remained mute and chose not to interact with the robot. The results of this initial clinical trial motivated the team to evolve the experiment by including new cases of selective mutism.},

It is found that the effect of membranes becomes negligible when the relative stiffness between membranes and tendons is equal to or less than 1.2.

Utilizing high-quality images and sensor-derived state information, we design rewards to guide an agent’s movement from the initial to the final destination. The soft actor-critic algorithm is employed to learn the optimal policy from the interaction between the agent and the environment, informed by these states and rewards. In an innovative approach, we apply the variational autoencoder technique to extract latent vectors from high-quality images, reconstructing a new state space with vehicle state vectors. This method reduces hardware requirements and enhances training efficiency and task success rates. Simulation tests conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the superiority of our method over others.

  abstract     = {This study introduces the YORB-SLAM algorithm, a novel approach that integrates an enhanced ORB-SLAM2 framework with a lightweight YOLOv5 model to improve the robustness and accuracy of visual SLAM systems in indoor dynamic environments. By incorporating a variable threshold FAST corner detection algorithm, we optimize feature point extraction performance under unstable lighting conditions. An improved quadtree algorithm not only accelerates feature extraction but also retains richer image information. Further, we tailor a lightweight YOLOv5 model to our application scenario through self-training and devise a set of dynamic feature point elimination rules, significantly boosting performance in dynamic indoor scenes. Evaluations on six dynamic indoor sequences from the TUM dataset show that YORB-SLAM significantly outperforms the original ORB-SLAM2 in accuracy and exhibits better real-time capabilities than DS-SLAM and DynaSLAM.},

  abstract     = {Lifting path planning is critical for the safety and efficiency of tower cranes operating in dynamic construction environments. This paper proposes a lifting path planner to efficiently generate safe and smooth lifting paths for tower cranes in an unknown construction environment through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. Based on the Twin-Delayed DDPG (TD3) framework, the planner effectively plans a lifting path within constraints of collision avoidance and operational limitations using the local environmental information measured by lidar. A Long Short-Term Memory network is applied in the planner to handle the dynamic characteristics of the obstacles in the construction sites to ensure that the lifting path is collision-free with dynamic obstacles. A discrete-continuous hybrid action space for tower cranes is proposed to optimize planned lifting paths more suitable for practical engineering operations. Moreover, a novel reward function is introduced to optimize the smoothness of the lifting path, which improves the success rate and optimizes the energy and time cost. A new Hindsight Experience Replay algorithm is proposed to address the reward sparsity problem in lifting path planning, which improves the training speed. Simulation results in Webots platform show the presented method effectively reduces the planning time and achieves better performance on online path planning compared with the existing DRL path planning methods.},

Center-rotor pentacopters are characterized by the ability to generate thrust in the desired direction using two servomotors and an EDF motor to maintain a stable attitude without tilting or leaning during flight. In this paper, the mathematical modeling of a center-rotor pentacopter was verified through simulation and compared with a regular quadcopter. We also simulated the thrust of the center rotor to see how much it could withstand when a sudden gust of wind occurred.

The essential step of posture alignment in teleoperation is to calibrate the transformation matrix of the world coordinate system of the optical motion capture system and the robot base coordinate system. It was necessary to change the position and attitude of the camera robot in the studio frequently. At the same time, the studio was complex with strong personnel mobility, thus the world coordinate system of the optical tracking system in the studio was needed to be re-established frequently. These two points asked the pose calibration scheme of the camera robot in the optical tracking system to be convenient and universal. In this paper, a novel posture alignment method (PAM) was proposed, which was an automatic, accurate and quick method to complete the posture alignment for related coordinate systems without non-systematic errors. PAM was applied to teleoperation for camera robot by inverse movement matrix. The comparative experiments prove that the proposed method is better than manual method, with higher precision and stability, more flexible physical setting for reference coordinate system, and shorter operation time consuming. Meanwhile, PAM is more suitable for camera robot teleoperation than existed automatic method, because it does not require paying attention to the calibration postures.},

  abstract     = {According to the characteristics of ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm in mobile robot path planning, such as local optimal solution, slow convergence speed, low search efficiency, and propensity to produce numerous deadlock ants, an improved ACO algorithm based on island type (insular ACO (INACO)) is introduced. In this algorithm, firstly, several islands are established between the starting and the ending position of environment, serving as intermediate nodes for the paths searched by the ants. This greatly reduces the number of deadlock ants. Additionally, rectangular areas are initialized with non-uniform pheromone levels between adjacent islands, while other areas are set to a constant minimum pheromone value. This prevents blind searches during the initial stages of path planning. Furthermore, an adaptive volatilization coefficient is introduced into the global pheromone update rules to balance the convergence and global search ability. Finally, optimal parameter combinations of INACO are determined by simulation. INACO algorithm is simulated in various grid maps and compared with other improved ACO algorithms. Results demonstrate its superior global optimal search capability and rapid convergence speed. The average iterative times is 2.7 in a 20 × 20 grid environment and 4.7 in a 30 × 30 grid environment. Notably, INACO produces very few lost ants, with mean values of 50.1 and 95.2 in 20 × 20 and 30 × 30 grid environments, respectively.},

In this work, we aim to solve this problem by proposing a novel assignment algorithm that assigns a new leader from the follower robots to ensure robots complete their given task when their leader fails. This algorithm also assign role to new robots joining the group, as well as the failed robot when rescued back to the team. We drive robots towards their desired trajectories to achieve formation using a Lyapunov-based time-varying state tracking controller from the literature. Due to role switching amongst member robots, we propose a new variant of the limit-cycle obstacle avoidance algorithm to ensure smooth and collision free transition.

  abstract     = {Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-visual-inertial odometry can provide accurate poses for the localization of unmanned vehicles working in unknown environments in the absence of Global Positioning System (GPS). Since the quality of poses estimated by different sensors in environments with different structures fluctuates greatly, existing pose fusion models cannot guarantee stable performance of pose estimations in these environments, which brings great challenges to the pose fusion of LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry. This article proposes a novel environmental structure perception-based adaptive pose fusion method, which achieves the online optimization of the parameters in the pose fusion model of LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry by analyzing the complexity of environmental structure. Firstly, a novel quantitative perception method of environmental structure is proposed, and the visual bag-of-words vector and point cloud feature histogram are constructed to calculate the quantitative indicators describing the structural complexity of visual image and LiDAR point cloud of the surroundings, which can be used to predict and evaluate the pose quality from LiDAR/visual measurement models of poses. Then, based on the complexity of the environmental structure, two pose fusion strategies for two mainstream pose fusion models (Kalman filter and factor graph optimization) are proposed, which can adaptively fuse the poses estimated by LiDAR and vision online. Two state-of-the-art LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry systems are selected to deploy the proposed environmental structure perception-based adaptive pose fusion method, and extensive experiments are carried out on both open-source data sets and self-gathered data sets. The experimental results show that environmental structure perception-based adaptive pose fusion method can effectively perceive the changes in environmental structure and execute adaptive pose fusion, improving the accuracy of pose estimation of LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry in environments with changing structures.},

However, the accuracy of existing human–robot mechanics model is insufficient, impacting the execution of transfer tasks. To enhance the model’s precision, an improved model is proposed, integrating hip torque identification. This proposed methodology involves the simplification of the human structure based on the kinematic attributes associated with the embrace of individuals by robotic arms and the subsequent computation of its inertial parameters. Accordingly, the application of D’Alembert’s principle is employed to analyze the impact of embracing motion, human posture, and the position of human–robot contact on the forces exerted on the human. This culminates in the establishment of a model. Considering the static indeterminacy predicament inherent in the model, a biomechanical data set is curated for the dual-arm transfer scenario. Leveraging this data set, a deep neural network utilizing multilayer perceptron is trained to accurately identify hip torque, thereby improving the model. Accordingly, a robotic transfer platform featuring dual arms is developed and trailed on six subjects with varying anatomical profiles. The results show that the constructed model has high accuracy. This study provides critical mechanics insights for dual-arm transfer tasks, offering potential application value in the field of nursing and rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the application of robots in service, medical treatment, rehabilitation, and other fields, a humanoid cable-driven hybrid robot by imitating the structure of human arm is designed in this article. The robot is composed of a cable–spool–pulley system, series mechanism, and coaxial spherical parallel mechanism, which can achieve six degrees of freedom movement in space. A challenge with cable driving is that the movement of the rear end joints (such as pitch and roll) can alter the length or tension of the cable driven by the frontend joints, resulting in joint coupling. This interference can lead to a decrease in the motion accuracy of the robotic arm. In addition, it also affects the durability of cables or mechanical components such as bearings and pulleys. Considering the joint motion coupling phenomenon caused by the cable-driven, the decoupling method is proposed, and the kinematic model of the robot is established. To solve the nonlinear coupling characteristics and the uncertainty of the dynamics parameters, a controller is proposed for the humanoid cable-driven hybrid robot, combining proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control based on decoupling method (DC-PID) and the double delay deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) deep reinforcement learning algorithm. The trajectory tracking of the end-effector position and orientation are controlled by using DC-PID and TD3. And the simulation results show that the proposed control method has good trajectory tracking and convergence performance according to trajectory tracking error and training reward. Finally, the humanoid cable-driven hybrid robot prototype is developed. The experimental results of coupling compensation show that the average maximum error of the joint is reduced by 77.58% after considering the coupling compensation of the joint. The results of the controller validation experiments show that the DC-PID controller reduces the maximum error in each axis by 11.54%, 35.29%, and 40.16%, respectively, compared to the open-loop experiments.},

Our approach formulates a probability framework combing the pose-based loop closure detection probability and the appearance-based loop closure detection probability. In the proposed framework, the pose-based loop closure detection model is firstly derived from the nonlinear optimization model of odometry. Then the appearance-based loop similarity and the pose-based loop similarity are combined into a joint framework to improve the loop closure detection performance. We implemented our approach using C++ and ROS and thoroughly tested it on the publicly available datasets.

  abstract     = {Gas source localization is one of the most common applications of a gas-sensitive mobile robot. However, most of the existing work focuses on rule-based algorithms for wheeled robots, which are difficult to apply in complex terrain with obstacles. In this article, we propose an olfactory quadruped robot to perform the gas source localization task using the Dueling Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN) algorithm. For training, we designed a set of environments and imported gas dispersion data from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to construct a simulator. The olfactory quadruped robot was trained in this simulator using the Dueling DQN algorithm to learn how to find the gas source. The trained neural network was then deployed on the olfactory quadruped robot. Our method has been tested in both simulation and real environments. The olfactory quadruped robot can traverse rugged terrain in real experiments and efficiently find gas sources, demonstrating that our method is highly robust and has important practical value.},

  abstract     = {Currently, for years, unmanned aerial vehicles have been widely applied in a comprehensive realm. By enhancing computer photography and artificial intelligence, it can automatically discriminate against environmental objectives and detect events that occur in the real scene. The application of collaborative unmanned aerial vehicles will offer diverse interpretations which support a multiperspective view of the scene. Due to diverse interpretations of unmanned aerial vehicles usually deviates, thus, unmanned aerial vehicles require a consensus interpretation for the scenario. To previous purposes, this study presents an original consensus-based method to pilot multi-unmanned aerial vehicle systems for achieving consensus on their observation as well as constructing a group situation-based depiction of the scenario. Further, a fuzzy neural network generalized prediction control system known as a recurrent self-evolving fuzzy neural network is mainly used to ensure stability through the use of a descending gradient online learning rule. At the same time, users can think along the lines of evolutionary biological design. Unmanned aerial vehicles can be modeled as system experts for solving group problems that require the definition of conditions that best describe the scene. First, this method allows each unmanned aerial vehicle to set high-level conditions for detection events by aggregating events based on fuzzy information. These aggregated events are modeled by a fuzzy system ontology, which allows each unmanned aerial vehicle to report its preferences in conditions. Therefore, the interpretation of each drone is compressed to achieve a collective interpretation of the state. The final polls, consent and affinity polls confirmed the final decision group’s reliability ratings. The rated consensus indicates how well the collective interpretation of the scene matches each drone’s point of view.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental vision technique for industrial robots involves the six degrees of freedom pose estimation of target objects from a single image. However, the direct estimation of the six degrees of freedom object pose solely from a single image is subject to limited accuracy. Various refinement approaches have been proposed to improve the accuracy by utilizing rendered images from a 3D model. Nevertheless, balancing speed and accuracy in an industrial setting remains a challenge for these methods. In this study, we propose a novel six degrees of freedom pose refinement approach centered around matching real image patches. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not rely on a 3D model, resulting in increased speed and accuracy. In the offline phase, we construct an offline database using image patches obtained from real images. During the inference phase, our method initially identifies the image patch within the offline database that is closest to the initial pose. Subsequently, we refine the six degrees of freedom pose by matching the corresponding image patches from the offline database. Experimental results indicate that our six degrees of freedom pose refinement method achieves real-time capability with a frame rate of 71 Frames Per Second (FPS), along with high precision. When the threshold is set to 0.5% of the object diameter, the average distance of dots score on the test data surpasses 70%. Moreover, experiments involving gripping and assembling tasks on an industrial robot demonstrate the ability of our method to autonomously select appropriate grasping angles and positions in real time. It further generates suitable motion paths, ultimately ensuring production efficiency.},

In this work, we present a method to design the orienting strategy for positioning the irregular parts based on the constraints formed by the fixture, thus the irregular parts such as the motor can be precisely localized only with the robot squeezing actions. We then develop a peg-in-hole insertion strategy using the force constraints formed by the environment, where fewer robot actions are required to insert the peg, thus enabling efficient and precise peg-in-hole insertions. Finally, we developed a robot assembly system with three robots from Universal Robots to perform all the assembly tasks, including picking, holding, placing, and inserting. Experiments on the assembly of a belt drive unit reveal the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous exploration is a widely studied fundamental application in the field of quadrotor, which requires them to automatically explore unknown space to obtain complete information about the environment. The frontier-based method, one of the representative works on autonomous exploration, drives autonomous determination by the definition of frontier information so that complete information about the environment is available to the quadrotor. However, existing frontier-based methods are able to accomplish the task but still suffer from inefficient exploration, and how to improve the efficiency of autonomous exploration is the focus of research nowadays. Slow frontier generation affecting real-time viewpoint determination and insufficient determination methods affecting the quality of viewpoints are typical of these problems. Therefore, to overcome the aforementioned problems, this article proposes a two-level viewpoint determination method for frontier-based autonomous exploration. First, a sampling-based frontier detection method is presented for faster frontier generation, improving the immediacy of environmental representation compared to traditional traversal-based methods. Second, the access to environmental information during flight is considered for the first time, and an innovative heuristic evaluation function is designed to decide on high-quality viewpoint as the next local navigation target in each exploration iteration. Extensive benchmark and real-world tests are conducted to validate our method. The results confirm that our method optimizes the frontier search time by 85%, the exploration time by around 20%–30%, and the exploration path by 25%–35%.},

  abstract     = {Cable-driven soft robots hold significant potential for surgical and industrial applications, yet their performance and maneuverability can be further enhanced through design optimization. By optimizing the design, factors such as bending angles, manipulator deformation, and overall functionality can be directly influenced, leading to improved interaction with the environment and more accurate task performance. This article presents a physics-based design optimization approach for cable-driven soft robotic manipulators, aiming to enhance bending performance through structural design enhancements. Four design criteria, namely, cross-sectional shape, material, gap shape, and gap size, are considered in the optimization process. Given the inherent nonlinearity of soft materials, finite element modeling techniques are employed to analyze the effects of modifying each design parameter on displacement and bending angle. The manipulator’s design is evaluated using ABAQUS/CAE, and an analysis of variance test is conducted to identify significant performance differences among the design parameters. The results reveal that material variation has the most substantial impact, followed by gap shape and gap size. Based on subsequent parameter optimization, Dragon Skin 10 is determined to be the optimal material for bending motion, while a trapezoidal gap shape is preferred. In addition, a genetic algorithm is utilized to select a maximum gap size of 8.87 mm. These findings provide valuable insights into key design principles for cable-driven soft manipulators, aiming to enhance flexibility and reduce actuation forces. By establishing a fundamental understanding of the relationship between morphology and motion capability, this methodology demonstrates an effective simulation-driven optimization approach that incorporates the nonlinear elastic behavior of materials to improve performance. Overall, this work establishes a framework for optimizing cable-driven architectures to suit various applications in the field of soft robotics.},

  abstract     = {Model-based stereo vision pose estimation depends on the establishment of the model. The photo-model-based method simplifies the model-building process with just one photo. Programming languages do not predefine the shapes, colors, and patterns of objects. In the past, however, it was necessary to calculate a pixel per metric ratio, that is, the number of pixels per millimeter of the object, based on the photo’s shooting distance to generate a photo-model with the same size (length and width) as the actual object. It restricts the real application. The proposed method extends the traditional photo-modeling algorithm and relaxes the photo prerequisite for target pose determination. Various pixel per metric ratios will be assumed to generate 3D photo-models of different sizes. These models will then be employed in stereo vision image matching techniques to detect the pose of the target object. Since it is not a data-driven method, it does not require many pictures and pretraining time. This article applies the algorithm to the cleaning of seaports and aquaculture, aiming to locate dead or diseased marine life on the water surface before collection. Pose estimation experiments have been conducted to detect an object’s pose and a prepared photo’s pixel per metric ratio in real application scenarios. The results show that the expanded photo-model stereo vision method can estimate the pose of a target with one pixel per metric ratio unknown photo.},

  abstract     = {There are problems in the special pastoral environment, including large changes in target size and serious interference from light and environmental factors. To solve the above problems, an enhanced YOLOv4-tiny target detection network is proposed in this study. This network first solves the problem of livestock size fluctuation in pastoral areas, uses a pyramid network with multiscale feature fusion, and considers shallow local detail features and deep semantic information. Subsequently, a novel compound multichannel attention mechanism is proposed to increase the accuracy of the target detection network for the pastoral environment. The problem of poor accuracy of target detection network is solved. The algorithm is ported to Jetson AGX embedded platform for validation to examine the real-time performance of the algorithm. As revealed by the experimental results, enhanced YOLOv4-tiny achieves 89.77% detection accuracy and 30 frames/second detection speed, which increases the average detection accuracy by 11.67% compared with the conventional YOLOv4-tiny while maintaining almost the same detection rate.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of robots and the rising cost of electricity have spurred research into energy-reducing concepts in robotics. One such concept, elastic actuation, introduces compliant elements such as springs into the robot structure. This article presents a comparative analysis between two types of elastic actuation, namely, monoarticular parallel elastic actuation and biarticular parallel elastic actuation, and demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for their optimization. Starting from the real-world system identification of an RRR robotic arm, we calibrate a simulation model in a general-purpose physics engine and employ in silico evolutionary optimization to co-optimize spring configurations and trajectories for a pick-and-place task. Finally, we successfully transfer the in silico optimized elastic elements and trajectory to the real-world prototype. Our results substantiate the ability of elastic actuation to reduce the actuators’ torque requirements heavily. In contrast to previous work, we highlight the superior performance of the biarticular variant over the monoarticular configuration. Furthermore, we show that a combination of both proves most effective. This work provides valuable insights into the torque-reducing use of elastic actuation and demonstrates an actuator-invariant in silico optimization methodology capable of bridging the sim2real gap.},

  abstract     = {In the process of solving the inverse kinematics of six-degrees-of-freedom collaborative robots, the numerical solution has problems such as low accuracy and singular configurations. Moreover, due to the high coupling of its position and attitude, the direct closed-form solution fails. To address these problems, an inverse kinematics algorithm that combines closed-form and numerical solutions was proposed. The Jacobian matrix was established based on the forward kinematics equation of the six-degrees-of-freedom collaborative robot. Its inverse matrix was obtained by a singular value decomposition of the matrix using the Manocha elimination method to avoid the singularities of the Jacobian matrix. The optimal inverse kinematics solution was obtained using the Newton–Raphson iterative method. A computer simulation implemented in MATLAB and Visual C++ was used to evaluate the accuracy and speed of the proposed algorithm. The results of the trajectory planning experiments demonstrate that the algorithm satisfies the requirements for real-time smooth motion. This study of inverse kinematics lays the theoretical foundation for solutions to the inverse problem and real-time control of collaborative robots.},

  abstract     = {Redundant robots can complete other tasks while performing main task and have excellent motion performance. Although redundant robots have redundancy characteristics, they may still fall into singular configuration or cannot overcome joint limits due to the limitation of their own structure and motion law. Besides, currently, most of the research mainly focus on obstacle avoidance at the end of the robot. So comprehensive study is conducted on avoidance of obstacle, singularity, and joint limit of redundant robot. Firstly, the kinematics model of robot is obtained by D-H matrix method. Space vector distance method is proposed to calculate the position relationship between robot and obstacle, and potential function is constructed. Based on gradient projection method, using the damped generalized inverse and the weighted norm method, the mathematical models of obstacle avoidance, singularity avoidance, and joint limit avoidance are constructed. The simulation results show that the robot can avoid the obstacle in three-dimensional redundant space. At the same time, manipulability and minimum singular value of the robot are always positive. After adding the function of avoiding joint limit, during the whole control process, the motion range of joint angle is reduced and the angular velocity is relatively small, which ensure the motion stability of robot. Namely, the singular configuration and joint limit of robot are avoided. The research is of great significance for practical application of redundant robot.},
