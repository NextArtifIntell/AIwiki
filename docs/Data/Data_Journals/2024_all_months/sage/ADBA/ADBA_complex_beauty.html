  abstract     = {Goffin’s cockatoos ( Cacatua goffiniana ) can solve a diverse set of mechanical problems, such as tool use, tool manufacture, and mechanical puzzles. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying this adaptive behavior are largely unknown. Similarly, engineering artificial agents that can as flexibly solve such mechanical puzzles is still a substantial challenge in areas such as robotics. This article is an interdisciplinary approach to study mechanical problem solving which we hope is relevant to both fields. The behavior we are studying results from the interaction between a complex environment (the lockbox) and different processes that govern the animals’ behavior. We therefore jointly analyze the parrots’ (1) engagement, (2) sensorimotor skill learning, and (3) action selection. We find that none of these aspects could solely explain the animals’ behavioral adaptation and that a plausible model of proximate mechanisms must jointly address these aspects. We accompany this analysis with a discussion of methods to identify such mechanisms. At the same time, we argue, it is implausible to identify a detailed model from the limited behavioral data of just a few studies. Instead, we advocate for an incremental approach to model building in which one first establishes constraints on proximate mechanisms before specific, detailed models are formulated. To illustrate this idea, we apply it to the data presented here. We argue that as the field attempts to find mechanistic explanations for increasingly complex behaviors, such alternative modeling approaches will be necessary.},

  abstract     = {External representations ( ERs ) are objects or performances in the world whose proper function is to communicate about other things in the world. Why and how did we make them, and what do they give us? We outline a simple framework for thinking about ERs grounded in modern machine learning. We propose a minimal set of neural mechanisms needed for open-ended ER production. Our constructivist enactive view contrasts with nativist views which propose specialist neural modules requiring symbolic internal representations. We propose a plausible set of (biological and cultural) evolutionary steps to full Gricean symbolic communication via a set of increasingly complex enactive algorithms for ER production. A pragmatic space of games is defined, which includes not only fully cooperative language games but also science, art, and evolved signal manipulation games. This space is defined by the complexity of learning needed by sender and receiver. We propose that one important step towards open-ended ER use was selection for bush reading, which like mind-reading is an inferential process requiring complex contextual and syntactic understanding of cues about events displaced in space and time. Bush reading pre-adapted receivers to be receptive, competent, and perspicacious interpreters of later intentionally produced signals about hidden topics such as felt mental states. This paved the way for minimally Gricean communication, which subsequently could be bootstrapped into explicit theories of mind, folk psychology narratives, and symbolic language in general. Recent findings in cognitive archaeology are integrated within the framework, and new experiments in machine learning suggested.},

  abstract     = {Many theoretical studies defend the existence of ongoing phase transitions in the brain dynamics that could explain its enormous plasticity to cope with the environment. However, tackling the ever-changing landscapes of brain dynamics seems a hopeless task with complex models. This paper uses a simple Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model to illustrate how phase transitions that change the number of attractors in the landscape for the relative phase between two neural assemblies can occur, helping to explain a qualitative agreement with empirical decision-making measures. Additionally, the paper discusses the possibility of interpreting this agreement with the aid of Irruption Theory (IT). Being the effect of symmetry breakings and the emergence of non-linearities in the fundamental equations, the order parameter governing phase transitions may not have a complete microscopic determination. Hence, many requirements of IT, particularly the Participation Criterion, could be fulfilled by the HKB model and its extensions. Briefly stated, triggering phase transitions in the brain activity could thus be conceived of as a consequence of actual motivations or free will participating in decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic (hereinafter “the pandemic”) necessitated social distancing measures and limited physical contact, prompting the exploration of alternative methods for tasks like object delivery. Mobile service robots emerged as a potential solution, offering a bridge between humans and various tasks. While existing techniques have been introduced to enable robots to deliver objects in an end-to-end manner, they come with limitations. Grippers, for instance, can deliver only one object per round, cabinet robots require manual speed tuning to keep the object in place, and object holders lack generalizability. Inspired by the idea of human nature to use a tray to deliver the object, we developed the Visual-Based Adaptive Interaction System (hereinafter “VAIS”), a novel learning system, to improve service delivery using visual information and a fast neural learning mechanism. Within this system, the robot learns the optimal angular rotational and linear translational moving speeds to effectively transport objects placed on a tray without an extra holder. The robot validates these learnt movements by successfully completing multiple-object delivery tasks along designated routes. The results exhibit that the robot can utilize online learning after a few attempts to determine its proper moving speed and deliver different objects to a given location.},

  abstract     = {While organisms are continually experiencing and interacting with their environments, the role and extent of experiences in behavioral development has been controversial. Some argue that adaptive behaviors are acquired through experiences, while others claim they are the result of innate programs that don’t require environmental input. Such controversies have historically occurred within animal behavior and psychology, but similar debates are emerging in the field of artificial intelligence. Here, the debate is centered on those who design experience-dependent systems that are trained to learn the statistical properties of “environmental” inputs, and those advocating the use of pre-packaged artificially “innate” responses tailored to prespecified inputs. Those favoring artificial innateness draw analogies with animal behavior to argue that innateness is necessary for the emergence of complex adaptive behavior. But does behavioral development in animals reflect the unfolding of innate programs? Here we highlight the widespread role of specifically causal experiences in the ontogeny of species-typical behaviors. All behaviors are an outcome of a chain of organism-environment transactions—called ontogenetic niches—that begin in the earliest periods of life. This challenges the notion that organisms come prepared with innate programs for behavior. We suggest that an artificial intelligence that matches the complexity of animal behavior should be based on principles of behavioral development, where experiences are necessary and specifically causal factors in the emergence of behavioral abilities.},

We use the term basic trust to refer to the attitude of certainty we express when we act in skilled, often unreflective, habitual ways in the living environment. We will argue that the basic trust of people living in cities should be understood in relation to what we will call trusted urban places. Trusted urban places can be understood similarly as what Giovanna Colombetti and Joel Krueger have called “affective niches” that provide affordances for amplifying, dampening, and sustaining affective states. The basic trust of people living in cities, we will argue, depends upon people moving through and engaging with trusted urban places. In urbanism and architecture, it is barely recognized how the city affords places of affective significance that the person incorporates into their bodily way of existing. Persistent exposure to urban stressors can disturb basic trust in one’s living environment, resulting in a person no longer being at home in the world. We provide examples in which people, as a consequence of the repeated exposure to stressors, no longer move through and engage with trusted urban places, and the impact this has on their basic trust. Our aim is to understand how the urban environment can contribute to the path from stress to anxiety and mood disorders, and how a person can regain their openness to possibilities for regulating their emotions skilfully.},

  abstract     = {Many insects use view-based navigation, or snapshot matching, to return to familiar locations, or navigate routes. This relies on egocentric memories being matched to current views of the world. Previous Snapshot navigation algorithms have used full panoramic vision for the comparison of memorised images with query images to establish a measure of familiarity, which leads to a recovery of the original heading direction from when the snapshot was taken. Many aspects of insect sensory systems are lateralised with steering being derived from the comparison of left and right signals like a classic Braitenberg vehicle. Here, we investigate whether view-based route navigation can be implemented using bilateral visual familiarity comparisons. We found that the difference in familiarity between estimates from left and right fields of view can be used as a steering signal to recover the original heading direction. This finding extends across many different sizes of field of view and visual resolutions. In insects, steering computations are implemented in a brain region called the Lateral Accessory Lobe, within the Central Complex. In a simple simulation, we show with an SNN model of the LAL an existence proof of how bilateral visual familiarity could drive a search for a visually defined goal.},

The majority of current literature assumes that the trust degree between individuals is constant. However, the trust values among decision-makers (DMs) are subject to change over time. Thus, it is necessary to identify potential dynamic trust that is compatible with the actual SNGDM to support the consensus reaching. For this purpose, this article investigates consensus building that considers dynamic trust among DMs in SNGDM with linguistic distribution assessments (LDAs). Firstly, the three-dimensional trust degree among DMs is constructed from three perspectives: the trust relationship from social networks, the confidence level of DMs, and the similarity of DMs&#39; preferences. Secondly, an optimization model is developed with the objective of maximizing consensus to determine how trust degree is assigned to each perspective, thereby determining the weights of DMs. Then, a double feedback-based consensus mechanism incorporating both opinion evolution and trust evolution is developed. Under the guidance of consensus mechanism, an improved SNGDM approach with LDAs is presented. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed approach through a case study of sustainable supplier selection in a circular economy. Comparative analysis and sensitive analysis verify our approach’s effectiveness.},

Recent research has implemented Type 2 strategies (such as Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought), as strategies that mimic Type 2 reasoning, from Dual Process Theory, to interact with Large Language Models for improved results. The current paper reviews these strategies in light of the Predicting and Reflecting Framework for understanding Dual Process Theory and suggests what Psychology, drawing from research in executive functions, thinking disposition and creativity, can further contribute to possible implementations that address hallucination and reliability issues.},

  abstract     = {Studies have shown that, to a large extent, performance of a given perceptual task is independent of the specific sensitivities of the anatomical components used to perform that task. Consequently, the object of calibration—what it is that people become calibrated to when performing a given perceptual task—may be likewise independent of the specific sensitivities of the anatomical components used to perform that task. The experiment reported here used a transfer of calibration paradigm to investigate this hypothesis as well as the more specific hypothesis that the object of calibration is independent of the sensitivity of a given anatomical component to the particulars of a given energy form. In a pretest and posttest, participants perceived the distance of an occluded surface by two different modalities—by exploring that surface with a wooden rod and by doing so with and Enactive Torch, a vibrotactile sensory-substitution device. In a practice session, we manipulated which modality participants used to perform this task (Rod or Enactive Torch) and whether feedback about performance was provided. We found that, when feedback was provided during the practice session, recalibration of perception of surface distance transferred from the rod to the Enactive Torch, and vice versa. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that the object of calibration in this perceptual task is (potentially) independent of the particular form of mechanical energy generated when exploring the surface.},

  abstract     = {We investigated whether the adaptation of postural control to perform saccadic tasks is still maintained in challenging situations such as when the posture is challenged with a large movement of the moving room and with the addition of a second perturbation as a visual task of memorization. Thirty young adults (20.0 ± 1.3 years) were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. Participants stood upright on a force plate inside a moving room wearing eye-tracking. The room moved back and forth (anterior–posterior direction), at low (.6 cm—first and third trials) and high (3.5 cm—second trial) amplitude, and frequency of .2 Hz. In each trial, participants performed left-right horizontal saccades on a target (1.1 Hz). The experimental group also performed a concomitant number memorization task. There were no differences between groups in the coupling between center of pressure (CoP) displacements and visual stimulus in any condition. There was also no difference in the performance of the saccadic task. In the memorization task, CoP displacements in response to the visual stimulus frequency (room motion) were not affected. The performance in the memorization task was similar between room conditions. Overall, increasing cognitive involvement by adding a working memory task does not deteriorate the postural stabilization of young adults to accomplish accurate gaze shifts. Also, it does not interfere with adaptive visual reweighting due to changes in the moving room amplitude. In conclusion, young adults are flexible in optimizing their postural control to succeed in multiple tasks even under perturbation.},

Cue-based aggregation, where environmental cues determine the location of aggregation, is known to be challenging when the swarm density is low. Here, we propose a novel aggregation method applicable to real robots in low-density swarms. Previously, Landmark-Based Aggregation (LBA) method had used odometric dead-reckoning coupled with visual landmarks and yielded better aggregation in low-density swarms. However, the method’s performance was affected adversely by odometry drift, jeopardizing its application in real-world scenarios. In this article, a novel Reinforcement Learning-based Aggregation method, RLA, is proposed to increase aggregation robustness, thus making aggregation possible for real robots in low-density swarm settings. Systematic experiments conducted in a kinematic-based simulator and on real robots have shown that the RLA method yielded larger aggregates, is more robust to odometry noise than the LBA method, and adapts better to environmental changes while not being sensitive to parameter tuning, making it better deployable under real-world conditions.},

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced to model the human decision dynamics. Then, Imitation Learning (IL) based on maximum likelihood estimation is used to train Neural Networks (NN) that map human decisions to observed states. The results show that passive imitation substantially underperforms humans. We further refine the human-inspired policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL) using the on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm which shows better stability than other algorithms and can steadily improve the policies pre-trained with IL. We show that the combination of IL and RL match human performance and that the artificial agents trained with our approach can quickly adapt to reward distribution shift. We finally show that good performance and robustness to reward distribution shift strongly depend on combining allocentric information with an egocentric representation of the environment.},

  abstract     = {Risk-taking is a ubiquitous behavior and its assessment is a central aspect of understanding human decision-making. Self-report questionnaires can be used to probe risk-taking propensities in a domain-specific manner. In contrast, most behavioral tools for risk-taking assessment provide nonspecific, unitary measures with a strong bias towards risk scenarios involving monetary gains and losses tied to probabilities. In the current work, we evaluate a behavioral task designed to specifically address recreational risk-taking, that is, situations where decision-making is driven by intrinsic motivation and performance is rewarding in its own right. For this, we chose the Tower Building Task (TBT), in which participants use wooden blocks to attempt to build the tallest tower they can; a trial ends if the building collapses, the allotted time ends, or the builder is satisfied with their tower. We correlated the TBT scores with each of the domains provided by two widely used self-report instruments, the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking scale (DOSPERT) and the Evolutionary Domain-Specific Risk scale (ERS). We found small, but significant correlations between TBT scores and those of (i) the recreational domain of the DOSPERT as well as (ii) the environmental exploration domain of the ERS. These correlation values reflect a small degree of similarity between these tests, suggesting that they capture some aspects of the complex construct that is recreation. However, the small magnitude of the correlations highlights the need for a complementary set of tools to evaluate the full spectrum of recreational risk-taking activities.},

In contrast to “canonical affordances” (i.e., “ready-to-hand,” mundane instances), creative affordances point to unconventional or surprising action opportunities that are nonetheless valued. Our initial aim is to discuss how to frame the affordance concept to make it attractive for the study of creativity. We propose a dialectic position that reconciles aspects of the realism of ecological psychology with the constructivist view more typical of creativity scholars. We stress that novel options frequently depend on constructive actions; novelty cannot always simply be “found” or just waits to be used. Many creative opportunities only emerge from how person actively engages with the ecology. Our second aim is to explore specific ways that creativity is mediated through affordances, based on illustrations from crafts and dance. These suggest that affordances span various timescales and mediate in multiple ways, from noticing existing potentials, via active affordance shaping, to background activities that indirectly invite or enable novelty. In conclusion we discuss how a person’s creative “vision,” imagination and combinatoric ability, all fundamental creativity mechanisms, relate to affordances and how fruitful creative directions may be perceptually hinted at.},

To fill this gap, we propose an Ecological-Enactive (E-E) affordance-based account of situated causal engagement, that is, causal judgments and perceptions. We develop this account to improve our understanding of this way of dealing with the world, which includes making progress on the causal selection problem, and to extend the scope of embodied cognitive science to causal cognition. We characterize identifying causes as selectively attending to the relevant ecological information to engage with relevant affordances, where these affordances are dependent on individual abilities. Based on this we construe causal engagement as based on a learned skill. Moreover, we argue that to understand judgments of causation as we make them in our daily lives, we need to see them as situated in sociocultural practices. Practices are about doing, and so this view helps us understand why people make these judgments so ubiquitously: to get things done, to provide an effective path to intervening in the world. Ultimately this view on causal engagement allows us to account for individual differences in causal perceptions, judgments, and selections by appealing to differences in learned skills and sociocultural practices.},

Whereas in traditional societies there was diversity of expertise, contemporary social media facilitates homophily, which isolates true subject experts from each other and from the wider population. Diversity of knowledge thus becomes social division. Here, we discuss the potential of a cultural-evolutionary framework designed for the countless choices in contemporary media. Cultural-evolutionary theory identifies key factors that determine whether communication networks unify or fragment knowledge. Our approach highlights two parameters: transparency of information and social conformity. By identifying online spaces exhibiting aggregate patterns of high popularity bias and low transparency of information, we can help define the “safe limits” of social conformity and information overload in digital communications.},

  abstract     = {The formation and evolution of public opinion have been widely studied to understand how consensus forms due to atomic interactions between individuals. While many studies have paid attention to modelling influence and interaction, most of the literature assumes static agents, ignoring the frequent changes in physical locations expected in real life. This feature naturally allows humans to interact with diverse people and avoid disagreement, which heavily impacts the co-evolution of opinions, communities or isolation in human societies. Our previous work proposed an extension of the bounded confidence model inspired by the theories of homophily and cognitive dissonance, which concern humans’ natural behaviours of attraction and disagreement. Although this demonstrated a marked difference to a static opinion model and purely random mobility, the limited experiments gave little insight into the causes or the resulting structures of consensus. This article addresses these shortcomings through a thorough investigation of the impact of mobility modelled by different mechanisms. Through extensive simulation, we observe a transition from multiple stable opinion clusters to complete consensus and a shift from a geographically based organisation to isolated structure-less agents. Lastly, we propose a novel classification of the different outcomes of self-organisation in opinion models, highlighting the patterns of emerging behaviours across the spectrum of interaction range and influence parameters.},

We conduct a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art algorithms, focusing on QD (Quality-Diversity) algorithms, based on a well-defined methodology for benchmarking evolutionary algorithms. We introduce carefully chosen indicators to evaluate their performance in three core aspects: task performance, phenotype diversity, and genotype diversity. Our findings highlight MNSLC (Multi-BC NSLC), with the introduction of aligned novelty to NSLC (Novelty Search with Local Competition), as the most effective algorithm for diversity preservation (genotype and phenotype diversity), while maintaining a competitive level of exploitability (task performance). MAP-Elites, although exhibiting a well-balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration, fall short in protecting morphological diversity. NSLC, while showing similar performance to MNSLC in terms of exploration, is the least performant in terms of exploitation, contrasting with QN (Fitness-Novelty MOEA), which exhibits much superior exploitation, but inferior exploration, highlighting the effects of local competition in skewing the balance toward exploration. Our study provides valuable insights into the advantages, disadvantages, and trade-offs of different algorithms in co-evolving morphology and control.},

  abstract     = {The enactive approach characterizes life and cognition as sense-making. The standard description of sense-making entails the co-emergence of an agent’s self and a meaningful world, as well as the emergence of a normativity that guides the behaviour of the coupled agent-environment system. This emergent process happens at different levels of interactions: biological, sensorimotor, intercorporeal and linguistic. Sense-making therefore accounts for the natural origins of intentionality and meaning and gives continuity to the emergent enactive processes of life and mind. The standard description of sense-making is nonetheless too abstract and neglects many historical and ecological aspects relevant to the scientific study of life and mind processes as they happen in concrete fields of action. To address this issue, I propose the enlarged description of sense-making in the wild, which is based on three fundamental concepts: norm development, enactive-situated normativity and transverse emergence. Norm development defines sense-making as a historically situated process that transforms the previously given dynamical configuration of the agent-environment system into a new one. Enactive-situated normativity asserts that in addition to the agent’s self-maintenance and the material constraints of the agent-environment system, many dynamical constraints, ecologically situated, shape the origin, maintenance and development of sense-making processes. Finally, transverse emergence describes the transformational process of the whole agent-environment system dynamically, as a reconfiguration of the landscape of attractors that exhibit the typical behaviour of the system. Sense-making in the wild thus aims to facilitate conceptual tools to study enactive cognition, as it happens in concrete fields of action.},

  abstract     = {The notion of atmosphere has taken prominence in contemporary architecture discourse, in which it is used mainly to denote the affective characteristic of inhabitable spaces. In this paper, we employ the ecological-enactive approach to cognition to explain how atmospheres are perceived and created. According to that approach, cognitive systems actively explore meaningful possibilities for action in their environments. We thereby construe the perception of atmospheres as the possibilities for being in certain moods by exploring what the place affords. The perception of atmospheres is, therefore, a meaningful activity that is ultimately related to the organism’s biological interests, which we argue, is a type of meaning that cannot be fully conveyed descriptively. From this, it seems to follow that architects cannot foresee the atmospheres of a place during the designing phase of their projects. We avoid this undesirable conclusion by evoking the material engagement theory and the situated aspect of cognitive performances. Accordingly, skillful architects can imagine the intended atmospheres of a place by creating what we call proto- atmospheres, which involves creatively thinking through and with their tools.},

  abstract     = {In a recent remarkable article, Froese (2023) presents his Irruption Theory to explain how motivations can make a behavioral difference in motivated activity. In this opinion article, we review the main tenets of Froese’s theory, and highlight its difficulty in overcoming the randomness challenge it supposedly solves, that is, the issue of how adaptive behavior can arise in the face of material underdetermination. To advance our understanding of motivated behavior in line with Froese’s approach, we recommend that future work should endorse a multilevel pluralistic approach to causation and explanation in which motivations could genuinely play an irreducible role. Additionally, in line with the life-mind continuity thesis, we suggest that the best place to look for the interplay between motivations and nonmotivational physical, biological, and dynamical factors, may be at the level of the continuous feeling of being an embodied, living organism.},

  abstract     = {Learning is a major determinant of behavioral change for some organisms through their lifecycles. From an associative perspective, learning is assumed to occur whenever organisms experience particular statistical regularities in their environment; specifically, meaningful outcomes that follow certain cues or actions chiefly contribute to behavioral change. However, numerous empirical reports reveal that not all cue–outcome and action–outcome combinations are learned equally well, a phenomenon that is termed belongingness . Those reports are valuable as descriptive-level knowledge, but beg further considerations, like what is the origin, adaptive value of, and underlying mechanisms associated with the predisposition to couple particular events. Contrary to what is often assumed, the mere observation of learning predispositions says little as to whether they arise from genetics, are constrained by hardwired neural circuitries, or have been ecologically advantageous in an evolutionary timescale. The present paper aims to present a number of notions from different research fields outside the hard core of associative learning and, in so doing, provides elements for careful study and conceptualization of this issue. Thereafter, these notions are pooled to understand behavioral variation in a wide array of phenomena, thus, bringing a more informed approach to the nature versus nurture debate.},

  abstract     = {Toluene-based inhalants found in some common products, such as paint thinner or glues, may be used to induce intoxication. Though addiction may be one of its most detrimental consequences, treatment options are insufficient or limited. Environmental enrichment (EE) refers to housing conditions that enhance sensory, cognitive, and motor stimulation. This paradigm induces beneficial effects in a variety of animal models of brain disorders, and also in animal models of drug addiction. Previous studies have shown that toluene induces behavioral sensitization and that EE treatment can reduce this response. Since EE comprises a variety of elements, the aim of the present study was to group mice into five different types of EE-shaping housing conditions (4 weeks) and to identify which of them are key elements in attenuating toluene-induced behavioral sensitization. The experimental groups were: Standard housing with conspecifics; EE with conspecifics; Toys stimulation with conspecifics; Exercise wheels with conspecifics; and Wheel and toy isolated. Mice in Standard housing and previously exposed to toluene exhibited high locomotor activity, suggesting behavioral sensitization. When animals were exposed to toluene and then housed in EE with conspecifics or Exercise wheels with conspecifics conditions an attenuation of behavioral sensitization was observed ( p &lt; 0.001; 100% and 75% effectiveness, respectively). Toy with conspecifics housing also reduced behavioral sensitization, but in a less proportion than the two previous mentioned treatments ( p &lt; 0.002; 33.5% effectiveness). Mice in the Wheel and toy isolated housing did not show significant changes in the assessed behavior ( p = 0.061; 12.4% effectiveness). We suggest that exercise and social interaction are the key enriched main elements to attenuate toluene-induced behavioral sensitization. Our results advise preclinical strategies for inhalant abuse interventions based on social interactions and physical exercise. Also, they provide guidelines to develop experimental models with diverse environments and groups that lead us to understand the complexity of environmental enrichment.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of altruistic behaviors in heterogeneous populations of autonomous robots, especially in signaling tasks, has proven to be a difficult problem to solve. However signaling and altruistic behaviors are present throughout the tree of life. Specially giving that, signaling behaviors seem to have evolved multiple times whenever there is a channel to emit a signal and one to receive it. In this work, this problem is addressed, using evolutionary algorithms, and modeling phenomena such as kin selection and kin discrimination in a biologically plausible way. We also used self-organizing maps to analyze the behavior of these populations during the evolutionary process, within the solution space. We believe that this approach can shed light on the predictive power of the Hamilton rule, the importance of kin selection in the evolution of altruistic behaviors, and how self-organizing maps can allow us to observe the different solutions in which the evolutionary algorithm converges through time.},

  abstract     = {Interestingly, the interactions between members of a social group and across people of different social groups often happen through mutual understanding and reciprocate behaviour by means of gestures or eye contact. A controlled laboratory experiment is used to test the effect of interactions between members of a social group and across social groups on the walk dynamics of people. This study tries to discover the trade-off made by people between the need to communicate/interact between group members and the need to avoid collision with opposing pedestrians in a bidirectional flow. Thirty adults participated in a series of controlled experiments. The individuals and group characteristics were compared to study the effect of social groups. Spatial patterns/group formations, average walking speeds, and deviation from the desired direction of motion were assessed. The analysis shows that time to cross the platform is the least when triads adopt the river and inverted V group formations. In contrast, V and line-abreast group formations require slightly more time and are better suited to promote interactions between the group members. Irrespective of the initial formation adopted by participants, there is a higher tendency for the groups to shift to river formation or inverted V formations. This may be a result of the higher group speeds observed in the Inverted V and river formations, which accelerates their progress in the direction of motion. The understanding of walking dynamics of social groups from this study can enable better planning of pedestrian facilities and crowded events.},

  abstract     = {Enactive approaches to cognitive science as well as contemporary accounts from neuroscience have argued that we need to reconceptualize the role of temporality and affectivity in minds. Far from being limited to special faculties, such as emotional mental states and timekeeping, these accounts argue that time and affect both constitute fundamental aspects of minds and cognition. If this is true, how should one conceptualize the relation between these two fundamental aspects? This paper offers a way to conceptualize and clarify the relation between temporality and affectivity when understood in this fundamental sense. In particular, the paper contributes to ongoing discussions of structural temporality and affectivity by combining enactive notions of self-maintenance with a thermodynamically informed view of the organization of living systems. In situating temporality and affectivity by way of their role for the maintenance of thermodynamic non-equilibrium, I will argue that temporality and affectivity should be regarded as two sides of the same coin—that is, two distinct ways of highlighting one and the same process. This process corresponds to the continued differentiation of organism and environment as functional poles of a living system. The temporal and affective structure of living systems may thus be seen as the warp and weft by which living systems maintain themselves in terms of thermodynamic non-equilibrium.},

Using the generally agreed upon definition of lying, we here develop an enactive account of the dynamics of lying. At face, lying poses a problem for enactive theories of cognition since lying seemingly requires the ability to represent counterfactual states of affairs and implant those representations in other agents&#39; belief systems. On our account, lying involves the active manipulation of the short- and long-term dynamics of social cognitive systems so that agents have access to different sets of affordances from the one’s they counterfactually would have had access to without the lie. Representing truths and falsehoods are replaced with competency within social-cultural and material practices.},
