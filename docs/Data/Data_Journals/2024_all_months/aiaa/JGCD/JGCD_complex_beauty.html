These constraints, including polynomial constraints accounting for aerodynamic and gyroscopic effects, were transformed into linear constraints using novel state-space augmentation. This allows for the design of a reference governor, which is designed to safeguard the drone’s flight envelope by adjusting the reference trajectory during trajectory tracking while also ensuring yaw tracking with lower priority than position tracking, especially when constraints are at risk of being violated. This study also presents simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a new framework for model-based continuous-time reinforcement learning (CT-RL) control of hypersonic vehicles (HSVs). The predominant classes of CT-RL methods for general nonlinear systems in adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and deep RL tend to either present substantial theoretical results but lack practical synthesis capability (ADP) or show empirical promise without offering theoretical guarantees (deep RL). Meanwhile, RL control frameworks developed directly for HSVs tend to require a simplified model and complicated control structure, and they lack the substantial numerical evaluations essential for real-world flight implementation. To directly address these challenges, we propose a new decentralized excitable integral reinforcement learning framework within which the reference input-based exploration improves persistence of excitation. Together with new insights on prescaling and established decentralized control structure for HSVs, we demonstrate the resulting controller for significant performance improvement over classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and feedback linearization methods. Additionally, we provide convergence, optimality, and closed-loop stability guarantees of the proposed method. We demonstrate these performance guarantees over a set of substantial and systematic numerical evaluations on an unstable, nonminimum phase HSV model subject to varying modeling errors and initial conditions.},

This requires that the system maintain a catalog of its local neighborhood; however, this imposes a large burden on each agent to update its catalog. This paper considers the case of multiple satellites each maintaining their catalog. Specifically, this paper considers the case of numerous noncooperative objects and a collection of agents operating in the same local environment. The goal of each agent is to maintain their catalog of all bodies (objects and agents) within this neighborhood through onboard angles-only measurements and cooperative communication with the other agents. A central supervisor selects the target body for each agent, a local controller tracks the selected target body for each agent, and a local estimator coalesces both an agent’s measurements and state estimates provided by neighboring agents within the communication graph. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the supervisor’s ability to select an appropriate target subject to an uncertainty threshold, the controller’s ability to track the selected target, and the estimator’s ability to maintain an accurate and precise estimate of each of the bodies in the local environment.},

Reachable sets with rest boundary conditions, that is, zero-velocity constraints imposed at initial and final times, are of interest for formation flying and spacecraft rendezvous and docking applications. The rest-to-rest reachability problem is extended to compute reachable neighboring circular orbits and a modified problem formulation is developed to exclusively compute the maximum and minimum reachable circular orbits. Reachable sets are computed by applying classical optimal control techniques to a maximum position optimization problem. A solution method for the optimization problem is outlined, which makes use of a Newton’s method solving schema. Additional constraints are added to the problem to compute maxima along specified directions, allowing for the characterization of the reachable set in as many directions as desired. Example reachable sets are computed to illustrate the use of this method on various systems, including an application to relative motion.},

It is shown that if the satellite has only a longitudinal component of the intrinsic magnetic moment, it is convenient to separate the attitude motion into the unperturbed motion and the perturbations from the nonpotential components of the considered torques. The bifurcation analysis of the critical points of the unperturbed dynamic potential demonstrates the influence of the main system parameters on their existence and stability and provides an intuitive understanding of the possible regimes of attitude motion. Numerical simulations show that, in addition to regular attitude motion of the considered satellites, chaotic regimes are also possible.},

  abstract     = {Interstellar objects (ISOs) are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous—a deep-learning-based guidance and control framework for encountering fast-moving objects, including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real time. It uses pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by a spectrally normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are tuned with a loss function directly penalizing the model predictive control state trajectory tracking error. We show that Neural-Rendezvous provides a high probability exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error, the proof of which leverages stochastic incremental stability analysis. In particular, it is used to construct a non-negative function with a supermartingale property, explicitly accounting for the ISO state uncertainty and the local nature of nonlinear state estimation guarantees. In numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to satisfy the expected error bound for 100 ISO candidates. This performance is also empirically validated using our spacecraft simulator and in high-conflict and distributed unmanned aerial vehicle swarm reconfiguration with up to 20 unmanned aerial vehicles.},

Taylor polynomials of the solution flow exhibit large approximation errors when the control sequence changes within the domain of operation. This property is leveraged through automatic domain splitting, a technique that tracks the approximation error and splits the domain into smaller subdomains when high errors are observed. After multiple splits, the domain is autonomously separated along the boundaries between different optimal control sequences. Crucially, each resulting subdomain encompasses only a single control sequence, ensuring that any guidance updates obtained from the final polynomial map provide the corresponding optimal control sequence. To ensure high accuracy of the guidance updates, this work also develops an efficient and iterative-less differential-algebra-based refinement algorithm, which is applied to the outputs of the polynomial map. The overall guidance scheme provides highly accurate guidance updates in response to large trajectory deviations, including new optimal control sequences, as demonstrated in an Earth–Psyche transfer.},

  abstract     = {Feedback control for close-range orbital rendezvous, which permits choosing the direction of the final approach, is beneficial for numerous space missions. However, developing such a feedback controller for satellites operating with constant-magnitude low thrust without introducing chattering is nontrivial due to the underactuated nature of the dynamics. This paper develops a feedback control law for rendezvous with a target on a nearly circular orbit, assuming that the chaser satellite utilizes constant-magnitude low thrust. Based on the Clohessy–Wiltshire (CW) model, a sliding surface is chosen on which the states approach the origin. A feedback law driving given initial states to the sliding surface is developed first. Close to the origin, a bang-bang type controller is then employed, which drives the state errors to zero in finite time while allowing to choose the final approach direction along the R-, V-, or H-bar. Solutions to the state trajectories are obtained in closed form, except for the case of the R-bar approach, which is proven to be finite-time stable. It is shown that the higher-order dynamics neglected in the CW equations can be handled through dynamic inversion combined with a hopping maneuver.},

  abstract     = {This is Part II of a two-part paper. Part I presented a universal Birkhoff theory for fast and accurate trajectory optimization. The theory rested on two main hypotheses. In this paper, it is shown that if the computational grid is selected from any one of the Legendre and Chebyshev families of node points, be it Lobatto, Radau, or Gauss, then the resulting collection of trajectory optimization methods satisfies the hypotheses required for the universal Birkhoff theory to hold. All of these grid points can be generated at an computational speed. Furthermore, all Birkhoff-generated solutions can be tested for optimality by a joint application of Pontryagin’s- and covector-mapping principles, where the latter was developed in Part I. More importantly, the optimality checks can be performed without resorting to an indirect method or even explicitly producing the totality of necessary conditions that result from an application of Pontryagin’s principle. Numerical problems are solved to illustrate all these ideas in addition to demonstrating near-exponential rates of convergence. The examples are chosen to particularly highlight three practically useful features of Birkhoff methods: 1) bang-bang optimal controls can be produced without suffering any Gibbs phenomenon, 2) discontinuous and even Dirac delta covector trajectories can be well approximated, and 3) extremal solutions over dense grids can be computed in a stable and efficient manner.},

  abstract     = {Over the last two decades, pseudospectral methods based on Lagrange interpolants have flourished in solving trajectory optimization problems and their flight implementations. In a seemingly unjustified departure from these successes, a new starting point for trajectory optimization is proposed. This starting point is based on the recently developed concept of universal Birkhoff interpolants. The new first-principles’ approach offers a substantial computational upgrade to the Lagrange theory in completely flattening the rapid growth of the condition numbers from to , where is the number of grid points. Furthermore, a Birkhoff discretization offers the theoretical possibility of an infinite-order rate of convergence. In addition, the Birkhoff-specific primal-dual computations are isolated to a well-conditioned linear/convex system even for nonlinear, nonconvex problems. This is Part I of a two-part paper. In Part I, the new theory is developed on the basis of two hypotheses. Other than these hypotheses, the theory makes no assumptions on the choices of basis functions, be they polynomials or otherwise, or even the distribution of grid points. Several theorems are proved to establish the mathematical equivalence between direct and indirect Birkhoff methods. In Part II of this paper, it is shown that a select family of Gegenbauer grids satisfy the two hypotheses required for the theory to hold. The theory developed in Part I is used in Part II to produce the fast computational implementation.},

A quantitative correlation remains elusive. In recent years, new physiological measurement devices have been developed that, together with software processing tools, can provide accurate measures of psychophysiological measures, including cognitive workload, distraction, and high/low engagement, based on electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram measures (i.e., brain waves and heart rate variability). The pilot compensation referred to in the Cooper–Harper scale is also a function of task performance measures that reflect aircraft characteristics and inceptor activity that reflects upon physical workload. Using a new piloted simulation test database generated in Manned Flight Simulator’s containerized rotary-wing simulator with 10 experienced test pilots, a machine-learning-based software algorithm that integrates a disparate mix of pilot–vehicle system, physiological, and task performance measures was used to further develop an approach to predict handling qualities levels and ratings.},

Such wind reconstruction algorithms typically include regularization in order to adequately handle the noise within the data. This paper presents an empirical Bayesian approach to choosing optimal regularization parameters for any given set of measurements. Using simulations of flight through turbulence, the Bayesian approach is compared with a former approach (based on engineering guess) and an omniscient optimizer, which yields the best achievable results for a constant set of parameters by using the full knowledge of the wind field. The Bayesian approach is shown to outperform the engineering guess and performs close to the omniscient optimizer while purely relying on the lidar measurement data.},

We apply our coverage strategy to the problems of coverage of a surface enclosing the structure, coverage using multiple agents, coverage by conforming to the shape of the structure, and coverage of a moving vehicle. For coverage by conforming to the shape, we introduce an attractive-repulsive force that ensures that the agent is locked at an optimum distance from the structure’s surface while moving around it; for coverage of a moving vehicle, we introduce a follower force that corrects for the error in the speed of the covering agent along the heading direction of the vehicle. We discuss a wide variety of enclosing surfaces that can be used and introduce two novel metrics, and , that measure the completeness and uniformity of the coverage, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate extensions of our coverage strategy to diverse applications, such as preferential coverage and coverage of complex structures.},

  abstract     = {Preview control using wind estimates derived from Doppler wind lidar measurements is a promising technique for designing active gust load alleviation functions. Due to the relatively high noise levels in the lidar measurements, the associated estimator must use some type of smoothing to obtain a usable estimate for gust load alleviation. In the resulting wind estimate, this results in the loss of some of the information as well as a filtered and reduced component of the measurement noise. Taking the losses and noise into account during control synthesis should help ease the tuning procedure and improve the performance and robustness of the resulting controller. This paper proposes a method based on a maximum a posteriori interpretation of the wind estimation problem to consistently produce linear filters that closely approximate the behavior of the complete measurement chain (sensor and wind estimator) and that can be integrated into a linear control synthesis framework. Its characteristics are shown to closely match those of the real estimator over a range of types of turbulence using a standard set of system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Active flutter suppression technologies have the potential to lead to major weight savings while keeping the envisaged flight envelope for the future generation of commercial aircraft. Since the stabilization of aeroelastic systems undergoing flutter instabilities is strongly affected by actuators’ characteristics and delays in the closed loop, the degradation of closed-loop performance due to actuators’ nonlinearities must be thoroughly understood. Comparisons between the region of attraction and the controllable region can support the quantification of performance loss due to common actuators’ nonlinearities, such as amplitude and rate limits. At first, this paper illustrates a numerically robust algorithm for the full characterization of the controllable region of a generic unstable system under input amplitude and rate constraints. Secondly, the concept of region of attraction is expanded to assess the boundedness of the closed-loop response in the presence of input saturation and atmospheric disturbances. These concepts are here employed to define two nonlinear performance measures that quantify the performance loss due to actuators’ saturation in an unstable aeroelastic system stabilized by a flutter suppression controller. The approach is demonstrated on a realistic aeroelastic system for which different and output feedback controllers are synthesized to augment the damping of the critical flutter mode.},

  abstract     = {Many control allocation algorithms require the calculation of (pseudo)inverses of control effectiveness matrices, also referred to as a matrix, which for nonlinear systems might change over time. Such cases would require an online calculation of the respective inverses. Storage of all possible, offline precalculated inverses might exceed available memory sizes in common aircraft applications. This is especially relevant for systems with a high number of control effectors, like novel aircraft configurations. Several control allocation algorithms exist that require updates of the matrix to be inverted, the considered example being Redistributed Scaled Pseudoinverse. Within the Redistributed Scaled Pseudoinverse algorithm, the control allocation problem is solved iteratively by sequentially removing the columns of the matrix that belong to saturated effectors. An approach using the Sherman–Morrison formula is presented in this study, which calculates the inverses based on recursive updates. This proposed approach has the following advantages over conventional Redistributed Scaled Pseudoinverse algorithm: reduced computational load and ease of protection against run-time errors. These make it a candidate for use in the context of safety-critical applications. The approach gives promising results and shows significant decrease of computational time. However, specific numerical challenges require additional investigations.},

In this paper, a data-driven approach to linear observer tuning is proposed and illustrated for predicting the rotor mast bending moments using fixed-frame rigid-body measurements only. The method is demonstrated on a research helicopter, where flight test data is used to identify three possible design models, optimize their respective observer performances, and select the most promising model structures for final application. The resulting observers are assessed in the time and frequency domains using sweep and turbulence data. The results show that data-driven observer tuning allows the effective adaptation of the observer to the reference data. To extend the observer to a larger flight envelope, improved models and a larger database would be required.},

Trajectories with a high number of flybys and multiple resonance flybys are usually hard to optimize, especially with small-size/short-period flyby moons. This work proposes a new mutation operator that is incorporated with the Monotonic Basin Hopping in the Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator tool; this mutation operator increases the exploration of resonance flybys to improve convergence in moon tour design optimization problems. In this work, the Hidden Genes Genetic Algorithm is used to optimize the undetermined number of moon flybys. A Europa Clipper-like mission is optimized assuming two-body dynamics, and a validation study for the proposed resonance mutation operator is presented. The results include an optimized baseline solution and a new solution with a different sequence of flybys with a different sequence of flybys for the Europa Clipper-like mission, in addition to an optimized moon tour in the Saturnian system.},

  abstract     = {To track orbits in cislunar space, predict where they will naturally move over time, and identify where unbounded trajectories come from, one may consider local action-angle orbital elements—coordinates that relate a spacecraft state to specific trajectories and exist in approximately integrable regions of the Earth–moon circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). As local action-angle elements are a semi-analytical analog to two-body orbital elements, the theory is extended to allow for the study of arbitrary perturbations to the dynamics. Namely, we derive Gauss equations for an arbitrary perturbing acceleration—continuous or discrete—to the CR3BP. Examples for continuous thrust and impulsive are provided in cislunar space, i.e., around Earth–moon in the CR3BP. Strategies for instantaneous maneuver design and transfers between quasi-periodic orbits and manifolds are developed.},

  abstract     = {“Spacecraft encounter” refers to a close flyby or fast proximity between two or more spacecraft in space. It involves the approach of one spacecraft to another, whether for observation, communication, capture, or interception purposes. This paper presents a novel approach to planning orbital encounter missions for spacecraft within a specified time constraint. The proposed method takes advantage of a unique encounter process where the vehicle performs only two in-plane impulses and matches the target location at the encounter position using multirevolution phasing. To ensure the minimum maneuvering fuel consumption from the selection of the encounter position and analyze the optimality of the proposed encounter maneuver, the determination method of the minimal orbital intersection distance is first given by constructing constraint equations in polynomial form. Then, the algorithm framework for determining the optimal encounter maneuvers is established. This scheme allows us to derive the optimal maneuver position, direction, and impulse magnitude, thereby creating a detailed two-layer solution framework for an arbitrary target. Concurrently, the strategy accommodates orbital phase deviations by proffering a rapid correction method that factors in the perturbation environment. To expand this optimal encounter maneuver planning method to multitarget missions, we develop a reduced-order allocation procedure for optimal pairing between vehicles and targets. Through the use of numerical simulations exemplified by one single-target and two multitarget missions, it is evident that the proposed method is both highly efficient and effective for encountering any given target.},

The Saturn V Iterative Guidance Mode used an approximately optimal steering law that could adjust the trajectory to compensate for performance issues while meeting trajectory constraints at propulsion-system cutoff. Hypersurface targeting provided constraints for the Saturn V Trans-Lunar Injection burn. E Guidance, in quadratic- and linear-acceleration forms, provided closed-loop descent and ascent guidance for the Apollo Lunar Module. The Space Shuttle’s Powered Explicit Guidance algorithm was more flexible than Apollo-era guidance algorithms, and it had better convergence characteristics, enabling it to support challenging abort profiles. The Space Launch System has built on the heritage of the Space Shuttle’s guidance algorithm. The Orion spacecraft’s Two-Level Targeter enables onboard, autonomous targeting of an entire mission profile subject to three-body dynamics in cislunar space. Orion uses Shuttle-derived guidance as the basis for an orbit-guidance package with more capability than guidance algorithms of previous vehicles.},

A novel method for designing an assistance controller based on incremental model predictive control is proposed to aid pilots in suppressing categories 2 and 3 PIOs. In the assistance controller design, the characteristics of the full pilot–aircraft system are considered through a predictive model that integrates the dynamics of the pilot, actuator, and aircraft. This ensures that the assistance controller coordinates with both the pilot and aircraft. Additionally, an adaptive logic for the pilot–controller authority assignment is proposed to automatically adjust the role of the assistance controller. This adaptive logic adopts a model predictive technique to determine whether the pilot’s independent control will cause actuator saturation over the receding prediction horizon. By doing so, the assistance controller is restricted to work only when the actuator saturation constraints are activated. The pilot model-based simulations and the human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrated that the proposed assistance controller can effectively assist pilots in dealing with factors causing nonlinear PIOs while maintaining a harmonious cooperative relationship with the pilot.},

We explore trajectory parameterizations based on the convolution of a piecewise low-order polynomial with an infinitely smooth kernel. These combine efficient storage with unlimited differentiability and allow for simple and efficient evaluation using numerical quadrature. To construct such parameterizations from given trajectories, we formulate quadratic programs that account for additional, mission-specific constraints. A numerical example demonstrates the parameterization of an approach and vertical landing trajectory based on optimal control results; we show that the convolution-based approach yields competitive results compared to a piecewise polynomial parameterization, with significant storage savings.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel method for modeling and estimating the dynamics of a continuous structure based on a limited number of noisy measurements. The goal is reached using a Kalman filter in synergy with the recently developed mathematical framework known as the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC). The TFC allows deriving a functional expression capable of representing the entire space of the functions that satisfy a given set of linear and, in some cases, nonlinear constraints. The proposed approach exploits the possibilities offered by the TFC to derive an approximated dynamical model for the flexible system using the Lagrangian mechanics. The result is a representation of the structural dynamics using a finite number of states, in contrast to the infinite-dimensional model that would be obtained by application of the traditional continuum mechanics models that are based on sets of partial differential equations. The limited number of states enables the application of the well-known Kalman filter framework to improve the estimation of the displacements and displacement velocities. In addition, the continuous displacement field of the structure can be reconstructed with high fidelity. The theoretical development of the method is presented in relation to the case of an Euler–Bernoulli beam. Finally, the obtained model is used to carry out a simulation campaign aimed at assessing the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method.},

This paper presents a robust adaptive control architecture for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems that allows for the desired dynamics to be systematically scheduled, while being able to handle a broad class of uncertainties, both matched and unmatched, which can depend on both time and states. The proposed controller adopts an adaptive control architecture for designing the adaptive control law and peak-to-peak gain (PPG) minimization for designing the robust control law to mitigate the effect of unmatched uncertainties. Leveraging the PPG bound of a LPV system, we derive transient and steady-state performance bounds in terms of the input and output signals of the actual closed-loop system with respect to a nominal system. The proposed control architecture is applied to control the longitudinal motion of an F-16 aircraft operating within a large envelope. Simulation results using both LPV and fully nonlinear models validate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a guidance-control design methodology for the autonomous maneuvering of tailsitter transitioning unmanned aerial systems (t-UASs) in hybrid flight regimes (i.e., the dynamics between VTOL and fixed-wing regimes). The tailsitter guidance-control architecture consists of a trajectory planner, an outer-loop position controller, an inner-loop attitude controller, and a control allocator. The trajectory planner uses a simplified tailsitter model, with aerodynamic and wake effect considerations, to generate a set of transition trajectories with associated aerodynamic force estimates based on an optimization metric specified by a human operator (minimum time transition). The outer-loop controller then uses the aerodynamic force estimate computed by the trajectory planner as a feedforward signal alongside feedback linearization of the outer-loop dynamics for 6DOF position control. The inner-loop attitude controller is a standard nonlinear dynamic inversion control law that generates the desired pitch, roll, and yaw moments, which are then converted to the appropriate rotor speeds by the control allocator. Analytical conditions for robust stability are derived for the outer-loop position controller to guarantee performance in the presence of uncertainty in the feedforward aerodynamic force compensation. Finally, both tracking performance and stability of the control architecture are evaluated on a high-fidelity flight dynamics simulation of a quadrotor biplane tailsitter for flight missions that demand high maneuverability in transition between flight modes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based robust low-thrust guidance method for asteroid approaching under process uncertainties. Markov decision processes with stochastic dynamics are formulated for RL. To overcome the problem of low terminal accuracy in RL-based transfer trajectory design, robust zero-effort-miss/zero-effort-velocity (R-ZEM/ZEV) guidance is proposed. Originally, an eigenvalue-related term is defined according to the stability conditions of the ZEM/ZEV feedback system and chosen as the learning parameter, which can significantly improve the robustness of the agent to process uncertainties under the low-thrust magnitude constraint. Moreover, the navigation performance of the asteroid approaching is modeled via the Fisher information matrix and incorporated in the reward function design, which enables optimizing the optical observation performance together with the propellant cost. Thereafter, the proximal policy optimization is adopted to train an RL agent that can efficiently deal with the uncertainties. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through simulations of a low-thrust spacecraft approaching the asteroid Bennu. The promising results indicate that the proposed method can not only deal with various uncertainties efficiently and autonomously but can also guarantee high terminal accuracy.},

  abstract     = {ESA’s Hera mission aims to visit binary asteroid Didymos in late 2026, investigating its physical characteristics and the result of NASA’s impact by the DART spacecraft in more detail. Two CubeSats onboard Hera plan to perform a ballistic landing on the secondary of the system, called Dimorphos. For these types of landings the translational state during descent is not controlled, reducing the spacecraft’s complexity but also increasing its sensitivity to deployment maneuver errors and dynamic uncertainties. This paper introduces a novel methodology to analyze the effect of these uncertainties on the dynamics of the lander and design a trajectory that is robust against them. This methodology consists of propagating the uncertain state of the lander using the nonintrusive Chebyshev interpolation (NCI) technique, which approximates the uncertain dynamics using a polynomial expansion. The results are then analyzed using the pseudo-diffusion indicator. This indicator is derived from the coefficients of the polynomial expansion, which quantifies the rate of growth of the set of possible states of the spacecraft over time. The indicator is used here to constrain the impact velocity and angle to values that allow for successful settling on the surface. This information is then used to optimize the landing trajectory by applying the NCI technique inside the transcription of the problem. The resulting trajectory increases the robustness of the trajectory compared to a conventional method, improving landing success by 20% and significantly reducing the landing footprint.},

  abstract     = {The propellant-optimal powered descent solution requires a bang-bang thrust magnitude profile that switches instantaneously between the upper and lower bounds of the engine thrust. Implementing a bang-bang thrust pattern for guidance can be challenging for the engine and may cause practical and operational difficulties. Motivated by the observation that excellent propellant performance does not appear to be predicated on necessarily having a bang-bang thrust structure, a new powered descent guidance method is proposed in this work. The foundation lies in a propellant-optimal problem in which the thrust magnitude is parameterized by a user-prescribed continuous function of time. In particular, constant and linear functions are considered. The solution determines the optimal thrust direction, time of flight, and design parameters defining the thrust function. An indirect-method-based guidance algorithm is developed to solve this problem rapidly and reliably. Substantial evidence is provided to demonstrate that the solutions proposed in this paper in general yield a propellant consumption very close to that of the optimal bang-bang solution. Given its comparable propellant performance, implementability, and robustness, this paper makes a strong case that the proposed propellant-optimal powered descent guidance approach is preferred to the long-standing bang-bang guidance approach.},

  abstract     = {Control surface actuators usually come with their own servo control algorithm, which ensures that the deflection commanded by the flight control laws is quickly achieved. Therefore, flight control and servo control together form a cascaded control structure. Traditionally, the flight control laws (outer loop) and servo control laws (inner loop) are designed independently. However, recent applications demand an increasingly dynamic design of flight control, with actuator dynamics becoming a limiting factor. In this paper, a unified control design for actuators and flight dynamics is investigated. The local acceleration at the lifting surface (empennages and wing), close to the actuator, is fed back within an inner actuator control loop, allowing for faster compensation. The theoretical properties of the suggested control structure are discussed analytically first. Later, the concept is applied to a linear model for longitudinal aircraft motion. A classical state controller serves as a reference for comparison of the proposed strategy against the standard one with the actuator internal control law. Both controllers are designed using eigenstructure assignment, and the pole locations are numerically optimized. The closed-loop behavior is assessed in the time and frequency domains. The results promise significant improvements in terms of disturbance rejection and robustness.},

Our approach incorporates the Fisher information matrix into a cost function to quantify state observability and facilitates its convergence using a semi-analytic gradient and Hessian derived under impulsive maneuvers. Two numerical examples show the validity and effectiveness of our algorithm. The results indicate the stability and efficiency in determining maneuver sequences and the improvement of state estimation accuracy along an optimized trajectory. It is also applicable to other observability-aware optimal control problems because the algorithm is independent of specific systems.},

  abstract     = {A convex-optimization-based model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for the guidance of active debris removal missions is proposed in this work. A high-accuracy reference for the convex optimization is obtained through a split-Edelbaum approach that takes the effects of , drag, and eclipses into account. When the spacecraft deviates significantly from the reference trajectory, a new reference is calculated through the same method to reach the target debris. When required, phasing is integrated into the transfer. During the mission, the phase of the spacecraft is adjusted to match that of the target debris at the end of the transfer by introducing intermediate waiting times. The robustness of the guidance scheme is tested in a high-fidelity dynamic model that includes thrust errors and misthrust events. The guidance algorithm performs well without requiring successive convex iterations. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of these thrust uncertainties on the guidance. Simulation results show that the proposed convex-MPC approach can ensure that the spacecraft can reach its target despite significant uncertainties and long-duration misthrust events.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for autonomous maneuver planning of low-altitude flybys for site-specific reconnaissance of small bodies. Combined with Monte Carlo tree search and deep neural networks, the proposed method generates optimal maneuvers, even under complex dynamics and abstractly science goals. Formulating the mission objective as an observability function, the RL issue can be framed in terms of a Markov decision process. The neural network, trained by a novel policy gradient algorithm with a clipped surrogate objective, learns both policy and value functions that map the action and state spaces to the expected long-term return. An adaptive refinement search technique is applied to further enhance the trained policy network, finding optimal maneuvers from the policy distributions. Experiment results on a simulated reconnaissance mission around asteroid Itokawa illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach in achieving multitarget observation.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a sequential convex program method to compute fuel-optimal collision avoidance maneuvers for long-term encounters. The low-thrust acceleration model is used to account for the control, but the method can compute high-thrust maneuvers by increasing the maximum available acceleration. Dealing with the long-term conjunction poses additional challenges compared to the short-term problem because the encounter is not instantaneous. Thus, under the assumption of Gaussian statistics, the probability of collision is replaced by a simpler metric, the instantaneous probability of collision (IPoC), and a keep-out zone constraint is formulated as a continuous condition to be respected throughout the time frame of interest. The robustness of the solution is improved by introducing a constraint on the sensitivity of IPoC. Furthermore, the collision avoidance problem is coupled with the classical station-keeping requirement for geostationary Earth orbit satellites and with a return to the nominal orbit condition for low Earth orbit satellites. Even though no guarantee is given for the recovery of the global optimum solution, numerical simulations in different orbital regimes show that the proposed approach can yield a local fuel-optimal solution with a run time suitable for autonomous applications.},

Extended equations are developed in the orbital plane based on Lagrange’s form for the unperturbed Lambert’s problem to address the -perturbed two-body motion. By combining them with the out-of-plane flight time equation constraint regarding the ground-track adjustment, a nonlinear system of equations with two unknowns and two equations is established and split into different modes. To solve these modes, a modified Newton–Raphson method is used, and a necessary condition is established to determine the maximum allowable number of revolutions. To enhance computational efficiency, a radius restriction method is proposed to narrow down the allowable range of the number of revolutions. The proposed algorithm is applicable to various scenarios, including single- or multiple-day flights, ascending or descending overflights, coplanar or non-coplanar transfers, and initial or reverse-initial directional transfers. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and accurate for the perturbed adjustment problem.},

The intersection between the two loci, when it exists, can be used to find feasible candidate solutions for each interplanetary trajectory segment and can be obtained analytically after solving a quartic equation. A time-of-flight compatibility condition can then be introduced that replaces the classical -matching constraint for locating properly phased transfer arcs, whereby opening the door to a very significant improvement in computational efficiency.

To increase the computational efficiency of the algorithm, an extended Kalman filter is selected as state estimator, fed by the positions of the planets extracted from deep-space images. An enhancement of the estimation accuracy is performed by applying an optimal strategy to select the best pair of planets to track. Moreover, a novel analytical measurement model for deep-space navigation is developed providing a first-order approximation of the light-aberration and light-time effects.

Initial Gaussian uncertainty associated with two objects is split into smaller Gaussian distributions using Gaussian mixture models to achieve mixture components that will maintain linearity over longer propagation times. These mixture components are propagated forward using second-order state transition tensors that can capture the nonlinearity in the propagation accurately by taking into account the desired dynamics. The dynamic solution and these tensors are computed using the Deprit–Lie averaging approach, including transformations between mean and osculating states, which accounts for perturbations due to solar radiation pressure and . This simplified dynamic system allows fast and accurate propagation by combining the speed of propagation with averaged dynamics and the accuracy of short-period variation addition. Combined, these mathematical tools are used to propagate the object’s uncertainties forward. The final distributions are compared using analytical conjunction methods to compute the probability of collision, which is then compared to the Monte Carlo result to confirm the method’s validity.},

  abstract     = {Shell-wise orbital coordination in low Earth orbit can improve space safety, simplify space traffic coordination and management, and optimize orbital capacity. This work describes two methods to generate 2D lattice flower constellations (2D-LFCs) that are defined with respect to either an arbitrary zonal, or zonal, sectoral, and tesseral Earth geopotential. By generating orbital shells that are periodic with respect to the Earth geopotential, it is possible to safely stack shells with vertical separation distances smaller than the osculating variation in semimajor axis and radial distance of each shell, or a corresponding Keplerian 2D-LFC propagated under an aspherical geopotential. These methods exploit previous work on constellations based on time distributions and designs of closed 2D-LFCs under arbitrary Earth geopotentials using repeating ground track orbits. Factors that influence the widths and shapes of these shells are identified. Additionally, simplified formulas for estimating shell geometry and thickness are presented. Based on these results, it is shown that geopotential-aware periodic orbital shells significantly increase the number of admissible orbital shells while preserving shell separation. Finally, this work shows that sequencing shells to group similar or ascending inclinations can further improve capacity versus arbitrary inclination ordering, particularly for smaller shell separation distances.},

  abstract     = {Solar sailing is a propulsion method that takes advantage of solar radiation pressure to generate thrust. Although most of near-future solar-sail missions will fly in low Earth orbit, where planetary radiation pressure can be as large as 20% of solar radiation pressure, studies on the accelerations produced by the Earth’s albedo and blackbody radiation have only been conducted to a very limited first-order extent. This paper therefore provides a novel, detailed analytical model for these perturbing accelerations, valid for perfectly reflecting solar sails. The full derivation of the model is described, and a thorough analysis of the blackbody and albedo radiation pressure accelerations is conducted for different orbital conditions. Then, to determine the model’s accuracy, a comparison with the state of the art (the finite-disk radiation source model and a high-fidelity numerical model) is provided. Ultimately, different analyses to quantify the effect of planetary radiation pressure acceleration on the solar-sail maneuvering capabilities are presented, using NASA’s upcoming ACS3 mission as reference scenario. The results highlight the nonnegligible effect of uncontrolled planetary radiation pressure acceleration, which can reduce the sailcraft’s achievable altitude and inclination gains to 76 and 80%, respectively, of the gains obtained when planetary radiation pressure is not accounted for.},

Among the available risk indicators, this paper focuses on computing the instantaneous probability of collision, which can be modeled as the integral of a three-dimensional Gaussian probability density function over a Euclidean ball. The authors propose an efficient and accurate method for evaluating this integral. It is based on the combination of two complementary strategies. For the first one, convergent series and numerical error bounds are computed. These bounds provide a tradeoff between the accuracy needed and the number of terms to compute. The second one, using divergent series, approximates the value of the integral with a good accuracy in most cases with only a few terms computed. Based on those two methods, a hybrid algorithm is tested on cases borrowed from the literature and compared against existing methods. Several numerical results and comparisons confirm both the efficiency and robustness of this paper’s approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a semi-analytical method for multiple gravity-assist (MGA) opportunity assessment, which can judge the feasibility of MGA sequences and predict corresponding opportunities in terms of the relative phases between flyby planets. The proposed method features the feasible domains of gravity-assist states and the phase differences in MGA rather than focusing on a limited number of optimal solutions. First, the planet flyby departure and arrival conditions for successive gravity assist are analytically derived based on the planar circular model. Second, the feasible domain of gravity assist described by flyby parameters is established and pruned based on the conditions, and the corresponding relative phases between planets are calculated. Third, a MGA opportunity search algorithm via feasible domain is formulated to match the phase differences in the ephemeris. Lastly, the method is examined in two types of MGA missions: the rendezvous and flyby missions. The results from the semi-analytical approach can cover all optimized opportunities in the rendezvous mission and 94.44% optimized opportunities in the flyby mission under the accurate three-dimensional model. The results of the proposed semi-analytical method can serve as a good initial guess for further accurate trajectory optimization and provide reference for future MGA mission design.},

  abstract     = {Vibration damping in aerospace structures can decrease the likelihood of failures and instabilities and improve passenger comfort. This paper introduces the novel idea of damping vibration using the electric proprotors on aircraft without compromising flight control. The equations of motion of a cantilevered beam with a propeller at the tip driven by an electric motor are obtained using Hamilton’s principle, solved analytically in the frequency domain, and approximately in the time domain. Feeding back the beam tip angular rate to the motor torque is shown to asymptotically stabilize all transverse beam vibration modes. The overall vibration control consists of the inner rate feedback damping loop with an outer rotor speed control loop. Experimental frequency response and step response validate the models and show that the closed-loop damping in the first mode is three times higher than open loop with less than 1% rotor speed change for a 3% initial tip displacement. Theoretical results give good agreement with experiments. Parametric studies based on a 12 kg quadcopter indicate that if the rotor inertia is sufficiently large the proposed control can provide 8% damping with minimal impact on rotor speed.},

These conditions are cohesively integrated with the trimmability condition directly derived from nonlinear dynamics, establishing a comprehensive criterion that facilitates the assessment of both trimmability and controllability of VTOL aircraft. This unified criterion elucidates the relation between desired and achievable specific forces and moments with clear implications for flight mechanics. Building upon this criterion, a distance-based metric is proposed to quantify the controllability, with an optimization-based algorithm developed for its calculation. Focusing on an exemplary lift plus cruise VTOL aircraft, this study investigates controllability variations within the aircraft’s velocity envelope and assesses the impact of rotor failures on controllability. These applications demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in quantifying the controllability of VTOL aircraft in various flight conditions.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modeling the evolution of debris clouds from satellite breakups is necessary for assessing the collision risk to space assets. Generally, the evolution of debris clouds can be divided into short-, medium-, and long-term phases. Compared to the short- and long-term phases, the study on the medium-term phase was insufficient. This paper proposes a probabilistic method to model the medium-term evolution of a debris cloud. First, a satellite breakup event can be characterized by a probabilistic density distribution of the initial velocity vectors of all fragments. Then, the distribution in the initial velocity can be transformed to that in three classic orbital elements, i.e., semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Given that the driving force of medium-term evolution is the perturbation and that has no secular contribution to these three classic orbital elements, the distribution of classic orbital elements remains stationary during the evolution. This feature can be exploited to express the probabilistic density distribution of any given target position in terms of the density distribution of the classic orbital elements by changing variables. Finally, 16 one-variable equations with analytical first derivatives were formulated to find the proper inverse mapping from the given position to the classic orbital elements, and the Jacobian matrix of the inverse mapping was derived. Medium-term debris clouds resulting from two typical breakup velocity distributions were tested using the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can accurately simulate the evolution of the clouds’ geometrical extent and density flow.},

This paper describes a novel approach capable of tracking maneuvering spacecraft with an explicit transitional prior and in a Bayesian framework, with fewer than two observations passes per day. The algorithm samples thrust profiles according to a multivariate Laplace distribution. It is shown that multivariate Laplace distributions are particularly suited to track maneuvering spacecraft, leading to a log probability function that is almost linear with the thrust. Principles from rare event simulation theory are used to propagate the tails of the distribution. Fast propagation is enabled by multi-fidelity methods. Because of the diffuse transitional prior, a novel -nearest-neighbor-based ensemble Gaussian mixture filter is developed and used. The method allows Bayesian tracking of maneuvering spacecraft for several scenarios with fewer than two measurement passes per day and with a mismatch between the true and expected thrust magnitude of up to a factor of 200. The validity domain and statistical significance of the method are shown by simulation through several Monte Carlo trials in different scenarios and with different filter settings.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a flight control design for compound vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles. With their multitude of degrees of controllability as well as the significant variations in their flight characteristics, VTOL vehicles present challenges when it comes to designing their flight control system, especially for the transition phase where the vehicle transitions between near-hovering and high-speed wing-borne flights. This work extends previous research on the design of unified and generic control laws that can be applied to a broad class of vehicles such as hovering vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft. This paper exploits this unifying property and presents an extension for the case of compound VTOL vehicles. The proposed control approach consists of nonlinear geometric control laws that are continuously applicable over the entire flight envelope, excluding the use of switching policies between different control algorithms. A transition strategy consisting of a sequence of high-level set points is associated with the flight control laws; it is defined with respect to flight envelope limitations and is applied in this work to a commercially available compound unmanned aerial vehicle. The control algorithms are implemented on a Pixhawk controller; they are evaluated via hardware-in-the-loop simulations and finally validated in a flight experiment.},

Mathematically, this is achieved through the introduction of Lagrange multiplierlike quantities that act as additional state variables and capture the desired sensitivity information. By penalizing user-specified sensitivities, the reference solution becomes easier to control under feedback. Thus, the DOC method can be viewed as a method to improve nonlinear robustness. By converting fixed parameters appearing in the problem formulation to state variables with trivial dynamics, the DOC approach can be used to improve robustness to parameter uncertainties. The paper also analyzes the relationship between sensitivities and the covariance matrix and compares the benefits and limitations of covariance shaping versus DOC. A simple Zermelo-type boat path optimization problem with uncertainties in the water current is analyzed to demonstrate the DOC approach.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning for autonomous aerobraking poses significant technical challenges, primarily due to the complexities associated with ensuring reliable onboard computation, mitigating flying uncertainty, enhancing aerodeceleration efficacy, and guaranteeing sufficient precision. To address this issue, this paper utilizes convex optimization for the first time to synchronously generate an anti-uncertainty trajectory and corresponding closed-loop controller with efficient, robust, and high-precision computational capability. Specifically, a double-loop planning framework is developed. In the inner loop, techniques of covariance control and linear covariance analysis are employed to give rise to a stochastic trajectory planning problem that optimizes the orbiter’s capacity to withstand and overcome deviations during flight. Furthermore, for onboard planning considerations, the problem’s nonlinearity is equivalently reduced by projecting the time-independent variable into the altitude variable. On this basis, a novel state-complete linearization method is introduced to enable the utilization of sequential convex programming with improved convergence. For the outer loop, the orbiter’s motion is decomposed into low-accuracy longitudinal and high-precision dynamics. A differential-correction-based technique is specifically designed to remedy the dynamics in turn. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce mission risk by at least 70% while only experiencing an additional cost of velocity impulse amounting to 20%.},

Dual quaternions are used to jointly represent the rotational and translational tracking error dynamics of the rigid body. A novel nonlinear feedback tracking controller is proposed, and a Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to prove SGES of the closed-loop dynamics. The analysis does not place any restrictions on the reference trajectory or the feedback gains. This stronger SGES result aids in further analyzing the robustness of the rigid-body system by establishing input-to-state stability (ISS) in the presence of time-varying additive and bounded external disturbances. Motivated by the fact that, in many aerospace applications, stringent adherence to safety constraints such as approach path and input constraints is critical for overall mission success, a framework for safe control of spacecraft is presented that combines the proposed feedback controller with control barrier functions. Numerical simulations are provided to verify the SGES and ISS results and also showcase the efficacy of the proposed nonlinear feedback controller in several nontrivial scenarios, including trajectory tracking, transposition and docking, flip maneuvers, collision avoidance, and rendezvous.},

For the intense reduction of gust loads, a highly reactive control system of sensors, control algorithms, and actuators is required, which is not yet available. In this paper, a control algorithm based on incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion is extended so that actuators respond faster. The control algorithm is applied to a future medium-range aircraft with distributed trailing-edge flaps. It is assumed that the vertical acceleration of the center of gravity and the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the first wing bending mode are available as feedback variables. To allow comparability with other actuator and sensor setups, the authors abstract the actuator dynamics and sensor filter as control system time delay. The feedback gains are adjusted automatically to the control system time delay. In simulation, the authors investigate the influence of the control system time delay on the peak gust loads. They show that gust loads can indeed be intensely reduced with sufficiently small control system time delay in simulation.},

A novel capture strategy that integrates redeployment and self-assembly techniques is introduced. With this strategy, the net robot self-assembles to close the net pocket and quickly maneuvers to nearby target debris. Upon reaching its target, the robot redeploys the net for debris capture. Central to this approach is the development of a capturing model that accurately describes the state function of the deployed net and incorporates an effective dragging method to counteract debris bouncing. To enable this multiple pieces of debris capture, an attitude consensus controller and a capture controller are designed using a finite-time scheme and terminal sliding mode, respectively. Numerical simulations reveal limitations in capturing multiple pieces of debris by existing design of tethered space net robots, where debris has the propensity to bounce out of a fully deployed net during multicapture attempts. The proposed strategy effectively mitigates these challenges, minimizing debris bounce and ensuring dependable multiple pieces of debris capture. Overall, the findings offer valuable insights to enhance the efficiency of active space debris removal missions.},

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft’s trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system’s complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid’s trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.},

  abstract     = {Confirmed small-body missions Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) and Hera are set to explore Martian moons and the binary asteroid Didymos’s moon Dimorphos, respectively. Orbital dynamics around these small moons differ substantially from those around previously visited targets. Simplified models, such as the circular-restricted three-body problem, cannot yield accurate predictions for orbits and their stability in real-world operations. To be specific, the orbit of the small moon and its vicinity are significantly perturbed by the oblateness of the planet and their relative positions. Realistic control constraints and the unstable 3:1 resonance of retrograde orbits further complicate orbit maintenance around a small moon. Therefore, minimizing the dynamical perturbation on baseline orbits resulting from model mismatches is crucial. This paper introduces the J2-ER3BP+GH model dedicated to describing the orbital dynamics around the small moon. It incorporates the perturbation of the planet on the elliptic-restricted three-body problem and can accommodate a nonspherical gravity field of the moon. Bounded orbits can still be identified without much effort in this sophisticated model. Baseline orbits around Phobos and Dimorphos from the J2-ER3BP+GH model become much easier to maintain, as verified in the high-fidelity dynamic and control environments.},

Two major contributions are introduced and can be used independently from one another to address the estimation problem. First, a representation of the cloud of debris with point processes is proposed, focusing on the population statistics rather than individual pieces of debris. It allows for the limited propagation of the cloud statistics required for the computation of the risk statistics, and nothing more, reducing significantly the computational costs when compared to traditional methods propagating individual pieces of debris. Then, a novel risk function is proposed, exploiting the ergodicity of the encounter problem to estimate the number of collisions between a pieces of debris and a target, following a rigorous mathematical construction based on well-defined assumptions. These two methods are then combined and illustrated on a simulated scenario and compared with a traditional Monte Carlo approach. The results show that the point process-based estimate of the risk statistics is consistent with the Monte Carlo reference, while being faster to run by at least two orders of magnitude.},

Atmospheric drag, solar radiation, and third-body gravity are not considered. To associate two tracks, the two sets of states and covariances are propagated to a common time. The Mahalanobis distance between the two tracks is then used to determine whether they associate. A higher-fidelity dynamic model for state propagation improves association performance, while the fidelity of the dynamic model for covariance propagation does not have a significant impact. The MME-based track association demonstrates excellent performance when incorporating , and in the MME state propagation as well as the MME covariance propagation with .

This study proposes the design of an antiwindup compensator for systems with actuators that are limited to a finite number of quantization levels. This combination of discrete-level actuation and saturation poses a unique antiwindup problem that has not yet been solved. To surmount this combined issue, an antiwindup compensator is proposed, which provides ultimate boundedness of the system state within a prescribed region and guarantees that the state does not stray outside a larger compact set. The use of shifted ramp functions enables a less conservative bound on the control-signal error, which yields significantly lower gain bounds compared to a standard sector-bound antiwindup design approach. A numerical simulation example illustrates the effectiveness on a rigid-body system, which inspired this study.},

The design is performed within the model reference control framework. It is applied to solving path-following and waypoint routing problems for curves with bounded curvature and vehicles with bounded speeds. The path-following controller regulates the system turn rate and the reference model speed. The vehicle speed dynamics are independently maintained as desired. In that regard, the developed control policy forces the system position to track a virtual target point defined by the reference model. Verifiable sufficient conditions are formulated to enable steering the Dubins vehicle along the designated routes in the presence of unknown bounded environmental disturbances, such as wind and gust.

  abstract     = {A rigid satellite attitude control requires stable finite-time attitude convergence in the presence of rotation unwinding, external disturbances, and actuator faults. To achieve this, a new nonsingular fast fixed-time sliding mode controller is proposed to ensure finite-time convergence independent of the initial conditions of the system. Rotation unwinding is addressed using the body and shadow pair of the Modified Rodrigues Parameters (MRPs). Convergence behavior of the states errors in the neighborhood of the MRPs switching surface is also addressed. Attitude control is achieved using a double-gimbal variable-speed control moment gyro (DGVSCMG). For the first time, a DGVSCMG having all possible electrical and mechanical faults is considered for control design. A novel nonsingular fast fixed-time anti-unwinding fault-tolerant sliding control using a new sliding surface is proposed. This eliminates switching of the sliding surfaces and minimizes control chattering. Four new propositions are proposed and proved to establish fast fixed-time global stability of the system for tracking maneuver in fault and fault-free conditions with anti-unwinding. Simulation results are presented and compared with existing fixed-time sliding control approaches. The results show superiority of the proposed anti-unwinding fault-tolerant fast fixed-time control for the tracking maneuver in terms of convergence time, energy efficiency, and fault tolerance.},

  abstract     = {As concerns over space debris in the Low Earth orbit (LEO) intensify, deorbit strategies for small satellites becomes evident because many lack an effective deorbit mechanism. After successfully demonstrating their effectiveness in flight tests, aerodynamic drag sails emerge as a superior deorbit solution, significantly reducing the time required for deorbiting. To maximize the aerodynamic drag, it is crucial to maintain the drag sail perpendicular to the atmospheric flow. This becomes especially challenging with the potential threat of sensor failure. This paper introduces a magnetic control scheme for deorbiting using drag sails. Relying solely on magnetometers as sensors, the control scheme uses magnetorquers, bias momentum wheels, and an onboard geomagnetic field model to keep the sail perpendicular to the satellite’s velocity. Furthermore, a backup control scheme that does not require the onboard geomagnetic field model is proposed. This control scheme uses magnetometers in conjunction with just another common small satellite sensor, such as the GPS, gyroscopes, or sun sensors as sensors. A stability criterion, based on a linearized analytical model, validates the feasibility of this backup control scheme. Numerical simulations confirm the efficacy of both control schemes. Both schemes reduce the deorbit time by approximately compared to the uncontrolled satellite deorbiting.},

  abstract     = {Configuration stability is crucial for the detection accuracy of space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors. This paper proposes a low-frequency hierarchical cooperative impulse control strategy and a high-fidelity orbit optimization method to achieve a formation of GW detectors with high detection performance. The control strategy employs a hierarchical structure to divide the configuration control into position and shape layers. In the upper layer, the position layer, a state transition tensor method is employed to analyze the sensitivity and feasible range of the formation center position on the configuration stability. In the lower layer, the shape layer, a novel consistency protocol cooperatively uses the states of all individuals in the formation to determine the control expectations. The constraint on formation position is relaxed to reduce the number of impulses, achieving a low-frequency impulse control. The optimization method, characterized by a careful selection of the optimization variables and a design of adaptive model continuation from a low-fidelity model to a high-fidelity model, is proposed to reduce the problem-solving difficulty. The proposed strategy and method are applied to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, and the results demonstrate that the configuration stability is effectively enhanced with several low-frequency impulses.},

The chaser spacecraft are commanded to hover above and track stably the feature points attached to the target as well as to avoid the mutual visual occlusion caused by interspacecraft motion. To this end, a new expression of image-based visual servoing dynamics for spacecraft is derived, where the physical meaning of each term is analyzed in detail so that the exact upper bounds of noncooperative terms can be estimated. After that, a novel occlusion description model is established by the projective theory of quadrics. The mathematical elements for describing the imaging elliptic curve and occlusion discrimination function are proposed, whose association with interspacecraft motion is given to guide occlusion avoidance controller design. Combining the artificial potential function with the backstepping control method, a robust control algorithm is designed. The proposed control scheme can achieve the six-degree-of-freedom control objective based on image space, and motion trajectory will not influence others’ visibility. Finally, the validity of the control scheme is verified by simulation for a given multispacecraft observation scenario.},

Then, the costate transformations between two reference frames are first derived with respect to the the corresponding Eulerian angles, such that the switching function can be expressed with a six-degree polynomial function and the number of parameters used to determine the energy-optimal solutions is reduced to 6. Finally, a neural network is trained to generated the initial guesses, and the solution algorithms for solving the time- and fuel-optimal problem are formulated. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the convergence ratio of initial guesses is higher than , the proposed assumptions are reasonable for guaranteeing the near optimality, and the presented method can obtain convergent solutions within tenths of a second for the Earth- and moon-centered external/interior transfers considering the shadow and third-body perturbations.},

Sensitivities of the shooting function are then used in conjunction with an ad hoc near-identity transformation between averaged and osculating variables to achieve an accurate solution for all longitudes of the departure and arrival orbits. Hence, a single simplified shooting problem has to be solved to approximate the solution for any combination of departure and arrival dates and to draw a Bacon plot for an arbitrary launch window. Both the averaged flow and the near-identity transformation are efficiently evaluated via the fast-Fourier transform algorithm, yielding a fully numerical procedure.},

A delay-resistant low-frequency adaptive controller is employed, which prevents excessive oscillations due to flexible dynamics, compensates uncertainties, and addresses the inherent time delay. In addition to this, a delay-dependent stability condition for the overall system dynamics is obtained including the human operator with reaction time delay, the adaptive controller, and the flexible quadrotor dynamics with input delay. With comparative simulation studies, it is demonstrated that the flexible arm tip oscillations are significantly reduced when the low-frequency delay-resistant closed-loop reference model adaptive controller is used, compared to a closed-loop reference model adaptive controller and a conventional model reference adaptive controller.},

In the first step, consensus on the target merging flow is achieved, where the merging stream is modeled as a straight line with the minimum total converging distance. In the second step, multiple aircraft with double-integrator dynamics and time-varying communication topologies are guided to merge into the target flow while maintaining appropriate interaircraft spacing. A state control law is designed, and the Lyapunov analysis method is leveraged to derive sufficient conditions on the communication topology and the control parameter for merging agents to reach consensus in finite time.

Panel-method-based guidance is a promising candidate for air mobility applications in urban environments where multiple aerial vehicles are expected to operate simultaneously without colliding with architectural structures and other vehicles in the airspace. In this study, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed guidance method is evaluated through a test campaign conducted in Toulouse, France, using multiple quadrotors in a scaled urban environment. Furthermore, the robustness of the guidance method under wind disturbances is tested in both indoor and outdoor experiments.

In this paper, the orbit determination equations where the target state is linear were derived by assuming that Lagrangian coefficients are constant and taking the minimum residual sum as the optimization objective. From this paper’s analysis, it was demonstrated that because the position uncertainty distribution primarily lies in the line-of-sight vector, the upper limit of relative positioning error (RPE) can be used as the evaluation parameter of the determination accuracy in scenarios where a high-orbit target is observed by a low-orbit sensor observes. An empirical relationship was also found, indicating that the upper limit of RPE is proportional to the observation error, −2.5 power of the observation arc length, and the 0.5 power of the observation interval.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the relative pose and angular velocity of an uncooperative space object is a critical component for many applications such as on-orbit assembly, inspection, and servicing. This paper presents new mathematical insights that permit a kinematic batch filter formulation for angular velocity estimation using quaternion measurements for relative orientation, thereby eliminating the need to know the moment of inertia of the target. In particular, a novel batch approach to computing the associated uncertainties for the angular velocity magnitude, spin-axis direction, and overall angular velocity vector estimates is presented and compared against previous recursive methodologies. Finally, a realistic use-case scenario is demonstrated in real-time on flightlike hardware.},

The presence of wingtip hinges complicates the dynamics and control of this class of aircraft but has thus far only been analyzed in specific cases. In this work, we make a comprehensive exploration of parameter space of the multibody trim problem and stability and demonstrate the treatment of the control problem using the robust synthesis technique. We propose a simplified simulation approach to the static trim analysis and demonstrate key observations relating to the configurations and open-loop dynamic stability of multibody aircraft in general. An interpolated parameter-scheduling model using the hinge angle as a scheduling parameter is established, based on which the structured multimodel synthesis method is employed to synthesize the robust flight controllers. Simulation results show that the designed controllers are capable of configuration control within the range of possible trim solutions and have also achieved good control effectiveness in path following and disturbance rejection. The proposed trim analysis and control techniques serve to provide a systematic benchmark study on wing-docked multibody aircraft dynamics, which is valuable to the development of this research area.},

  abstract     = {This study presents incremental correction methods for refining neural network parameters or control functions entering into a continuous-time dynamic system to achieve improved solution accuracy in satisfying the interim point constraints placed on the performance output variables. The proposed approach is to linearize the dynamics around the baseline values of its arguments and then to solve for the corrective input required to transfer the perturbed trajectory to precisely known or desired values at specific time points, in other words, the interim points. Depending on the type of decision variables to adjust, parameter correction and control function correction methods are developed. These incremental correction methods can be used as a means to compensate for the prediction errors of pretrained neural networks in real-time applications where high accuracy of the prediction of dynamical systems at prescribed time points is imperative. In this regard, the online update approach can be useful for enhancing overall targeting accuracy of finite-horizon control subject to point constraints using a neural policy. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an application to a powered descent problem on Mars.},

It allows the controller to explicitly account for the launcher’s time-varying dynamics and changing control objectives along the ascent trajectory. The latter are readily incorporated via time-varying weighting functions into a mixed sensitivity design. For a traceable and transparent control design, a physically motivated weighting scheme is applied, which requires little tuning effort. The controller is obtained via a novel observer-based finite horizon linear time-varying synthesis approach. It provides a transparent structure which is easy to implement. The approach is used to design a pitch controller for a flexible expendable launch vehicle in atmospheric ascent tracking the open-loop guidance reference signal.},

These systems offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions, particularly for asteroid missions that deal with uncertain environments. This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GNC for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.},

Then, the Lambert problem and state transition matrix are used to obtain the image of the target body in the spread velocity space, where the collision probability computation is performed. To perform and control the accuracy of the integration of the collision rate needed to obtain collision probabilities, we apply high-order Taylor expansion and automatic domain splitting techniques.

  abstract     = {Low-thrust propulsion allows substantial propellant saving if compared to high-thrust systems. However, multirevolution orbit transfers are affected by the unavailability of electrical power along eclipse arcs. This research addresses the identification of minimum-time low-thrust Earth orbit transfers with spacecraft eclipsing. Two different indirect heuristic approaches, based on the use of the analytical conditions for optimality, in conjunction with stochastic fractal search, are applied: 1) regularization through the hyperbolic tangent function and 2) multi-arc formulation of the problem. Both of them require no averaging, and the respective advantages and shortcomings are identified. Approach 2 leads to an extended set of multipoint conditions for optimality, which are shown to be solvable sequentially in the numerical solution process. Implicit costate transformation is proven to be a key ingredient for the purpose of obtaining closed-form solutions of the jump relations that hold for the adjoint variables at light/eclipse transitions. Some illustrative examples prove effectiveness of the two indirect heuristic approaches 1 and 2 in finding minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers between either two coplanar or two noncoplanar Earth orbits. Approach 2 proves to be superior in terms of both computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical results.},

First, the docking ring is chosen as the recognized object for pose measurement. Second, a new ellipse detection method is proposed to detect the docking ring. Third, the circular feature is used to estimate the six-degrees-of-freedom pose with the aid of a reflective block. Combined with the range at each pixel location from TOF, the pose duality can be eliminated, and the roll angle is recovered through the geometric constraint. Ground physical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The on-orbit application demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can accurately and robustly estimate the relative pose of the noncooperative satellite, providing reliable navigation information for the chaser spacecraft with the relative pose estimation errors less than 2 deg and 5 cm.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a method to accurately resolve orbit determination for a spacecraft with unknown impulsive maneuvers. The proposed method handles the unknown impulsive maneuver by incorporating the magnitude, direction, and time of the impulsive maneuver into the estimation parameter vector. First, a modified state transition tensor (STT) is proposed via orbit division and segment connection, allowing the orbit to be directly propagated under the effects of impulsive maneuver uncertainties. Then, based on the modified STT, a second-order measurement model is established with the estimation parameter vector as the input. Combining the second-order measurement model with observations, a second-order optimal solution is derived to correct the estimation parameters. The spacecraft orbit, together with the magnitude, direction, and time of the impulsive maneuver, are simultaneously estimated in an iterative framework. The performance of the proposed method is validated in a low-Earth-orbit case and a high-Earth-orbit case. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms its linear version in terms of convergence, accuracy, and uncertainty quantification capacity. Its maneuver reconstruction and orbit estimation errors are one order of magnitude less than those of competitive methods. Moreover, the proposed method can handle severe conditions and is robust to initial guesses.},

  abstract     = {Continuation methods provide a solution to the initial guess problem that numerical root solvers and shooting methods often face by iteratively transforming an auxiliary solution into a desired solution through differential corrections. While seemingly straightforward, designing an automated continuation strategy that starts at the auxiliary problem and successfully terminates at the desired problem with minimal user intervention is often challenging especially for optimal trajectory-planning problems with nonlinear motion models subject to state/path and control constraints. One scenario where the auxiliary problem does not connect to the desired problem occurs when the intermediate problems are ill posed (i.e., infeasible). This paper presents a two-layered Jacobian conditioned stabilized continuation algorithm that circumvents these infeasible zones along a user-defined continuation path with little designer intervention. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated in the context of several prototype problems including quadratic root-solving, optimal path planning with a Dubins model, an optimal orbit transfer problem, and an optimal high-speed vehicle trajectory generation problem.},

First, a new prescribed performance function is designed in the relative range domain, and the common drawbacks of most existing prescribed performance functions, such as large overshoot, time dependency, and infinite-time convergence, are avoided. Second, the three-dimensional biased pure proportional navigation guidance frame is selected. The biased term is derived based on the prescribed performance control theory and the optimal error dynamic method, for realizing the terminal impact-angle constraint. After that, the analytical solution of missile lead angle is derived under some linearization approximations, and two methods are respectively developed for obtaining the range of the guidance gain and updating its value to guarantee the satisfaction of the field-of-view constraint during the guidance process. Moreover, for the proposed guidance law and methods, the tracking error could be ensured to remain in the predefined performance boundaries. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the new theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the entry guidance problem, which is a highly nonlinear and constrained optimal control problem. The entry guidance problem is formulated as a nonlinear trajectory optimization problem with six-degrees-of-freedom dynamics, path constraints, and boundary constraints. The formulated problem is discretized and solved using sequential convex programming (SCP) with successive linearization. However, during the discretization process, conventional collocation methods encounter a challenge with high-frequency jittering in the control and bank angle profiles near active path constraints. Because the considered problem especially involves tight path constraints, the solution jittering issue becomes severe. Therefore, this study proposes a novel mesh refinement strategy to address this problem. Unlike conventional mesh refinement strategies based on interpolation error, the proposed approach resolves the convergence and solution jittering issue of the SCP framework by linking the direct and indirect methods with the costate estimation under successive linearization. Along with the development, we introduce a novel costate estimation method and provide proof of its validity. We present numerical simulation results of the proposed method and conduct a comparison with conventional approaches. The results obtained demonstrate successful mitigation of the solution jittering issue and a significant improvement in solution accuracy regarding compliance with the necessary conditions of optimality.},

These include time-domain criteria specifying the peak response to discrete gusts as well as frequency-domain continuous-turbulence criteria. Both types of criteria cannot be easily considered simultaneously with commonly available control design software. A frequency-domain formulation of 1−cosine discrete gust criteria based on a low-order, parameterized linear filter is proposed and demonstrated on a publicly available gust load alleviation benchmark. One example demonstrates its application in combination with continuous-turbulence specifications, and in principle, it can also be combined with other relevant frequency-domain specifications, such as passenger comfort metrics. This technique is shown to work well, producing the desired results with a simple, systematic design procedure, and should help reduce the time and effort required to obtain satisfactory control specifications.},

This paper shows how an ETD can be described analytically and exploited for the efficient computation and insightful classification of the complete set of ballistic capture trajectories in the planar problem. The new methodology is applied to different three-body systems and highlights the influence of the three-body energy on key aspects of the capture mechanism, such as prograde to retrograde transition.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based solution is introduced to the Powered Descent Guidance problem, grounded in principles of nonlinear Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) and Feynman–Kac theory. Our algorithm solves the problem by framing it as an -SOC problem for minimum fuel consumption. Additionally, it can handle practically useful control constraints and nonlinear dynamics and enforces state constraints as soft constraints. This is achieved by building off of recent work on deep forward-backward stochastic differential equations and differentiable neural-network layers for nonconvex optimization based on stochastic search. In contrast to previous approaches, our algorithm does not require convexification of the constraints or linearization of the dynamics and is empirically shown to be robust to stochastic disturbances and the initial conditions of the spacecraft. After training offline, our control policy can be activated once the spacecraft is within a prespecified radius of the landing zone and at a prespecified altitude, in other words, the base of an inverted cone with the tip at the landing zone. We demonstrate empirically that our controller can successfully and safely land all trajectories initialized in the vicinity of the base of this cone as well as with randomization in the starting velocities and spacecraft mass while minimizing fuel consumption.},

  abstract     = {A convenient formalism for the design of resonant flyby trajectories is the B-plane, where postencounter orbits with target resonance conditions or semimajor axes can be analytically mapped. This framework has been developed by many authors starting from the classical Öpik’s theory for close encounters, but it still relies on the approximation of circular orbits of the flyby bodies. In this work, the theory is analytically extended to account for elliptical planetary orbits. The classical and the extended formulations are tested and compared on two mission design applications, showing nonnegligible differences when the flyby body has a marked eccentricity. Further validation using a full three-body model confirmed the greater accuracy of the extended formulation. The second part of the paper proposes an efficient dynamic programming approach to the design of unperturbed resonant flybys. This problem has traditionally been addressed within broader optimization frameworks involving generic multiple gravity assists. However, focusing only on the resonant sequence allows the problem to feature a convenient structure for the implementation of dynamic programming. The developed algorithm is tested by reproducing the design of Solar Orbiter’s resonant phase with Venus, used in the actual mission to gradually raise the ecliptic inclination and reduce the distance at perihelion.},

The light curves are generated through numerical wave propagation, which considers atmospheric turbulence under anisoplanatic conditions. Subsequently, the light curve model is transformed into a linear measurement model to apply compressed sensing techniques. Notably, the sensing matrix is found to be a superposition of spatially variable PSFs, which significantly downsamples the ideal object image. The proposed approach robustly recovers clear images of objects in LEO, even with imperfect PSF map estimates and Poisson noise in the light curve measurement.},

  abstract     = {Close-proximity on-orbit inspection is a critical ability to initiate on-orbit servicing operations, required technology for space exploration missions. It is challenging to solve an optimal inspection trajectory planning problem that provides a complete target observation due to major difficulties. First, the inspection requirements must be defined and imposed on the problem as a set of path constraints that result in a nondeterministic-polynomial-time-hard problem. Second, the optimization problem, including highly nonconvex constraints, is very difficult to solve directly using an optimal control solver. Additionally, it requires proper initialization of states and control variables, which is critical in such problems. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes a novel formulation and method of solution for a full six-degrees-of-freedom optimal inspection motion planning problem. Optimal inspection trajectories are designed for a rigid-body spacecraft, which performs close, continuous, and complete observation of rigid, nonrotating, and nonaccelerating known targets. The inspection and collision avoidance constraints are defined in explicit forms that rectify the nondifferentiability of the problem and satisfy the inspection requirements. A pseudospectral optimal control solver is implemented to numerically solve the trajectory optimization problem. The proposed methodology is applicable to any robotic inspection mission. Simulations are presented as a validation of the proposed methodology and the achieved optimality.},

  abstract     = {A method for constructing homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions is presented for linear time-varying or switched-linear systems and the class of nonlinear systems that can be represented as such. The method uses a simple recursion based on the Kronecker product to generate a hierarchy of related dynamical systems, whose first element is the system under study and the second element is the well-known Lyapunov differential equation. It is then proven that a quadratic Lyapunov function for the system at one level in the hierarchy, which can be found via semidefinite programming, is a homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function for the system at the base level in the hierarchy. Searching for Lyapunov functions of the foregoing kind is equivalent to searching for homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov functions via the formulation of sum-of-squares programs. The quadratic perspective presented in this paper enables the easy development of procedures to compute bounds on pointwise-in-time system metrics, such as peak norms, system stability margins, and many other performance measures. The applications of the theory to analyzing an aircraft model, on the one hand, and an experimental aerospace vehicle, on the other hand, are presented. The theory can be comprehended with a first course on state-space control systems and an elementary knowledge of convex programming.},

To safely operate in the harsh conditions around Mercury, the spacecraft was in a highly eccentric orbit with a low periapsis altitude. The radiation environment had a strong impact on the spacecraft orbit evolution because of the proximity of Mercury to the Sun. A detailed modeling of the nonconservative forces is then a key factor to enhance the precise orbit determination of the spacecraft. We present here refined models of the nonconservative forces, including thermal reradiation effects, that enabled significant improvements in the trajectory reconstruction. A crossover analysis based on the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) data was carried out to cross-check the accuracy of the orbit determination results. The trajectories retrieved by using the refined spacecraft dynamical model provide reduced height misfit at crossover points, indicating a high-quality reconstruction. Our new solutions of the spacecraft orbits are then archived to be used as auxiliary information for the data analysis of other MESSENGER instruments.},

A method consisting of two novel algorithms is proposed to solve these subproblems. First, a multitree search framework is developed to assign multiple targets to each spacecraft and simultaneously optimize the rendezvous sequence for every single spacecraft. Specifically, a novel algorithm of local search combined with beam search is proposed. Second, this paper converts the rendezvous time optimization problem into a multistage decision problem. Based on a critical rendezvous-epoch-dependent characteristic found in this subproblem, the number of state variables is thereby reduced. A novel dual dynamic programming algorithm is proposed and combined with dynamic programming to solve for the globally optimal rendezvous epochs efficiently. Global optimality is guaranteed by Bellman’s principle of optimality, which is the first time in such a problem to our knowledge. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in several typical fuel-optimal scenarios of active debris removal. This open-sourced method is non-database-dependent and contains only one design stage, which is expected to be adopted in other successive rendezvous missions.},

  abstract     = {Expensive and time-consuming flight tests are required to evaluate different helicopters and flight control systems in terms of handling and ride qualities. If gusts occur during these flights, they can distort the flight crew’s perception of the handling and ride qualities. Therefore, it is desired to quantify the influence of gusts on these criteria. This requires the determination of gusts that occur during the flights. Indirect methods are favored for quantification of the gusts to avoid the complex mounting of expensive measuring devices. Existing gust reconstruction approaches rely on gust models in addition to dynamic models of the vehicle, so the quality of these approaches depends on the validity and quality of the gust models. Hence, an approach that is only bound to the model validity of the vehicle dynamics is preferred. Unfortunately, such an approach is currently not available. This paper addresses this gap by deriving an observer using the closed-loop shaping method. The proposed observer reconstructs gusts from measured accelerations considering the gust rejection properties of the helicopter. Consequently, it works independently of any gust model and provides an easy-to-use alternative to existing methods. The quality of the approach is evaluated with simulation data under various flight conditions.},

It is modeled as a linear time-varying system by linearizing with respect to a nominal reference trajectory. Disturbances due to random parametric uncertainty, atmospheric turbulence, and static wind shear are considered. Probabilistic uncertainty in the aerodynamic coefficients and mass parameters is quantified efficiently by applying a polynomial chaos series expansion. This generalized Fourier series is applied after employing a linear fractional transformation. The computational benefits of expanding uncertain interconnections in linear fractional representation build an appealing advantage of the applied analysis methods. Probabilistic and worst-case perturbations around the reference trajectory are quantified. The analysis results are compared with nonlinear Monte Carlo simulations of the complete closed-loop system.},

In this article, a new methodology is proposed to extend the maximum angle of attack at which a fin-stabilized guided projectile can be controlled, in spite of stringent actuator limitations. Plant-controller optimization is leveraged to maximize the control performance and mitigate the detrimental effects of aerodynamic nonlinearities on the projectile attitude dynamics. A nonlinear model is introduced to account for the effects of canard stall at the design stage and evaluate the performance of the system. Closed-loop wind-tunnel testing is performed to validate the aforementioned model and assess the performance of the optimal design against other guided projectile configurations. Numerical and experimental results show that the optimal projectile is faster for most angles of attack between 0 and 10 deg and features better disturbance rejection properties than its closest competitor.},

A dedicated modeling procedure allows reformulating the nonlinear projectile dynamics as a LPV polytopic system, employed for the controller design.

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel three-point guidance strategy that simultaneously achieves a desired impact angle, launch angle, impact time, and maximum lateral acceleration against a stationary target. The guidance strategy uses four sinusoidal harmonics of different amplitudes to construct an interceptor trajectory that satisfies all the mission specifications. A new geometric constant for sinusoids is proposed, which requires only the interceptor’s line-of-sight angles from the launcher and the target for computation. Correspondingly, a geometric rule is developed—the interceptor follows the desired sinusoidal trajectory by maintaining throughout the engagement. A trajectory design algorithm to determine the desired sinusoidal trajectory based on the mission specifications is presented. A proportional-derivative controller is applied to implement the proposed geometric rule, and analytical expressions for the controller gains are defined. The efficacy of the guidance strategy is investigated via various simulation scenarios. It is shown that the developed guidance law is robust to the initial heading errors and interceptor dynamics.},

At large distances, the projections of these CoLs appear as ellipses in images collected by cameras or telescopes onboard exploration spacecraft. This work shows how CoL projections may be used to determine the pole orientation and covariance for a spinning asteroid. In the case of a known planet modeled as an oblate spheroid, it is shown how similar CoL projections may be used for spacecraft localization.

  abstract     = {During powered descent of a crewed lunar landing mission, the ability to abort and ascend into a clear pericynthion orbit is critical in case any contingency renders the landing infeasible or excessively risky. In such a case, it is incumbent upon the guidance system to determine autonomously a safe abort trajectory and the associated guidance command. To accomplish this task reliably, a novel two-phase abort guidance strategy is proposed in this paper where a pull-up maneuver redirects the velocity vector to help mitigate any ground collision risk and achieve an appropriate initial ascent condition, followed by a fuel-optimal ascent guidance algorithm to insert the spacecraft into a predefined safe orbit around the moon. Development of the pull-up guidance laws and a description of the fuel-optimal ascent guidance based on the indirect method of optimal control are presented. In-depth investigation is conducted to provide a full understanding of the validity of the abort solutions. The solutions and fuel efficiency of the proposed guidance strategy are independently verified by using a direct method of optimal control. Monte Carlo closed-loop simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this method throughout the entire powered descent.},

Due to the high-dimensional complexity of AWE systems, however, formal mathematical robustness guarantees become difficult to compute. We draw on research from Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis to compute an avoidance control maneuver for the path-following controller that enforces safety constraints on the system while maintaining the guidance strategy. In addition, the subzero level set of the computed value function inherent in HJ reachability analysis indicates the backward reachable set, the set of states from which it is possible to safely drive the system into a target set within a given time without entering undesirable states. Furthermore, to integrate the avoidance controller with the path-following controller, we derive the necessary switching law such that the avoidance maneuver is only initiated when a tether rupture is potentially imminent. We illustrate our results via extensive simulation-based studies.},

Existing guidance laws based on the zero-effort-miss concept lack consideration for remaining thrust, potentially resulting in the excessive magnitude and rate of the thrust direction command. To address this issue, the zero-effort-miss concept is combined with an iterative predictor–corrector-based guidance law that is adapted for solid-propellant rockets. To apply the iterative predictor–corrector-based guidance law to the interception problem with a solid-propellant rocket, a composite zero-effort-miss concept is introduced, and the correction step is formulated as an online convex optimization problem. The composite zero-effort-miss consists of two zero-effort-misses. One miss is obtained from current state and the other miss is obtained from predicted state at burnout. Those render the proposed guidance law robust to thrust uncertainty allow for a noniterative approach and eliminate the singularity problem. Also, the proposed guidance law reduces maneuvering during the early part of the midcourse phase, leading to less velocity loss, and resolves intercept performance degradation due to the rate limit of thrust vectoring. Numerical simulations comparing the proposed method with the modified zero-effort-miss guidance demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.},

This index is then embedded into a low-order automatic domain splitting algorithm that accurately describes the mapping of an initial uncertainty set through a generic nonlinear transformation by splitting the domain whenever nonlinearities grow above a predefined threshold. The algorithm is illustrated in the critical case of orbital uncertainty propagation, and it is coupled with a tailored merging process that limits the growth of the domains in time by recombining them when nonlinearities decrease. The low-order automatic domain splitting algorithm is then combined with Gaussian mixture models to accurately describe the propagation of a probability density function.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a high-order guidance scheme based on the expansion of the solution to a time-optimal low-thrust optimal control problem by using differential algebraic techniques. The result allows new optimal trajectories to be autonomously computed from the simple evaluation of polynomials, including updated times of flight. Furthermore, a differential algebraic technique known as automatic domain splitting is implemented to improve the guidance scheme by adaptively and automatically splitting the uncertainty domain into smaller subdomains, in which new guidance polynomials are then generated which are better equipped to handle deviations in their respective subdomains. The result is not only a more effective handling of deviations in the trajectory compared to previous algorithms which use just a single set of polynomials but one that can provide the control and time-of-flight updates to a desired accuracy across the entire domain. Combined with its high-order nature, the guidance scheme is capable of dealing with nonlinearity and large deviations with respect to the reference trajectory, thus being robust to mismodeling and unplanned events. The guidance scheme is evaluated in three scenarios: simplified rendezvous using Clohessy–Wiltshire equations to demonstrate automatic domain splitting in the guidance problem, an Earth–Mars transfer, and an asteroid landing trajectory. The results show the ability of the differential algebraic-based guidance to provide optimal control and time-of-flight updates and improvements of several orders of magnitude over previous differential algebraic-based schemes in handling large uncertainty experienced in spaceflight by leveraging automatic domain splitting.},

The manifolds of averaged dynamics are used to reduce the transfer cost. A one-degree-of-freedom dynamical model around Europa, incorporating effects of Jupiter’s third-body perturbation and Europa’s nonspherical gravity, is established via double-averaging. Europa frozen orbits are calculated and classified into five groups according to their stability and locations in the phase space. The phase portraits indicate that low-eccentricity, high-inclination frozen orbits are always unstable, and manifolds are found to be associated with them. The transfers from halo orbits to these frozen orbits are designed by inserting into the manifolds first and then following the natural evolution until the arrival at the target frozen orbit. A nonlinear programming problem is established to optimize the transfers. Through the analytical derivations, the optimization model is simplified and finally solved by the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by numerical experiments, which indicate that the transfer cost can be reduced by approximately 10 to 40% at the expense of longer transfer time.},

  abstract     = {The polyhedral gravity model is the de facto standard for computing the gravity field near the surface of small bodies due to their irregular shapes. However, the computational load to compute the gravitational acceleration can increase significantly for high-resolution shape models. In this work, an algorithm for creating mixed-resolution shapes is developed with the goal of getting similar accuracy in the gravitational acceleration while reducing the computational cost. This method is tested for full integration into low-altitude trajectory simulations. The results show that blended models can provide comparable accuracy while improving the computation performance. Additionally, this approach does not require any fitting or estimation process as it only involves creating shape model connections, which is done in a deterministic manner. Test cases with asteroids Bennu and Itokawa demonstrate that the errors in the gravitational accelerations computed with the hybrid models are comparable to expected uncertainties from unknown heterogeneous mass distributions. For precomputed hybrid shape model strategies, we see savings in computational time on the order of 50% compared to using the high-resolution shape model, while getting much lower propagation errors than using only a low-resolution model alone.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes and evaluates a new safety concept called backup plan safety for path planning of autonomous vehicles under mission uncertainty using model predictive control (MPC). Backup plan safety is defined as the ability to complete an alternative mission when the primary mission is aborted. To include this new safety concept in control problems, we formulate a feasibility maximization problem aiming to maximize the feasibility of the primary and alternative missions. The feasibility maximization problem is based on multi-objective MPC, where each objective (cost function) is associated with a different mission and balanced by a weight vector. Furthermore, the feasibility maximization problem incorporates additional control input horizons toward the alternative missions on top of the control input horizon toward the primary mission, denoted as multihorizon inputs, to evaluate the cost for each mission. We develop the backup plan constrained MPC algorithm, which designs the weight vector that ensures asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, and generates the optimal control input by solving the feasibility maximization problem with computational efficiency. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulations of an unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problem.},

  abstract     = {The landing problem of a reusable rocket is generally a highly constrained and nonconvex optimization problem. In this paper, we will convexify the problem without relying on any linearization. Specifically, we propose to quickly determine some of the state variables in advance so that the nonlinearity of the dynamics is greatly reduced, and then we accurately convexify the problem by change of variables and transformation of the optimization objective. This convexification process enables us to design an iterative algorithm that can converge very reliably, and the convergence does not rely on any trust region constraint. It should be highlighted that the algorithm is very efficient, generally taking just milliseconds to converge on a personal computer. Furthermore, by ensuring the recursive feasibility of calling the iterative algorithm in each guidance cycle, we can design a landing guidance algorithm that is able to achieve precise landing under various uncertainties and disturbances. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the high performance of the iterative algorithm and the landing guidance algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A high-mass Mars entry, descent, and landing (EDL) mission for cargo delivery or human exploration faces the challenge of a high propellant mass fraction requirement for powered descent. This work develops a novel method and the associated algorithm that utilize existing entry and propellant-optimal powered descent guidance algorithms for fast and robust optimization of the end-to-end EDL trajectory for achieving the overall optimized propellant efficiency. A bilevel optimization formulation aided by a predictive logic based on the optimal powered descent algorithm to determine the near-optimal transition from entry to powered descent allows the end-to-end trajectory to be optimized in a relatively simple manner. No new major software or algorithms are required other than the existing guidance algorithms. A solution to the bilevel optimization problem is shown to exist, and the convergence of the bilevel optimization algorithm is guaranteed under certain mild assumptions. The algorithm developed in this paper is able to find consistently an end-to-end near-optimal EDL trajectory in just over 10 s on a desktop computer, while general-purpose modern trajectory optimization software can take thousands of seconds. The effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm are demonstrated by successfully optimizing thousands of complete EDL trajectories efficiently and reliably from dispersed initial entry conditions.},

First, the optimization process is formulated with observation vectors extracted from point-cloud features. Then, error-covariance expressions are derived. The attitude and position estimates obtained via the derived optimization process are proven to reach the bounds defined by the Cramér–Rao lower bound under the small-angle approximation of attitude errors. A fully populated observation noise-covariance matrix is assumed as the weight in the cost function to cover the most general case of the sensor uncertainty. This includes more generic correlations in the errors than previous cases involving an isotropic noise assumption. The proposed solution is verified using Monte Carlo simulations, a Gazebo simulation in a robotics operating system, and an experiment with an actual light detection and ranging sensor to validate the error-covariance analysis.},

  abstract     = {Millions of space debris pose a significant risk to operational spacecraft, making active debris removal (ADR) missions an urgent priority. Net capturing is a promising method to remove space debris objects due to its multiple advantages. However, once a target has been captured, a combined tethered system comprising the chaser, the target, and the tethers is formed, which requires effective stabilization. In this paper, stabilization of the entire postcapture system is realized by solely controlling the active chaser satellite. Such a control strategy can attenuate system hardware facilities compared with those by applying additional tether control such as using a winding mechanism, which were mostly discussed in the literature. Further, for the first time, considering the uncertainties during the capture process, including inaccurate target parameters, initial attitude error of the target, and external disturbances, a hierarchical sliding mode controller (HSMC) with two sublayers is developed to detumble this underactuated system. Additionally, a hybrid position controller is proposed to eliminate the undesired swing motion within the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that HSMC method delivers better performance over the proportional-derivative controller in efficiency and robustness for postcapture stabilization of the combined tethered system. Overall, our proposed control strategy offers a promising solution for future ADR missions, contributing to a safer and more sustainable space environment.},

We propose a gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart based on a matched linearization-Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (GGIWML-PMBM) filter to estimate the motion state and shape size of the SET. For the random matrix that can only describe the distribution under which the measurements are linear, the measurements of the spatial target are linearized using matched linearization, and the extended information is preserved in the second-order central moments. The transfer density and likelihood function of GGIW are nonlinear for Poisson measurements with nonlinear Gaussian spatial distributions, and the single-target densities and normalizing constants of the PMBM filter are not closed form. The prediction and update of PMBM include Gaussian-weighted integral calculation, for which different nonlinear approximation methods are used to calculate the weighted integral and derive the closed form of GGIWML-PMBM. Finally, the simulation scenarios of low-orbit single-radar sensor tracking near SET and group SET are established, and the results show that the tracking accuracy can reach 2.6 m for near SET and 6.6 m in group SET.},

Path-planning algorithm Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)*-Smart is employed in pointing space to generate a collision-free pointing path, and piecewise quintic polynomials are used to represent the attitude path. By proving the differential flatness of spacecraft with movable parts, the inverse dynamics is used to acquire attitude state trajectory in state space.

The ISMP is experimentally validated through three experimental scenarios. In the first scenario, the spacecraft must perform a re-orientation maneuver that caused it to move toward a keep-out cone. The ISMP manages the momentum of the spacecraft to prevent it from overshooting into the keep-out cone. In the second scenario, the spacecraft performs a slalom maneuver to avoid a pair of keep-out cones. The ISMP must reverse the momentum of the spacecraft to transition from avoiding the first keep-out cone to the second. The final scenario is an unrealistically difficult scenario designed to stress-test the capabilities of the ISMP where the spacecraft must escape from a maze of keep-out cones. These results demonstrate the ability of the ISMP to control the spacecraft attitude while enforcing state and input constraints.},

  abstract     = {The ability of a deep space spacecraft to estimate its position, velocity, and clock errors without external clock error estimation is investigated. A novel approach to onboard estimation of clock errors is proposed. The effects of clock bias and drift on spacecraft position and velocity errors are derived. These derived equations are leveraged to design a Kalman filter that processes optical measurements along with one-way ranging or two-way position updates from the ground. Simulations are performed to numerically validate the proposed approach and show good localization and timing estimation performance even with lengthy tracking data gaps.},

  abstract     = {In this paper an augmented convex–concave decomposition (ACCD) method for treating nonlinear equality constraints in an otherwise convex problem is proposed. This augmentation improves greatly the feasibility of the problem when compared to the original convex–concave decomposition approach. The effectiveness of the ACCD is demonstrated by solving a fuel-optimal six-degree-of-freedom rocket landing problem in atmosphere, subject to multiple nonlinear equality constraints. Compared with known approaches such as sequential convex programming, where conventional linearization (with or without slack variables) is employed to treat those nonlinear equality constraints, it is shown that the proposed ACCD leads to more robust convergence of the solution process and a more interpretable behavior of the sequential convex algorithm. The methodology can also be applied effectively in the case where the determination of discrete controls or decision-making variables needs to be made, such as the on–off use of reaction control system thrusters in the rocket landing problem, without the need for a mixed integer solver. Numerical results are shown for a representative, reusable rocket benchmark problem.},

  abstract     = {We propose a nonlinear hybrid dual quaternion feedback control law for multibody spacecraft-mounted robotic systems (SMRSs) pose control. Indeed, screw theory expressed via a unit dual quaternion representation and its associated algebra can be used to compactly formulate both the forward (position and velocity) kinematics and pose control of -degree-of-freedom robot manipulators. Recent works have also established the necessary theory for expressing the rigid multibody dynamics of an SMRS in dual quaternion algebra. Given the established framework for expressing both kinematics and dynamics of general -body SMRSs via dual quaternions, this paper proposes a dual quaternion control law that achieves simultaneous global asymptotically stable pose tracking for the end effector and the spacecraft base of an SMRS. The proposed hybrid control law is robust to chattering caused by noisy feedback and avoids the unwinding phenomenon innate to continuous-based (dual) quaternion controllers. Additionally, an actuator allocation technique is proposed in the neighborhood of system singularities to ensure bounded control inputs, with minimum deviation from the specified spacecraft base and end-effector trajectories during controller execution.},
