In this work, a ring-shaped structure is introduced to isolate mechanical waves within cylindrical shells. The underlying mechanism is that the ring-shaped structure undergoes different forms of deformation to counteract different modes of incident waves. A subwavelength Mn-Cu alloy ring is designed as a shock wave barrier in a typical spacecraft hold-down and release apparatus structure with multimodal wave excitation. We experimentally reveal that the Mn-Cu alloy ring reduces the peak value of the acceleration frequency response by 53.4% within a wide frequency range from 1 to 10 kHz. Meanwhile, in the time domain, the instantaneous acceleration peak can be weakened by 37.9%. This work provides a new strategy for shock control of shell structures in aerospace engineering and related fields.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a framework of physically consistent homogenization and multiscale modeling (PCHMM) is developed to analyze complex slender structures with homogenized one-dimensional beam models. Firstly, it is highlighted that periodic boundary conditions are not valid for the representative volume element (RVE)-based homogenizations if a shear-deformable beam model is to be obtained. Addressing this issue, physically consistent boundary conditions (PCBCs) are discussed in detail, which accounts for the influence of shear forces on the behavior of the slender structure and the corresponding RVE. A procedure of enforcing such boundary conditions is also given, applying sectional stresses to the RVE with fictitious DoFs. Additionally, we introduce a newly developed correct formula to calculate effective sectional properties which guarantee the cross-scale energy conservation though a modified Hill’s condition. The PCHMM framework, with homogenization/dehomogenization procedures using PCBC and the modified Hill’s condition, is also conveniently integrated into a commercial finite element software. The correctness and effectiveness of the developed framework of homogenization and multiscale analysis are demonstrated through several numerical examples, including lattice beams, twist-morphing metamaterial spars, and a realistic wing. The extension of this theory to plate/shell structures will be presented in our future work.},

  abstract     = {In the moving-morphable-component topology optimization, morphable components are introduced as a geometrical model mapped onto the background finite elements, and their shape parameters are utilized as design variables for topology optimization. Whereas a complex curved geometry ensuring continuity can be generated using existing curved components, the component curvatures cannot be selected as design variables in the existing methods; thus geometric constraints associated with curvatures cannot also be directly imposed. To address this issue, this study proposes a curvature-based morphable component by introducing the curvilinear geometry representation in the strain-based beam formulation. Since the proposed component is parameterized by curvatures using the curvilinear equation, the component curvatures can be utilized as the design variables. This allows for directly imposing curvature constraints on structural members, thereby accounting for the manufacturability of an optimal topology. It is demonstrated that a symmetric placement of the design variables using the midpoint curvilinear coordinate system is critical in ensuring convergence of the proposed curvature-based component optimization. The symmetric curvature component is further extended to account for multiple curvatures within a single component while ensuring continuity. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed multicurvature component for topology optimization.},

Macroscale simulations incorporate this spatial variability indirectly using homogenized material properties. The framework was applied to composite pressure vessels, whose stochastic burst pressure was predicted. The predictions were validated by experimental measurements. These measurements show that the actual burst pressure was underpredicted by an average of 5.8%. Several hypotheses were investigated to explain this discrepancy.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing has become a pivotal innovation in computational science, offering novel avenues for tackling the increasingly complex and high-dimensional optimization challenges inherent in engineering design. This paradigm shift is particularly pertinent in the domain of structural optimization, where the intricate interplay of design variables and constraints necessitates advanced computational strategies. In this vein, the gate-based variational quantum algorithm utilizes quantum superposition and entanglement to improve search efficiency in large solution spaces. This paper delves into the gate-based variational quantum algorithm for the discrete variable truss structure size optimization problem. By reformulating this optimization challenge into a quadratic, unconstrained binary optimization framework, we bridge the gap between the discrete nature of engineering optimization tasks and the quantum computational paradigm. A detailed algorithm is outlined, encompassing the translation of the truss optimization problem into the quantum problem, the initialization and iterative evolution of a quantum circuit tailored to this problem, and the integration of classical optimization techniques for parameter tuning. The proposed approach demonstrates the feasibility and potential of quantum computing to transform engineering design and optimization, with numerical experiments validating the effectiveness of the method and paving the way for future explorations in quantum-assisted engineering optimizations.},

Special emphasis is put on the truncation errors and the spectral properties of the scheme, and a connection is established to the well-known -damping scheme. The latter is also used to introduce discretization coefficients into the method that allow a fourth and a sixth order of accuracy in space on Cartesian grids. The effect of the scheme is presented in terms of canonical diffusion problems, as well as test cases for laminar wall-bounded flows. It is shown that the method preserves a second-order accuracy for the viscous operator, even on highly distorted unstructured grids and in the presence of boundaries and that it strongly enhances the solution accuracy with respect to a conventional scheme for viscous fluxes.},

  abstract     = {An on-the-fly unsteady adjoint-based aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimization methodology is presented, aiming to achieve practical engineering applications to explore high-efficiency and low-noise design for aerodynamic shapes. Firstly, a novel on-the-fly hybrid CFD-CAA approach is developed with a close integration of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and a fully viscous time-domain FW-H formulation. Subsequently, an adjoint-based sensitivity analysis method is proposed for unsteady aerodynamic and aeroacoustic problems with either stationary or moving boundaries, wherein a unified architecture for discrete-adjoint sensitivity analysis of both aerodynamics and aeroacoustics is achieved by integrating the on-the-fly hybrid CFD-CAA approach. The on-the-fly approach facilitates direct evaluation of partial derivatives required for solving adjoint equations, eliminating the need for explicitly preprocessing flow and adjoint variables at all time levels in a standalone adjoint CAA solver and consequently substantially reducing memory consumption. The proposed optimization methodology is implemented within an open-source suite SU2. Results show that the proposed on-the-fly adjoint methodology is capable of achieving highly accurate sensitivity derivatives while significantly reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude, and further demonstrations of single-objective and coupled aerodynamic and aeroacoustic optimizations highlight the potential of the proposed method in exploring high-efficiency and low-noise design for aerodynamic shapes.},

The cylinder was immersed in flows with favorable, near-zero, and adverse pressure gradients at a Reynolds number of 48,000, based on cylinder width. Far-field noise, unsteady surface pressure, and particle image velocimetry measurements were taken simultaneously using the open-jet pressure-gradient test rig in the UNSW Anechoic Wind Tunnel. Favorable and adverse pressure gradients were found to enhance and suppress the cylinder tonal noise, respectively. A favorable pressure gradient reduced the size of the recirculation region in the wake, which intensified the free-end downwash and suppressed the junction upwash. The intensities of the cylinder surface pressure fluctuations were slightly increased at the primary and secondary shedding Strouhal numbers (based on cylinder width) of approximately 0.1 and 0.2. Conversely, the recirculation region expanded under an adverse pressure gradient, with the downwash weakened and the upwash enhanced. The peaks in the surface pressure spectra were noticeably attenuated at the primary shedding Strouhal number and completely suppressed at the secondary Strouhal number. Wake flow structures correlated with the surface pressure fluctuations and far-field noise were identified to understand the enhancement or suppression mechanisms of the surface pressure fluctuations and the associated shedding regimes.},

The aerodynamic characteristics and three-dimensional flow structures were analyzed for the tandem wings. The back wing disturbed by the upstream vortices gained an evident increase in aerodynamic performance, where the advantage is related to the suppression of the large-scale vortex formation near the trailing edge. The Liutex method was applied to visualize the vortical structures for investigating the three-dimensional evolution and instability when interacting with the back wing. The upstream wake triggered dual-secondary vortices and intensified the secondary instability on the back wing. The induced vortices contributed to the lift enhancement because they provided an extra low-pressure region when propagating downstream on the suction side of the back wing. Because of the three-dimensional destabilization, the vortex interaction in the evolution process accelerated the transition and injection of the high-momentum flow into the boundary layer attached to the back wing, energizing the turbulent boundary layer and eliminating the large-scale separation near the trailing edge.

  abstract     = {In this work, numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of Reynolds and Mach numbers on thrust characteristics for a pitching airfoil. The results show that as increases, the thrust performance is improved. The inverse square root of Reynolds number is demonstrated to be a universal scaling law for both thrust coefficients and drag-to-thrust crossovers across and . In contrast, as increases above 0.1, the thrust performance is significantly reduced, especially when approaches 0.3. The thrust coefficients follow the square law of the Mach number, which also exhibits universality. Furthermore, the incompressible vortex projection method and the compressible vortex projection method are employed for thrust decomposition. Before this, the full expression of the compressible vortex projection method is derived. It is revealed that as increases, the improvement of thrust performance is primarily attributed to the reduced flow viscous effect and, meanwhile, benefits from the formation of more intense boundary layers and vortex structures in near wake. As increases, the enhancement of local flow compressibility ultimately leads to the divergence of added mass drag and thereby reduces the thrust performance.},

  abstract     = {In the Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid model, comprising air and droplets, singularities often arise as the phase fraction of dispersed droplets approaches zero. The nonconservative momentum equations can address this issue, but it will lead to inaccurate solutions when encountering discontinuities. To tackle the singularity problem and ensure accurate solutions for the droplet field, a novel adaptive form of momentum equations is proposed. The adaptive form defaults to the conservative form and smoothly transitions to the phase-intensive form when the phase fraction falls below a critical value, specifically 1/1000 of the inlet. The LU-SGS algorithm, enhanced with the inner iteration step method, is employed for numerical solutions of the droplet field. Comparative analysis reveals that the discrepancy between the results obtained from the adaptive form and the conservative form is negligible, under 0.5‰. Notably, with larger Courant numbers, the conservative form diverges from waterless regions despite imposing the minimum phase fraction constraint. Conversely, the adaptive form consistently maintains a Courant number of five times or more, potentially exceeding a hundredfold in complex flows. Although the adaptive form moderately increases complexity and computational time for a single time step, the improvement of the maximum Courant number will bring significant computational efficiency advantages. Moreover, the adaptive form holds promise for application in various other multiphase flow scenarios.},

The effects of the axial position and the acoustic impedance of the liner on the fan flutter stability are examined. Results show significant near-field coupling between the acoustic liner and the rotor, affecting the unsteady blade loading distributions and intensifying as the liner and the rotor overlap axially. The fan flutter stability shows clear sensitivity to the liner’s acoustic resistance, while its dependency on acoustic reactance appears more complex. An energy-based analysis shows that secondary unsteady loading induced by rotor–OTRL interaction may inverse the phase of the total unsteady loading, thus affecting the fan flutter stability.},

First, a nonlinear aeroelastic model is proposed utilizing two nonlinear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs , which are used to predict aerodynamic moments on an airfoil due to large-amplitude oscillation and camber morphing, respectively. Afterward, a nonlinear-model-inversion control system is designed upon the mentioned aeroelastic system to suppress stall flutter via the camber morphing. A fluid–structure–control (FSC) coupling strategy is developed with structure and control systems embedded in the high-fidelity computational-fluid-dynamics environment to validate the control effect. The FSC high-fidelity simulations show that the nonlinear-model-inversion controller can suppress pitching oscillation completely, whereas a linear proportional–derivative controller without time delay only performs a limited suppression rate by 25.6%. The flowfield evolution result infers that the active camber morphing can generate a converse training-edge vortex, which counteracts the leading-edge vortex during stall flutter. From the perspective of an energy hysteresis, active camber morphing works well by converting injected aerodynamic energy from positive to negative.},

The model combines an unsteady lifting-line formulation with Küssner–Schwarz aerodynamic theory to provide the pressure distribution and thus the transcendental aerodynamic matrix that relates the generalized aerodynamic forces to the Lagrangian coordinates of a given wing structural dynamics model. The state-space form of the aerodynamic loads is obtained from the rational matrix approximation of the aerodynamic matrix. This, combined with the wing structural dynamics operator, can readily provide the state-space form of the aeroelastic problem. To assess the accuracy of the proposed aerodynamic solution method, numerical investigations are performed. These consist of its application to several conventional wing configurations and wings with camber morphing, followed by the comparisons of the corresponding solutions with the predictions given by a well-validated panel-method solver for potential flows. These results are shown to be in very good agreement, thus demonstrating that the proposed approach can capture the effects due to wing tapering, sweep angle, and camber morphing, while requiring a remarkably lower computational effort. The excellent accuracy of a few-pole finite-state approximation of the aerodynamic matrix is finally proven for a swept wing with camber morphing.},

This analysis is extended to varying the wing root pitch angles through which the effects of geometrical nonlinearity are exercised. Their effects are particularly noted on the hump feature of the airspeed-driven damping ratio locus of the mode responsible for instability. The decreasing critical damping ratio is shown to result in amplified turbulence-driven responses, which pose significant challenges to identification procedures by masking the visibility of other modes. Furthermore, through a novel technique used to analyze the modal coupling, the relative phase and magnitude properties of the coupled bending–torsion composition of the critical mode before and at flutter onset are evidenced experimentally. It is demonstrated that these relative participation measures provide a strong indication of the response content of the limit cycle oscillations that emerge after the flutter speed.},

This paper presents a dynamic model and a flexoelectric vibration control method tailored for spacecraft equipped with single-sided flexible appendages. The spacecraft system is a central rigid hub with flexible cantilever beam appendages that allow for single-axis rotation. The flexible beam has a flexoelectric element attached to it. Leveraging Hamilton’s principle, the equations of motion are derived, accounting for flexoelectric effects, the centrifugal stiffening effect, and the coupling between rigid body attitude and flexible beam vibration. A closed-loop proportional–derivative controller is crafted for attitude control of the system. Additionally, a flexoelectric patch is employed as an actuator for active vibration control of the flexible beam. The precision and efficacy of the proposed model and control scheme are meticulously validated through numerical simulation. The results indicate that the flexoelectric patch can effectively manage the vibration of the flexible beam, consequently impacting the attitude control performance of the system. Furthermore, the flexoelectric effect of the system under static conditions is scrutinized, and the influence of the flexoelectric actuator on the rigid–flexible coupling characteristics of the system is thoroughly analyzed.

In this study, a numerical framework for coupled aeroelastic analysis was constructed in a partitioned manner using open-source software to elucidate the combined effect of structural deformation and compressible flow dynamics and characterize the aerodynamic performance of reentry vehicles with inflatable structures. The results revealed that the membrane surface was deformed elastically by the aerodynamic force owing to the large difference in pressure distribution between the front and back of the aeroshell. Fluctuating behavior was observed in the aerodynamic coefficients owing to the small-amplitude oscillation of the capsule. This oscillation was induced by the large wake behind the vehicle.

Simultaneous high-speed schlieren visualization and stereo digital-image correlation showed a strong linkage between the motion of the shock waves and the deformation of the panel.

The knowledge of these parameters is mandatory to analyze interferograms from Rayleigh scattered light. The second type corresponds to Rayleigh scattered light from a small volume under flow conditions, lighted with a focused laser beam and captured with long exposure time. Several flow parameters are chosen to generate these interferograms. The relative errors on the temperature and velocity estimates are found to be weak. Noise is also added to assess the robustness of the processing method. The error induced by the estimates of the instrument function is found to be of second order compared to the error induced by the image analysis.},

  abstract     = {Many scientific space missions need highly precise attitude and orbit control or ultrafine drag compensation, which relies on the variable-thrust propulsion technology operating at the micronewton level. Cold gas thruster (CGT) is a very promising solution, mainly because of its high reliability. One of the keys to the success of micronewton variable-thrust CGT is to understand the flow in its nozzle, whose configuration is much more complex than traditional CGT nozzles. This paper applies kinetic-based multiscale models to investigate the gas flow in the complex nozzle of a micronewton variable-thrust CGT. The simulations reveal that the flow simultaneously experiences all kinds of regimes from continuum to free molecular. The continuum breakdown is likely to occur near the throat region due to large gradients of flow variables and in the expander due to low gas density. Frictional choking is observed, and the nozzle length can be optimized to improve the thruster performance. Nozzle performance measures such as thrust, discharge coefficient, and thrust efficiency are found to change only with the throat Knudsen number . The performance curves can be divided into two sections at , and thereby an empirical piecewise formula for thrust prediction is proposed.},

The present work demonstrates that the recently developed spectral multiple-relaxation-time (SMRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is theoretically equivalent to Grad’s eigensystem [“Principles of the Kinetic Theory of Gases,” Thermodynamik der Gase/Thermodynamics of Gases, Springer–Verlag, Berlin, 1958, pp. 205–294], where the eigenfunctions obtained by tensor decomposition of the Hermite polynomials are also those of the linearized Boltzmann equation. Numerical results of shock structure simulation using the Maxwell molecular model agree very well with those of a high-resolution fast spectral method code up to Mach 7, provided that the relaxation times of the irreducible tensor components match their theoretical values. If a reduced set of relaxation times is used, such as in the Shakhov model and lumped-sum relaxation of Hermite modes, non-negligible discrepancies start to occur as the Mach number is raised, indicating the necessity of the fine-grained relaxation model. Together with the proven advantages of LB, the LB-SMRT scheme offers a competitive alternative for nonequilibrium flow simulation.},

  abstract     = {Shock-induced flow separation plays an important role in practical applications of hypersonic flows, like intake unstart and unsteady aeroelastic phenomena. The size of the shock–boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) region determines the extent of choking in engine inlet ducts. Recent scaling studies have shown that interaction length is a function of shock-induced pressure jump, upstream Mach number, Reynolds number, wall heating/cooling, and flow deflection angle at the shock wave. In this work, we analyze the interaction length scaling for different hypersonic SBLI cases at varying flow enthalpies. We perform Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations, using a shock-strength-dependent turbulence model, of hypersonic SBLI flows over a range of Mach numbers and at flow enthalpies where vibrational nonequilibrium starts to be important. The numerical results closely match the experimental data, validating the RANS predictions. The size of the separation bubble in such high-enthalpy cases is found to not follow the known scaling relations. We propose a modified scaling that collapses a wide range of hypersonic Mach numbers and freestream enthalpy conditions. We also derive the high-Mach-number limit to demonstrate that wall cooling/heating and geometry are the main factors affecting the size of the SBLI region in hypersonic flows.},

A unique feature of the proposed P-ROM method is its a priori mode selection criterion that can be utilized with the desired target accuracy assigned by the modeler. Thus, the proposed P-ROM method bypasses the arduous task of substructural mode synthesis (viz., selecting modes for each substructure) and directly constructs the ROM equations. An attractive feature of the proposed P-ROM method is that it can handle nonmatching mesh problems with ease. The performance of the present P-ROM method is illustrated through several numerical ROM examples and the ensuing transient analysis.},

Experiments have been conducted in the Altitude Icing Wind Tunnel at the National Research Council of Canada under different icing conditions to assess the potential of the new technique. Using the camera in a close-up configuration, the results show the evolution of the three-dimensional shape of the accreted ice in high spatial and temporal resolution and in absolute metric units. The computed surface meshes allow for a detailed analysis in terms of ice shape, surface area, and ice volume. Posttest shapes are compared to measurements taken using a commercial laser scanner. Although not rated for ice surfaces, this device is used as a reference to compare the detailed surface structure after registering the data sets. The results of the two methods are in good agreement and show a mean relative deviation of the plenoptic camera of about 0.15 mm.},

As the equivalence ratio increases, the combustion mode will change from Scram to Dual to Ram. However, the larger combustor has a delayed mode transition. The scale effects of flame stabilization are also reflected in the changes of heat release, precombustion shock train length, jet penetration depth, and reaction zone location. The combustion flowfields of different-scale combustors exhibit numerous differences under different combustion modes. However, after shortening the isolator of the proportionally scaled small-scale combustor, the combustion flowfield is closer to that of the large-scale combustor. Further analysis reveals the reason for the inconsistent scale effects of flame stabilization under different combustion modes. The probable reason is that the boundary layer, which does not change proportionally with the combustor scale, has different effects on the combustion under the three modes. Compared with the Scram and Ram modes, the scale effect in the Dual mode is the most significant because the strong interaction between heat release and the boundary layer amplifies the slight difference in the relative thickness of the boundary layer.},

A unique feature of this rotor setup is the constructive and destructive interference of sound waves produced by neighboring blades, which are incubators for signal distortion effects. Waveform distortions are evaluated for changes to rotor index angle, the separation distance between the upper and lower rotors, as well as changes to rotor speed for different observer positions. Significant sensitivities in the kurtosis of the pressure waveform and its time derivative, the number of zero crossings, and the integral of the quadrature spectral density are shown for changes in rotor index angle, observer position, and rotor speed; stacking distance appears less important at affecting changes to these metrics. The trade space between these metrics and rotor figure of merit demonstrates how changes to the rotor index angle can invoke relatively small changes in rotor performance while generating large changes in acoustic waveform nonlinearities.},

High-fidelity simulations have typically been limited to narrow domains to be computationally feasible, overly constraining the flow and introducing modeling errors. Depending on the boundary-layer state upstream of the interaction, different buffet features are observed. High-fidelity simulations (implicit large-eddy simulation) were performed on the periodic (infinite) NASA-CRM wing at a moderate Reynolds number to assess the sensitivity of the two-dimensional transonic buffet to boundary-layer state and domain width. Simulations were cross-validated against low-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)/unsteady RANS and global stability analysis, and excellent agreement was found near the onset. By varying the boundary-layer tripping amplitude, laminar, transitional, and turbulent buffet interactions were obtained. All cases consisted of a single shock and low-frequency oscillations . The transitional interaction also exhibited reduced shock movement, a 15% increase in , and energy content at higher frequencies . Spanwise domain studies showed sensitivity at the shock location and near the trailing edge. We conclude that the span width must be greater than the trailing-edge boundary-layer thickness to obtain span-independent solutions. For largely separated cases, the sensitivity to span width increased, and variations across the span were observed. This was found to be associated with a loss of two-dimensionality in the flow.},

This paper uses acoustical data collected from a 120-microphone array near a T-7A-installed F404 engine to characterize the spatiospectral lobes in combinations of the time, frequency, and spatial domains. An event-based beamforming method is used in conjunction with a wavelet transform to determine propagation angles and event source locations corresponding to each of the lobes. Temporospectral events in the wavelet transform are then analyzed using Markov chains. Finally, spatiospectral maps created from the measured data are decomposed into individual lobes using events in the wavelet transform as a guide. The spatiospectrotemporal combination of these three analyses shows that the lobes originate from multiple, overlapping regions along the jet lipline and that each lobe has its own peak radiation angle. Additionally, events corresponding to the spatiospectral lobes occur intermittently and at different times from each other, leading to bursts of acoustic energy with rapidly changing directivities.},

  abstract     = {Gas-surface reaction mechanisms and rates were developed for an air–titanium surface to support finite-rate catalytic surface reaction models used in computational fluid dynamics. For the surface dissociation/recombination reactions, a two-step reaction method was applied based on the assumption that two atoms must be positioned in adjacent cells to recombine. Transition state theory was used to calculate the surface reactions for adsorbed diatomic molecules to dissociate to the adjacent unit cell or atoms located in the adjacent cells to recombine into diatomic molecules. For the second step, atoms located in the adjacent cells are allowed to further dissociate to another cell (total separation), or totally separated atoms recombine into the adjacent cells. A stochastic gas-surface kinetics simulation code, STOKIN, was developed to simulate gas-surface reactions and to calculate the equilibrium constants of second molecular dissociation recombination processes. Thermodynamic properties of the adsorbates (enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities) were calculated using density functional theory along with statistical mechanics assuming no rotational and translational contributions to the entropies and heat capacities due to the adsorbates’ inability to freely move or rotate on the surface.},

  abstract     = {The paper illustrates the effect of temperature on composite material properties and its influence on the response of composite plates. Two composites considered include laminae with uniaxially oriented and with in-plane randomly oriented fibers. Analytical solutions are presented for a uniformly heated large-aspect-ratio plate deforming into a cylindrical surface. The solutions are demonstrated for thermal buckling and natural frequencies for the cases of controlled loading and controlled displacements. Micromechanical residual and lifetime thermally induced stresses at the interface of fibers and matrix are assessed to predict a possible onset of local damage after the curing and during lifetime. The material considered in numerical examples consists of silicon carbide fibers and a titanium alloy matrix. The moduli of elasticity and shear as well as the coefficients of thermal expansion of this composite are significantly affected by temperature. The thermally induced microscopic radial stress at the fiber–matrix interface is high, so it should be monitored in silicon fiber titanium matrix composites to avoid the onset of local damage. In conclusion, accounting for the effect of temperature on material properties is highly desirable since it produces more accurate solution than those utilizing the properties at the room temperature.},

The aspect ratio (wind tunnel width/separation length, ) provides nominally two-dimensional flow for more than half of the spanwise extent of the test section. Analysis in the streamwise/wall-normal plane along the center of the test section shows low-frequency large-scale motion of the separated region. The flowfield contains features of both geometry-induced and pressure-gradient-induced separation, but unsteady dynamics produce dominant frequencies closer to geometry-induced TSBs compared to purely pressure-gradient-induced TSBs . Measurements along the spanwise direction and parallel to the initial shear layer development show strong evidence that the low-frequency motion is inherently three-dimensional, providing an additional dimension to the understanding of the flapping/breathing typically observed in planar streamwise/wall-normal measurements. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition and low-order modeling identify spanwise undulations with wavelengths of the order of and frequencies of . The three-dimensional behavior causes a peak/valley formation along the span and a more localized expansion/contraction, leading to only small variations in the integral volume of the TSB.},

The simulations are based on a previously developed model, which was shown to be hyperbolic, thus permitting the unhindered propagation of pressure waves critical to craters produced by supersonic plumes. The goal is to identify predicted quantities from these simulations that show sufficient differences among simulations performed with different drag models; these quantities would warrant future experimental investigations determining which model is correct. Among all drag models examined, only two models are found applicable to the regime of investigation. Examination of the databases is conducted from the viewpoint of global quantities and detailed quantities. The results show that isocontours and characteristic length scales are minimally affected by the employed drag law. In contrast, azimuthally averaged and root mean square ejecta-related quantities are more sensitive to the drag model employed, but only in the central part of the crater. This sensitivity is much larger for shallow craters having a parabolic cross section than for deep craters having a conical cross section, thus indicating the experimental configuration best suited to experimentally evaluating drag models.},

Our model is characterized and validated using forward evaluations of simulated buoyancy-driven flow and both simulated and experimental BOS measurements of hypersonic flow over a sphere. Moreover, the model is embedded in a neural reconstruction algorithm, which is demonstrated with a total variation penalty and the compressible Euler equations. Our cone-ray technique dramatically improves the accuracy of BOS reconstructions: the shock interface is well-resolved in all our tests, irrespective of the camera’s aperture setting, which spans f-numbers from 22 down to 4.},

Laser beams were positioned both in the freestream and behind the bow shock at specific locations deemed pertinent to computational fluid dynamics comparison and kinetic model evaluation. The fractions of laser beam pathlengths behind the shock in different spatial regions were also discerned, thus providing a measurement of shock location. This study consists of six total experiments (“shots”) across two Mach conditions, characterized by total enthalpies of 8 and and freestream velocities of 3.5 and , respectively. Freestream measurements generally concur with prior works in the T5, but with some non-trivial differences. Shock-layer measurements span from 2000 to 6000 K and feature noteworthy and expected variety among different zones within the post-shock region. Thermal equilibrium is generally held throughout the flowfield, but chemical nonequilibrium is commonly observed. NO is the primary spectroscopic target, but measurements of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, and atomic oxygen provide supplementary insights.},

The global stiffness of the wing structure is changed after jig-shape optimization and structural optimization, and the jig-shape and structural scheme are modified alternately. The previously mentioned process needs to be repeated until the changes in the jig-shape and structural scheme in the iterations can be ignored.

  abstract     = {The nonparametric probabilistic method (NPM) is a physics-based machine learning approach for model-form (MF) uncertainty quantification (UQ), model updating, and digital twinning. It extracts from reference data information not captured by a real-time computational model and infuses it into a “hyperparameterized,” stochastic version of this model by solving an inverse statistical problem formulated using a loss function and a few hyperparameters. The loss function is designed such that the mean value and statistical fluctuations of some quantities of interest predicted using the real-time stochastic model match target values obtained from the reference data. NPM’s performance hinges upon the efficient minimization of the loss function, which is unfortunately stochastic and nonconvex and thus prone to getting the optimization procedure trapped in suboptimal local minima. The latter scenario is exacerbated when the reference data is scarce. The paper addresses these issues by adopting the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance as the measure of dissimilarity between two different sets of data and by reformulating NPM’s inverse statistical problem as a multimodal data-assimilation problem. The potential of the resulting enhanced NPM for MF-UQ, model updating, and digital twinning is demonstrated using numerical simulations relevant to applications in structural dynamics, including structural health monitoring.},

Inspired by the observations that the instability of axial liquid film exerts significant influence on the downstream spray behaviors of a liquid–liquid pintle injector, the influence of the skip distance ratio on the instability of the axial liquid film and the subsequent spray characteristics of the pintle injector was experimentally investigated. The spray steadiness of the pintle injector was evaluated based on the instantaneous images using the proper orthogonal decomposition technique, and the effects of the skip distance ratio and the momentum ratio on the spray features were analyzed. Furthermore, a proactive strategy was proposed to adjust the liquid film instability by modifying the outer wall morphology of the pintle post, and the verification experiments were carried out based on three different wall morphologies. It was discovered that the rough wall enhances the axial liquid film instability and promotes the liquid sheet breakup and atomization of the pintle injector.

  abstract     = {When attempting to develop aerodynamic models for extreme flight conditions, including high angle of attack, high rotational rates, and tumbling motion, many classical methods have challenges in accurately modeling the highly nonlinear aerodynamic effects present. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have previously been shown to be a potential technique to model these nonlinear aerodynamic effects when framed as a system identification problem. PINNs are well suited to this problem as they benefit from the universal approximation abilities of neural networks while directly incorporating known physical constraints into the training process. One of the main challenges in machine learning algorithms, including PINNs, is quantifying the confidence in a deterministic model prediction. This work expands on the previous development of PINNs as an aerodynamic and system identification tool by incorporating uncertainty quantification through three ensemble methods to provide calibrated confidence intervals on both aerodynamic coefficients and propagated trajectories. This work demonstrates and evaluates these methods on a simulated F16 case study where up to 100 PINN models are trained on varying training datasets. These models provide aerodynamic coefficients directly and are used to propagate trajectories within a six-degree-of-freedom simulation environment.},

The problem is modeled in a cuboidal domain, and a cuboidal energy element is developed for the simulation of the structural components. To simulate the energy distribution of the structure, stiffened plates are treated as discrete energy systems, where variable stiffness is used to characterize their energy distribution in a cuboidal domain and a global admissible function is used to approximate their vibrational behavior. With extended interval integral, Gauss quadrature, variable stiffness, and Legendre polynomials used for numerical integration in the cuboidal domain, the cuboidal energy element can offer sufficient precision with sufficient Gauss points for simulating the strain energy of stiffened plates with complex geometries. The Gauss–Legendre quadrature will provide accurate integration results if the integral domain is cuboidal. Otherwise, small cuboidal energy elements are generated with denser Gauss points to capture the geometric boundaries. As the numerical model is constructed on a standard geometric domain, all energy functionals and computational procedures are standard. Three-dimensional vibration problems are investigated for variously shaped stiffened plates with straight or curvilinear stiffeners.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach to constrain limit-cycle oscillations in design optimization. The approach builds upon a limit-cycle oscillation constraint that bounds the recovery rate to equilibrium, circumventing the need for bifurcation diagrams. Previous work demonstrated the constraint using approximate recovery rates obtained by evaluating the system state velocity for prescribed states. This work proposes a fully nonlinear matrix pencil method that accurately evaluates the recovery rate based on transient simulations. The proposed method captures the amplitude variation in the recovery rate using a short time window that slides along the time history of a quantity of interest. This sliding-window matrix pencil method is first verified for a typical section model. Sensitivity analyses identify guidelines to obtain accurate recovery rates efficiently. The system is then optimized subject to limit-cycle oscillation, flutter, and side constraints, and the results are compared with the ones based on approximate recovery rates. The sliding-window matrix pencil method allows the optimizer to produce a less conservative design while preventing limit-cycle oscillations at desired operating conditions and amplitudes. The approach introduced in this paper can facilitate the inclusion of limit-cycle oscillation considerations in the design phase of a broad class of nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {The response of an impinging laminar shock–boundary layer interaction (SBLI) to prescribed surface motions is investigated numerically at , and a shock-associated pressure ratio of 1.5. Parametric sweeps over classical standing and traveling mode shapes are considered at low-, moderate-, and high-frequency conditions for fluid–structure interaction. The specific values are chosen based on compliant panel deformations and frequencies reported in the literature. At low surface oscillation frequencies, the SBLI responds to the deformations in a quasi-steady fashion, with standing wave forcing displaying both breathing and sloshing of the separated region depending on structural mode shape. As the oscillation frequency is increased, the flow transitions to an unsteady response with pronounced separation bubble undulations in time. Higher-order modes and frequencies lead to the largest reductions in the time-mean separation bubble size, more so with traveling surface waves. Modal decompositions show that pressure fluctuations, which arise due to dynamic interaction with the surface, persist downstream and increase in amplitude with the surface oscillation frequency.},

The utilization of near-field information is justified by the observation that the scattering surfaces are typically situated within a few nozzle diameters from the jet axis in the radial direction, both in the current and in innovative aircraft configurations. The far-field information is used to guarantee the correct subdivision between the wave-packet radiating noise and the hydrodynamic components. The results show a notable agreement between the LES data and the wave-packet solutions, consistent with findings documented in the existing literature. This agreement underscores the validity and applicability of the implemented methodology, offering an effective method for obtaining an equivalent jet noise acoustic source, easily implementable in acoustic scattering codes, and accounting for the directional behavior of jet noise.},

Of these, Hashin’s criteria distinguish between the fiber and the matrix failure. The in-plane stresses are found from the plate displacements and Hooke’s law, and the transverse stresses are recovered by integrating the equilibrium equations through the thickness. Effects of the plate aspect ratio, the fiber angle, the face sheet materials, and the core materials on the first failure load are identified. The computed results are found to agree well with those reported in the literature.

The intrinsic effect of transition to turbulence on the vortex-shedding frequency, strength, and its three-dimensional structure is explored. At large-scales, the vortex shedding is characterized by significant phase variations along the span, which vary stochastically and are punctuated by vortex dislocations when the phase differences grow large. These features of the vortex shedding are quantitatively examined in a streamwise–spanwise plane of the wake with particle image velocimetry. When the point of transition shifts upstream due to an increasing Reynolds number, greater phase variations in the vortex shedding along the span and more frequent dislocation events are produced. These changes are linked to the spanwise correlation of the streamwise velocity in the wake. In the turbulent boundary-layer regime, it is found that the phase drift does not change significantly. The decline in the spanwise correlation with increasing boundary-layer thickness in this regime is instead linked to the relative strength of the vortex shedding compared to the random turbulent fluctuations in the wake.},

Previous two-dimensional simulations and a preliminary wind-tunnel test demonstrated the effectiveness of the microjet concept on a deployed flap. To further validate microjet effectiveness, this study uses a specially developed particle image velocimetry technique to estimate the momentum injected by a microjet on a deployed Fowler flap of a two-element NLR7301 airfoil while simultaneously measuring the lift enhancement provided by the microjet via surface pressure taps. The test results are broadly consistent with numerical simulations that predict lift increases proportionally to the square root of momentum injection. Within the experimental uncertainties, the test results show slightly less lift benefit for a given level of estimated momentum injection compared to the simulations, possibly due to three-dimensional effects such as spanwise variability and spanwise velocity components of the injected air, which could not be measured with the current instrumentation.},

In these settings, standard, single-domain approaches may be too inaccurate or may overfit and hence generalize poorly. Moreover, processing large-scale datasets typically requires significant memory and computing resources, which can render single-domain approaches computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we introduce a domain-decomposition formulation into the construction of a data-driven reduced model. In doing so, the basis functions used in the reduced model approximation become localized in space, which can increase the accuracy of the domain-decomposed approximation of the complex dynamics. The decomposition furthermore reduces the memory and computing requirements to process the underlying large-scale training dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in a large-scale three-dimensional unsteady rotating-detonation rocket engine simulation scenario with more than 75 million degrees of freedom and a sparse training dataset. Our results show that compared to the single-domain approach, the domain-decomposed version reduces both the training and prediction errors for pressure by up to 13% and up to 5% for other key quantities, such as temperature, and fuel, and oxidizer mass fractions. Lastly, our approach decreases the memory requirements for processing by almost a factor of four, which in turn reduces the computing requirements as well.},

A numerical model of the aircraft is established and the six-degree-of-freedom motion equations combined with the improved-delayed-detached-eddy simulation (IDDES) method are used to simulate the maneuvering process of the aircraft and calculate the surface acoustic load. The calculated acoustic load is used as an external excitation for the vibroacoustic response of the cabin. Considering the impact of high static stress caused by overload on structural vibration characteristics, the low-frequency modal and high-frequency equivalent stiffness of the aircraft under overload conditions are calculated separately. The low-frequency and high-frequency responses are calculated by combining the finite element/boundary element and statistical energy analysis methods, and the full-band vibration spectrum and noise spectrum in the cabin are obtained. The calculation results indicate that the vibroacoustic response characteristics are mainly determined by external load, and the structural vibration response is dominated by low-order vibration. The main component of the noise response also comes from the low-order modal vibration of the structure. Overload has a greater impact on the low-frequency vibroacoustic response of the cabin, and as the frequency increases, the impact of overload on the vibroacoustic response gradually decreases.},

  abstract     = {A novel model reduction method for viscously damped structures with statically determinate interfaces, such as spacecraft flexible appendages, is proposed. The paper presents a derivation of the complete complex modal expansion of the interface dynamic stiffness of these structures. Based on the identity relation for all complex modes, which is obtained during the derivation, it is found that the interface acceleration impedance can be expressed as a rational fraction with high accuracy using only low-order complex modes. Using this rational fraction as an approximation model, numerical results of the frequency response can be fitted. The fitted interface acceleration impedance can be applied to real-time control as a reduced model in the form of a transfer function. Furthermore, it can be transformed into the form of system matrices by introducing auxiliary variables, which then participate in the dynamic analysis of the assembly. The reduction process circumvents complex modal analysis and necessitates only the results of frequency responses. Thanks to the powerful ability of conventional finite element software to perform frequency response analysis, this reduction method can be used for large-scale complex models in actual engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {In aerospace engineering, the existence of cracks highly alters the mechanical behaviors of structural components. As a new class of key structural components, functionally graded material (FGM) rectangular plates with an interior/side crack are focused on in this study. New analytical free vibration solutions are put forward for such cracked FGM plates. First, a cracked plate is decomposed into several subplates with the necessary continuity conditions to address the physical discontinuity issue caused by the crack. The challenge then becomes deriving analytical free vibration solutions for each subplate. To accomplish this task, a symplectic superposition method (SSM) is developed to deal with FGM rectangular plates with various boundary conditions, including the complex continuity conditions. The SSM eliminates the need for a predefined solution form, and its solution procedure, including variable separation and eigen expansion, is mathematically rigorous. Afterward, the analytical solutions obtained via the SSM are integrated to serve as the final free vibration solution of the cracked FGM plate. Comprehensive results based on the obtained analytical solutions, including natural frequencies and vibration modes, are presented and validated. The solutions are further used to investigate the effects of some important parameters, such as crack length and crack location.},

This method is then used to obtain estimates of the total mass, stowed envelope size, and fundamental natural frequency of vibration for antennas with a range of aperture diameters and focal lengths, assuming an operational radio frequency of 10 GHz. A study of the scaling trends of this reflector design shows that the distribution of prestress in the inner tension structure has a major impact on the mass of the outer perimeter truss. Based on this result, a prestress optimization problem to design reflectors of minimum mass is formulated, and analytical scaling laws are obtained for the mass, stowed envelope, and natural frequency of optimally prestressed reflectors with aperture diameters up to 200 m. It is then shown that aperture diameters of 70–100 m are at the limit of launchers that are currently available or under development. A semianalytical homogenization model that accurately estimates the fundamental natural frequencies for batten-supported and free-free boundary conditions is also presented.},

  abstract     = {In the early stages of aerospace design, reduced-order models (ROMs) are crucial for minimizing computational costs associated with using physics-rich field information in many-query scenarios requiring multiple evaluations. The intricacy of aerospace design demands the use of high-dimensional design spaces to capture detailed features and design variability accurately. However, these spaces introduce significant challenges, including the curse of dimensionality, which stems from both high-dimensional inputs and outputs necessitating substantial training data and computational effort. To address these complexities, this study introduces a novel multifidelity, parametric, and nonintrusive ROM framework designed for high-dimensional contexts. It integrates machine learning techniques for manifold alignment and dimension reduction—employing proper orthogonal decomposition and model-based active subspace—with multifidelity regression for ROM construction. Our approach is validated through two test cases: the 2D RAE 2822 airfoil and the 3D NASA CRM wing, assessing various fidelity levels, training data ratios, and sample sizes. Compared to the single-fidelity principal component–active subspace (PCAS) method, our multifidelity solution offers improved cost-accuracy benefits and achieves better predictive accuracy with reduced computational demands. Moreover, our methodology outperforms the manifold-aligned ROM method by 50% in handling scenarios with large input dimensions, underscoring its efficacy in addressing the complex challenges of aerospace design.},

Optical diagnostics such as high-speed CH* chemiluminescence and high-speed three-color camera pyrometry were utilized to measure and analyze the emissive species to draw conclusions about the reacting flowfield. Additionally, optical access afforded the ability to determine spatially resolved regression rates within the flameholding region of each fuel grain.

  abstract     = {In this work, a modal matching approach is developed to investigate the impact of the spatial correlation of wall pressure fluctuations on structural vibration and its role in suppressing flow-induced vibration in aircraft. The modal matching method defines the wavelength ratio between the convection wave and the flexural wave to capture the spatial characteristics of both the flow mode and the structural mode. In comparison to conventional methods such as the finite element method and analytical method, the proposed modal matching approach allows for obtaining the vibration response in the spatial–wavenumber domain. To validate the spatial correlation effect on structural vibrations obtained with the modal matching approach, a wind tunnel test was conducted to measure flow-induced vibrations. The calculated spatial–wavenumber data for flow-induced vibrations reveal that the crests and troughs of the vibration velocity alternate periodically as the wavelength of the wall pressure fluctuations changes. At the resonance frequency, a vibration velocity trough can be observed when the spatial correlation of wall pressure fluctuations aligns with the structural mode. Additionally, the concept of resonance independence of flow-induced vibrations is introduced to describe the phenomenon where the most severe structural vibration, determined by the matching value between the aerodynamic mode and the structural mode, does not always occur at the resonance frequency. The modal matching approach effectively suppresses structural vibration by utilizing the spatial correlation of wall pressure fluctuations, offering a new perspective on controlling flow-induced vibrations.},

Structural modeling assumptions are also evaluated using both linear and nonlinear representations. Close agreement in the predicted aeroelastic steady state is observed. However, large discrepancies in the dynamic aeroelastic response predictions are found and ultimately linked to the neglect of deformation-induced cavity pressure fluctuations and dynamic flow separation in the LPT model. Interestingly, the dynamic flow separation induces a fluid-driven limit cycle oscillation in the postflutter regime. Furthermore, structural nonlinearity is not found to have a strong impact on the conditions and configurations considered.},

The structural model comprises geometrically exact beams formulated in a director-based total Lagrangian description, circumventing the need for rotational degrees of freedom. The structural model is spatially discretized into finite elements and temporally discretized with the help of an implicit scheme that identically preserves momenta and energy. The resulting nonlinear discrete equations are solved by applying Newton’s method, requiring calculating the Jacobians of the whole aeroelastic system. The correctness of the linearized loads is then shown by direct comparison with their numerical counterparts. In addition, we employ our strongly coupled aeroelastic model to investigate the nonlinear static and dynamic behavior of a suspension bridge. With this approach, we successfully investigate the numerical features of the aeroelastic system under divergence and flutter conditions.},

This means that for nonlinear aeroelastic applications, where small training budgets are driven by the high computational burden associated with generating data, the usability of such methods has been limited to highly simplified aeroelastic systems. This paper presents a novel approach for the identification of optimized sparse higher-order polynomial-based aeroelastic reduced order models (ROMs) to significantly reduce the amount of training data needed without sacrificing fidelity. Several sparsity promoting algorithms are considered, including rigid sparsity, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). The study demonstrates that through OMP, it is possible to efficiently identify optimized -sparse nonlinear aerodynamic ROMs using only aerodynamic response information. This approach is exemplified in a three-dimensional aeroelastic stabilator model experiencing high-amplitude freeplay-induced limit cycles. The comparison shows excellent agreement between the ROM and the full-order aeroelastic response, including the ability to generalize to new freeplay and velocity index values, with online computational savings of several orders of magnitude. The development of an optimally sparse ROM extends previous higher-order polynomial-based ROM approaches for feasible application to complex three-dimensional nonlinear aeroelastic problems, without incurring significant computational burdens or loss of accuracy.},

It is combined with the Craig–Bampton method to reduce order and eliminate nonindependent degrees of freedom. Then, the unsteady vortex-lattice method is used to calculate the transient, unsteady aerodynamic force for time evolution.

The plates are characterized by a single dimensionless porosity parameter identified in previous works that controls the influence of porosity on the sound field. Hot-wire anemometry interrogates the velocity field to connect turbulence details of specific regions to flow noise directivity and beamforming source maps. Porous plates are demonstrated to reduce the bluntness-induced noise by up to 17 dB and progressively suppress broadband low-frequency noise as the value of the porosity parameter increases. However, an increase in this parameter also increases the high-frequency noise created by the pores themselves. The same highly perforated plate characterized by a large value of the porosity parameter reduces the bluntness-induced vortex shedding that is present in the wake of the impermeable plate. Lastly, pore shape and positional alignment are shown to have a complex effect on the acoustic field. Among the porosity designs considered, plates with circular pores are most effective for low-frequency noise reductions but generate high-frequency noise. No meaningful difference is found between the acoustic spectra from plates of the same open-area fraction with pores aligned along or staggered about the flow direction.},

Flying animals have velocity-sensing structures on their wings and are capable of highly agile flight in unsteady conditions, a proof-of-concept that artificial flight-by-feel control systems may be effective. Constrained by size, weight, and power, a flight-by-feel sensory system should have the fewest optimally placed sensors which capture enough information to predict the flight state. Flow datasets, such as from computational fluid dynamics, are discrete, often highly discontinuous, and ill-suited for conventional sensor placement optimization techniques. The data-driven Sparse Sensor Placement Optimization for Prediction approach reduces high-dimensional flow data to a low-dimensional sparse approximation containing nearly all of the original information, thereby identifying a near-optimal placement for any number of sensors. For two or more airflow velocity magnitude sensors, this algorithm finds a placement solution (design point) which predicts angle of attack of airfoils to within 0.10° and ranks within the top 1% of all possible design points validated by combinatorial search. The scalability and adaptability of this algorithm is demonstrated on several 2D model variations in clean and noisy data, and model sensitivities are evaluated and compared against conventional optimization techniques. Applications for this sensor placement algorithm are explored for aircraft design, flight control, and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Response to control input is of significance to the application of real-time active flow control (AFC). In this paper, a novel data-driven framework is used to discover the underlying physics of the dynamic response process of fluidic thrust vectoring (FTV), a typical application of AFC. In the proposed framework, sparse identification of a nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is used to identify the governing equations of the flow control responses of sets of noisy measurement data. The clustering algorithm is then used to seek the generalized coefficients of basis functions for different sets of data, which improve the robustness of the model to noisy measurement data. First, a simulated mechanical system is used to validate the effect of the framework. To simplify the modeling, control performance and characteristics are investigated in a detailed manner. Then a dimensionless parameter based on the pressure coefficient is found to exhibit a linear relationship with the vector angle under different working conditions. This parameter is introduced in the proposed framework to model the dynamic process of response to control input. The obtained governing equations can describe the dynamic process accurately based on the validation of testing data. The form of the governing equation is rewritten and analyzed based on the control theory, revealing the physics of this process, which is significant to practical AFC implementation.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the use of surrogate-based analysis and optimization (SBAO) methods to investigate the performance of pulsed jet actuators for active separation control in a wind tunnel. Two experimental setups are examined: pressure-induced separation on a one-sided diffuser and trailing-edge separation on a NACA 64A-015 airfoil. In both cases the modeling is done using Gaussian process regression (kriging), and the investigated active-flow-control parameters are the amplitude, frequency, and duty cycle of the actuators that are used to mitigate boundary-layer separation. In the diffuser test case, a parameter-space exploration is conducted to examine the effect of the three input parameters on the amount of reverse flow detected by an array of calorimetric shear-stress sensors. In the airfoil test case, an optimization strategy is followed to maximize an objective function constructed with the airfoil sectional lift coefficient and the mass flow consumption of the actuators. Both experiments consistently indicate that lowering the duty cycle of the pulsed-jet actuators below 0.5 may lead to efficiency gains in active separation control by limiting their mass flow consumption for equal performance, but with a concomitant supply pressure increase. Overall, the results presented herein demonstrate that SBAO methods could provide a potential for more efficient wind tunnel investigations involving multiparameter problems.},

  abstract     = {Operating a conventional propeller at negative thrust results in the operation of positively cambered blade sections at negative angles of attack, leading to flow separation. Consequently, accurately simulating the aerodynamics of propellers operating at negative thrust poses a greater challenge than at positive thrust. This study offers a comprehensive assessment of the aerodynamic modeling capabilities of numerical methods, spanning low to high fidelity, for computing propeller performance across both positive and negative thrust regimes. Low-fidelity methods, namely, blade-element momentum and lifting line theories, effectively predict propeller performance trends at positive thrust. However, they fail to capture trends at negative thrust beyond the maximum power output point due to the neglect of three-dimensional flow effects. Both steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations with perform well across both positive and negative thrust conditions, with errors below 2% for both thrust and power magnitudes near the maximum power output point. Lattice-Boltzmann very-large-eddy simulations (LB-VLESs) with exhibit excellent agreement with experimental data with less than 1% error near the maximum power output point but with significant computational costs. Conversely, LB-VLESs with offer a more economical approach to capture general trends with the computational cost of the same order as unsteady RANS. However, wall models introduce errors in modeling flow separation, leading to a 16% overestimation of power magnitude near the maximum power output point. The results highlight the necessity of using tools with increased fidelity levels when considering propeller operation at negative thrust compared to the conventional positive thrust regime.},

  abstract     = {Unsteady-flow wind tunnels typically employ control louvers installed in the wind-tunnel circuit to produce rapid changes in the test-section flow velocity. For these wind tunnels, an open-return circuit is advantageous because of the lower mass of air that must be accelerated by the louver forcing. However, in addition to inertial effects, the wind-tunnel behavior is also affected by the interaction of the pressure disturbances from the louvers and their reflection from the open boundary conditions of the wind tunnel, resulting in a windspeed response that is nonintuitively related to the louver motion. In this paper, an experimental investigation into the unsteady behavior of a model-scale, open-return wind tunnel is described. An incompressible method of characteristics model for the wind tunnel is shown to successfully predict the wind-tunnel dynamic behavior, and an approach to produce controlled windspeed histories that compensates for the wind-tunnel response is demonstrated.},

Their application enables an extension of the pulse technique for system identification, as well as the adaptation of the linear-frequency-domain formulation commonly utilized in fixed-wing to rotary-wing scenarios. These methodologies effectively incorporate the aerodynamic nonlinearities associated with the equilibrium state into an efficient time-variant linearized representation of the unsteady aerodynamics. To promote its application in the context of rotary-wing aeroelasticity, a state-space realization based on a periodic autoregressive model with exogenous input is subsequently employed. Upon transformation from discrete to continuous time, the resulting aerodynamic model adopts a linear continuous-time periodic state-space formulation, offering compatibility for its coupling with a wide range of structural models. The proposed aerodynamic framework tailored to rotary-wing aeroelasticity holds applicability across a spectrum of aerodynamic models of arbitrary complexity, spanning from incompressible potential flow approximations to potentially more sophisticated methods. Showcasing the potential of this framework, the widely studied lossy Mathieu equation and the aerodynamic response to a flap perturbation about the periodic equilibrium condition of a prototypical rotor blade section, incorporating nonlinearities through an analytical dynamic stall model, are considered.},

  abstract     = {We propose a framework for developing wall models for large-eddy simulation that is able to capture pressure-gradient effects using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Within this framework, the distributed reinforcement learning agents receive off-wall environmental states, including pressure gradient and turbulence strain rate, ensuring adaptability to a wide range of flows characterized by pressure-gradient effects and separations. Based on these states, the agents determine an action to adjust the wall eddy viscosity and, consequently, the wall-shear stress. The model training is in situ with wall-modeled large-eddy simulation grid resolutions and does not rely on the instantaneous velocity fields from high-fidelity simulations. Throughout the training, the agents compute rewards from the relative error in the estimated wall-shear stress, which allows them to refine an optimal control policy that minimizes prediction errors. Employing this framework, wall models are trained for two distinct subgrid-scale models using low-Reynolds-number flow over periodic hills. These models are validated through simulations of flows over periodic hills at higher Reynolds numbers and flows over the Boeing Gaussian bump. The developed wall models successfully capture the acceleration and deceleration of wall-bounded turbulent flows under pressure gradients and outperform the equilibrium wall model in predicting skin friction.},

The simulated lift coefficient and dynamic stall timing agree with experimental data, which is attributed to the wall-normal resolution of the mesh and is an advancement from the early prediction of stall seen consistently in previous numerical studies. The accurate prediction of dynamic stall is found to be dependent on the correct simulation of the bursting of the laminar separation bubble (LSB), which initiates the complete separation of the boundary layer and the formation of a leading-edge vortex.

This length scale is shown to vary with Reynolds number as . A-priori analysis demonstrates that the resolution required to reasonably predict the wall stress in several nonequilibrium flows is at least , irrespective of the Reynolds number and Clauser parameter. Further, a-posteriori studies (on the Boeing speed bump, Song– Eaton diffuser, Notre-Dame Ramp, and the backward-facing step) show that scaling such that is independent of Reynolds number results in accurate predictions of separation for the same “nominal” grid across different Reynolds numbers.

Because SREs are elongated in the streamwise direction and designed to avoid flow tripping, the critical height of SREs is much higher than that of DREs. Moreover, the wake flow behind SREs efficiently generates and sustains crossflow vortices that are not dangerously unstable against secondary instabilities but able to strongly distort the mean crossflow profile into a less unstable one. By measuring this mean flow distortion by SREs and DREs, the laminarizing effect is compared among them. It is shown that the effect of SREs is higher than that of DREs and can be enhanced by choosing the appropriate height, angle, and wavelength depending on the local boundary-layer profile.},

Whereas in Case A the freestream-velocity profile changes from suction–blowing to blowing–suction in a complete cycle, Cases B and C are both suction–blowing only and the strength of the adverse pressure gradient is modulated in time. Moreover, the boundary layer in Case B never approaches a zero-pressure gradient condition. A closed separation bubble is formed for all Cases; however, its dimensions change depending on the far-field forcing. The time evolution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) reveals an advection mechanism of turbulent structures out of the domain for all Cases. Whereas in Case A and C the high-TKE region, generated in the separated shear layer, is washed out of the domain as a rigid body, in Case B the separation bubble remains present and the advection mechanism of TKE is characterized by a breathing pattern.},

The goal is to improve the aeroelastic performances of turbomachinery blades and simultaneously constrain/improve aerodynamic performances. The decoupled modal reduction method is used to compute the forced response, which is considered the objective function in adjoint-based design optimization. To analyze aeroforcing and aerodamping flow and adjoint fields efficiently, the harmonic balance method and its adjoint counterpart developed by an automatic differentiation tool are applied. Two cases—the NASA Rotor 67 with inlet distortion and a three-row configuration with multiple fundamental frequencies in the second row—are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aerodynamic and aeroelastic coupled design optimization system developed in this work. For the latter case, the Fourier-transform-based method that first decomposes and then matches the time and space modes at two sides of an interface is used for interface coupling. The almost-periodic Fourier transform method is used to determine the time instances for cases with multiple fundamental frequencies.},

Control was applied through splitter-plate trailing-edge spanwise waviness (passive), spanwise-arranged microjet blowing actuators (active), and their combination (hybrid). Passive and hybrid control successfully alleviate the tone, whereas active control amplifies and alters the tone frequency. Time-averaged schlieren data show changes to mean shock structures with control. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) spectra from the raw schlieren data are consistent with the far-field measurements and reveal coherent structural details. Radiation associated with high-frequency structures is inhibited by passive and hybrid control that enhance mixing, but not by active control. Momentum potential theory filtering prior to SPOD application augments the analysis by isolating irrotational content, providing additional clues on acoustic vs hydrodynamic mechanisms. The results indicate shock–shear-layer interaction and shedding as sources of low- and high-frequency content, respectively. As such, through suitable processing, relatively easy-to-obtain high-speed schlieren provides a powerful tool to assess complex flow-control physics.},

The normalized root-mean-square optical path difference for all three cases is in good agreement with respective data obtained from reference direct numerical simulations and experiments (within 1.53% for , 1.25% for , and 12% for , compared to numerical data). Above , the normalized path difference obtained from the simulations is above the value predicted by a semi-analytical relationship by Notre Dame University. With increasing Mach number, the bulk contribution to the total optical distortion shifts toward the boundary-layer edge. In addition, a proper orthogonal decomposition reveals that the nature of the dominant density fluctuations, which are located near the boundary-layer edge, changes from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. Understanding how the coherent structures contribute to the optical path difference may pave a way toward devising active flow control strategies geared toward a reduction of the optical path difference.},

  abstract     = {The fluctuations caused by the dynamic shock wave and its interaction with the boundary layer bring formidable challenges for aerodynamic design and stable control of supersonic aircraft. The mechanism of closed-loop control for dynamic oblique shock stabilizing with arc plasma is numerically studied. Two types of dynamic oblique shocks are formed in supersonic airflow by a compression ramp rotation and incoming Mach number variation, respectively. A closed-loop controller is established to connect the arc plasma deposited power with the pressure ratio across the dynamic shock by using the proportional-integral method. It realizes the shock pressure ratio stabilized in the desired target value with a local overshoot appearing at the initial excitation and a more stable flow downstream of the oblique shock during excitation state for both types of dynamic shock control. The effects of arc plasma length and ramp rotating speed on the closed-loop control for the dynamic shocks induced by ramp rotation are further discussed. Results show that the arc plasma with longer length is more favorable to the dynamic oblique shock control with lower energy consumption and total pressure loss. The pressure ratio fluctuation is increased at higher ramp rotation speed, but its standard deviation is still limited to 0.3% of the desired target value during excitation state.},

These results show that plasma development changes substantially between the first three pulses, where the distribution of free electrons resulting from the previous pulse influences the development of the plasma sheath and hence the downstream extent of the bulk plasma. Between the third and fifth pulses, a negative surface charge region persists at the downstream extent of the plasma, which generates an electron void, thus inhibiting the development of a strongly ionizing plasma sheath. These results show that by five pulses the plasma has reached its maximum extent and that for the purposes of establishing average values the first two pulses should not be considered representative of the longer-term plasma behavior.},

In this paper, the Koiter–Newton reduced-order method using mixed nonlinear kinematics is presented for the geometrically nonlinear buckling analysis of thin-walled structures. Strain energy variations up to the fourth order were achieved using mixed kinematics for the improved Koiter theory. Corotational kinematics, which is inconvenient for high-order variations, was applied to calculate the first- and second-order variations for the internal force and tangent stiffness, respectively, whereas the third- and fourth-order strain energy variations were facilitated by explicit algebraic formulations using updated von Kármán kinematics. A reduced-order model with degrees of freedom was established, of which perturbation loads were considered to make the method applicable for buckling problems. The geometrically nonlinear response was traced using a predictor–corrector strategy by combining the nonlinear prediction solved by the reduced-order model and the correction using Newton iterations. Numerical examples of structures with various buckling behaviors demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is not obviously affected by using simplified kinematics, and sometimes it even exhibits a superior capability for path-following analysis.},

Toroidal shapes can be defined as curved, endless hollow shapes that eliminate the need for end caps when used for pressure vessels. This study presents an analytical formulation using lamination parameters for the novel design of toroidal pressure vessels. The proposed design is based on stiffness tailoring by changing the fiber tow trajectories spatially through the structure to suppress the direct stress and strain gradients in the thickness direction, leading to reduced structural weight, defined as bend-free variable-angle-tow (VAT) toroidal pressure vessels. For a toroidal pressure vessel with a fixed geometry, the VAT distribution through the structure to suppress bending is obtained. Subsequently, the bending stresses and strain levels in the designed VAT toroidal pressure vessels are assessed numerically and compared with those of their isotropic and constant-stiffness composite counterparts. Results show that the designed VAT toroidal pressure vessel generates considerably lower degrees of bending than its corresponding isotropic and constant-stiffness composite counterparts.},

Initially, we recast the discrete vibration response equation into a matrix form and formulate the parameter estimation problem in modal analysis as an optimization problem. Then the problem is solved with a gradient-based iterative algorithm, which explicitly exhibits the closed form of gradients used in optimization. Initial values for this iteration are parameters derived from finite element models, since every important engineering structure should be analyzed with a finite element model before it is constructed. Subsequently, the performance of this algorithm is validated by both pure numerical experiments, which simulate the physical world, and experiments using real measurement data gathered by sensors in the real physical world. The algorithm’s performance is further enhanced by incorporating gradient clipping and an adaptive iteration threshold. As a comparison, a discussion on classical least-squares time-domain method for the problem is provided. For practical applications, the Shi–Tomasi corner detection and Lucas–Kanade optical flow methods are deployed to detect corner points from videos taken during the vibration of a structure and track the motion of these points in the videos.},

Advancements in composite manufacturing and numerical methods have enabled designers to consider more nontraditional shapes, such as connecting the conical and cylindrical sections with a toroidal transition to create a single-piece conical–cylindrical shell. This single-piece construction eliminates the need for a stiff, heavy interface ring between sections and has the potential to reduce mass. To better understand the buckling behavior of a composite conical–cylindrical shell, a laboratory-scale article was designed, fabricated, and tested. Before the test, a finite element model that included thickness variations and radial imperfections was created. The test article buckled elastically at 251.8 kN, approximately 8.8% higher than the predicted buckling load of 231.4 kN. Because the test article buckled elastically, the buckling test was repeated. The buckling load measured from the second test was within 1% of that from the first test. Continued research on conical–cylindrical structures has the potential to expand the design space for launch-vehicle structures and lead to improved designs and reduced mass.},

This study explores the feasibility of enforcing displacement compatibility between two interconnected, independent solid mechanics finite element models with a contact interface within an SoS. This work developed an approach that ensures operational independence by delaying displacement compatibility in one of the systems. The lagged system provides a trial displacement input to the leading system, which determines the displacement discrepancy between both systems. This error is used to calculate an equivalent pressure that enforces displacement compatibility between the models. The method was verified by modeling two specimens with a frictionless contact interface and comparing the results against a continuous model assuming a perfect bond between the specimens. Lastly, the method was implemented within an SoS for space habitats and proved effective in ensuring matching displacements at the contact surface between two interacting structural layers. The proposed approach preserves the modularity of coupled systems, avoiding complex iterative procedures and transferring mass and stiffness information between systems. Moreover, it allows the coupled models to be developed in independent coordinate systems, as they only pass scalar, coordinate-independent parameters through the input–output ports.},

Linearization of this coupled panel and vortex particle method is demonstrated via finite differencing and a novel analytical linearization technique to yield a linear time-invariant representation. The code is implemented in MATLAB® and validated against an open-source aerodynamic solver for a fixed wing in both stationary and unsteady conditions. The linearized models are verified against the nonlinear dynamics both in the time and frequency domains. Linearized models accurately represent the wake dynamics about the equilibrium condition for moderate amplitude inputs and for input frequencies covering the typical frequency range of flight dynamics and flight controls, i.e., 0.3–30 rad/s. Analytical linearization is shown to abate the cost of linearization over perturbation methods by , where is the total number of states of the system. Linearized models of the coupled panel and vortex particle dynamics have applications in the flight dynamics of both fixed- and rotary-wing vehicles, where these dynamics can be used to augment the rigid-body dynamics.

Generally, these techniques are conducted in conjunction with comparison tests on metals. In this study, a review of the various approaches for measuring adhesion for static and impact ice for metal and icephobic surfaces was done. This review indicated that many details of the test conditions either varied significantly among studies or were omitted. To address this uncertainty, new measurements were taken to examine in-situ ice-shear-adhesion strength for impact and static ice with various surfaces, using a consistent icing-research-tunnel facility with well-characterized and detailed test conditions. The results for the two different metals tested revealed a significantly higher ice adhesion for static ice compared to that for impact ice. However, the tested self-lubricated icephobic coating significantly reduced ice adhesion strength for both impact and static ice and this performance was retained after multiple icing tests. Based on the methodology review and the current experimental study results, it is recommended that future ice adhesion studies fully characterize the following: the apparatuses for shear measurement, which include protocols and procedures used; the surface chemistry and roughness; the thermal conditions of the air, water, and surface; and for impact ice, the droplet conditions such as velocity and size in order to ensure repeatability within a study and comparison across studies.},

The plasma actuator is usually excited by a sinusoidal high-voltage power with a frequency of a few to tens of kilohertz. However, the investigations on the flowfield produced by a plasma actuator with a frequency below 200 Hz remain limited. Motivated by this demand, the formation and characterization of the vortices generated by a plasma actuator with a high-voltage frequency of 125 Hz are studied in detail. In addition to the starting vortex, it is of great importance that a train of vortices that shed periodically from the junction between the two electrodes and are quite different from the starting vortex are first observed. The shedding frequency of the periodic vortices is the same as the high-voltage frequency of 125 Hz. Combining the acoustic with the flow characteristics of the plasma actuator, the formation mechanism of these periodic vortices is discussed. Finally, a criterion for generating the periodic vortices is proposed based on the relationship between the scale of vortices and the separation distance between the two neighboring periodic vortices.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models have been widely applied in the aerodynamic optimization of aircrafts, whereas the traditional individual surrogate models have the defects of low robustness and applicability. In this study, a novel ensemble surrogate model is proposed and applied in the multi-objective optimization of the airfoil. The backpropagation neural network, deep belief network, and kriging surrogate models are selected as the member surrogate models, and the Dirichlet distribution strategy is introduced to adaptively generate the weights of the member surrogate models in constructing the ensemble surrogate model. An improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) framework is established by employing the -stable distribution function to enhance the global convergence rate of the algorithm. Based on the improved MOPSO framework in which the ensemble surrogate model is embedded, the multi-objective optimization of the airfoil is conducted. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble-surrogate-model-based optimization obtains better aerodynamic performance of the airfoil under multiple operating conditions, compared to the individual-surrogate-model-based optimization.},

  abstract     = {The micronewton thruster is one of the essential technologies for providing an ultrastable satellite platform for scientific experiments in space. Particularly, space gravitational wave detection requires a microthruster with continuously adjustable thrust, high resolution, low noise, and fast response. To meet these requirements, we designed a two-dimensional (2D) nozzle and manufactured it using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Compared to the nozzles machined with conventional methods, the nozzles etched by the MEMS can easily reach a micron size and form arrays to create mutual backups and also provide a way to widen the thrust range by switching the number of openings. Based on a single 2D nozzle, a cold gas microthruster prototype is constructed with nitrogen gas as the propellant. The thrust of the prototype is tested by a pendulum, the range can span , the thrust resolution is better than , and the thrust noise reaches at 0.1 Hz. The result demonstrates that the scheme has the potential to be applied to gravitational wave detection missions.},

In this study, a spatially evolving turbulent boundary layer interacting with a wall-mounted cube ahead of a backward-facing ramp is investigated using wall-resolved large-eddy simulations for a Reynolds number of 19,600, based on the inlet boundary layer thickness and freestream velocity. Different cube configurations are examined to isolate the effects of cube height and streamwise position. The large counter-rotating flow produced by the larger cubes generated more turbulent kinetic energy, thereby resulting in smaller separated regions over the ramp. Although significantly lower levels of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation than production are observed in the outer flow regions of the horseshoe vortex and in the induced counter-rotating flow, the spatial distribution of dissipation is similar to that of the turbulent kinetic energy. When the upstream position of an isolated single cube, relative to the leading ramp edge, is more than three cube heights, the streamwise decay of the counter-rotating flow results in lower levels of turbulent kinetic energy.},

  abstract     = {Multirotor vehicles typically use either complex mechanisms to vary blade pitch angle or speed control to vary thrust and torque to attain stability and maneuverability. Alternatively, thrust and torque can be varied by morphing the blades without the use of complex mechanisms and without varying the rotor speed. This method could be faster to change thrust, more efficient, and it may require fewer mechanical components. This paper presents an experimentally validated aerodynamic model with an empirical static-aeroelastic correction to predict the thrust and torque coefficient of a mechanism-free rotor with Macro-Fiber Composite actuators. A variable-camber piezocomposite rotor prototype is experimentally tested on a static-thrust setup. The experiment is used to identify the so-called unknown coefficients of the model (e.g., related to the shape of the blade induced by the piezoelectric device) and to identify a correction to account for flow-induced deformations. Using the identified model, several parametric analyses are conducted to predict thrust and torque coefficients as a function of rotor speed and the electrical excitation of the piezocomposite actuators. In addition, the model is used for design optimization, leading to several optimal designs based on a limited parameter space. Three different objective functions are used: maximizing thrust, minimizing torque, and maximizing thrust-to-torque ratio. The operational aerodynamic characteristics of these designs are also presented.},

However, they are unable to reveal phase relations between different frequency components while these play a role in the fundamental understanding of low-frequency intensity modulation of higher-frequency rotor noise. A methodology to quantify interfrequency modulation is applied to a comprehensive acoustic dataset of a fixed-pitch benchmark rotor, operating at a low Reynolds number and at advance ratios ranging from to 0.61. Our findings strengthen earlier observations in case of a hovering rotor, in which the modulation of the high-frequency noise is strongest around an elevation angle of (below the rotor plane). For the nonzero advance ratios, modulation becomes dominant in the sector and is most pronounced at the highest advance ratio tested . Intensity modulation of high-frequency noise is primarily the consequence of a far-field observer experiencing a cyclic sweep through the noise directivity pattern of relatively directive trailing-edge noise. This noise component becomes more intense with increasing and is associated with broadband features of the partially separated flow over the rotor blades.},

To validate and demonstrate the approach, a benchmark case of wave scattering from parallel hard–soft plates is studied by comparing the machine learning results with the available analytical solutions. The proposed MINN approach could provide a new route to extensively enhance the theoretical modeling capability for several wave scattering and fluid mechanics problems.

  abstract     = {Trailing edge serration is an effective method to reduce broadband noise generation by an airfoil. However, the noise reduction performance can be significantly reduced when there is flow misalignment at the serration. This experimental study investigates the impact of a shift in the serration position downstream of the airfoil trailing edge on the noise reduction performance, referred to in this paper as serration extension. Experiments were performed on a 100-mm-chord NACA 0012 wing model with sawtooth trailing edge serrations. The serration performance was studied at 0° and 7° flap-down configurations at various angles of attack. The serrations with three different extension lengths of 5, 10, and 15 mm were tested and compared with the baseline case without extension. The emitted noise was measured with a phased microphone array. The results show a significant reduction in broadband high-frequency noise by extension under loading conditions. Particle image velocimetry measurements of root flow along the wall-normal plane reveal diminished crossflow across the serration after extension. Furthermore, the extensions cause an up-to-25% increase in the maximum lift coefficient and improved or unaltered lift-to-drag ratios.},

The aerodynamic results reveal the development of a complex vortex system at the side edge, including primary, secondary, and tertiary vortices that govern aerodynamic noise production. The wall-pressure coefficient and root-mean-square pressure coefficient contours highlight the side-edge shear layer and flow impingement of the primary vortex at the pressure-side edge as important noise-generation mechanisms. Dynamic mode decomposition shows that the dominant pressure modes on the airfoil exist along primary and secondary vortex impingement lines. Far-field acoustic predictions based on both solid and porous Ffowcs-Willliams and Hawkings’ analogies demonstrate good agreement with experimental results between 1.5 and 9 kHz. Low-frequency tonal humps observed in the spectra result from duct acoustic modes excited by airfoil self-noise, a consequence of the installation effect. For this configuration, airfoil side-edge noise did not dominate over airfoil surface noise levels, suggesting that at low to moderate angles of attack, airfoil side-edge noise is not a significant contributor to the overall acoustic emissions.},

To investigate such complex dynamics of a flame–turbulence interaction, we present an experimental exposition of a premixed turbulent Bunsen flame. Several quantities have been evaluated to assess the flame–turbulence interaction. We first measured the statistics of the flowfield adjacent to the flame and compared it with the cold flow. This allowed us to evaluate the effect of the flame on the upstream turbulence. Subsequently, we performed statistical analyses of the local values of various stretch rates and quantified how their distribution changes with turbulence intensity and flame temperature. We also evaluated the pairwise relation among various stretch rates to assess their dependence on each other. Finally, we used flame particles to evaluate the Lagrangian evolution of stretch rates conditioned on flame-fronts. All the analyses presented in this work point out Karlovitz number as a key factor in determining the flame–turbulence interaction. Specifically, we observe a stronger influence of turbulent eddies on flames with increasing Karlovitz number, as evidenced by the reduced effect of flame on upstream flow, wider probability distribution functions of stretch rates, and increased persistence timescales for stretches.},

Global lifting regimes were mapped and consisted of attached flames, periodically lifted flames, and permanently lifted flames. With one exception, all flames were attached in the absence of acoustics and lifted only because of the applied acoustic excitation. The exception occurred at the highest Reynolds number and velocity ratio, where the flames were unconditionally lifted in all cases. Between these two extremes, a range of lifting regimes was observed. Lower applied frequencies and smaller amplitudes were found to generally promote attachment to the burner. Flow visualizations using high-speed Schlieren and chemiluminescence imaging revealed a lateral spreading effect near the jet exit. The lateral spreading was hypothesized to be caused by an axially oriented counterflow collision between the downstream flowing jets and presumed local upstream portion of the acoustic velocity fluctuations. Physical mechanisms were hypothesized based on this observation, which appear to consistently explain most of the observed behavior.},

It is found that, compared to the pure high-pressure kerosene, the gas-added kerosene can achieve better combustion performance at low injection pressure. The gas addition increases the fuel-jet penetration depth and promotes flowfield fluctuations. The gas–liquid two-phase instability induces large-scale vortices within the fuel-jet shear layer.

  abstract     = {The linear amplification of modal disturbances that lead to boundary-layer transition in two-dimensional/axisymmetric hypersonic configurations is strongly reduced by the presence of a blunt nose tip, and the mechanisms underlying the low Mack’s second-mode -factor values at the observed onset of transition over the cone frustum are currently unknown. Linear nonmodal analysis has shown that both planar and oblique traveling disturbances that peak within the entropy-layer experience appreciable energy amplification for moderate to large nose-tip bluntness. The present study extends the previous linear analysis by including the nonlinear effects. Specifically, the harmonic Navier–Stokes equations (HNSE) are solved with a fully implicit formulation and the Newton–Raphson method. The increased number of degrees of freedom for the nonlinear system presents difficulties for solution strategies based on direct solution of the linearized system. Such difficulties are overcome by using the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) iterative method with a preconditioner corresponding to a simplified Jacobian without the cross-derivative terms. The HNSE solver is verified by comparing with nonlinear parabolized stability equation results for the nonlinear evolution of planar waves in an incompressible Blasius boundary layer and in a Mach 6 flow over a blunt cone. Finally, nonlinear nonmodal results are presented for planar traveling disturbances over a blunt cone configuration with reduced transition factor as measured in wind-tunnel experiments. The nonmodal analysis demonstrates that entropy-layer disturbances generated close to the nose tip can seed the amplification of higher-frequency Mack’s second-mode instabilities farther downstream and hence can lead to a reduction in the transition factor.},

The Hopf bifurcation and dynamic responses of the hypersonic airfoil are performed. To analyze the reliability, the effects of stochasticity on the dynamic behaviors of the hypersonic airfoil model are discussed in detail. Several unwanted phenomena that result in the failure of the airfoil structure are induced by random fluctuations. Subsequently, the reliability of the airfoil model is defined and analyzed according to the first passage failure criteria. The effects of different parameters on the reliability are investigated. Furthermore, a nonlinear energy sink is introduced to suppress the vibration of the airfoil and enhance the reliability. Two-dimensional reliability regions of the airfoil model are given to provide the safety parameter region. The results show that the reliability of the airfoil model is significantly improved with the nonlinear energy sink.

This work presents a computational study of shock-boundary layer interaction (SBLI) at hypersonic Mach numbers. The objective is to accurately predict the separation bubble size for oblique shock impingement on a turbulent boundary layer and for two-dimensional axisymmetric cone-flare SBLI cases. We use the Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes method with an advanced shock-strength-dependent turbulence model. A recently developed transport equation-based shock sensor is employed to identify the location and strength of shock waves. The computational results are found to match experimental measurements of surface pressure and skin-friction coefficient for a series of test cases, highlighting the effects of Mach number, shock generator angle, and wall cooling on the size of the separation bubble. Results are also found to conform to the scaling of SBLI separation size found in the literature. This is one of the few such corroborations for hypersonic axisymmetric SBLI.},

  abstract     = {Various types of sensors are needed to monitor the health state of smart deep-space habitats. However, measured data can be affected by sensor faults, which influence the health management system and consequently the decision-making. In this paper, an unsupervised learning approach based on convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) is developed to detect anomalies in temperature and pressure sensors. The proposed method is systematically investigated using a habitat simulator (HabSim). Several illustrative examples are demonstrated in the nominal and hazardous states of the habitat, including micrometeorite impact and fire scenarios. The performance of the proposed method using CAEs is compared with that of existing methods using auto-associative neural networks (AANNs) and variational autoencoders. This comparison is based on typical evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, training time, and testing time. The effect of temperature–pressure coupling on the detection performance of CAEs and AANNs is explored by training different data-driven models, including one with temperature sensors, one with pressure sensors, and one with both temperature and pressure sensors. The effect of the number of faulty sensors on the performance of CAEs is studied, as with an increase in the number of faulty sensors, redundant information among the sensors is reduced. The capability of CAEs to change the number of sensors without redesigning the network architecture and retraining the neural network is investigated and demonstrated. The capabilities and limitations of the proposed solution are discussed.},

Appropriate safety controls are selected using hazard reduction precedence principles, prior experience, or by assessing their impact on residual risk (together with other factors like cost). We propose a control effectiveness metric as one way to systematically and consistently evaluate potential safety controls individually and thereby facilitate selecting a shortlist of potential controls for subsequent integrated evaluation. The control effectiveness metric considers a safety control’s availability when needed, the probability that its design is adequate in addressing the targeted hazard, the probability that the design will be implemented as intended, and the relationship between the time it takes for the safety control to address its target hazard and the time before the hazard propagates. We demonstrated the use of our metric on a lunar habitat design using a physics-based habitat simulator. High control effectiveness and safety controls result in a habitat with high resilience, while low control effectiveness results in lower resilience.},

Although exciting, these applications are a long way off from providing a “real-world” benefit, as they have only been theoretically explored or demonstrated in small-scale experiments. An outstanding challenge is to identify near-term use cases for quantum networks; this may be an intriguing new area of interest for the aerospace community, as the quantum networking field would benefit from more multidisciplinary collaborations. This paper introduces quantum networking, discusses the difficulties in distributing entanglement within these networks, highlights recent progress toward this endeavor, and features two current case studies on mobile quantum nodes and an entangled clock network, both of which are relevant to the aerospace community.},

The effects of copper foam pore size, thickness, installation length, and structure on the flame acceleration were studied experimentally, as were the effects of blockage ratio and mixture equivalence ratio. The results show that among the four pore sizes selected, the 10 PPI case produces the fastest flame development on the porous flat wall. For conditions with successful detonation, the 10 PPI case reduces the DDT distance and time by 34.97 and 42.57%, respectively, compared with the 40 PPI case. Regarding the installation length of copper foam, it is found that copper foam with a large pore size (10 PPI) and a short installation length achieves stable detonation. The general structure of copper foam was also analyzed, including the porous flat wall, porous obstacle, and solid obstacle with the same installation length. These three structures effectively accelerate the initiation of detonation. Particularly, porous obstacles show more pronounced effects on flame acceleration than the commonly used solid obstacles. These results are instructive for optimizing the short-distance ignition ability of pulsed detonation engines.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, surrogate models based on deep neural networks have been widely used to solve partial differential equations for fluid flow physics. This kind of model focuses on global interpolation of the training data and thus requires a large network structure. The process is both time consuming and computationally costly. In the present study, we develop a neural network with local converging input (NNLCI) for high-fidelity prediction using unstructured data. The framework uses the local domain of dependence with converging coarse solutions as input, thereby greatly reducing computational resource and training time. As a validation case, the NNLCI method is applied to study two-dimensional inviscid supersonic flows in channels with bumps. Different bump geometries and locations are examined to benchmark the effectiveness and versatility of this new approach. The NNLCI method can accurately and efficiently capture the structure and dynamics of the entire flowfield, including regions with shock discontinuities. For a new bump configuration, the method can perform prediction with only one neural network, eliminating the need for repeated training of multiple networks for different geometries. A saving of computing wall time is achieved by several orders of magnitude against the high-fidelity simulation with the same level of accuracy. The demand on training data is modest, and the training data can be allocated sparsely. These features are especially advantageous compared with conventional global-to-global deep learning methods and physics-informed methods.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation aircraft require the development and integration of a deal of innovative green technologies to meet the ambitious sustainability goals set for aviation. Those transformational efforts are associated with a tremendous increase in the complexity of the onboard systems and their multiphysics-coupled behaviors and dynamics. A critical aspect relates to the identification of the coupled faults resulting from the integration of those green technologies, which introduce damage identifiability issues and demand new approaches for the efficient and accurate identification of non-nominal fault conditions. Model-based fault detection and identification (FDI) methodologies have been proven essential to identify onboard the damages affecting the systems from physical signal acquisitions, but existing methods are typically computationally expensive and fail to capture incipient coupled faults, which prevents their adoption and scaling with the increasing complexity of novel multiphysics systems. This work introduces a multifidelity framework to accelerate the identification of fault modes affecting complex systems. An original two-stage compression computes an optimally informative and highly reduced representation of the monitoring signals for the minimum demand of onboard resources. A multifidelity scheme for Bayesian inversion is developed to infer multidomain fault parameters from the compressed signals: variable cost and fidelity models are optimally queried for a major reduction of the overall computational expense. The framework is demonstrated and validated for aerospace electromechanical actuators affected by incipient multimodal faults. Remarkable accelerations of the FDI procedure are observed, and the exact identification of the incipient fault condition was achieved one order of magnitude faster than with standard algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As the number of disciplines included in the multidisciplinary design-optimization process continues to increase, it is envisioned that some of the disciplinary tools will take the form of surrogate models, whereas others remain physics-based, depending on the requirements and stage of the design process. To simulate this in the context of an aerostructural optimization of an aircraft wing, the work presented herein features a high-fidelity aerodynamic flow solver, while a surrogate is employed to model the wing structure. This approach includes the evaluation of the sensitivities of both the aerodynamic and structural disciplines, using a coupled-adjoint formulation to enable gradient-based optimization. An important aspect of the method is that the surrogate is trained only once, prior to the optimization, and held fixed throughout. The surrogate in effect parameterizes the structural design process, and outputs the weight and stiffness of an optimized structure, given inputs of geometry parameters and sizing loads. To minimize the number of surrogate inputs and enable the representation of the entire structural design space, parameterized loads are used to build the surrogate. The method is applied to the optimization of the NASA Common Research Model, illustrating the effectiveness of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {The far-field noise and forces of a subscale two-blade rotor were measured in an anechoic wind tunnel for both hover and edgewise flight conditions. The mean thrust and torque coefficients increased with the edgewise advance ratio in relation to the hover coefficients. The tonal and broadband noise contributions were separated and analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. The sound pressure level (SPL) at the blade pass frequency (BPF) had the greatest contribution to the overall SPL, and the dominant broadband noise source changed from high-frequency trailing edge noise to midfrequency blade wake interaction noise with an increasing edgewise advance ratio. The tip Mach number scaling of the noise sources was examined and found to be highly dependent on the oncoming freestream velocity. The BPF SPL directivity showed a dependency on the advance ratio, with a peak magnitude below and upstream of the rotor’s retreating side. The broadband noise had a dipole directivity with a minimum in the rotor plane. The midfrequency broadband noise had signatures indicative of blade wake interaction noise, and the high-frequency noise had signatures indicative of amplitude modulated trailing edge noise. The results demonstrate the importance of unsteady loading noise and broadband noise for subscale urban air mobility rotors.},

The Particle-In-Cell and Monte Carlo Collision method was used to better understand plasma movement and find the ideal condition for the azimuthal current formation. The findings suggest that raising the voltage amplitude can improve the electric field’s penetration into the plasma, diminish the disparity between the azimuthal current’s maximum and minimum values, and consequently generate a more uniform size and distribution. Peak azimuthal current values are directly proportional to the ac frequency at frequencies above 100 MHz and inversely proportional to the frequency below 100 MHz. A rotating electric field that matches the background magnetic field could be produced by adjusting the phase difference among the two sets of antennas. And then the plasma is accelerated by the effect of to achieve a more favorable azimuthal current. The results also demonstrate that an appropriately sized and distributed azimuthal current benefits more from a magnetic field with a strength between 200 and 1000 G and a value that declines from the cross-section center to its periphery.},

Additionally, a physical understanding of the buffet suppression technique is important for preventing shock wave oscillations. In this study, we conducted zonal detached-eddy simulations to numerically investigate the effects of vortex generators (VGs) on buffet suppression and to discuss the differing flow characteristics of the SC(2)-0518 and OAT15A supercritical airfoils when the chordwise position of the VGs is varied. The results for both airfoils equipped with VGs demonstrated significant suppression of large-scale lift oscillations across all calculation steps. VGs placed at 10% of the chord from the leading edge produced higher time-averaged lift coefficients for both airfoils, with the OAT15A airfoil showing a particularly notable 2.5% improvement in lift coefficient, leading to a 0.82% increase in ratio. The visualized results indicated that the interaction between the shock wave and VGs leads to variations in the separation point, depending on the VG chordwise position. This separation is affected by the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil shapes and the wake induced by the VGs, ultimately resulting in changes to the lift coefficient.},

Early automatic detection of the onset of buffet from simulation data is a necessary step in optimization algorithms used to design new aircraft geometries. We use the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) eigenvalues to detect the onset of buffet from transient simulations of the OAT15A airfoil across a range of angles of attack. During transients, different eigenvalues may be expressed at different times, and we process shorter segments of the data (sliding windows) in order to obtain robust, time-varying estimates of frequency of oscillation and decay/growth rates. We demonstrate that the onset of oscillation can be identified by analyzing DMD eigenvalues, and that physically different mechanisms of oscillation can additionally be identified from spatial profiles associated with DMD modes. The dominant buffeting modes can be detected through DMD before they become apparent in the physically relevant quantities, such as the coefficient of lift. We expect that such early detection of the onset of buffet could reduce the computational burden of aircraft design and expand the feasible design space.},

  abstract     = {A two-element natural laminar flow airfoil—commonly used on medium-altitude, long-endurance, unmanned air vehicles—was conformally decambered for application on a two-bladed, H-rotor, vertical-axis wind turbine. Blade kinematics were used to determine the virtual camber line, which was then used to conformally map the original profile onto the chord line. Both decambered and original blade profiles were evaluated experimentally using large chord-radius ratios (0.6 and 0.75) that exploited dynamic stall to produce the driving torque. Decambered blades showed substantially greater power and torque coefficients than the original blades, up to 60 and 27%, respectively, which represents the first experimental validation of conformal decambering. Relatively large peak power coefficients of 0.28 were attained, despite maximum chord-based Reynolds numbers being less than . Depending upon the chord-radius ratio, either light or deep dynamic stall occurred in the second upstream quadrant, and the flap flow remained attached virtually throughout. In contrast, on the original profiles, massive separation was observed on the blades, and the flap flow remained separated due to assumed outer surface flow separation. Future research should consider surface pressure and flowfield measurements, significantly higher Reynolds numbers, and variable intracycle flap deflection mechanisms to optimize performance and minimize unsteady loads.},

All flow cases show an increase in drag compared to the smooth wall.

Estimating the momentum coefficient accurately through experiments is challenging. Several approaches exist to estimate the momentum coefficient in laboratory conditions. However, the question arises as to whether these models hold as ambient and supply conditions change during operation in flight. Therefore, computational fluidic dynamic (CFD) simulations were carried out on two exemplary AFC actuators (i.e., a fluidic oscillator and a steady jet nozzle) in a quiescent environment with supply pressure ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4; supply temperatures at 293, 550, and 800 K; and ambient altitude conditions at sea level and 10 km. When scaled with , the mass flow for different conditions collapses as a function of the pressure ratio. Furthermore, the momentum coefficient collapses when scaled with . The existing models to calculate the momentum coefficient hold for changing ambient and supply conditions. Therefore, these models, in conjunction with scaling parameters, can be employed during the operation of an AFC system in flight with changing conditions in order to provide the desired momentum output.

  abstract     = {There has been a growing interest in utilizing flared folding wingtips as an in-flight load alleviation device to enable increased wing spans that meet airport gate limits but with little increase in wing weight. The semi-aeroelastic hinge (SAH) concept is implemented in high-aspect-ratio wings to enable wingtips to be released during severe load cases such as maneuvers and gusts to alleviate the bending moments while maintaining optimum aerodynamic shape for the rest of the flight. In this paper, scaling methods for wings incorporating the SAH are explored, allowing for the development of equivalent scaled unmanned aerial vehicles or wind tunnel models with similar aeroelastic behavior as full-size aircraft. Three scaling approaches are considered in this study, namely, Iso-Froude, Iso-Frequency, and Iso-Strain, where a set of governing nondimensional quantities and scaling factors are determined. Despite the significant nonlinearities resulting from large wingtip fold angles, it is shown that a linear scaling approach can be appropriate for such a wing configuration. Furthermore, the aeroelastic properties of each scaled model are compared to those of the full-scale model, where the best match was obtained from the Iso-Strain model, although it is challenging to meet the required operational conditions.},

This study introduces an innovative approach for rapid buffet-onset prediction. A machine-learning flowfield prediction model was pretrained on a large database and then deployed offline to replace the simulations in the buffet prediction process for new airfoil designs. Unlike using a model to directly predict buffet onset, the proposed technique offers better visualization capabilities by providing users with intuitive flowfield outputs. It also demonstrates superior generalization ability, as evidenced by a 32.5% reduction in the average buffet-onset prediction error on the testing dataset. This method was used to optimize the buffet performance of 11 distinct airfoils within and outside the training dataset. The optimization results were verified with simulations and proved to yield improved samples across all cases. It was affirmed that the pretrained flowfield prediction model can be applied to accelerate aerodynamic shape optimization, but further work is still needed to raise its reliability for this safety-critical task.},

Backward-facing step flows have many flow features of gas turbine combustors (recirculation, impingement, and boundary-layer development), but in a two-dimensional, nonproprietary geometry. Reynolds number, gas temperature, and plate temperature were varied as heat flux was measured in different regions of the flow. Measurements were made using a heat flux sensor and radiometer, which measure total and radiative heat flux, respectively. The highest total heat flux was measured at the impingement location and the lowest in the recirculation zone. Separating the total heat flux into the radiative and convective components is not straightforward and requires simulations of the experiment. Spectrally resolved Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations are used to scale the radiative heat flux measurements for the separation of convective and radiative heat flux from the total heat flux measurements. These calculations show that only about 30% of incident radiation is captured by the radiometer due to spectral differences between the two sensors. Once the radiation measurement is corrected, experimental results show higher radiative than convective heat transfer at low Reynolds numbers , highlighting the impact of radiative heat transfer in hot gas environments.},

Using NASA’s Moon to Mars Architecture requirements for surface habitation and accounting for the midterm/long-term mission duration, a framework for vulnerability assessment is developed for essential nonstructural elements (NSEs) inside an inflatable habitat subjected to moonquakes. The aim of this study is to develop an approach to assess the vulnerability of typical NSEs that support essential equipment, such as the environmental control and life support system, under a paucity of information related to the seismic hazard. We also emphasize that the launch dynamic environment and lunar seismic environment exhibit notable differences in their characteristics, which can lead to higher lateral acceleration levels than initially expected. This acceleration may be linked to high-occurrence seismic events. However, due to the lack of information regarding the frequency of these events, the risk of NSEs being subjected to unforeseen loads increases. It is imperative to equip future lunar habitats with seismic mitigation measures until additional seismometers are deployed near upcoming surface human outposts.},

To enhance the existing numerical simulation of membrane deployment, the nonlinear behavior of the crease is finely described based on experiments and integrated into the numerical model via the principle of virtual work. Specifically, a foldable membrane is modeled as a multibody system (MBS) based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF), where the flexible facet is meshed with both ANCF triangular and quadrilateral thin shell elements and the crease is treated as a virtual torsional spring with special constraints along the fold line. The MBS modeling method is validated via the deployment experiment of a Z-folding membrane. The deployment of a four-unit Miura-ori membrane is further analyzed to show the capability of the approach in modeling foldable membranes with complicated configurations. Good agreement is obtained on the membrane-deformed configurations between the simulation and experiment. Additionally, the driving force at the corners is obtained.

  abstract     = {Short-glass-fiber-reinforced adhesives are state-of-the-art materials used in the bond lines of wind turbine blades. Various alignments of the short fibers are emerging, which depend on the adhesive flow during the application and joining processes. This induces a spectrum of direction-dependent mechanical properties. The tensile strength, for instance, can vary by about 20% depending on the load direction. Therefore, the adhesive performance, which is normally determined under controlled laboratory conditions and implemented in bond line design routines, can deviate from the in situ application. This work investigates the effect of the short-fiber alignment on the tensile strength distribution of an industry-standard adhesive used in wind turbine rotor blades. The smeared short-fiber orientation of the tensile specimens tested is estimated locally near the damaged surface using a material model that is fed with thermomechanical measurements and calibrated via micro-computed-tomography analysis. A linear correlation between tensile strength and short-fiber alignment has been identified. This augments the identification of the material’s upper and lower strength limits for bond line design purposes.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging neural networks as surrogate models for turbulence simulation is a topic of growing interest. At the same time, embodying the inherent uncertainty of simulations in the predictions of surrogate models remains very challenging. The present study makes a first attempt to use denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to train an uncertainty-aware surrogate model for turbulence simulations. Due to its prevalence, the simulation of flows around airfoils with various shapes, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack is chosen as the learning objective. Our results show that DDPMs can successfully capture the whole distribution of solutions and, as a consequence, accurately estimate the uncertainty of the simulations. The performance of DDPMs is also compared with varying baselines in the form of Bayesian neural networks and heteroscedastic models. Experiments demonstrate that DDPMs outperform the other methods regarding a variety of accuracy metrics. Besides, it offers the advantage of providing access to the complete distributions of uncertainties rather than providing a set of parameters. As such, it can yield realistic and detailed samples from the distribution of solutions.},

A three-dimensional flow structure is observed within the recirculation zones of reacting and nonreacting cases; the structure includes both the “spanwise” vortices that extend the length of the recirculation zone and “corner vortex structures” that are situated adjacent to the bluff-body trailing edge and spanwise walls. The corner vortex structures enhance the mixing and residence times of fluid inside the recirculation zone. Fluid is circulated between the spanwise vortices and corner vortex structures. Corner vortex structures always appear downstream (relative to the local flow) of the boundary-layer separation location on the spanwise walls within the recirculation zone, and they are absent when boundary-layer formation on the spanwise walls is prevented. Laminar boundary-layer theory predicts the boundary-layer separation locations within of the calculated values from the large-eddy simulations in all but one case. These results suggest that 1) boundary-layer separation on the spanwise walls is a necessary condition for the formation of corner vortex structures, and 2) boundary-layer separation on the spanwise walls is caused by an adverse pressure gradient in the recirculation zone.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed air vehicles in urban environments will have flights during terminal operations that are dominated by strong transient aerodynamics. These vehicles are not only lighter and smaller than traditional rotorcraft and helicopters, but in many instances they may be hybrid configurations with lifting surfaces similar to those of fixed-wing aircraft. These differences require further understanding of the physics of these transient aerodynamics, specifically large-amplitude transverse gusts and the resulting vehicle response, where classic indicial theory is no longer valid. This is crucial to the safety and certification of these air vehicles near buildings and populations. Prior efforts identified that gust responses depart from traditional linear theory when the leading-edge vortex (LEV) forms as a distinct feature and departs from the lifting surface, resulting in flow nonlinearities. This paper expands our understanding of the interactional physics of these nonlinear transverse gusts with flow separation. LEV and trailing-edge vortex (TEV) behavior are correlated, and these vortex interactions are studied to understand the impact on flow separation and subsequent aerodynamic behavior. Larger gust ratios are observed to increase the LEV normal translation, while flow separation is driven by the location and magnitude of the TEV.},

In order to distinguish how each single phenomenon contributes toward shock attenuation, the National Cheng Kung University shock tube is simulated for driver and test (driver–test) gas pairs involving air–air and He–air. For low pressure ratios, the diaphragm effect was found to be negligible. For a pressure ratio of 200 and helium as driver gas, the shock speed was found to decrease linearly with the size of the diaphragm orifice. In general, wall viscous effects caused a 2.5% decrease in shock speed, while an additional 7% reduction was caused by the presence of the diaphragm. The gradual opening of the diaphragm mainly contributed to a decrease in shock oscillations.},

Despite recent developments, complex phenomena such as high-Reynolds-number (high-) flow remain a modeling challenge without the use of high-fidelity inputs. In this study, a low-fidelity-influenced physics-informed neural network (LF-PINN) is proposed as a surrogate aerodynamic analysis model for inverse airfoil shape design at . The LF-PINN is developed in a hybrid approach using low-fidelity flowfields approximated from a viscous-inviscid coupled airfoil analysis tool (mfoil) and physics residuals from the steady, incompressible, two-dimensional Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. The approach is designed to alleviate offline computational costs by avoiding high-fidelity simulations and sustain predicting accuracy using corrections by the physics residuals. The LF-PINN is able to correct the low-fidelity flowfield quantities toward the ground truth, with a mean improvement of about 19% in pressure and about 5% in total velocity based on Euclidean distance comparisons. Evaluation of the airfoil surface pressure coefficient distributions shows corrections by the LF-PINN at the suction peak, which largely contributes to lifting forces. Inverse airfoil shape design is conducted using target distributions in the objective function, whereby the LF-PINN can approach the expected target shapes while reducing online computational time by at least an order of magnitude compared to direct airfoil analysis tools.},

Wall-modeled LES of a periodic sector and a 360-deg full fan stage have been performed at approach conditions, which is a relevant operating point for aircraft noise certifications. The fan noise is directly obtained from the fully compressible LES, using a well-refined unstructured mesh, and compared with state-of-the-art analytical models. The impact of the periodic boundary conditions, which are often used for high-fidelity simulations of turbofan engines, is assessed. The results from the 360-deg and periodic-sector LES are compared from aerodynamic and acoustic perspectives, including an analysis of the mean and turbulent flow quantities and sound-pressure spectra. Aerodynamic parameters show similar results for both configurations. However, the fan blade loading is slightly reduced in the 360-deg- LES near the blade tip. Acoustically, lower sound power levels at the intake and exhaust sections of the fan stage are obtained in the 360-deg LES, when compared to the periodic sector LES, particularly at low and middle frequencies. This can be associated with lower coherence levels in the fan wakes and smaller spanwise correlation lengths at the trailing edge of the blades. The modal content of the acoustic field has also been analyzed in detail and shows that the periodic sector LES cannot correctly simulate the modal content of the fan noise.},

Furthermore, this wall-modeling method is formulated to lessen the near-wall grid resolution requirements by, below the log layer, making the eddy viscosity approach a constant, nonzero value and the velocity varying approximately linearly with distance from the wall. Using output-based mesh adaptation, this new wall-modeling method is compared to standard Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS-SA). It is shown that this wall model results in accurate predictions of quantities of interest such as aerodynamic coefficients, surface pressure and temperature, skin friction, and heat transfer compared with RANS-SA, while requiring substantially less near-wall grid.},

Engines are one of the two main sources of noise generated by aircraft, with fan noise, in particular, being of concern due to its broadband and tonal contributions. Small and lightweight methods of addressing both broadband and tonal noise are necessary due to the limitations presented by the current engine design. Presented in this paper is a novel acoustic metamaterial that has undergone design optimization for broadband noise reduction. The final design was produced using 3D printing and tested using the Advanced Noise Control Fan at the University of Notre Dame.

Mathematically viable boundary conditions of the Poisson equation, which computes the AWE-PO source, are investigated. For the different source fields, the wave propagation is computed using the AWE-PO, and the details of the sound prediction results are compared to a reference direct numerical simulation of a mixing layer. The different boundary conditions of the Poisson equation were found to have a minor influence on the overall sound prediction characteristics of the AWE-PO equation. The AWE-PO is reformulated into a simplified version of the Phillips’s equation, which mitigates the intermediate step of computing an isotropic source potential. By doing so, a previously obtained interference radiation valley in the radiated acoustic intensity of the AWE-PO results is attributed to a missing shear-noise source term.},

Efficient atomization within the short residence times of liquid-fueled supersonic combustors is crucial for maximizing combustion efficiency. Initial investigations in a quiescent environment aimed to isolate the impact of injector geometry and temperature, utilizing quantitative analysis and diffused backlit illumination to demonstrate that heating fuel beyond its boiling point significantly enhances atomization and dispersion. A notable finding is that higher ratios led to a quicker initiation of flash boiling. Subsequent analyses under supersonic crossflow, using two-dimensional planar laser-induced fluorescence, support these observations. The study further employs spray structure and spatiotemporal characteristic analyses, coefficient of variation, and proper orthogonal decomposition, revealing enhanced flashing atomization at higher ratios. This underscores the critical role of injector design and temperature in optimizing fuel atomization in scramjet engines, highlighting the nuanced interplay between physical injector characteristics and thermal properties in achieving efficient combustion.},

  abstract     = {State feedback is mostly used in the active vibration control of structural systems. However, the most challenging problem is to achieve the whole state of the structure. Another issue in active vibration control is that, in many cases, only some particular modes need to be controlled, while the other modes can remain unchanged in order to save on the costs of the control. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a state-observing method and conducts a non-spillover partial pole placement control using a multistep method. Using the finite element method, the electromechanical coupling equations of motion of the beam are formulated. The reduced finite element model is then obtained by using the system equivalent reduction expansion process method. Introducing the real measurements by sensors and applying the local corresponding principle, the modes of the structural system are corrected, which are then utilized to predict all the degrees of freedom without measuring by sensors. Then, the non-spillover partial pole placement based on the state feedback is conducted using the multistep method. The optimal locations of actuators are derived by the genetic algorithm to control the specific structural modes effectively. The numerical simulations and experimental studies are also carried out.},

Various turbulence models of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are analyzed. A modified version of the transitional model was developed to enhance stall prediction accuracy for high-lift configurations with a nacelle chine. The vortex generator, three-element airfoil, and high-lift model are numerically simulated. The results reveal that implementing a model with the separation shear layer fixed notably enhances the stall prediction behavior for both the three-element airfoil and high-lift configuration without affecting the prediction of the vortex strength of a vortex generator. Moreover, incorporating rotation correction into the SPF model improves the prediction of vortex strength and further enhances stall prediction for the high-lift configuration. The relative error in predicting the maximum lift coefficient is less than 5% of the experimental data. The study also investigated the impact of the nacelle chine on the stall behavior of the high-lift configuration. The results demonstrate that the chine vortex can mitigate the adverse effects of the nacelle/pylon vortex system and increase the maximum lift coefficient.},

  abstract     = {The investigation of flow separation control over a NACA 0015 airfoil model using a fluidic oscillator (FO) is conducted through delayed detached eddy simulation. First, the flowfield within and outside an FO operating in quiescent air is resolved simultaneously. The oscillation of the jet flow induced by the FO is attributed to the cyclic expansion and contraction of the recirculation bubbles located near the two Coanda surfaces in the mixing chamber. Significantly, the predicted jet oscillation frequency closely matches the experimental data, validating the accuracy of our findings. Next, the FO is integrated into an airfoil model to suppress the flow separation. The airfoil is under deep stall conditions, with angles of attack of 20 and 17° and a Reynolds number of . The key driving force for flow reattachment is the spanwise vortices induced by the oscillating jet, which substantially enhance the mixing between the separated flow and the external high-momentum flow. Consequently, the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil is notably improved. Additionally, both spectral and dynamic mode decomposition analyses indicate that the flow, under the influence of the FO forcing, becomes more orderly and well-organized and is effectively locked into the forcing frequency.},

To accomplish this, a Gaussian process model is developed using Bayesian optimization to efficiently sample possible cycles to minimize run-time. To allow the use of conventional optimization methods, we developed fractional smoothing steps, moving the optimization from a discrete space to a continuous space. Initially, a static, offline, approach was developed, and optimal cycles were found for two flow past cylinder test cases with and ; however, when exchanging optimal cycles between the different test cases, there was significant degradation in speedup. Toward this, a dynamic, online, approach was developed where cycles are optimized during a simulation. The performance of the resulting optimal cycles gave a similar speedup to the offline approach while achieving a net reduction in run-time. Again testing the optimization strategy on the flow past a cylinder, this yielded candidates with mean speedups of and , respectively.

Based on such analysis, a controlling function is employed to control the numerical dissipation in the momentum equations at low speeds, and the All-Speed MuSIC2 (AMuSIC2) scheme is proposed in curvilinear coordinates. Systematic numerical tests are illustrated. The one-dimensional cases show that the AMuSIC2 scheme is capable of accurately capturing one-dimensional shocks, expansion waves, and contact discontinuities. The two-dimensional odd–even decoupling case indicates that the AMuSIC2 scheme is robust against the unphysical shock anomaly in capturing strong shocks. The spherical blast wave case indicates that the AMuSIC2 scheme improves the traditional one-dimensional Riemann solvers’ mesh imprinting phenomenon as the MuSIC2 scheme. The two-dimensional inviscid flow over the NACA0012 airfoil case and the low-speed Gresho vortex case suggest that the AMuSIC2 scheme improves the MuSCI2 scheme’s accuracy at low speeds remarkably. The turbulent flow over the flat plate case and the turbulent flow past the NACA4412 airfoil case also suggest that the AMuSIC2 scheme has a much higher level of accuracy at low speeds than its counterpart.},

An optimization framework was developed to identify the optimal solution by exploring the low-dimensional subspace generated by the trained autoencoder. To demonstrate the convergence, stability, and reliability of the ROM, a subsonic inverse design problem and a transonic drag minimization problem of the airfoil were studied and validated using two different parameterization strategies. The robustness and accuracy demonstrated by the method suggest that it is valuable in parametric studies, such as aerodynamic design and optimization, and requires only a small fraction of the cost of full-order modeling.},

The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of surface pressure, with the basis extracted from simulation data and the basis coefficients determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of optimal sensor locations, which are obtained by using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The nonlinear term is an artificial neural network that is trained to bridge the gap between the DEIM prediction and the ground truth, especially when only low-fidelity simulation data are available. The model is tested on numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a two-dimensional NACA0015 airfoil and numerical simulation data of the dynamic stall of a three-dimensional drone.

  abstract     = {To predict the deformation and aerodynamic performance of a passive morphing airfoil with a novel compliant structure, aeroelastic simulation methods were developed. The static aeroelastic problem was solved by loosely coupling a finite-element-method solver and a hierarchical Cartesian grid-based flow solver. The viscous effect was investigated by comparing the results of using the Euler and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations in the aerodynamic simulations. The accuracies of the structural and aerodynamic solvers were validated through structural and wind-tunnel experiments, respectively. The deformation predicted by the RANS-based aeroelastic simulation was in accordance with the experimental results, while the Euler-based aeroelastic simulation predicted a larger deformation. The lift slope of the morphing airfoil improved more than that of the rigid airfoil, showing consistency with the experimental results. The comparative study showed that the viscous flow condition leads to a smaller aerodynamic load and deformation of the morphing airfoil.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the interaction of an impinging shock wave with a supersonic turbulent boundary layer over several distinct and permanently deformed surfaces, resulting in differences in the shock–boundary-layer interaction and the surface acoustic loading. High-order numerical simulations featuring two-dimensional surface deformations typically encountered in experiments are performed. The deformation amplitudes are up to half the incoming turbulent boundary-layer thickness. The results show that the high-pressure region about the shock impingement is significantly altered and can become narrower or wider depending on the local surface inclination of the deformed panel mode. The surface curvature is found to not significantly affect the separation and reattachment locations of the recirculation bubble. The power spectrum analysis of the pressure fluctuations along the panel’s midspan, where the surface attains the largest deformation amplitude, exhibits a rich and varied response. The pressure power spectrum is amplified in all of the surface deformation modes examined, with the magnitude of the amplification varying in the frequency domain, depending on the location and mode.},

  abstract     = {This work is a numerical and experimental study of transonic panel flutter. Two configurations were explored: clean and pinned geometry. The former is a panel clamped on all sides, while the configuration with pin also includes an additional constraint in the middle of the panel. This case study was inspired by the skin-panel design used for Skylon, a single-stage-to-orbit concept vehicle. In Skylon, a series of discrete supports are used to stiffen thinner skin panels to maximize the payload; thus, there is a need to explore the dynamic stability of this configuration also in the transonic regime. To this end, a panel clamped on all sides and with a pin in the center was tested in the transonic wind tunnel, where time-accurate displacement measurements were performed using laser sensors. From the analysis of experiments and numerical simulations, transonic flutter appeared to be a one-way type of interaction, where the aerodynamic pressure characteristic is not affected by the structure deformation. This is due to small panel displacements, typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the panel thickness. Higher natural modes, with a frequency close to the aerodynamic fluctuating pressure, are directly excited. Generally, the additional constraint in the center does not seem to add significant benefits in terms of dynamic stability in the transonic regime. A numerical parametric study showed that for external Mach numbers ranging approximately between 0.8 and 1.2, flutter oscillation amplitude is the largest for low Mach speeds.},

To extend the capability of FFVHC-ACE to transonic flow simulations with shock waves, a hybrid kinetic energy and entropy preserving/upwind scheme is implemented in FFVHC-ACE. To validate the employed simulation framework, the flow around the NASA Common Research Model in the near-cruise condition is simulated. In this case, the surface pressure distributions and force coefficients are reasonably predicted and show the trend of grid convergence. Furthermore, the WMLES at the buffet conditions reproduces the wavy structures of the shock wave (i.e., buffet cells) propagating outboard. The obtained propagation speed of the buffet cells and surface pressure spectra show reasonable agreement with the wind tunnel experiments.},

  abstract     = {Boundary-layer transition in the wake of a discrete roughness element results in a turbulent wedge that can adversely affect aerodynamic performance. Even when surfaces are designed for laminar flow, roughness that accumulates near the leading edge can cause premature transition and degrade performance. One approach for mitigating such transition is to place small spanwise-oriented shielding strips upstream or downstream of potential roughness elements accumulation sites. Shielding strips have been shown to be effective at eliminating transition in zero-pressure-gradient, flat-plate boundary layers. This work documents the shielding performance near the leading edge of an NACA 63(3)-418 airfoil where the pressure gradient is strongly favorable. Infrared thermography is used to evaluate the laminar or turbulent state of the boundary layer behind multiple roughness elements with and without shielding strips. The performance of various upstream and downstream shielding configurations is evaluated, as well as the performance improvement of combining these two strategies simultaneously. Direct numerical simulations provide validation and additional insight into the mechanisms responsible for the shielding phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {The laminar–turbulent transition of a supersonic boundary layer induced by an isolated roughness element is investigated using direct numerical simulation, BiGlobal linear stability theory, and the three-dimensional parabolized stability equation. Cylindrical and diamond-shaped roughness elements are investigated in combination with different wall temperatures. Direct numerical simulations show that the cylinder configuration induces an earlier transition than the diamond configuration, with the interaction between the separated shear layer and the counter-rotating vortices causing the transition. BiGlobal analysis and the parabolized stability equation confirm the existence of two unstable instability modes in the wake region, namely, a symmetric mode and an antisymmetric mode, with the former being strongly dominant. The wall cooling and heating effects are studied by changing the wall temperature. Wall heating lifts the inlet boundary layer and weakens the separated shear layer. This, in turn, weakens the wake instability and delays the transition. The antisymmetric model disappears as the wall heating increases. Wall cooling accelerates the transition by enhancing the distortion of the roughness wake, resulting in stronger instabilities. Finally, the Reynolds number based on the momentum defect is used to define the transition criterion, and this is found to be in good agreement with the present simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Under random-interval mixed uncertainties of structures, failure-probability upper-bound function (FPUBF), which varies with the distribution parameters of random inputs, can not only provide the influence of distribution parameters on the failure-probability upper bound (FPUB), but also contribute to decoupling a reliability-based design optimization model. Although FPUBF can be estimated by repeatedly evaluating FPUBs at different distribution parameter realizations, it suffers from unaffordable computational cost resulting from this double-loop framework. To address this issue, this paper proposes a single-loop sampling strategy (SL) to estimate FPUBF at arbitrary realizations in the interested distribution parameter region. Instead of the huge computational cost of a double-loop framework, the SL estimates the entire FPUBF only by one simulation analysis. Moreover, importance sampling (IS) variance reduction technique is introduced, and a single-loop IS probability density function (PDF), or SL-IS-PDF, is constructed to more efficiently estimate FPUBF by reducing the required size of the candidate sample pool. For approximating the optimal SL-IS-PDF and identifying the states of candidate samples efficiently, the double-loop adaptive Kriging model of performance function is introduced to further reduce the number of performance function evaluations. A numerical example and two composite structure examples are employed to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and feasibility of the proposed methods.},

Machine-learning techniques have been proven to be effective and practical to accomplish such nonintuitive design tasks. This paper proposes an inverse design framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) to explore and optimize two-dimensional metamaterial designs consisting of spinodal topologies, called spinodoids. CGANs are capable of solving the many-to-many inverse problem, which requires generating a group of geometric patterns of representative volume elements with target combinations of mechanical properties. The performance of the networks was validated by numerical simulations with the finite element method. The proposed inverse design framework vastly improves the efficiency of design exploration and optimization of spinodoid metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {The structural safety factor is an essential parameter in aircraft design, representing the ratio of the design load to the operating load. Traditional design methods rely on subjective determination of safety factor values based on experience, lacking objectivity in quantifying uncertainty. However, with advancements in aircraft design technology and increasing competition in the commercial space market, new-generation hypersonic aircraft with complex load environments require a more optimal approach. Applying a uniform safety factor to each component within subregions of the aircraft leads to overly conservative results and impacts flight performance. To address this limitation, a design scheme that incorporates subregional, differentiated safety factors is necessary. This approach allows for better material utilization and ensures compliance with safety requirements. This paper utilizes reliability-based design optimization theory to consider uncertainty in structural systems. It establishes a mapping relationship between structural reliability and differentiated safety factors, providing safety under uncertainty while guaranteeing weight reduction. Additionally, this paper develops a subregional, differentiated safety factors distribution program to determine the safety factors of different subregions of the structure. Consequently, a refined subregional differentiated safety factors scheme that balances safety and economy is derived.},

First, a measurement system is developed to quasi-statically quantify the deployment torque of the structural models that failed to complete deployment after long-term storage and fell into an undesirable equilibrium shape. The measurement results confirm that the deployment torque decreases with long-term storage of the structure, and the torque in the deployment direction becomes negative at the deployment angle of the undesirable equilibrium shape. Therefore, as the second contribution, design modifications are made to the boom and membrane, and quasi-static and dynamic deployment tests are employed to evaluate their effects. The deployment reliability evaluation method and two design updates proposed herein will contribute to future space demonstrations and the utilization of lightweight membrane deployment structures with high packaging efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This research examines how ductility affects the durability of lunar surface structures against recurring disturbances like moonquakes, micrometeorite impacts, and thermal cycles over an extended period. The structural performance at various levels of ductility was determined by adjusting material parameters and the thickness of a reference multilayered dome structure. Moonquake and micrometeorite impact-induced lateral displacements were estimated using a reduced-order model under a control-oriented dynamic computational modeling framework. The study considered the degradation of the metallic dome’s strength properties over time due to thermal cycles. Fragility curves were generated by assessing the likelihood of reaching three predefined damage levels as a result of multiple hazards. Additionally, a discounted cash flow analysis was conducted to incorporate a financial aspect into the performance comparison. The findings revealed that structures with sufficient ductility capacity have a lower probability of sustaining severe damage or collapsing within a shorter time frame. Hence, having ductile structures in lunar environments is advantageous as it allows the postponement of maintenance and repair actions, thereby conserving scarce resources for more urgent tasks. Moreover, the financial analysis demonstrated that lunar habitats with higher ductile capacities result in larger net present values, offering a higher return on the initial investment.},

  abstract     = {An efficient, fully decoupled approach is proposed to solve the structural reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problem. The proposed approach utilizes augmented space integral and importance sampling (ASI-IS) to efficiently evaluate a functional relationship between the probability of failure and the design parameters, namely the so-called failure probability function. ASI-IS allows for the avoidance of both the intractable density fitting task associated with augmented space methods and the time-consuming repeated reliability evaluations associated with surrogate model approaches. The resulting functional relationship can be used to completely decouple the original RBDO problem into a deterministic one. Then, an iteration mechanism is constructed with gradually smaller design domains to enhance the efficiency of the optimization process. Furthermore, a sample reuse algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the proposed approach by collecting the samples generated in previous iterations and reusing them in the current iteration in order to produce a better estimator of the failure probability function. Numerical and engineering examples, including a turbine blade and an aircraft inner flap, are given to demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

In this study, a high-temperature test module in a supersonic wind tunnel with integrated various test systems was independently designed to systematically investigate the thermal mechanical damage evolution of CMCs used in astronautics applications under high-temperature transient conditions. Furthermore, a numerical method for fluid-heat-solid coupling based on an iterative solution strategy was developed and compared with an algorithm based on a wall modification strategy in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Besides, a comparative analysis was conducted with the temperature field distribution of the sample obtained in the hypersonic wind tunnel integration test to verify the correctness of the developed thermal-fluid-solid coupling calculation method. Finally, through thermoelastic coupling computational models, the high-thermal-gradient-induced thermomechanical damage mechanism of the CMCs was revealed, providing support for further optimizing the material system and thermal structure design of the CMCs.},

However, they must also be mechanically robust and damage tolerant to fully realize their potential. Currently, it is costly and time-consuming for testing under service conditions, therefore, computational models are a good path forward. Due to the inherent microstructural stochasticity of these structures, however, their behavior is difficult to effectively model without detailed experimental studies for validation and benchmarking. To that end this study investigates the mechanical properties of a porous carbon fiber network and ties together the global macroscopic observations to the local mesoscale behaviors dictated by individual fibers and fiber junctions. Strain localization was observed using digital image correlation (DIC) and tied to features within the macroscopic stress–strain plots. Work to quantify the impact of the addition of complex geometries (e.g., cracks and through-holes) on mechanical reliability was conducted. The defects resulted in distinct macroscale mechanical characteristics and mesoscale deformation behaviors, depending on defect type and loading orientation. These results provide broad experimental data to inform and validate modeling approaches to accurately predict and tailor the reliability of porous parts under service conditions.},

This paper proposes a novel method to solve the transient thermal field of the thin-walled cross section of beams in outer space. High-order beam elements are derived by means of the Carrera unified formulation (CUF), where the longitudinal direction of the beam is discretized by one-dimensional two-node and four-node elements, whereas arbitrary high-order expansion functions are used for the description of the temperature expansion within the cross section. The governing differential equations of the transient temperature field are derived according to the transient thermal conduction theory and the weighted residual method. The solution of the initial value problem for ordinary differential equations is obtained through the application of the Adams–Bashforth method, leading to the determination of the transient thermal field. In order to demonstrate the accuracy of the temperature results, a convergence analysis is conducted. Finally, temperature distributions within the cross section and along the longitudinal direction of the model are discussed to show the effects of several factors, including material properties, angle of solar radiation, and shadows induced by the shelter of other components.},

The characteristics of mixing and combustion of methane–oxygen flames are experimentally investigated in nonreacting and reacting cases by varying the outer-to-middle velocity ratio from 1.1 to 5.7. In the nonreacting cases, acetone–planar-laser-induced fluorescence technology is applied to experimentally study the mixing behavior near the nozzle exit. Since the coaxial dual-shear configuration generates a sandwich structure, a flow structure near the exit, including three potential cores and three mixing layers, is established. Two mixture fraction fields divided by a critical velocity ratio are observed, in which the stoichiometric contours have different appearances. Based on the mixing characteristics, a mixing model and a linear scaling relation were presented to predict the stoichiometric mixing length in both nonreacting and reacting flows. Besides, the coaxial dual-shear jets yield more compact flames in cases of , while the conventional coaxial jets produce longer flames with yellow tips. This shows the improvement of the coaxial dual-shear nozzle in mixing and combustion efficiency due to the formation of two shear layers near the nozzle exit. Furthermore, the OH* distribution indicates that the coaxial dual-shear flames produce a lower thermal load on the nozzle, preventing the combustor from experiencing the hazards of ablation.},

The change in the kernel area caused by the jet velocities is less than 1.5%. An increase of the bulk velocity by 190% decreases the ignition kernel temperature by 6%.

High-speed imaging of the flow luminescence and wall pressure measurements were performed simultaneously. Four different combustion modes (scram mode, scram-ram transition, ram mode, and unstart) were observed by altering the global equivalence ratio. Time-resolved measurements revealed that the mode transitions for the perisymmetric model occurred earlier than the axisymmetric model. The instantaneous data showed transient phenomena such as upstream flame propagation in the combustor, reverse flame propagation into the isolators, and the propagation of the pseudo-shock. In addition, an inlet buzz was observed for the perisymmetric model. The time-resolved high-speed images and the pressure data revealed that inlet unstart and restart repeatedly occurred during the inlet buzz.

  abstract     = {We present a steady jet-flow-based flow control of flexible membrane wings for the adaptive and efficient motion of bat-inspired drones in complex flight environments. A body-fitted variational computational aeroelastic framework is adopted for the modeling of fluid–structure interactions. High-momentum jet flows are injected from the leading edge and transported to the wake flows to alter the aerodynamic performance and the membrane vibration. The coupled dynamic effect of active jet flow control on membrane performance is systematically explored. While the results indicate that the current active flow control strategy performs well at low angles of attack, its effectiveness degrades at high angles of attack with large flow separation. To understand the coupling mechanism, the variations of the vortex patterns are examined by the proper orthogonal decomposition modes, and the fluid transport process is studied by the Lagrangian coherent structures. Two scaling relations that quantitatively connect the membrane deformation with the aerodynamic loads presented in our previous work are verified even when active jet flow control is applied. A unifying feedback loop that reveals the fluid–membrane coupling mechanism is proposed. These findings can facilitate the development of next-generation bio-inspired drones that incorporate smart sensing and intelligent control.},

The aerodynamic response of the wing can be categorized based on the angle of attack and the degree of flow separation on the suction side of the wing. When the suction side is dominated by separated flow, either at low angles of attack with long laminar separation bubbles or at high, poststall, angles of attack, the lift is enhanced by the favorable pressure gradient during freestream acceleration and decremented by the adverse pressure gradient during freestream deceleration. In these cases, the sectional lift coefficient is shown to oscillate by as much as due to the unsteady pressure gradient. Comparatively, regions of attached flow on the wing surface remain largely unaffected by the time-varying conditions, regardless of the reduced frequency. Discrepancies between the measured lift and the estimated response from Isaacs’s theory demonstrate that the coupling between the viscous flow separation and the unsteady conditions dominates the unsteady aerodynamic response.},

The moving boundary conditions are motivated by inviscid potential flow around the airfoil, which also satisfies the viscous equations of motion. In this study, the wall is moved at the slip velocity of the inviscid flow, or a fraction of it. These prescribed moving boundary conditions are shown to suppress vortex shedding, thus allowing the drag to go toward zero and the lift coefficient toward over a wide range of angles of attack even in the separated flow regime. It is shown that moving boundary conditions are effective over a wide range of their strengths with respect to the overall power required (required to overcome aerodynamic drag and move the airfoil boundary). This power is shown to attain a minimum near the inviscid flow moving boundary condition, which is around 10% or less of the power required for the stationary boundary condition. Finally, the effectiveness of the moving boundary conditions is demonstrated for fully turbulent flow regimes at million as well.},

As the channel gap height decreases, circulatory-lift peaks attributed to leading-edge vortices (LEVs) become larger, and for the second peak onward occur earlier, from wing blockage enhancing the flow speed. Larger and earlier LEVs are visualized, supporting this, as are secondary vortices off the channel. The lift reduces while exiting a channel, being lowest afterward if exiting during a lift peak. For ceilings, the first circulatory-lift peak increases for smaller LE-to-ceiling gaps, but for 0.5 chord gaps or less, later maxima are below the no-obstacle case yet still earlier. For grounds, with lower wing height the first circulatory-lift peak is larger but the second peak’s behavior varies with angle of attack, and lift decreases near the ground end. Grounds affect peak timing the least, indicating less influence on the LEV.

  abstract     = {A magnetic sail is a propellantless propulsion system that has great potential in long-term space travel. It utilizes the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetic field generated by a high-current coil. However, the requirement of a large-sized coil with a high working current limits its practical application. To reduce the coil size while maintaining the thrust, a rotational magnetic sail is proposed and analyzed using the three-dimensional particle tracing method. The results show that the magnetic sail thrust significantly increases with the rotational speed and is influenced by plasma parameters. Moreover, the sail achieves the maximum thrust and the most stable attitude when the magnetic moment vector is perpendicular to the particle impact direction. The analysis implies that the rotational magnetic sail can shrink to about a minimum of 20% and approximately 1% of the size of a static magnetic sail in the solar wind and low Earth orbit, respectively, while maintaining the same thrust.},

  abstract     = {The presence of grazing flow can alter the noise reduction performance of resonant liner panels. One possible cause is the flow entering the liner opening. In this study, a fine perforated film was applied to the surface of acoustic liners to prevent such flow effects. Three types of liner samples were fabricated and tested in a flow duct rig at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The first sample was a conventional resonant liner (“baseline”), the second sample had a fine perforated film directly attached to the baseline liner surface (“direct fine perforated film”), and the third sample had a gap fixed between the film and the liner surface (“fine perforated film with a gap”). The impedance eduction results show that the fine perforated film with a gap was effective in separating grazing flow from the liner openings and in reducing the effect of the flow on the impedance. The transmission loss in the duct improved. However, the effectiveness of the direct fine perforated film was limited. The fine perforated film with a gap structure showed potential to facilitate the design of high-efficiency liners under grazing flow conditions.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the acoustic source characteristics of supersonic jets is vital to accurate noise field modeling and jet noise reduction strategies. This paper uses advanced, coherence-based partial field decomposition methods to characterize the acoustic sources in an installed, supersonic GE F404 engine. Partial field decomposition is accomplished using an equivalent source reconstruction via acoustical holography. Bandwidth is extended through the application of an array phase-unwrapping and interpolation scheme. The optimized-location virtual reference method is used. Apparent source distributions and source-related partial fields are shown as a function of frequency. Local maxima are observed in holography reconstructions at the nozzle lipline, distinct in frequency and space. The lowest-frequency local maximum may relate to noise generated by large-scale turbulence structures in the convectively subsonic region of the flow. Other local maxima are correlated primarily with Mach wave radiation originating from throughout the shear layer and into the fully mixed region downstream of the potential core tip. Source-elucidating decompositions show that the order and behavior of the decomposition lend to the local maxima being related to distinct subsources. Between the local maxima, however, there may be a combination of sources active, which is likely the cause of the spatiospectral lobes observed in other full-scale, supersonic jets.},

A possible method to reduce this noise is the use of flow-permeable leading edges, which has been investigated experimentally on a set of flat plates with different leading-edge perforations. The results show that these modifications can lead to notable noise reductions at low and medium frequencies, but also to a noise increase at high frequencies due to the contribution of surface roughness noise. The measured data were then used as an input to a symbolic regression modeling approach with the aim of obtaining a simple yet accurate model to predict the noise reduction capacity of the permeable leading edges. Three different prediction models were finally selected to demonstrate the capability of the current approach. One of the more complex models already predicts correct trends and shows an acceptable mean absolute error, making it a reliable candidate for engineering purposes.},

Recently, they have been widely studied for constructing physics-informed neural networks, but they need to be trained on a case-by-case basis and require long training times. On the other hand, fast prediction and design tools are desired for aerodynamic shape designs, and data-driven mesh-based models have achieved great performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a data-driven mesh-agnostic decoder that combines the fast prediction ability of data-driven models and the flexibility of mesh-agnostic models. The model is denoted by an implicit decoder, which consists of two subnetworks, i.e., ShapeNet and HyperNet. ShapeNet is based on implicit neural representation, and HyperNet is a simple neural network. The implicit decoder is trained for the fast prediction of supercritical airfoils. Different activation functions are compared, and a spatial constraint is proposed to improve the interpretability and generalization ability of the model. Then, the implicit decoder is used together with a mesh-based encoder to build a generative model, which is used for the inverse design of supercritical airfoils with specified physical features.},

  abstract     = {Determining the sensitivity of model outputs to input parameters is an important precursor to developing informative parameter studies, building surrogate models, and performing rigorous uncertainty quantification. Determining parameter sensitivities over a range of parameter values, termed global sensitivity analysis, requires many model evaluations sampled over the parameter space, which is intractable for many large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. For moderate parameter dimensions, we propose the use of Morris screening, a one-at-a-time quasi-global method for estimating parameter sensitivities over a range of parameter values for CFD simulations. The Morris method is implemented within a CFD framework that utilizes adaptive grid refinement, thereby enabling its application to state-of-the-art production-level problems. The method is shown to be viable for a model problem of supersonic flow over an axisymmetric capsule geometry with both physical and nonphysical (i.e., simulation-informing) input parameters. It is shown that Morris screening identifies relative parameter sensitivities consistent with those of more costly experimental and computational studies that were previously performed on this geometry.},

In terms of the RSM, however, coupling more transport equations will further increase its complexity (may worsen robustness and convergence rate). In this paper, a -based algebraic transition model originating from the SA-BC model is coupled with an -scale RSM (EV-RSM) to form a new transition/turbulence model, called tEV-RSM. Some numerical tests are conducted with a fifth-order scheme, WCNS, including the well-known T3 flat plate series, a two-dimensional airfoil (S809), a two-dimensional three-element airfoil (30P-30N), a three-dimensional prolate-spheroid, and a three-dimensional circular cylinder. The proposed model is compared with the SA-BC and SST models, which indicates that it can predict the flows primarily governed by Tollmien–Schlichting transition or bypass transition well and has an advantage in predicting the flows with detached separation. Meanwhile, the iteration convergence rate of the tEV-RSM is fast enough considering it as a seven-equation model.},

The experiment is performed at conditions leading to different shock structures, and the shock behavior is captured with high-speed schlieren imaging. The Rolls-Royce HYDRA in-house code is employed for the numerical simulations. Trends in the change of oscillation behavior are discussed. The work addresses the fundamentally different behavior between an idealized quasi-2D LES case and an experimental cascade. This suggests that a simplification of the shock oscillation problem to a more canonical form is needed in order to investigate the oscillation mechanism itself experimentally and validate the CFD of the mechanism before returning to more complex cases.

Making use of both shock-fitting and shock-capturing CFD simulations and classical shock polar analysis, we prove that, in the case of a NACA0012 airfoil, the two interaction points cannot be modeled using the three shocks theory that von Neumann developed nearly a century ago to describe triple points arising in Mach reflections.

Infrared thermography was employed to assess the surface temperature distribution, particularly the thermal striations on the fin that indicated a crossflow-dominated transition. Increasing the unit Reynolds number increased heating and moved the crossflow-transition front closer to the fin leading edge. Stability analysis based on the linear parabolized stability equations identified unstable stationary crossflow modes across the range of tested unit Reynolds numbers, and the most amplified disturbances were found to have wavelengths of 2–4 mm. The experimentally observed thermal striations were analyzed and found to have initial wavelengths of 2–5 mm but eventually formed higher-amplitude structures with a wavelength of approximately 10 mm. Discrete roughness elements of different diameters and spacings were implemented near the fin leading edge. Boundary-layer transition onset was found to be delayed with a subsequent lowering of the fin surface heating, with discrete roughness elements having a wavelength of 13.33 mm.},

A novel ray-tracing algorithm, called Blackout Ray Tracer (BORAT), based on a Snell’s law solver, is introduced to analyze the signal behavior during reentry using geometrical optics for nonmagnetized and magnetized plasma. The ray-tracing analysis is performed on Knapp’s case fluid simulations provided by the University of Stuttgart. The effect of an applied magnetic field on ray tracing is discussed and visualized using radiation patterns. The results suggest that a sufficiently strong magnetic field is promising to mitigate radio communication blackouts.},

  abstract     = {The destructive atmospheric entry process is distinguished by the formation of several fragments due to the severe aerothermal loads encountered during the descent. The proximity of debris leads to shock wave interactions and collisions between bodies, influencing the overall dynamics of the fragments and affecting the prediction of demise and ground impact location. To account for these effects, the use of computational fluid dynamics is introduced to resolve the shock interaction patterns by employing a quasi-steady approach, and the use of a simple rigid-body collision model is introduced to represent the dynamics of fragments in the cloud of debris. The quasi-steady approach is assessed and validated by comparative analysis with a few studies in the literature. One of these examples is the rebuilding of the VKI’s experiment of a free-flying ring crossing a shock wave generated by the presence of a stationary cylinder. The impact of explicitly modeling collision dynamics in the trajectory of fragments and ground spread distance is validated by considering a set of relevant test cases from the literature and tested them for destructive atmospheric reentry of the Attitude Vernier Upper Module, the launcher VEGA upper stage.},

To account for the relevant physics during the reentry process of fragmenting bodies, a multifidelity framework is presented that allows for selecting the most appropriate level of fidelity, between high-fidelity solutions or low-fidelity aerothermodynamic metamodels. A physics-informed approach is implemented to automatically choose between the two fidelity levels on the basis of the intersection of shock wave envelopes.

  abstract     = {The flow around a rotating cylinder is one of the fundamental problems that have piqued the interests of many venerable fluid mechanicians since the time of Rayleigh. The force caused by the rotation of the cylinder has always been considered as an immediate consequence of viscosity, since the potential flow model failed entirely to predict the value of the circulation due to the lack of a Kutta-like condition. On the other hand, Glauert modeled the flow outside the boundary layer of a rotating cylinder as a potential flow with an unknown circulation. He then obtained an approximate solution of Prandtl’s boundary-layer equations and applied the no-slip condition to estimate the circulation in the outer flow. Interestingly, for rapidly rotating cylinders , up to fourth-order in the small parameter , the obtained circulation is independent of viscosity. In this work, we use Glauert’s model of the outer flow (i.e., a potential flow with an unknown circulation). However, instead of the tedious boundary-layer calculations, we rely on Gauss’s principle of least constraint to obtain the unknown circulation. A perfect match with Glauert’s solution is found. Moreover, our solution, in contrast to Glauert’s, points to the existence of different physics at small rotational speeds. The obtained results, given their perfect matching with Glauert’s solution (relying on the no-slip condition), point to a potential equivalence between the no-slip condition and fluid body forces.},

Data fusion techniques aim to bring together the strengths and mitigate the limitations of data from various information sources. A multifidelity data fusion framework employing Gaussian process regression is adopted herein and applied to the surface pressure data of a large aircraft wing model. The modeling approach is non-hierarchical in that there is no established hierarchy of accuracy among the information sources. Scalability issues arising from the large volume of data required for the study of pressure distributions are overcome by using an approximate Gaussian process regression based on stochastic variational inference, enabling the data fusion framework to be applied effectively to industry-relevant analysis and design challenges. The approach is demonstrated for a high-dimensional data set generated through wind tunnel testing in an industrial setting and numerical analysis.},

By preconditioning a deep neural network policy and a deep neural network Lyapunov function, and then applying a constrained parameter optimization approach, we are able to address the shape mismatch problem posed by the standard sum-of-squares Lyapunov function and achieve feedback-optimal control. Phase-space plots of the Lyapunov derivative show the level of certificate enforcement achieved by the developed algorithms, and Monte Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the stable, optimal, real-time feedback control provided by the policy.},

A comparative assessment is conducted between the proposed deep-learning framework and the proper orthogonal decomposition approach to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each method.

Despite the challenges of the analyzed scenarios, promising results are obtained for each test case, showing the effectiveness of the model implemented.

  abstract     = {Identification of flutter margins in modern aeroelastic systems is a challenging task due to increased nonlinearities in novel designs, which can result in instabilities occurring below the linear flutter speed. These instabilities pose a significant risk as they may involve multiple stable solutions, such as large-amplitude self-sustained oscillations. The lack of efficient nonlinear bifurcation analysis methods for experimental systems exacerbates the challenges associated with postflutter analysis. This paper presents a data-driven method for predicting flutter instabilities and bifurcation diagrams of an experimental nonlinear 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) airfoil. The approach uses measurement data from the preflutter regime to forecast the postflutter dynamics, eliminating the need for computationally expensive models. This study is the first application of the recently introduced data-driven bifurcation forecasting method to experimental aeroelastic systems. The results show that the proposed method is accurate, with predictions matching the measured behavior of the system. The presented study provides valuable insights into the nonlinear stability and dynamics of experimental airfoils and demonstrates the potential for applicability of this approach in the analysis of experimental systems. The findings have significant implications for online monitoring and evaluation of the nonlinear dynamics of aeroelastic systems in the aerospace industry, where safety is of crucial importance.},

Three types of sampling methods, namely, Markov chain Monte Carlo, transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo, and the sequential Monte Carlo sampler, are implemented into Bayesian model updating. The framework has been demonstrated using a nonlinear wing flutter test rig. It is modeled by a two-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic system and solved by the harmonic balance methods. The experimental data of the flutter wing is obtained using control-based continuation techniques. The proposed methodology provided up to a 20% improvement in accuracy compared to conventional deterministic methods and significantly increased computational efficiency in the updating and uncertainty quantification processes. Transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo was identified as the optimal choice of sampling method for stochastic model identification. In selecting alternative nonlinear models, multimodal solutions were identified that provided a closer representation of the physical behavior of the complex aeroelastic system than a single solution.},

  abstract     = {Microstructure-sensitive materials design has become popular among materials engineering researchers in the last decade because it allows the control of material performance through the design of microstructures. In this study, the microstructure is defined by an orientation distribution function. A physics-informed machine learning approach is integrated into microstructure design to improve the accuracy, computational efficiency, and explainability of microstructure-sensitive design. When data generation is costly and numerical models need to follow certain physical laws, machine learning models that are domain-aware perform more efficiently than conventional machine learning models. Therefore, a new paradigm called the physics-informed neural network (PINN) is introduced in the literature. This study applies the PINN to microstructure-sensitive modeling and inverse design to explore the material behavior under deformation processing. In particular, we demonstrate the application of PINN to small-data problems driven by a crystal plasticity model that needs to satisfy the physics-based design constraints of the microstructural orientation space. For the first problem, we predict the microstructural texture evolution of copper during a tensile deformation process as a function of initial texturing and strain rate. The second problem aims to calibrate the crystal plasticity parameters of the Ti-7Al alloy by solving an inverse design problem to match the PINN-predicted final texture prediction and the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the characteristics of partially premixed flames (PPFs) under transcritical conditions is of critical importance for the development of fuel-rich staged rocket engines. While substantial progress has been achieved for transcritical non-premixed flames (NPFs), comparatively little effort has been made to investigate transcritical PPFs. To this end, a series of transcritical counterflow gaseous hydrogen/liquid oxygen (GH2/LOX) PPFs is simulated to investigate the thermodynamic structure of PPF and to examine the effects of molecular diffusion modeling, strain rate, and the equivalence ratio at the fuel-rich side on PPFs in physical space and mixture fraction space, as well as reduced temperature/reduced pressure space. The comparisons between the NPF and PPF demonstrate that the PPF exhibits a bimodal structure in physical space: a premixed reaction zone at the fuel inlet side and a non-premixed reaction zone at the oxidizer side. In mixture fraction space, the C-shaped structure of PPF is observed owing to the differential diffusion of species. It is found that the choice of molecular diffusion model has a significant impact on PPF structure. The presence of a loop at subcritical pressures in a reduced temperature/reduced pressure space is caused by the differential diffusion of species and the formation of in the non-premixed reaction zone. Furthermore, the results indicate that the premixed reaction zones in the PPFs are very sensitive to the change in strain rate and/or equivalence ratio of the premixed mixture at the fuel inlet side. For a given equivalence ratio, increasing strain rate can suppress the differential diffusion effect and the C-shaped structure, while it has a negligible impact on the non-premixed reaction and hence on loop formation.},

  abstract     = {In advanced aeropropulsion engines, liquid fuel is often injected into the combustor at supercritical pressures, where flow dynamics are distinct from the subcritical counterpart. Large-eddy simulation, combined with real-fluid thermodynamics and transport processes of a liquid N-dodecane jet in oxygen crossflow, is presented at different supercritical pressures and jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratios . Various vortical structures are discussed in detail. The results show that, with the same velocity ratio of 0.75, the upstream shear layer (USL) is absolutely unstable at high supercritical pressure and convectively unstable at low supercritical pressure , consistent with the empirical criterion at subcritical pressures . While decreasing to 7.1 at low supercritical pressure, however, the USL remains convectively unstable, manifested by the variable dominant Strouhal number of the USL along the upstream jet trajectory. Such abnormal behavior can be attributed to the real-fluid effect induced by strong density stratification at low supercritical pressure, under which an inflection point in the upstream mixing layer renders a large density gradient and tends to stabilize the USL. Linear stability analysis further verifies these findings. The analysis of spatial mixing deficiencies reveals that the mixing efficiency is enhanced at a higher .},

A pair of counter-rotating propellers was simulated by the lattice Boltzmann method, and the far-field noise was predicted by the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings analogy. Dynamic mode decomposition was introduced to analyze the surface pressure contribution to far-field noise and to provide insights on the cancellation mechanism of the noise source distribution for the interaction tone. It was found that the cancellation effect is closely related to the relative position between the front blade wake and rear blade element. By adjusting the rear blade sweep and, hence, changing the relative position, the interaction tone can be reduced effectively.},

Similar tip designs are used on some modern helicopter main rotors. The experiments were conducted at the Rotor Test Facility Göttingen (RTG) in hover-like conditions using a stereoscopic high-speed particle image velocimetry system. The results are compared with those of a reference rotor using a conventional parabolic blade tip. The test parameters include both constant-pitch cases and pitch-oscillating cases with a cyclic swashplate input. The constant-pitch tests show a two-step stall behavior for the double-swept tip, with the first step characterized by a reduced thrust slope and a reduced rotor efficiency. This effect is explained by a repositioning and a structural change of the tip vortex generation. The pitch-oscillating cases show that the double-swept tip results in an earlier tip stall compared to the parabolic geometry while maintaining high thrust levels. The dynamic tip stall yields a break-down of the wake’s tip vortex system, which is replaced by a spanwise band with small-scale turbulent structures and trailed vorticity, but no large-scale vortices.},

This study proposes a set of automated geometric modeling and mechanical analysis processes to realize the automated mechanical analysis and design of complex wire mesh structures. First, considering the tilt in the wire mesh structure owing to the traction of the underlap on the loop, a three-dimensional (3D) geometric model of the repeating unit of the wire mesh structure was established using periodic cubic spline curves. Subsequently, a method using sensitivity matrix adjustment is proposed to eliminate the interstructure inlay phenomenon, and an optimization model is established. The vector superposition method established a 3D geometric model of the overall wire mesh structure without an inlay problem. Finally, a finite element model of the wire mesh considering the contact problem was established by the adaptive matching method for contact pairs of the finite element model of the wire mesh. Mechanical simulation experiments were carried out on the model, comparing the theoretical analysis with the experimental results and verifying its reasonableness.},

  abstract     = {Stowage schemes based on origami wrapping patterns are useful for the design of various deployable spacecraft structures. These origami patterns allow for the compact stowage of flat sheets of small thickness. Typically, some other structure is needed to stiffen this thin sheet when it is fully deployed and flat. This paper describes a class of thin-shell structures that can be compactly stowed using origami wrapping methods but have a corrugated form when deployed. These structures cannot reach a flat state by design. The persistent corrugations provide stiffness without the need for an external structure, thus leading to overall savings in mass and complexity. The geometrical design of the corrugations is highly tunable. This paper describes a method for generating the form of these folding structures; the method guarantees that the structure can be unstrained both when compactly wrapped and when fully deployed. Test articles are fabricated to demonstrate the concept, and stowage experiments and stiffness experiments are conducted. A structural finite element modeling procedure is described to predict the deployed stiffness of these structures, and the stiffness predictions match the experimental results.},

In addition, the DOF number and properties of its moving components are analyzed. Based on the condition that the nonhomogeneous linear equations have a unique solution, the singularity analysis of the mechanism is complete, which indicates that the mechanism can be continuously deployed and folded. Based on the geometric characteristics of the mechanism, its folded ratio is calculated. Finally, a ring, a planar, and a parabolic truss deployable antenna mechanism are assembled based on the RPDM, and the DOF variation for the different assembly modes is obtained via the screw constraint matrix.

Experiments are conducted at Mach 3.5 along a 23° compression corner with turbulent inflow boundary-layer and Reynolds number based on the 6.2-mm boundary-layer thickness. Micro-ramp, standard ramped-vane, and inverted ramped-vane VGs all cause the separation line to ripple and become more three-dimensional, but none eliminate it altogether. Vane-type VGs produce a stronger control effect than micro-ramps. Inverted vanes tend to generate large areas of near-wall low-momentum flow that locally increase separation length, making standard vane configurations more effective at reducing separation size. Velocimetry measurements show that the VG-induced vortices remain coherent and capable of exchanging momentum within the boundary-layer, even downstream of the interaction. Enhanced flow three-dimensionality causes an intensification of areas of increased and decreased momentum downstream of reattachment, resulting in significant flow distortion. Increased near-wall turbulent fluctuations are observed upstream of the interaction in areas where separation length is reduced. These findings are used to propose a mechanism of VG control, highlighting the role of VGs in enhancing mixing in the separated shear layer, leading to earlier reattachment and an overall reduction in separation length.},

Due to the uncertain nature of the gas composition in the flowfield of interest, PIV measurements of a supersonic wedge flow were used to couple the flow velocities to the oblique shock relations. This enabled a PIV-derived total temperature calculation that does not require a priori assumptions of the exact gas composition. A PIV expansion module was developed for this study, and proper seed sizing and material were selected for the present flow. An analysis of the seed particle response from the PIV measurements provided an initial validation of the seed performance while revealing potential issues with consistent seed sizing. These measurements and derived conditions represent a means of acquiring high-resolution velocimetry and temperature datasets that consider uncertainties in the experimental generation of hypersonic high-enthalpy flows.},

However, the conventional method to predict the burst pressure relies on time-consuming experiments that pose significant challenges for ultrahigh driving conditions. In this study, the finite element method (FEM) based on the Johnson–Cook model is adopted to predict the burst pressure of diaphragms used in a shock tube. The influences of the diaphragm thickness and groove depth on the burst pressure are analyzed. A simplified approximation based on the simulation results is obtained to estimate the burst pressure under a static load rapidly. This method is more generalizable than the existing equation and produces results in good agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, the burst pressure is investigated under different dynamic loads using the proposed FEM method. The results show that the dynamic load results in larger burst pressures than the static load, indicating that the burst pressure depends on the load type, the loading rate, and the magnitude of the applied forces.},

We solve the parabolized Navier–Stokes equations, which are integrated via spatial marching in the streamwise direction. We find that unique physics must be accounted for in the hypersonic regime relative to the supersonic, which includes viscous, nonequilibrium, and real gas effects. The near-field aerodynamic pressure is propagated through the atmosphere to the ground via the waveform parameter method. To illustrate the approach, three bodies are analyzed: the Sears–Haack geometry, the HIFiRE-5, and a power-law waverider. Ambient Mach numbers range from 4 through 15. The viscous stress tensor is essential for accurate hypersonic prediction. For example, viscous effects increase near-field and sonic boom overpressure by 15.7 and 8.49%, respectively, for the Sears–Haack geometry. The difference between viscous and inviscid predictions of the near-field is due to the hypersonic boundary layer. The computational cost for predicting the near-field is approximately 6.6% relative to fully nonlinear computational fluid dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Variable-geometry lip structures can effectively broaden the operating range and improve the performance of hypersonic inlets. However, the presence of connection devices leads to a significant reduction in structural stiffness, which can easily trigger fluid–structure interaction (FSI) issues of the lip. In this study, an in-house FSI program is employed to investigate the buzz characteristics under FSI of the lip for a hypersonic inlet. The results indicate that FSI induces instability in the downstream shock train, resulting in the premature occurrence of inlet buzz. The buzz mode induced by FSI significantly differs from the rigid inlet buzz. During the buzz induced by FSI, both violent and mild buzz modes coexist, with these two modes irregularly alternating. During the violent buzz, the inlet achieves a brief start, leading to a fundamentally different evolution of the flowfield structure compared to the rigid model. During the mild buzz, the inlet remains unstart, so the evolution of the flowfield structure is similar to that of the rigid model. In comparison to the rigid inlet buzz, the amplitudes of pressure fluctuations significantly increase, and the dominant frequency decreases for the buzz induced by FSI. Simultaneously, different evolution characteristics of flow frequencies within various inlet regions are observed. Additionally, performance parameters no longer exhibit regular cyclic variations, with significant amplifications in their amplitudes. This study deepens the understanding of the buzz characteristics under FSI of lips for hypersonic inlets and provides a novel perspective on the mechanisms underlying buzz occurrence.},

  abstract     = {Because of the requirements of payload capability, flight range, and maneuverability, hypersonic aircraft demand high aerodynamic performance. Waveriders have attracted significant attention because of their high lift-to-drag ratios in hypersonic states. Many methods to design waveriders have been proposed for more than 60 years, among which the osculating method features unique advantages in terms of design space, efficiency, and flexibility. Moreover, nearly all waverider design methods can be realized using this approach. This paper presents an overview of research on waverider design methodologies using osculating theory developed until 2023. The design theory and detailed implementation of the osculating cone method are first described, followed by the progress and improvement of the method and the derived osculating flowfield method. The planform-customized waverider from the osculating cone method, which has developed rapidly in recent years, is discussed emphatically. In addition, the connection between the osculating cone and other waverider design methods is plotted to show its powerful applicability. The application of the osculating waverider in practical aircraft design is also summarized. Finally, some perspectives and suggestions for future development are concluded.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive approach, combining theoretical analysis and direct numerical simulation, is employed in this study to investigate the influence of temperature gradient on the stability phenomenon of the stator boundary layer in a rotor–stator cavity. In contrast to previous studies, a temperature term is introduced to account for centrifugal buoyancy within the cavity. The focus is on analyzing the transitional behavior and the effects of centrifugal buoyancy on the boundary layers of the stationary disk under operating conditions characterized by a Reynolds number of . The investigation reveals that this temperature gradient significantly affects the base flow and alters the instability governing the boundary-layer transition on the stationary disk. Specifically, the centrifugal buoyancy induced by the higher temperature on the stationary side weakens the spiral mode perturbations without inducing changes in the azimuthal wavenumber of the spiral mode. However, when the centrifugal buoyancy effect exceeds a certain threshold, it directly suppresses the generation of the spiral mode and induces the formation of low-radius circular waves, thereby promoting a more stable boundary layer. This research emphasizes the importance of considering temperature variations in the rotor–stator cavity for improved control of stability within the boundary-layer flow.},

While a flexible electric film heater wrapped around the leading edge of an airfoil/wing model was used to heat the airfoil frontal surface to prevent ice accretion near the airfoil leading edge, three different kinds of coatings were applied to coat the airfoil model at three distinct spanwise locations, which included an icephobic coating with an outstanding icephobicity but a weak hydrophobicity; a superhydrophobic surface (SHS) coating with outstanding water repellency but a moderate icephobicity; and a commonly used hydrophilic coating with poor hydrophobicity and poor icephobicity. Surface wettability was found to play a more important role than icephobicity in affecting the performance of the hybrid anti-/de-icing systems. In comparison to the approach of forceful heating the hydrophilic airfoil surface, the hybrid approach with the SHS coating was found to be able to achieve about 90% energy savings in keeping the entire airfoil surface ice-free; the corresponding energy savings for the hybrid system with the icephobic coating was only about 10%.},

The effects of mass flow rate, hydraulic diameter, aspect ratio, curvature radius, surface roughness, inlet orientation, and nonconstant curvatures were experimentally investigated. Measurements of the oscillation Strouhal number, discharge coefficient, spreading angle, and sweeping angle were used to characterize the jet. The resulting oscillators were found to fall into one of three categories: oscillated at the same frequency and sweep angle as conventional flat oscillators; oscillated at a slightly higher frequency and lower sweep angle than flat oscillators; or no dominant oscillation frequency detected and with no sweeping action. An unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics simulation revealed fundamental differences in the internal flow mechanisms between flat and curved oscillators that drive the sweeping jet. The curvature between 37.5 and 62.5% of the total length, or the region from the inlet nozzle to halfway through the main chamber, was a primary factor influencing the response type of a design. Due to the curvature of these oscillators, they have the ability to be used in geometrically constrained spaces, such as the leading edge of wings and turbine vanes.},

The ROM formulation is unique in that it utilizes an integral technique and models the energy exchange between harmonically related modes, which can give insight on how to excite the jet in an experiment or computation. This ROM is used in conjunction with a linearized Euler equation solver to obtain shape functions for various disturbance frequencies. Work is limited here to symmetric modes of the coherent structure, and hence the disturbance in the upper and lower shear layers is in phase. Nonlinear solutions are first obtained without mode–mode interactions, giving a most amplified Strouhal number of 0.15 based on the height of the jet, which is assumed to be the dominant noise source in the jet, referred to as the fundamental frequency. The fundamental’s interaction with either the subharmonic or harmonic is assessed based on their ability to reduce the fundamental. Adding the harmonic is found to be more effective at reducing the peak of the fundamental, and thus this is concluded to be possibly an effective mechanism for noise reduction.},

  abstract     = {Composition noise has recently received increasing attention for its potential to contribute significantly to the indirect noise mechanism. In this study, the importance and definition of composition noise are revisited by proposing a new proper decomposition between entropy and mixture compositional fluctuations. When assuming quasi-one-dimensional, multispecies, isentropic, and nonreactive flow in nozzles, the resulting system of equations shows a new and remarkable one-way coupling between composition waves and both acoustic and entropy waves. Relying on the Magnus-expansion methodology, an exact solution of that system is investigated. The proposed theory is validated by comparing the model predictions with direct numerical simulations of nozzle flows in which compositional fluctuations are pulsed. It is shown that composition transfer functions from the unsteady simulations are in agreement with the analytical model of this paper. Finally, a hybrid approach is investigated consisting of extracting waves from a large-eddy simulation of a real helicopter engine and propagating those through different nozzle geometries. Composition noise is found to be negligible compared to direct or indirect entropy noise since it is at least 20 dB lower than other noise mechanisms for all tested cases.},

  abstract     = {The paper delves into the detailed sound generation and propagation mechanisms associated with tripping-induced flow perturbations and trailing-edge scattering using wall-resolved large-eddy simulations. Two distinct boundary-layer tripping techniques, namely a geometrically resolved stair strip and an artificially modeled trip using suction and blowing, are investigated. To facilitate comparison, the natural boundary-layer transition is also simulated as a baseline scenario. The analysis takes into account a Reynolds number of , a Mach number of 0.058, and a nonzero angle of attack of 6.25° over a NACA 0012 airfoil configuration. The mechanisms for sound generation and propagation related to trailing-edge noise remain consistent across the three transition scenarios. However, boundary-layer tripping notably leads to intricate, scenario-specific noise generation: there is an interaction between the laminar separation bubble and tripping for the stair strip case, whereas laminar boundary-layer instability is evident for the suction and blowing scenario. Aerodynamic flowfields involving acoustic noise sources, their propagating natures near the wall, and far-field acoustics are cross-examined in detail. The comprehensive analysis of observed phenomena provides valuable insights for understanding nonlinear flow and acoustic interactions relevant to airfoil noise and designing new types of trips under adverse pressure gradient flows.},

  abstract     = {High-speed rotorcraft experience a region of reversed flow over the retreating blade at high advance ratios. This reverse flow region results in multiple unfavorable effects, including negative lift, increased drag, and a large pitching moment impulse. The effect of the sweep angle on a rotor blade in reverse flow was explored, and it was demonstrated that the introduction of a trailing edge reflex camber could mitigate the adverse effects seen in this regime. A cantilevered, finite-span NACA 63-218 blade was examined at a Reynolds number both with and without a 10° trailing edge reflex camber. Three blades were tested: one with 20° forward sweep, one with 20° backward sweep, and one with no sweep. The experiments consisted of load measurements across a range of angles of attack, as well as volumetric flowfield measurements using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry on the two swept models at 10° angle of attack in reverse flow. The flowfields exhibited a highly three-dimensional separation bubble that existed on the blades in both backward and forward sweep conditions. Cambering of the trailing edge led to almost complete flow attachment on the backward swept model and a significant reduction in separation over the forward swept model. Cambering also led to a large reduction in drag in the entire reverse flow regime in both swept and unswept conditions. A large reduction in pitching moment and a smaller reduction in negative lift were also observed at moderate angles of attack.},

  abstract     = {By actively controlling laminar separation, the aerodynamic loading can be increased. In the context of turbomachinery, an increased loading allows for more power to be extracted or for a lower part count. Active flow control can be made more effective and efficient if the actuator location and forcing frequency are chosen well. Large-eddy simulations of the flow over an E387 airfoil were carried out for a chord Reynolds number of 100,000. For an angle of attack of zero degrees, the suction-side boundary layer separates laminar to form a large separation bubble. With 1% freestream turbulence intensity, the boundary layer reattaches earlier, and the length of the separated region is in better agreement with available measurements. A resolvent analysis suggests that forcing immediately upstream of separation with an angular frequency of 50 (based on freestream velocity and chord length) provides the maximum forcing-response gain. Guided by the resolvent analysis, active flow control by wall-normal blowing and suction was then investigated in the simulation. Forcing introduces laminar, two-dimensional “rollers” that effectively suppress separation. Without freestream turbulence, transition occurs close to the trailing edge. With freestream turbulence, the flow transitions further upstream and active flow control is less effective.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the lift coefficient of an airfoil with nonzero prescribed thickness and camber, along with a prescribed porosity distribution in a steady incompressible flow. In similar prior work, considering a Darcy-type porosity condition on the airfoil surface provides a Fredholm integral equation that can be solved exactly for Hölder-continuous porosity distributions. However, the generated lift predicted by the model diverges from the experimental data for porous airfoils with large values of the porosity parameter. This indicates a fundamental characteristic is missing in the mathematical model. Consequently, in this paper, the (linear) Darcy porosity condition is replaced by the (nonlinear) Forchheimer porosity condition. The Forchheimer porosity condition is decomposed into linear sections and furnishes a modified system of Fredholm integral equations, enabling an approximate solution by superposition for Hölder-continuous porosity distributions. The solution is then verified against the SD7003 airfoil results, and the comparison shows better agreement than considering the Darcy porosity condition. The methodology and results presented here may be combined with previous work on the aeroacoustics of porous airfoils with a Forchheimer boundary condition to address the conflicting aims of improving aerodynamic performance while reducing unwanted aeroacoustic emissions.},

By introducing CF, the proposed methods can effectively improve the computational efficiency of the nested expectation and variance operators in the reliability sensitivity indices of the distribution parameters. Based on the concept of SSPDF, a surrogate importance sampling probability density function was developed. This not only overcomes the problem of the computational effort of propagating parameter uncertainty to the failure probability function (FPF), which depends on the dimensionality of the parameters; it also further improves the efficiency of the RSA of the parameters in the case of a small failure probability. Finally, by incorporating the idea of the QMC method, the process of calculating the reliability sensitivity indices of the parameters is reduced from a double-loop to a single-loop one. Three engineering examples are used in this study to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Many modern structural health monitoring (SHM) systems use piezoelectric transducers to induce and measure guided waves propagating in structures for structural damage detection. To increase the detection capabilities of SHM systems, gradient-based optimization of sensor placement is frequently necessary. However, available numerical differentiation methods for mechanical wave propagation problems suffer from truncation and subtraction errors and are difficult to extend to high-order sensitivities. This paper addresses these issues by introducing an approach to obtain highly accurate numerical sensitivities of arbitrary order in mechanical wave propagation problems. The hypercomplex time-domain spectral finite element method (ZSFEM) couples the hypercomplex Taylor series expansion method with the time-domain spectral finite element method. We show how ZSFEM can be implemented within the commercial finite element package ABAQUS/Explicit. For verification, we compared the numerical and analytical results of the displacement and its sensitivities with respect to mechanical parameters, geometry, and boundary conditions for a rod subjected to a sudden, distributed axial load. First- and second-order sensitivities were obtained with normalized root mean square deviations below . Mesh convergence analyses revealed that -refinement offered better convergence rates than -refinement for the outputs and their sensitivities. Also, the sensitivities obtained with ZSFEM were compared with finite differences showing higher accuracy and step-size independence (e.g., no iteration is needed to determine the step size that minimizes the error). For simplicity, ZSFEM was presented only for one-dimensional truss elements, but the method is general and can be applied to other elements.},

Consequently, modifications of a RANS model often negatively impact its basic calibrations, which is why machine-learned augmentations are often detrimental outside the training dataset. A solution to this is to identify the degrees of freedom that do not affect the basic calibrations and only modify these identified degrees of freedom when recalibrating the baseline model to accommodate a specific application. This approach is colloquially known as the “rubber-band” approach, which we formally call “constrained model recalibration” in this paper. To illustrate the efficacy of the approach, we identify the degrees of freedom in the Spalart–Allmaras model that do not affect the log law calibration. By subsequently interfacing data-based methods with these degrees of freedom, we train models to solve historically challenging flow scenarios, including the round-jet/plane-jet anomaly, airfoil stall, secondary flow separation, and recovery after separation. In addition to good performance inside the training dataset, the trained models yield similar performance as the baseline model outside the training dataset.},

In the present study, the UGKWP method simulates challenging flow problems with large Knudsen number variations, including supersonic flow around a sphere, hypersonic flow around a space vehicle, nozzle plume into vacuum, and side-jet impingement on the hypersonic flow. The UGKWP accurately captures complex flow structures and has been verified through experimental data or direct simulation Monte Carlo results. Regarding computational cost, the UGKWP method requires only 60 GiB of memory to simulate the three-dimensional space vehicle with 560,593 cells under various flow conditions, which is manageable even on personal workstations. Given its excellent efficiency and accuracy, the UGKWP method shows its substantial benefits in simulating multiscale flow for aerospace engineering applications.},

Different from conventional training methods, a new adaptive learning strategy that mitigates gradient imbalance through incorporating adaptive weights in conjunction with a dynamically adjusting learning rate is used during the training process to improve the convergence of PINNs. The performance of PINNs is assessed here by solving both the forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, by encapsulating the physical relations among relevant variables, PINNs demonstrate their effectiveness in accurately forecasting the compressor’s flowfield. PINNs also show obvious advantages over the traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches, particularly in scenarios lacking complete boundary conditions, as is often the case in inverse engineering problems. PINNs successfully reconstruct the flowfield of the compressor cascade solely based on partial velocity vectors and near-wall pressure information. Furthermore, PINNs show robust performance in the environment of various levels of aleatory uncertainties stemming from labeled data. This research provides evidence that PINNs can offer turbomachinery designers an additional and promising option alongside the current dominant CFD methods.},

  abstract     = {Scale-resolving solutions for computational fluid dynamics problems have usually been challenging due to their request for computing resources. A two-scale framework was proposed for more efficient solutions to couple a local fine-mesh solution with a global coarse-mesh solution. The methodology was successfully implemented and demonstrated for a canonical turbulent channel flow and for a tripped turbulent boundary layer. The solution mapping from the local fine-mesh to the global coarse-mesh region is realized by modifying the flow-governing equations in the under-resolved coarse-mesh region through adding extra forcing source terms generated from the space–time-averaged fine-mesh solutions. However, the high-gradient transitional region presents additional challenges when applying the Chebyshev spectral method for mapping the source terms; thus the high-gradient frontal region has not been fully resolved in the streamwise direction. In the present work, the propagation of the source terms is facilitated by machine learning tools (multilayer perceptron-based neural network) so as to implement the method in flowfields with high gradients or drastic changes in the mean velocity. The neural-network-based propagation model is shown to be capable of accurately estimating the source terms in the near-wall coarse-mesh region. The mean flow there thus can be nicely reproduced by the source-term propagation. The machine-learning tools thus provide potential as the more advanced source-term propagation method for the two-scale framework to be implemented in more complicated flowfields.},

To enforce smoothness of solutions across subdomains, points at domain interfaces are reconstructed using the data-driven gappy proper orthogonal decomposition method. The method is assessed on three high-dimensional test cases with shocks, including one with two-dimensional turbulent flow around the RAE2822. Results show that fully nonlinear ROMs predict fields more accurately in the vicinity of discontinuous features compared to their linear counterparts, which are more accurate in regions that are far from these discontinuities. Furthermore, irrespective of the DR method, DD-based ROMs outperformed their global counterparts in all test cases. Finally, models that used a combination of DR methods simultaneously showed superior performance near shockwaves and a significant improvement in total error compared to existing approaches that employ a single DR method in all subdomains.},

In a hypersonic crossed-field configuration acceleration problem, the increased electromagnetic field strength significantly enhances the two-fluid effects. When the load factor equals 3, which measures the strength of the electrode voltage and induced electromotive force, the relative velocity difference between the charged particles and neutrals can reach 28%.

It has been shown that EAD can be used to propel an airplane; however, improvements in thrust density are needed for practical applications. We recently proposed using multistaged ducted (MSD) EAD thrusters to improve performance: these devices enclose several serial EAD stages in a duct that contains an inlet and a nozzle. The duct can theoretically contribute to thrust and be used to control the flow properties. Here, we conduct experiments with single-stage and MSD thrusters with up to 10 stages using corona discharges as the ion source. Our 10-stage thruster can produce a thrust per unit cross-sectional area of up to . This is an order of magnitude higher than that used to fly the first EAD-propelled airplane and is achieved at a similar thrust-to-power ratio. We also compare the experimental results to the predictions from theoretical models and show that these agree with a coefficient of determination of 0.994, providing a means for quantitative design and optimization.},

  abstract     = {Using nano-sized energetic materials as fuel additives to hydrocarbon gel fuel has gained in popularity due to the advantages of higher energy density and shorter ignition delay times. Combustion characteristics and application performance of gel fuel containing 16% wt aluminum nanoparticles were investigated on a direct-connect scramjet platform with an inflow Mach number of 2, an inflow total temperature of 1700 K, and a fuel equivalence ratio ranging from 0.6 to 1.0. The gel fuel could be stably injected and atomized efficiently by a nitrogen-assisted injector. The combustion efficiency of JP-Al gel fuel was 4.27% higher than that of JP-10 gel fuel, while the addition of aluminum increased the density specific impulse by 6.34%, indicating that the addition of aluminum nanoparticles indeed presented a positive effect on combustion and engine performance. The wall deposition phenomenon of gel fuel was particularly slight as compared to that of slurry fuel cases. Unlike nanoaluminum-blended slurry fuel, nanoaluminum-blended gel fuel controlled the potential risk of increasing thermal load to the least degree within the scope of existing research, with wall heat flux increasing by 7.43% solely as a result of elevated airflow temperature, indicating its advantageous application prospect.},

  abstract     = {To suppress random vibration of aircraft models during wind tunnel tests, a novel magnetorheological elastomer (MRE)-based device with variable stiffness and variable damping (VSVD) is proposed, which is installed on the tail support system. Firstly, the dynamic characteristics of the tail support system are established using finite element model simulation to obtain the vibration mode and stress distribution. Next, the vibration reduction mechanism of the MRE-based tail support system is analyzed by solving a finite element model. Then, the magnetic-controlled VSVD device with an annular sandwich structure is proposed, and the decisive rheology material and structural parameters in relation to the tail support system’s dynamics are determined. Subsequently, the magnetically generated element with multicoils is designed to guarantee a large enough magnetic field, and the optimal structure parameters are obtained. Finally, random wind flow experiments in the wind tunnel and frequency sweep tests in the ground laboratory for the tail support system equipped on the VSVD device are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed device, respectively. The results under 15–200 Hz random excitation indicate the root mean square of acceleration at the centroid of the aircraft model with the VSVD device can be decreased by 46.8% compared to the system without the VSVD device.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this study is to develop a novel aircraft design approach using biomimetics as an alternative to traditional airframes. This approach is primarily inspired by the dragonfly wing, which possesses reinforcement structures composed of cross veins and longitudinal veins. These structures are assumed to regulate deformation and enhance stiffness, respectively. The cross veins were replicated using weighted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (WCVT) based on the out-of-plane displacement of the skin. In contrast, the longitudinal veins were replicated by extracting a centerline from the topology optimization (TO) results on the skin, achieved through image analysis techniques such as binarization and skeletonization. The longitudinal layout effectively reduces compliance by distributing internal loads, utilizing only essential reinforcements on the skin without increasing its mass. The WCVT layout significantly enhances the buckling resistance of the reinforced skin. As a result, the skin reinforced using both cross–longitudinal layouts from TO and WCVT exhibited a buckling load 2.7 times greater while maintaining a lower mass compared to conventional layouts.},

In this paper, we first calculate the errors involved in the simplified geometric analysis used to model the CBT by considering two different effects: variations in the bending moment through the sample and nonlinearities in the material response of the fibers. The first effect, modeled using Euler’s elastica, results in a set of design guidelines for the test geometry (i.e., length of the grips and the specimens) in order to achieve moderate errors in moment and curvature predictions. The nonlinearity in the fiber behavior (tension stiffening and compression softening) does not have a strong effect on the curvature but produces significant variations in the bending stiffness of HSCs as well as the maximum strain observed in the fibers due to the shift in the neutral axis. This indicates that accounting for the nonlinear behavior of fibers is necessary in order to accurately predict the failure properties of HSCs under bending.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, fiber-optic shape sensing, which means reconstructing the deformation state of structures from strain information measured by fiber-optic sensors, has attracted interest from many fields. Most of the existing shape-sensing research for flexible three-dimensional (3D) slender structures is based on simple strain-curvature transformation, relying on standardized substrates with a circular cross section and particular forms of fiber layouts. To develop a more general shape-sensing method that can be applied to a wider range of practical engineering conditions, in this paper, the strain–displacement relationship of 3D slender structures under the effect of multiple deformation modes coupling is described by introducing absolute nodal coordinate formulation element, and the deformation reconstruction problem is reorganized into a nonlinear optimization problem that can be applied to large deformation and accommodates different cross-sectional shapes and optical fiber layouts. Due to the rapid increase in the calculation difficulties of nonlinear optimization problems with the number of variables, an element-by-element solving strategy is adopted, and nodal degrees of freedom that have less influence on the overall shape of the structure are merged. In addition, in order to address the issue of local strain anomalies caused by unmodeled factors such as section warping, the pointwise matching between the theoretical strains and measured strains is relaxed to an average matching in subregions to capture the overall deformation, improving the robustness and computational efficiency of the solution process. The accuracy and computational performance of the proposed method are verified through numerical simulation and experiment.},

This significantly reduces the shear stiffness of the hinge, which might reduce the first resonance frequency of the structure. We rationalize the free vibration of the system and the interplay between shearing and bending deformation by deriving an analytical formulation using Timoshenko’s beam theory. The framework is derived for a general beam and applied to a case of two flexures of arbitrary geometry with no core. Investigating the specific geometry of flat flexures reveals the existence of two nondimensional length ratios that capture the interplay between inertia, bending stiffness, and shear stiffness of the hinge. Our model explains the dependence of the frequency on the parameters of the system, as well as the dimensions that determine the transition between bending- and shear-dominated vibration modes. Comparison with finite element simulations shows that our analytic framework is able to predict the first natural frequency with less than 1% error. Additionally, an experimental validation was carried out using steel flexures and acrylic panels, showing good agreement with the predictions.},

Active vibration control is necessary for precision operation and long-term service of such structures, and a flexible actuator with a large actuation force and stroke is a key limitation. In this paper, super-coiled (SC) actuators, fabricated from fibers by twisting and inserting, were introduced to actively suppress the low-frequency vibration of flexible structures. Two SC actuators were symmetrically mounted on both surfaces of a cantilever beam to generate actuation forces. The force model of thermally driven SC actuators was developed, and a dynamic model of a cantilever beam with SC actuators was then proposed and validated via experimental actuation. Three types of control strategies, open loop, velocity negative feedback, and linear quadratic regulator (LQR), were adopted for vibration suppression. The results show that the proposed model fits quite well with the experimental data, and the maximum error between the experiment and the prediction is 3.90% among various driven currents. In velocity negative feedback control and LQR control, a 91.83% reduction of dynamic response is achieved, which validates the feasibility of using the actuator for low-frequency vibration control.},

The theory behind each approach is detailed and successfully verified on representative test cases. The resulting modeling environment is then exemplified in a study of the flight dynamics of a flexible aircraft demonstrator model. Results indicate that, for large wing deformations, a noticeable effect of fuselage aerodynamic interference appears on the wing aeroelastic behavior. The polar corrections improve the drag estimations and allow capturing lift decrements due to stall onset at high induced angles of attack, which then affects the gust loads. The wake discretization scheme enables a reduction of the computational time for dynamic simulations on a full aircraft model by about 20% while keeping the arising error negligibly small.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of nonlinear aerodynamics is essential for the transonic aeroelastic analysis of flight vehicles. Though reduced-order aerodynamic models are cheap and reasonable tools, it is still a tough problem to accurately evaluate the unsteady pressure distributions on the surface of an elastic structure. This paper presents a nonlinear data-driven modeling approach based on the high-fidelity simulations in the following three steps. The first step is to compute the dominant modes of unsteady pressure distributions through the proper orthogonal decomposition. The pressure snapshots used for the feature extraction are sampled under a multilevel sine-sweep excitation. The second step is to obtain the low-dimensional temporal dynamics of the coefficients of these modes via polynomial nonlinear state-space identification. The linear estimation implemented by employing the dynamic mode decomposition with control algorithm serves as the initialization of the nonlinear optimization. The third step is to reconstruct the unsteady pressure distributions under arbitrary structural excitation from the temporal coefficients. The paper validates the approach via two numerical examples of the transonic aerodynamic–structural coupling problem. One is an NACA0012 airfoil, and the other is an AGARD 445.6 wing. The examples show that the proposed approach exhibits both accurate and robust performance in the prediction of unsteady pressure distributions, aerodynamic forces, and aeroelastic responses. In particular, the approach well predicts the physical features at the fluid–structure coupling interface, previously neglected in the system identification of aerodynamic systems. Therefore, the approach serves as a promising tool for data-driven aeroelastic analysis.},

  abstract     = {The impact of shock formation and vortex dynamics on airfoil flutter in the transonic regime is investigated through a series of two-dimensional time-accurate simulations of a sinusoidally pitching airfoil at a Reynolds number of 10,000. To gain insight into transonic flutter in the fully nonlinear regime, an energy-based approach that employs prescribed kinematics is utilized. Flutter stability boundaries are identified as a function of the Mach number and the reduced velocity, the latter of which is a surrogate for structural stiffness or flight speed. The results show a subcritical instability near Mach numbers of for a range of oscillation frequencies. Additionally, three shock-induced mechanisms are identified that influence the transfer of energy from the flow to the airfoil. The primary mechanism is flow separation triggered by the generation of a lambda shock. The influence of the lambda-shock dynamics on airfoil flow separation is determined for different Mach numbers, providing insight into the well-known “transonic dip” observed in flutter boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials and metasurfaces disclosed new degrees of freedom in controlling the acoustic field. Exploiting the generalized Snell law and the generalized law of reflection, the assembly of subwavelength unit cells is able to achieve extraordinary refraction and reflection by means of a controlled phase delay introduced in the field by the treated boundaries. The space-coiling design is one of the most powerful for cells in this metadevice class, providing effective low-thickness metasurfaces. However, space-coiling suffers from a narrow frequency operating range due to the intrinsic connection between the design operating wavelength and the characteristic dimensions of the metasurface. This work defines a procedure based on numerical optimization for designing space-coiling cells for modular acoustic metasurfaces, extending the frequency range in which the metasurface is effective. The set comprises eight different unit cells, each introducing a tailored phase shift in the reflected field that can be arranged to produce the desired acoustic effect. The broadband design is obtained by minimizing the dependency on the operating frequency of phase delay introduced by the cells, keeping the overall thickness below a quarter of the design wavelength. Results are shown for the benchmark problem of a metasurface modifying the reflection angle from a boundary.},

Using flowfield data of computational fluid dynamic simulations, the acoustic extrapolation is carried out with the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings approach. The obtained results are then compared to fully resolved simulations, where it is first ensured that the aerodynamic characteristics agree sufficiently. It was found that the noise characteristic is well predicted by the actuator line method, whereas discrepancies occurred in the prediction of propeller–wing interaction noise. Finally, the parameter space was extended by increasing the angle of attack for the configuration in high-lift and stall conditions. Here, the deviations in the acoustic behavior between the actuator line method and fully resolved simulations increase. Nevertheless, the qualitative characteristic of directivity is also well predicted in these conditions. Beside the main advantage of the actuator line method to perform larger propeller parameter studies without creating a body mesh, computational time can be reduced. It was found that for this configuration, a time saving of 10% could be achieved.},

  abstract     = {The performance of waveriders is greatly influenced by the wall pressure distribution. To achieve the goal of designing a waverider based on the complex two-dimensional pressure distribution, this study proposes a methodology called the stream-surface iteration-based flowfield calculation (SIFC) method. This method discretizes the three-dimensional flowfield with curved stream surfaces and approximates the flow around each point with a unique axisymmetric flow. Moreover, this method iteratively solves the shape of each stream surface and the corresponding flowfield to deal with ill-posed problems. To verify its effectiveness, the SIFC method was first applied to inversely solve the two external annular supersonic flowfields. Then, it was used for the waverider design. The computational fluid dynamics results showed that the relative error of the wall pressure was less than 2.6% for the annular supersonic flowfields. The wall pressure determines the geometric shapes and mechanical properties of waveriders. The pressure center of a waverider can be shifted by 12% of the length in the flow direction and 7.4% of the width in the crossflow direction by altering the input wall pressure. This shift will cause the waverider to produce more than 30% extra trim drag when cruising at the design Mach number.},

  abstract     = {Skimming the sea at ultralow altitudes can be achieved by repeatedly touching and bouncing off water surface (commonly referred to as skipping), thus giving birth to skippable anti-ship missiles. However, the high impact load during skipping poses a safety hazard to the structure. Whether a missile can rebound primarily depends on the initial kinematic parameters, which also influence the impact load along with the configuration parameters. Therefore, it is important to optimize both of them. Due to the differences in types and complicated coupling of these parameters, the optimization problem becomes highly complex. In this paper, the grouped sequential quadratic programming (GSQP) algorithm is proposed to reduce the nonlinearity and nonconvexity of the problem. By bringing together the global search capability of cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm and the local search strength of GSQP, a combined optimization framework using decomposition strategies is constructed. With the support of fluid–structure interaction models, the optimization is performed to reduce impact load for the missile. The results demonstrate that simultaneously optimizing the configuration and initial kinematic parameters yields a reduction of 12.2% in the impact load on the premise of successful skipping. This research provides a valuable reference for the design of future skippable anti-ship missiles.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to study the dynamics of 3D plates under uniform and nonuniform temperature distributions in the framework of the space-fractional generalized thermoelasticity (S-FGT) approach. The quadratic eigenvalue problem is obtained, which means that the thermoelastic damping plays a meaningful role due to the plate’s thermal energy absorption. The plate’s complex frequency spectrum and mode shapes (free ends) under two different temperature distributions are considered for different values of the fractional continua order and the length scale parameter . For the first four frequencies, the fractional modes closest to the experimental results and the classical modes are presented with the absolute differences between them. For the nonuniform temperature distribution case, the mode shape analysis is performed assuming that modulus of elasticity, thermal expansion, and specific heat parameters are functions of the temperature. The primary outcomes of the paper can be stated as follows: 1) the S-FGT approach analysis gives more reliable results than the classical (local) theory; 2) the peak point of the out-of-plane mode amplitude is shifted toward the warmed zone; 3) a mode shifting is observed for the uniform temperature distribution in contrast to the nonuniform temperature distribution; 4) the fractional order derivative and length scale parameter depend on temperature, similar to other material properties such as elastic modulus, specific heat, and coefficients of thermal expansion; 5) a decrease in the fractional order is observed, while temperature increases for the fixed length scale parameter. These novelties indicate that the S-FGT approach establishes a new model for analyzing materials under heating, and the results may be beneficial for designing thermal structures.},

Despite the reinforcement provided by stitching, the ACSSC structures on vehicles’ outer surfaces remain vulnerable to damage resulting from the excessively high deformation and vibration that occur during high-speed flight. Accordingly, experimental tests were conducted to investigate the failure characteristics of ACSSCs under bending vibration conditions. The tests demonstrated that the ACSSC structures were prone to fatigue failure caused by vibration, which resulted in significant shear damage in the aerogel core. Furthermore, the study introduced a new method for indirectly characterizing the fatigue life of shear damage in the core. Finite element analysis was undertaken to elucidate the cause of the cracking near the bottom layer of the core. The results indicated that the crack location of the aerogel core was littered with the high stiffness and deformation of internal stitches.},

However, as piston theories are valid for flow regimes where , they are inaccurate for modeling the aerodynamic response associated with aeroelastic phenomena in subsonic or low-supersonic flow regimes. Unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to learn the unsteady pressure response, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is applied to the error between the CFD-computed pressure fluctuation and the piston-theory-predicted pressure fluctuation. This process is performed on two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow domains over various flow regimes. For both scenarios, the DMD analysis learns dominant spatial modes in the error that constitute low-order models, which may be used to improve the pressure response and are confirmed to be physically relevant. A method for computing aeroelastic stability with these leading modes is discussed and applied to fluid–structural beam and panel configurations. The results are compared against prior numerical and experimental investigations to quantify the improvement in prediction obtained by the DMD-augmented piston theory.},

Flow compression in CCR intakes occurs through a combination of a curved ramp shock wave and a series of compression waves. In general, such a combination offers the best features of the canonical air intake families. That is, pressure recovery in CCR intakes is better than simple ramp (planar ramp) air intakes, and pressure ratios in CCR intakes are better than Prandtl–Mayer air intakes. A modified Kantrowitz criterion for startability is proposed to accommodate the nonuniform Mach number distribution in the cross-stream direction at the intake throat that is inevitably realized in CCR air intakes. The starting characteristics of different design configurations that fall within the family of CCR air intakes are analyzed, and a comparison is made with planar ramp and Prandtl–Meyer intakes. Inviscid flow numerical experiments of intake starting were carried out to successfully verify the starting characteristics predicted by the analytical model. The analytical framework presented here can be employed as a general tool for optimizing air intake design based on startability, efficiency, and other performance considerations.},

With a flag, the flowfield measurements showed the reattachment of the shear layer onto the wing surface and the re-formation of the leading-edge vortex, whereas the clean wing had completely stalled flow at the same angle of attack. Over a wide range of angles of attack, mass ratios, and flag lengths, the maximum lift enhancement was attained when the dimensionless frequency of flag oscillations was in an optimal range and the flag-tip velocity had sufficient amplitude. The optimal dimensionless frequency range corresponded to the natural shear layer instabilities of the clean wing. The excitation in this range substantially increased the coherency of the separated flow due to the flag oscillations. The main mechanism of the lift increase is the excitation of the shear layer, which exhibits convective instability. This is very different from the lift enhancement mechanism on airfoils where the flags lock-in to the wake instability, which is known to have an absolute instability at the poststall angles of attack of the clean airfoil.},

  abstract     = {Swirled flows often feature global modes that become manifest as skew-symmetric helical vortices, also known as precessing vortex cores, which dominate the flow dynamics. This study uses linear stability analysis (LSA) and bispectral mode decomposition (BMD) to elucidate the interactions of such modes in the turbulent, nonreacting, swirled flow of an industrial, three-passage, aeroengine fuel injector obtained via large-eddy simulation. A discrete Fourier transform in time retrieves the modes as narrow-banded, evenly spaced peaks in the spectral amplitude of the turbulent signal, where the second mode is dominant. Similar arrangements are known to appear as a consequence of a saturated global mode, which amplifies its higher harmonic frequencies due to nonlinear effects. We show that each mode appears in the spectrum of LSA eigenvalues, indicating that the subdominant peaks are caused not only due to nonlinear interactions but that they have an underlying linear mechanism. A structural sensitivity analysis based on the adjoint LSA shows that the observed helical modes originate close to the exit plane of the fuel injector. Finally, the BMD reveals significant nonlinear interaction between the individual modes. It is hypothesized that this interaction amplifies the modes, which are linearly stable, leading to the strong dynamics in the flow.},

  abstract     = {This study considers the development and evolution of the swirling turbulent wake and their link to the turbulence present in the wake. A wake generator produces swirling wakes with a minimum of artifacts that would complicate the flow. Four swirling wakes have been studied with swirl numbers ranging from 0.19 to 0.37, and the results are compared to those of a nonswirling wake. Two-component laser-Doppler anemometry has been used to measure mean and turbulence quantities in the wake, and the uncertainty of these quantities has been determined. Careful alignment of the laser-Doppler anemometry system and large numbers of independent samples were used to obtain second-order turbulence statistics with low uncertainty. The results indicate that swirl strength impacts wake behavior, and changes in the behavior are linked to modifications in the turbulence. Faster wake width growth and centerline velocity deficit decay have been observed for wakes with higher swirl strength. The results indicate that a minimum swirl level is required to significantly impact wake behavior, and, at some level of swirl, the enhanced wake evolution observed saturates. For the conditions tested, the swirl number that enhances wake diffusion before saturation has been determined to lie between 0.21 and 0.37.},

The flow condition refers to the after-shock wave flow on a blunt-body hypersonic vehicle (Duan and Martín, AIAA Journal, Vol. 49, No. 1, 2011, pp. 172–184). Direct numerical simulation results show that the injection of these light gases has little effect on the mean velocity profiles but significantly reduces the near-wall density and skin friction. The separation and fragmentation of near-wall vortical structures are restrained, and the Reynolds shear stress decreases. The injection of inert He inhibits the dissociation reaction of and weakens the chemical nonequilibrium effect, resulting in enhanced mean and fluctuating temperatures. The injection of active promotes the reaction between and , which increases the mean temperature but inhibits its fluctuation. After decomposing the mean skin friction into physics-informed contributions, both injections largely reduce the turbulent kinetic energy production term and the spatial growth term of the flow, through lowering the near-wall density and reducing vortices.},

To replicate rotor/stator interactions occurring in turbomachinery, harmonic forcing of the backpressure is imposed at the outlet. Various perturbation frequencies are prescribed and encompass different regimes, from a fully locked configuration to a decoupling between the unperturbed and forced flows. The mean solution is, however, found to be independent of the perturbation. In a triple-decomposition framework, the coherent component of the flow is extracted by phase averaging. Organized structures of streamwise velocity and turbulence kinetic energy are highlighted. Whereas these structures are of similar shapes beneath the shock system, their extent in the downstream boundary layer is controlled by the frequency of the perturbation. The mean and harmonic turbulent stress budgets are presented. A typical three-peak distribution of mean turbulent diffusion is reported, which is also found to appear for coherent turbulent diffusion. Harmonic production arises mainly from the mean shear and its modulation.},

The flapping jets’ frequencies were varied at 0 (non-flapping case), 15, and 22 kHz, respectively. Discharging non-flapping jets at the leading edge and the bottom wall upstream side remarkably enhanced pressure fluctuations and density gradients. The reverse flow near the bottom wall and the amplitude of the recirculation inside the cavity were enhanced when non-flapping jets were discharged at the leading edge. Discharging non-flapping jets at the bottom wall downstream side reduced the pressure fluctuations of the frequency lower than 8 kHz. Discharging flapping jets changed flowfields, although the flow control effects of discharging positions were dominant. The flapping-jet discharging at the leading edge reduced the size of the primary recirculation. Discharging flapping jets at the bottom wall downstream side showed further suppression effects on fluctuations than the non-flapping-jet discharging case.

Pressure measurements and flame chemiluminescence observations were combined to study the initial flame formation and combustion mode transitions. In addition, flame luminosity standard deviation and fast Fourier transform power spectral density (PSD) were post-processed to assess the impact of equivalence ratio and aft wall height on combustion modes as well as oscillations. It is indicated that increasing the equivalence ratio leads to a transition from lifted shear-layer mode to ramjet mode. Elevating the cavity aft wall height improves the combustor’s self-ignition capability and promotes the transition from lifted shear-layer mode to ramjet mode as long as flame stabilization is achieved. It is found that increasing the equivalence ratio and aft wall height also results in more intense combustion oscillations; besides, raising the cavity aft wall height could accentuate the predominant frequency of low-frequency oscillations in the combustor. Finally, it is demonstrated that the application of spark plasma effectively suppresses these low-frequency combustion oscillations, which is a promising active control method in the scramjet engine.},

The multimodel synthesis is based on a single linear-time invariant (LTI) controller optimized over multiple operating points, whereas the gain scheduling method results in a control law based on the interpolation of multiple LTI controllers designed at the various operating points. Both methods are compared with simple LTI controllers based solely on the nominal operating point in two sensor–actuator architectures: in feedforward (respectively, feedback) the estimation sensor is located upstream (respectively, downstream) of the actuator. In the feedforward case, significant performance loss is observed in off-design conditions, regardless of the method used. In the feedback case, multimodel synthesis enhances slightly performance robustness (but improvement is weak because of the wide range of freestream velocity variation), while the gain scheduling approach succeeds in strongly reducing the perturbation amplitude over the entire range of variation.},

In this paper, the effect of finite transducer size is investigated by applying spatial averaging or wavenumber filters to a database of hypersonic wall pressure generated from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) that simulates the turbulent portion of the boundary layer over a sharp 7° half-angle cone at nominally Mach 8. A good comparison between the DNS and the experiment in the Sandia Hypersonic Wind Tunnel at Mach 8 is achieved after spatial averaging is applied to the DNS data over an area similar to the sensing area of the transducer. The study shows that a finite sensor size similar to that of the PCB132 transducer can cause significant attenuation in the root-mean-square and power spectral density (PSD) of wall-pressure fluctuations, and the attenuation effect is identical between cone and flat plate configurations at the same friction Reynolds number. The Corcos theory is found to successfully compensate for the attenuated high-frequency components of the wall-pressure PSD.},

A telecentric optical configuration was applied to the background-oriented schlieren measurement at the large-scale hypersonic wind tunnel facility. A basic tomographic reconstruction method, such as filtered backprojection, was used to reconstruct the projection datasets with some combination of denoising calculations. Results showed that the reconstructed flowfield was first noisy without denoising. With the denoising considerations proposed in this study, the flow physics, such as oblique shock waves emanating from the vehicle nose tip and engine lip, were clearly visualized. Therefore, the telecentric optical setup and denoising processes proposed in this study can successfully reconstruct a complex three-dimensional flowfield obtained at a large-scale wind tunnel facility. This setup and denoising process can also apply to other applications in large-scale wind tunnel experiments.},

  abstract     = {Based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), the large-amplitude vibration behavior of shallow spherical shells made of functionally graded materials (FGMs) due to the rapid decrease of temperature (cooling shock) is investigated. FGM is assumed to be a mixture of stainless steel and low-carbon steel whose properties are considered temperature dependent and are estimated based on the power-law model. According to FSDT and von Kármán assumptions, the governing equations of motion in conjunction with corresponding boundary conditions are obtained using Hamilton’s principle. The temperature distribution is also achieved by means of the 1D Fourier transient heat conduction equation, considering two time-dependent thermal loading scenarios. The considered thermal boundary conditions allow that a temperature difference is created with a time delay for the structure under cooling shock. Also, the results of recent experiments are employed to estimate the temperature-dependent properties of structures. In the solution approach, the generalized differential quadrature method and the Newmark-beta integration scheme are utilized. Selected numerical results are presented to study the effects of thermal load rapidity time, geometry, magnitude of thermal load, and material gradient index on the thermally induced vibrations of spherical shells. Stresses generated in the shell due to the thermally induced vibrations are also investigated.},

The present work aims to predict the free vibration behavior of laminated sandwich plates using wavelet finite element (WFE). Different kinds of mother wavelets, namely, B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI), Gaussian, Haar, Daubechies 6 (db6), Biorthogonal 3.7 (bior3.7), Coiflet5 (coif5), Symlets (sym8), Morlet, Mexican hat (Mh), and Meyer mother wavelets, are employed in WFE for predicting the frequencies. Both symmetric and unsymmetric laminates are studied using the proposed approaches. A wide range of problems, including the influence of the geometric and material properties and end conditions on the free vibration behavior of the laminated sandwich plates, are solved. The effectiveness of the WFE over the conventional finite element method in terms of computational efficiency is discussed. In conclusion, BSWI-based WFE method (WFEM) is found to be the most accurate and computationally efficient in predicting the free vibration behavior of laminated sandwich plates.

  abstract     = {Aerodynamic interference occurs when biplane wings are placed close to each other. Investigating aerodynamic interference on the transonic flutter characteristics of these wings is an important issue. A numerical model is configured with the rigid airfoil positioned above the elastic airfoil at different positions to simulate various levels of aerodynamic interference. The flutter characteristics of the elastic airfoil are analyzed using an efficient aeroelastic analysis method based on the reduced order model. The results suggest that when the rigid airfoil is positioned directly above the elastic airfoil the aerodynamic interference accelerates the airflow on the upper surface of the elastic airfoil. This leads to a subsonic phenomenon, and the instability mode after the subsonic dip gradually transitions from first order to second order. Furthermore, aerodynamic interference leads to an earlier occurrence of a shock wave on the upper surface of the elastic airfoil, which causes earlier appearances of transonic dip and S-shape flutter boundary. Moreover, the S-shape flutter boundary is widened as a consequence of the interference. Remarkably, the part of the S-shape flutter boundary is solely induced by the first-order mode instability, which is different from the typical alternating instability of the first-order and second-order modes together. When the rigid airfoil is positioned diagonally above the elastic airfoil, aerodynamic interference causes a later occurrence of a shock wave on the upper surface of the elastic airfoil, which leads to later appearances of the transonic dip and S-shape flutter boundary. Additionally, the S-shape flutter boundary is widened.},

  abstract     = {Over the past years, advanced prognostic models and approaches have been developed. Most existing approaches are tailored to one specific system and cannot adaptively be used on different systems. This can lead to years of research and expertise being put into implementing prognostic models without the capacity to predict system failures, either because of a lack of data or data quality or because failure behavior cannot be captured by data-driven models. In addition, prognostic models are often evaluated using metrics only related to the correctness of predictions, preventing meaningful evaluation of operational performance. This paper makes use of a framework that can automatically choose prognostic settings based on specific system data. It simultaneously optimizes the choice of methodologies using metrics that capture multiple aspects of prediction quality. We apply this framework to both a simulated data set and a real aircraft data set to characterize the impact of metrics on the choice of prognostic methodologies. The results show that the choice of optimization metric greatly impacts the output of the generic prognostic framework and the overall performance. In addition, a definition for data suitability is provided and assessed on the aircraft system data sets.},

We demonstrate and validate FREEDOM against numerical and physical experiments for the case of an electromechanical actuator employed for secondary flight controls.

Four tip-loss corrections, including two from literature, are also analyzed and compared to lifting-line and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) blade-resolved computations. The best practices and the most effective tip-loss correction lead to a final model that is compared to lifting-line, RANS, and unsteady RANS computations for different pitch angles and incidence angles, on the ONERA HAD-1 three-bladed light propeller.

The flow emulators are based on a) decoder convolutional neural networks, which generate solution snapshots in the computational domain, and b) design-variable hypernetworks, which provide pointwise predictions in physical space. The flow emulators are used to predict parametric subsonic and transonic compressor flows in an industrial design use case with baseline geometry corresponding to the NASA rotor 37. Both methods are effective in representing unseen subsonic airfoil flowfields, with mean errors less than 1%. The hypernetwork-based method generalizes more effectively under transonic conditions and is used in place of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to drive shape optimization at varying rotor speeds. Under transonic conditions and at nominal speed, the emulator-driven optimization achieves the same optimal design as CFD in a reduced number of iterations at a fraction of the online computational cost while providing similarly performing designs at off-nominal conditions. It is remarked that once the emulator is trained once offline, it can be used online to conduct many different design optimizations, e.g., with different objective functions, constraints, and tradeoffs. These results establish the utility of design-variable hypernetworks as a viable emulation and optimization tool in practical industrial design.},

A theoretical stall inception prediction model was developed to account for the wire mesh casing treatment, which was modeled as an impedance boundary condition. This model was validated on a low-speed compressor, replicating the experimental trend with reliable precision. The impedance boundary condition effectively attenuates disturbances and confines the distribution range of perturbations compared to the solid wall boundary condition. Furthermore, the installation of the wire mesh casing treatment induced a downstream shift in the passage shock wave and enhanced the flow capacity in the blade tip region. The effects of the casing treatment on different installation locations were investigated, and the results indicated that the maximum stall margin improvement occurred when the casing treatment was positioned at the midchord location. The integrated design of the casing treatment and blade profile, along with the established prediction model, is also discussed. This model demonstrates reliable precision when compared to the experimental results and addresses the need for rapid design iteration during the initial design phase.},

  abstract     = {Traditional optimization methods usually perform aerodynamic design by manipulating geometry shapes, which would ignore useful information in flowfields. In order to improve the defect, a novel pressure-based optimization (PBO) method is developed in this study to conduct the design of airfoils using deep learning techniques. In this method, a one-dimensional convolutional auto-encoder (1D-CAE) is employed to extract representative features from the pressure distributions. With these latent features as inputs, two multilayer perceptrons are constructed to predict airfoil profiles and forces, respectively. Furthermore, these deep learning models are combined with the genetic algorithm to minimize the drag of the RAE2822 airfoil. Finally, two data mining techniques are implemented to investigate the optimization mechanisms. Results show that, after the latent dimension reaches 12, the reconstructed pressure distributions by 1D-CAE agree well with the original ones. The predicted forces are close to the observations, with the mean absolute relative error below 0.21% for and 0.69% for on the testing set. Meanwhile, the predicted airfoils show a good match with the true profiles, and the root mean square error is less than 0.08% for all the testing samples. Optimized results show that, compared with several state-of-the-art optimization approaches, the proposed PBO method achieves a lower drag coefficient and has the potential to provide better airfoil designs. In addition, the discovered mechanisms indicate that the pressure distributions could be manipulated by varying pressure features to achieve drag reduction of airfoils.},

To achieve this, we first identify the primary challenge in the meshless coarsening application to CFV. Specifically, the challenge lies in the poorly coarsened grid, which results in a degradation of the convergence rate. The reason for this is that the coarsening stencils were coupled with the discretization stencil. To address the issue, we proposed a new coarsening strategy on CFV that adequately utilizes node information on the fine-level mesh. The proposed methodology shows superior coarsening rates compared to the basic meshless cell coarsening, regardless of the dimension and type of mesh elements, resulting in significant speedup in convergence. Various computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with three-dimensional complex geometries are presented, and their results demonstrate approximately seven times faster convergence compared to the single-grid method. The overall results verify that the multicloud method with the proposed coarsening procedure provides a powerful tool for practical CFD simulations by reducing the computation time, and it enables researchers and engineers to simulate and optimize real-world systems more efficiently.},

All configurations have similar total orifice neck area, orifice height, and cavity volume, resulting in a similar Helmholtz frequency. Experiments are conducted for orifices mounted on a flat plate under a quiescent condition. The mean jet velocity exhibits resonant peaks at several excitation frequencies, which also gave rise to the sound pressure levels. The resonant frequencies and peak jet velocities were found to depend on the excitation amplitude and orifice configuration. Investigation of the jet momentum penetration into the quiescent air above the different orifice configurations shows that the momentum issuing from the rectangular slot decays much quicker than that of the circular orifices, irrespective of whether the SJA is excited at resonance or not. The most favorable performance (i.e., the highest momentum in the jet core) was obtained with the array of circular orifices having a smaller orifice diameter, even at off-resonance excitations. The work herein shows the possibility of reducing the SJA noise by 8–10 dB by operating the SJA at a frequency away from the Helmholtz frequency while still achieving comparable levels of jet momentum penetration into the crossflow.},

This noise can be predicted using semi-analytical models that require input measurements of the incoming turbulent flow parameters. However, the turbulence parameters are inherently difficult to measure accurately. These parameters, which include the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate, have a stochastic nature. This study aims to investigate how small variations in the measurements of turbulence parameters affect the uncertainty of the predicted airfoil–turbulence interaction noise. This is achieved by applying polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to the semi-analytical model of Amiet’s theory for airfoil-interaction noise. The validity of the deterministic and stochastic simulations is ensured by comparisons against available experimental data from the literature, and Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. Uncertainty quantification is then performed using a stochastic collocation technique, where the aerodynamic noise is evaluated at specific collocation points to estimate the coefficients required for PCE. Both the individual and combined effects of varying the uncertain input turbulence parameters are simulated to quantify the uncertainty of the output aerodynamic noise. The insights gained from the results suggest it is important to incorporate the stochastic behavior of the incoming turbulent flow in operational models for airfoil–turbulence interaction noise predictions.},

In addition to the VPM reformulation, a new anisotropic dynamic model of subfilter-scale (SFS) vortex stretching is developed. This SFS model is well suited for turbulent flows with coherent vortical structures, where the predominant cascade mechanism is vortex stretching. The mean and fluctuating components of turbulent flow and Reynolds stresses are validated through the simulation of a turbulent round jet. The computational efficiency of the scheme is showcased in the simulation of an aircraft rotor in hover, showing our meshless LES to be 100 times faster than a mesh-based LES with similar fidelity.

The interaction of the windward side vortex with the physical barrier of the forebody surface was observed to greatly affect its behavior and the interaction downstream. In some configurations, the merged vortex exhibited a breakdown. The flowfield and the vortex dynamics under various conditions are discussed in detail to provide insight into manipulating the flowfield using physics-based flow control.},

The complex flow phenomena associated with the impinging jet flowfield are studied. The power spectral density (PSD) of instantaneous pressure reveals a discrete impingement tone. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the velocity and pressure is also done for both cases to extract the most dominant modes of the flow. The fundamental impingement tone frequency obtained from the PSD of pressure is identical to that of the first dominant pressure mode obtained from DMD. Both axisymmetric and semihelical modes are present for the case, but only axisymmetric modes are there in the case, and it is noted that the modes corresponding to the fundamental tone have an axisymmetric structure. Also, one dominant mode showing the wall jet structures denoting the liftoff of fluid from the wall after impingement at some radial distance away from the stagnation region is present in both impingement distance cases.},

To include the effects of compressibility, ad hoc corrections have been proposed but result in an inconsistent thermodynamic state between the manifold and flow simulation. In this work, an iterative algorithm to consistently incorporate compressibility effects into manifold-based models is developed. The manifold inputs (fuel and oxidizer temperatures and pressure) are determined iteratively to reflect the nonnegligible variations in thermodynamic state (expressed in terms of density and internal energy in flow simulations) that are characteristic of supersonic combustion. The algorithm is demonstrated on data from simulations of high-speed reacting mixing layers and is significantly more accurate than established approaches that only partially couple the manifold in compressible flow simulations. The proposed approach eliminates partial coupling approximation errors in excess of 10 and 20% for temperature and water source term.},

The experimental TBL had a sufficiently low momentum thickness Reynolds number, such that there were no energetic organized large-scale structures in the outer region, as evidenced from measurements of the premultiplied wavenumber–frequency spectra. The periodically pulsed plasma actuator, placed inside the outer region of TBL, introduced a synthetic large-scale structure, and the boundary-layer response to this synthetic structure downstream of the actuator at select wall-normal and streamwise locations was investigated. The turbulence amplitude modulating effect of the synthetic large-scale structure, within the inner and log-linear regions of the boundary layer, was isolated and analyzed using a phase-locked analysis. The dynamic interaction of the synthetic large-scale structure and smaller-scale turbulent motions was quantified using a modulation coefficient, and a strong positive correlation within the inner and log regions of the boundary layer was measured. The streamwise development of the synthetic large-scale structure and its modulating effect on the near-wall turbulence across several streamwise locations are described. Profiles of the phase speed at these streamwise locations were extracted and were found to be constant within the log region, further confirming a strong coupling between the near-wall fluctuations in turbulence intensity and the synthetic large-scale motions introduced in the outer region. Overall, the turbulence amplitude modulation effect induced by the synthetic large-scale structure was found to be dynamically similar to the large-scale modulation measured in canonical TBLs at higher Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract     = {Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of turbulent boundary layers subjected to spatially varying streamwise pressure gradients are conducted to assess the predictive performance of three wall models: ordinary differential equation equilibrium, integral nonequilibrium, and partial differential equation (PDE) nonequilibrium models. The test case is based on experiments conducted by Volino (Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 897, Aug. 2020, p. A2), where the flow is subjected successively to zero pressure gradient (ZPG), favorable pressure gradient (FPG), recovery ZPG, and adverse pressure gradient (APG) regions. Skin friction is overpredicted in FPG by all the wall models. For equilibrium and integral models, this overprediction is attributed to the strong deviation of mean velocity profiles within FPG from the log law, used explicitly in the equilibrium and implicitly in the integral model. The overprediction is more pronounced for the PDE model, which is attributed to dynamic correction of wall-model eddy viscosity for resolved stresses and a lack of correction for pressure gradient. Potential remedies to mitigate this problem are proposed. Grid refinement improves wall-stress predictions in both FPG and APG but only affects the outer profiles in APG, revealing that accurate wall-flux modeling is more critical for APG. Anisotropic grid analysis shows streamwise grid refinement to be more crucial than spanwise for the convergence of skin-friction, outer velocity, and Reynolds stress profiles.},

In this work, we present a campaign of direct numerical simulations of a turbulent boundary layer on a microramp, to investigate the effect of the Mach number, from subsonic to supersonic regime. We show that the flow topology changes significantly because of compressibility effects, and that typical wake features do not scale linearly with the geometry dimensions but rather depend on the incoming flow conditions. Moreover, we investigate the spectral content in time and space of the wake, which is dominated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability developing along the shear layer. For larger Mach numbers, the shedding onset is postponed and exhibits a lower peak frequency that evolves in space. Finally, we extract the spatially coherent structures convected in the wake by means of a dynamic mode decomposition along the characteristics, which represents effectively and efficiently the evolution of the entire field, despite the convective nature of the flow under consideration.},

The investigation was conducted in the context of boundary-layer interactions in low-speed crossflow conditions through the use of coaxial and v-shaped geometries. Time-averaged velocity field measurements showed that the toroidal region of vorticity induced by the coaxial geometry in quiescent air resulted in the formation of a horseshoe vortex in crossflow. Similarly, the v-shaped actuator resulted in the formation of streamwise vortices. The resulting boundary layers had s-shaped streamwise velocity profiles as measured in the wall-normal direction characteristic for the flow downstream of a conventional vortex generator pair, due to the three-dimensional mixing induced by coherent vortex structures. A simplified model based on intermolecular momentum transfer through collisions is proposed to explain the fundamental discharge–air interactions and the induced flowfields. These results inform the applications of various magnetically driven discharges in the field of aerodynamic flow control.},

Inlet geometries have noticeable effects on gas pressures inside inlets, and the gas pressures of the two concave inlets are the highest. Among the four inlets considered here, the rounded concave inlet performs the best in terms of compression and collection performances. Relative to the simple slope inlet, the rounded concave inlet achieves a rate of increase of over 120% in gas pressure and more than 110% in gas flow rate. GSI accommodation coefficients play a crucial role in both the pressure and mass flux inside the inlet, and the drop of the GSI accommodation coefficient from 1 to 0.2 brings about a considerable increase in the pressure and mass flux, achieving an increase of a factor of 8 and 5, respectively. Therefore, smoothing the inlet surface is an effective means of improving the compression and collection performances of inlets.},

  abstract     = {We present a discussion on theoretical, experimental, and computational research studies on Görtler instability and the related transition to turbulence occurring in compressible boundary layers over concave surfaces. We first examine the theoretical results on primary and secondary instabilities, emphasizing the role of receptivity, the mechanism by which external agents, such as freestream fluctuations or wall roughness, act on a boundary layer to trigger Görtler vortices. We review experimental findings obtained from measurements in supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels and discuss studies employing numerical methods, focusing on the direct numerical simulation approach. The research in these two last sections is surveyed according to the geometrical configuration, from simple concave walls to more complex surfaces of hypersonic vehicles. The experimental investigations have been successful in the visualizations of Görtler vortices, in the measurement of the wall-heat transfer in the transitional region, and in the computation of the Görtler-vortex growth rates, although detailed boundary-layer velocity measurements are still missing. Direct numerical simulations have confirmed instability results emerging from stability theories and revealed nonlinear interactions between Görtler vortices and other disturbances. The established initial-boundary-value receptivity theory can certainly benefit from more advanced experimental measurements, and receptivity results should be used in combination with direct numerical simulations. A major conclusion of our review is therefore that the understanding of Görtler vortices should be pursued by a combined methodology including theoretical analysis based on the receptivity formalism, direct numerical simulation, and experiments. Highly desirable outcomes of such endeavor are the prediction of the location and extension of the transition region, and a model for the transition process. We finally highlight further prospects and challenges on fundamental and applied research on Görtler instability and transition in compressible flows.},

  abstract     = {Ogive cylinders are representative designs of hypersonic forebodies and harbor several flow complexities. This work evaluates the effects of nose bluntness of ogive-cylinder forebodies on their laminar, transitional, and turbulent boundary layers (BLs). Laminar simulations indicate that the thickness of BL and entropy layer (EL) increases with nose bluntness, with the latter displaying a stronger sensitivity to nose radius due to the increased strength and curvature of the leading-edge shock system. Linear perturbation analysis identifies the presence of the second mode, the first mode, and EL modes with increasing bluntness. While the former two are prevalent over a significant streamwise extent, EL modes are limited to the upstream region, well within the swallowing length. Using direct numerical simulations, it is found that transition over the sharpest nose design occurs through the modal fundamental resonance route, driven by second-mode instabilities. Due to weakened BL modes, the blunter geometries undergo transition further downstream in the low-amplitude freestream perturbation environment tested in this study. The transition mechanism in the blunter geometries is intermittent in nature and appears to be driven by turbulent spots generated from streamwise vortices reminiscent of Klebanoff modes.},

The simulated flowfields demonstrate that the recompression shock wave oscillates back and forth at a Strouhal number of the order of 0.01. Frequency analysis of fluctuations in the drag coefficient and base pressure reveals that these fluctuations can be predominantly attributed to oscillations in the recompression shock wave. While the recompression shock wave propagates upstream, local shock waves occur alternately in the upper and lower free-shear layers, with a Strouhal number of the order 0.1, due to the instability of free-shear layers. The repeated occurrence of these local shock waves causes the recirculation region to shrink, resulting in a decrease in the base pressure. Conversely, while the recompression shock wave propagates downstream, no local shock wave occurs and the recirculation region expands, leading to an increase in the base pressure. These results suggest that the interactions among the recompression shock wave, local shock wave, and free shear layer give rise to fluctuations in the base pressure of the capsule, which in turn can affect its dynamic instability.},

This study explores a novel mitigation method using an air film, a thin insulating coolant layer on the surface. The researchers successfully reduced the reentry blackout by employing a gas injection system. Through a coupled approach using computational fluid dynamics and a frequency-dependent finite-difference time-domain method, the plasma flow properties and electromagnetic propagation were analyzed around a test model in a wind tunnel in DLR (German Aerospace Center). The numerical results indicated that the injected nitrogen gas formed an insulating air film layer on the surface. The thin layer advected backward, maintaining a low temperature without ionization, and covered the object in the wake region. The electromagnetic waves propagated and reached a distant area because the electron density was low. It means that the air film layer acted as a propagation window for the telecommunication waves. Thus, communication blackouts will be avoidable because electromagnetic waves can transmit through the air-film layer. It concluded that the air film effect, developed as a thermal protection technique, is a novel mitigation scheme for reentry blackouts.},

Here, an acoustic velocity potential formulation for the finite element model propagation model is extended to examine the relative effectiveness of driving the model with measured acoustic pressure at the source and termination and driving with acoustic pressure at the source and closing the computational domain with measured termination impedance. Also assessed is the appropriate location of measurement microphones to satisfy plane wave requirements for the computational model. Source acoustic pressure and termination impedance driving the propagation model produce superior eduction results with lower residual error, though the model driven with pressure at both the source and termination produces acceptable spectra. The microphone location in the gazing flow test facility is judged to be adequate for the range of grazing flow Mach number and frequency considered. Examination of impedance spectra for a range of lining samples has revealed a correlation of a decrease in spectrum quality, measured by observed data scatter, with a decreasing face sheet open area ratio and therefore with increasing lining nonlinearity.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an efficient method for the modal analysis of vertical cyclic periodic tanks partially filled with liquid. The fluid effect on the vibration of the structure is modeled by introducing an added mass matrix. Because the added mass matrix formed by the boundary element method is fully populated, it requires considerable computer memory when the wet modal analysis involves substantial wetted elements. Additionally, the dense added mass matrix will destroy the sparsity of the total mass matrix, resulting in a significant computational burden for solving the eigenvalue problem. Based on the cyclic periodic property of the fluid/structure system, it is proved that the added mass matrix of the vertical cyclic periodic tank also has a block-circulant property. Therefore, according to the group representation theory, the original eigenvalue problem of the wet modal analysis can be decoupled into a series of independent subproblems. Because the computational scale of the subproblems is much smaller than that of the original eigenvalue problem, the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational cost. Numerical examples show that the proposed method can solve the modal analysis of the cyclic periodic fluid/structure system with high accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Nonplanar crack growth holds a critical role in aeronautical structures, necessitating effective analysis under mixed fatigue loading to assess structural integrity. This study introduces a reduced-order modeling (ROM) method for predicting nonplanar crack growth in structural digital twins. The method’s advantage lies in its representation of the entire crack surface morphology using a B-spline surface, which better captures its impact on crack growth. The symmetric Galerkin boundary element method–finite element method coupling method is adopted as a full-order method to generate the crack database. Isoparametric coordinates of the crack surface and stress intensity factor serve as input and output, respectively, for training the ROM, which integrates -means clustering, principal component analysis, and Gaussian process regression. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a rotorcraft-mast-like component. Results reveal superior fracture mechanics parameter prediction compared to the crack-front-based ROM. Furthermore, the method boasts three orders of magnitude greater efficiency than full-order simulation, enabling its coupling with approaches like Monte Carlo for probabilistic crack growth analysis. Future work entails integrating our method into the probabilistic framework of digital twins.},

In this work, a dual-function cloak is proposed in which there is an edge object with an intelligent control system in an elastic wave metamaterial plate. Based on the image and scattering cancellation methods, the scattering mode coefficients are derived. The effects of material and structural parameters on dynamic stress concentration and scattering amplitude are investigated. The cloaking configuration consists of concentric layers of piezoelectric (lead–zirconate–titanate [PZT]) patches, which are connected with the intelligent control system. The theoretical and experiment results show that the dual-function cloak can effectively reduce the dynamic stress concentration and scattering amplitude. Compared to the range from 100 to 450 Hz for the original structure without a control system, the effective frequency range of the intelligent cloak can be extended from 100 to 500 Hz. The present design with both strength enhancement and invisibility of the edge target is expected to provide new ideas for the development of mechanical metamaterials and novel structures.},

In severe cases, the measurement deviation may even exceed 100%. This article analyzes the flight data of the space model flight test MF-1 and finds that there is a significant hot spot effect. This paper reproduces the temperature measurement process of MF-1 thin-skin structure along the trajectory through aerodynamic thermal/heat transfer coupling calculations. The difference between the flight data and the coupling calculation results is compared and analyzed. Based on the flight test of MF-1, the formation mechanism of the cold/hot spot effect and its impact on wall heat flux are studied. It is found that local temperature discontinuities can generate an additional wall-normal velocity near the wall, which will generate an additional wall-normal convective heat transfer, further increasing the measurement deviation of wall heat flux. The research results of this paper have important guiding significance for the development of heat flux sensors for aerospace model flight tests and correctly conducting heat flux measurements.},

The knowledge and techniques derived from these studies have often been applied to analyze and control the aerodynamic noise of low-speed axial/mixed-flow fans used in ventilation and cooling applications. Despite the structural similarity between aeroengine fans and axial-flow fans for ventilation and cooling, the differences in their rotor–stator spacing and operating parameters raise the question of whether or not they share completely identical or approximately similar unsteady flow and noise generation mechanisms. In this paper, we employ a large-eddy simulation to investigate the low-speed unsteady flow inside a mixed-flow fan. The triple decomposition method is used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of the time-averaged, ensemble-averaged, and stochastic fluctuation velocities and pressures in both stationary and rotating coordinate systems. The results show that the unsteady flow and noise generation mechanisms inside the fan investigated in this paper are significantly different from those of aeroengine fans, mainly due to two aspects. First, the wake effect on the velocity field of the fan studied in this paper is almost negligible, and the potential interaction is the primary source of the nonuniform spatial distribution of the time-averaged velocity field and the periodic velocity disturbance. Second, the turbulent energy spectrum of the stochastic fluctuation velocity is greatly distinct from the classic turbulence spectra in the low-frequency bands.},

Particle image velocimetry and hot-wire measurements indicate a jetlike flow with a nearly uniform core, which monotonously contracts in the streamwise direction and the surrounding, growing unsteady shear layers. These complex dynamics result in a limited region with a desired flow profile and turbulence level. The experimental results shed light on the flow generated by a full-scale fan-array wind generator, and they indicate the need for further improvements via properly designed add-ons and dedicated control algorithms.},

In this study, we explore the practical feasibility of multilayer perceptron (MLP) for estimating aerodynamic loads in gusts, when confounded by noisy and spatially distributed sparse surface pressure measurements. As a demonstration, a nonslender delta wing experiencing various gusts with different initial and final conditions is considered. Time-resolved lift and drag, and spatially distributed sparse surface pressure measurements are collected in a towing-tank facility. The nonlinear MLP model is used to estimate gust scenarios that are unseen in training progress. A filtering process allows us to examine the fluctuation of the dynamic response from the pressure measurements on the MLP. Estimation results show that the MLP model is able to capture the relationship between surface pressure and aerodynamic loads with a minimum quantity of learning samples, delivering accurate estimations, despite the slightly large errors for the cases at the boundary of the datasets. The results also indicate that the dynamic response of the pressure measurements has an influence on the learning of MLP. We further utilize gradient maps to perform a sensitivity analysis, so as to evaluate the contribution of the pressure data to the estimation of gust loads. This study reveals the significant contribution of the sensors located near the leading edge and at the nose of the delta wing. Our findings suggest the potential for an efficient sensor deployment strategy in data-driven aerodynamic load estimation.},

The geometry and flow conditions were motivated by an experimental investigation, which was conducted in order to provide data for validating numerical approaches. Because the high-Reynolds-number and three-dimensional shape of the experimental model is challenging, even for approximate numerical techniques, a prior investigation was initiated in order to provide benchmark results that are accessible via wall-resolved large-eddy simulation. It was found that by increasing the bump height, the Reynolds number could be reduced, and flow separation would occur. The modified bump now serves as a surrogate for the original Gaussian bump, producing smooth-body separation. In the present study, solutions are obtained to the unsteady three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations utilizing a high-fidelity computational scheme and an implicit time-marching approach. A series of simulations is carried out for bumps of varying heights, for both the three-dimensional configuration and a spanwise-periodic subset, corresponding to flow at the midspan. A number of metrics are provided to attest to the accuracy of simulations. Comparisons are made between the spanwise-periodic subset and the three-dimensional configuration, and features of the flowfields are described. The generation of an arch vortex structure evolving about the speed bump geometry is elucidated.},

The cross-field method allows for the automatic blocking so that anisotropic quadrilateral meshes generation and adaptation to resolve flow features can be carried out.

  abstract     = {Aerodynamic shape optimization has become well established, with designers routinely performing wing and full aircraft optimizations with hundreds of geometric design variables. However, increased geometric design freedom increases optimization difficulty. These optimizations converge slowly, often taking hundreds of design iterations. In addition, designers have to manually scale design variables through trial and error to achieve a well-behaved optimization problem, which is tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a sensitivity-based geometric parametrization approach that maps the design space onto one better suited for gradient-based optimization while keeping the same optimization problem. At the same time, the process can automatically determine design variable scaling so that the new optimization problem can be solved more effectively. We demonstrate the approach on two aerodynamic shape optimizations and show improved terminal convergence trends compared to the traditional approach, without requiring manual adjustments to the design variable scaling.},

  abstract     = {A novel, efficient, edge-based viscous (EBV) discretization method has been recently developed and implemented in a practical, unstructured-grid, node-centered, finite-volume flow solver. The EBV method is applied to viscous-kernel computations that include evaluations of mean-flow viscous fluxes, turbulence-model and chemistry-model diffusion terms, and the corresponding Jacobian contributions. Initially, the EBV method had been implemented for tetrahedral grids and demonstrated multifold acceleration of all viscous-kernel computations. This paper presents an extension of the EBV method for mixed-element grids. In addition to the primal edges of a given mixed-element grid, virtual edges are introduced to connect cell nodes that are not connected by a primal edge. The EBV method uses an efficient loop over all (primal and virtual) edges and features a compact discretization stencil based on the nearest neighbors. This study verifies the EBV method and assesses its efficiency on mixed-element grids by comparing the EBV solution accuracy and iterative convergence with those of well-established solutions obtained using a cell-based viscous (CBV) discretization method. The EBV solver’s memory footprint is optimized and often smaller than the memory footprint of the CBV solver. An EBV implementation of a nonlinear extension of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model, SA-neg-QCR2000, is also presented and verified. The SA-neg-QCR2000 model is used for simulating turbulent corner flows. Multifold speedup is demonstrated for all viscous-kernel computations, resulting in significant reduction of the time to solutions for several benchmark mixed-element-grid computations, including simulations of subsonic flows around a hemisphere–cylinder configuration and a NASA juncture-flow model, a supersonic flow through a long square duct, and a hypersonic, chemically reacting flow around a blunt body.},

The computational cost of tracking all particles is intolerable, while the solutions with insufficient numbers of particles often fail to achieve enough fidelity. This research proposes a finite particle approach for high-fidelity simulation on helicopter brownout, providing particle number concentration distributions to quantitatively evaluate the risk of dust clouds. Based on the summarization of criteria for counting particle number concentration, the total number of particles in the calculation is presented to balance fidelity and efficiency. According to the entrainment model results, only a finite number of particles are injected into the flow to improve computational efficiency. The trajectories of injected particles are reconstructed for high-fidelity results. Combining the Richardson extrapolation and the assessment of average particle spacings, the total number of particles in the calculation is recommended to be . The finite particle approach is adopted to investigate dust clouds in various flight conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared to hovering, the maximum value of particle number concentration is greater and closer to the rotor center when flying with a low advance ratio.},

The main aim is to enhance the prediction capabilities of an existing Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model for laminar separation bubbles. The recently developed field inversion method has been chosen to infer corrections to the shear stress transport turbulence model. An innovative approach has been proposed to reduce the computational cost of the modeling procedure. The objective function makes use of the friction coefficient to compare data coming from the RANS model with reference large-eddy simulation data available in the literature. The performed test cases responded well to the optimization procedure which provided a correction field that boosts the turbulent kinetic energy within the bubble. The proposed procedure is the necessary building block to define a new turbulence model able to overcome the present limitations in simulating laminar separation bubbles.},

  abstract     = {A numerical investigation of the effect of small leading-edge bluntness on the linear stability regime in high-speed boundary layers for flat plates was carried out using linear stability theory. While it is known that increasing leading-edge bluntness leads to stabilization of the linear instability, it is not completely understood when leading-edge bluntness effects become relevant; in other words, for which leading-edge radii the primary instability regime is affected for flat plates at higher Mach numbers. For the so-called “sharp” geometries, it is assumed that the influence of the nose radius on stability and transition is negligible. For cones, it is generally accepted that nose radii resulting in Reynolds numbers (based on nose radius) smaller than 1000 can be considered sharp. However, no clear guidelines supported by numerical or experimental data exist to conclusively determine what constitutes a sharp leading edge for a flat plate. In this work, bluntness effects are assessed by considering the influence of the leading-edge radius on the linear stability characteristics for high-speed flat-plate boundary layers. It was found from linear stability calculations that surprisingly small leading-edge radii have significant effects on the critical Reynolds number and spatial amplification rates, thus resulting in substantially reduced maximum -factors.},

The harmonic balance method for unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation is introduced to large-eddy simulation (LES), utilizing the difference in timescales between the periodic flow and the turbulent fluctuations. Considering their nonlinear mutual interaction, periodic flow and turbulent fluctuations are computed by iterating short-time LES and the harmonic balance method. The HB-LES is applied to the analysis of a Stokes boundary-layer problem at the Reynolds number based on the Stokes boundary-layer thickness of 1790. The characteristics and evolution of the turbulent structures near the wall are consistent with those observed in the results of conventional LES. Both the phase-averaged periodic component and the turbulence statistics show good quantitative agreement with the experimental results and conventional LES. Furthermore, nonlinearity of the periodic component caused by the mutual interaction between turbulent fluctuations and the periodic component is reproduced as a rapid increase in wall-shear stress. The proposed HB-LES demonstrated approximately a 10-fold improvement in computational efficiency.},

The flames were exposed to transverse acoustic waves tuned to produce pressure antinode acoustic forcing at various frequencies and amplitudes. The flame responses were recorded using high-speed Schlieren and chemiluminescence imaging. The center jet was set to be the same between the single and the coaxial jets at two different Reynolds numbers. The annular flow of the coaxial jet was set to have the same bulk velocity as the ambient coflow, a configuration here called a coaxial single jet. The configuration was so named because it was expected that a coaxial jet having the same annular bulk velocity as the ambient coflow would produce results similar to that of the single jet in the same coflow.

  abstract     = {A two-dimensional unsteady reactive Euler solver is employed to model rotating detonation combustion (RDC). A baseline case is chosen, and several combustor geometric and design parameters are varied individually in order to assess their effect on flowfield structure, exhaust flow properties, and performance. The parameters of interest are the perimeter and axial lengths of the combustor annulus, mass flux, outlet throat area, air injector throat area, and equivalence ratio. Quantification of the isentropically available work (IAW) in the exhaust flow is employed as a performance criterion. IAW is primarily affected by mass flux and outlet throat area through the effects of one-dimensional flow and, to a lesser degree, by perimeter and axial length through changes in the fraction of the flow that experiences irreversible shock processing. For all cases in the present study, this fraction appears to be solely determined by the ratio of detonation height to axial length. This ratio is also highly correlated to the angle of the oblique shock and the strength of the flow fluctuations. The predicted wave speed is between 90 and 95% of the Chapman–Jouguet velocity for a range of equivalence ratios between 0.6 and 1.4.},

The combustor had an axial air inlet and a 50% exit constriction. The measured (negative) pressure gain values agree with the results in the literature for similar inlet-to-exit area ratios. The base drag correction on the centerbody was found to be the greatest source of uncertainty for the thrust. While thrust is the predominant source of random uncertainty in the pressure gain calculation, significant systematic errors can be committed due to the assumed exit Mach number. The impact of this assumption becomes more detrimental the closer to positive the measured pressure gain is. By experimentally evaluating the exit Mach number, the random and systematic uncertainty in pressure gain both decreased, indicating that this should be an essential step. A definitive demonstration of gain is challenging, given the assessed uncertainties, and recommendations are provided to increase the precision of the equivalent available pressure methodology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, various compressibility correction terms of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model are evaluated in hypersonic compressible flows. A unified transport equation containing six correction terms is equipped to investigate the separate and combined effects of the correction terms. The numerical results of the hypersonic flat-plate cases and corner cases are, respectively, calculated and compared with direct numerical simulation data and experimental data. By using the coarse-grained uncertainty metrics, errors on the profiles and wall coefficients are measured and analyzed in several cases. The results suggest that compressibility corrections should be applied when the strong cold-wall effect or the compressibility effect exists in the hypersonic flows. Catris and Aupoix’s correction (“Density Corrections for Turbulence Models,” Aerospace Science and Technology, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2000, pp. 1–11) and Séror, Rubin, Peigin, and Epstein’s correction (“Implementation and Validation of the Spalart–Allmaras Turbulence Model in Parallel Environment,” Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 42, No. 1, 2005, pp. 179–188) offer much more accurate predictions than other models in hypersonic corner cases. As the compressibility effect further increases, the conservation correction and Shur, Strelets, Zajkov, Gulyaev, Kozlov, and Sekundov’s compressibility correction (“Comparative Numerical Testing of One-and Two-Equation Turbulence Models for Flows with Separation and Reattachment,” 33rd Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, AIAA Paper 1995-0863, 1995) drastically increase the prediction error of the profiles.

This is important for the aerodynamic design of the nacelle, as it may assist in the characterization of candidate designs. This work uses experimental data obtained from a quasi-2D rig configuration to provide an assessment of the CFD methods typically used within an industrial context. A range of operating conditions are investigated to assess the sensitivity of the boundary layer to changes in inlet Mach number and mass flow through a notional windmilling engine. Fully turbulent and transitional boundary-layer computations are used to determine the characteristics of the boundary layer and the interaction with the shock on the nacelle cowl. The correlation between the onset of shock-induced boundary-layer separation and the preshock Mach number is assessed, and it was found that the CFD is able to discern the onset of boundary-layer separation.},

In this study, we construct a dataset under Mach numbers from 2 to 5 based on a self-designed scramjet combustor model and propose a physical convolutional neural network flowfield reconstruction method based on channel interaction (PICNNCI). This method embeds Euler equations that characterize the flow characteristics of inviscid fluids as physical constraints to solve the low-accuracy problem of traditional convolutional neural networks arising due to insufficient prior information. The model first performs dimensional transformations on temporal and spatial information input and converts a one-dimensional column vector into a two-dimensional vector to meet the convolution operation rules. Then, convolution is used for feature extraction to output the predicted flowfield, including velocity, pressure, and density fields. Finally, the predicted flowfield is optimized using the Euler equation and compared with the results obtained by numerical calculation and traditional neural network methods. The average peak signal-to-noise ratio of PICNNCI reaches 34.01 dB, and the linear correlation reaches 0.994.},

  abstract     = {Beneficial effects of forced air-jet vortex generators in controlling shock-induced flow separation motivated us to study forced jet injection in detail to understand the advantageous control effects. We performed implicit large-eddy simulations to examine the influence of sinusoidally forced injection of a spanwise-inclined jet in supersonic crossflow. Two forcing frequencies were considered (with and 0.0062) in a crossflow at Mach 2.5 and momentum-thickness Reynolds number of 7000. The underexpansion of the jet has a near-linear dependence on the injection pressure. Consequently, in the near field, the major vortices pulsate with the injection pressure. Statistical analysis using triple decomposition revealed that periodic oscillations of the major counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) result in momentum transfer by major CVPs, also on their lateral sides, leading to enhanced mixing and lateral spreading, which is beneficial for separation control. Three-dimensional dynamic mode decomposition revealed that forced injection induces a large-scale clockwise rotation of the major vortex. These effects are weak at low forcing frequency. High-frequency jet forcing thus leads to more efficient control of flow separation. On the other hand, periodic oscillations cause these vortical structures to dissipate and breakdown faster in the midfield region than for steady jets. The placement of forced jets is therefore an important parameter when used for separation-control purposes.},

  abstract     = {Modern experimental techniques were used to obtain detailed aerodynamic and thermodynamic data for turbulent supersonic jets. Operating points from the work of Seiner et al. for heated Mach 2 jets were used as a starting point for the matrix of cases examined here using a geometrically similar Mach 2 nozzle. Two additional nozzles were examined having design Mach numbers of 1.36 and 1.63. For each Mach number, multiple jet temperatures were investigated. Jet measurements were first made with stagnation pressure and temperature probes for comparison to the previous experiments. The experiments focused on modern nonintrusive measurement techniques, including particle image velocimetry for mean and root-mean-square (rms) velocities, and rotationally resolved Raman scattering spectroscopy for mean and rms temperatures. Experimental results showed that as jet Mach number increases, the overall jet mixing rate decreases, as indicated by the potential core length, downstream mean velocities, and turbulence levels. Similar behavior was observed in the mean temperatures and rms temperatures. The suppression of turbulence as the jet Mach number increases is due to compressibility. For a fixed jet Mach number, increasing the jet temperature resulted in faster mixing by all measures. Peak turbulent stress levels, located along the lipline of the jet, demonstrated trends in individual stress components that differed depending on whether jet Mach number or temperature was varied, but indicated that the turbulence structure parameter was very similar when varying either jet temperature or Mach number.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate numerical models and boundary conditions are required to accurately model hypersonic flows involving local nonequilibrium effects, which can be induced by the wall effect and large gradients of flow properties in the flowfield. Considering the strong density gradient near the wall for hypersonic flows, an improved Gökçen slip model is proposed in this paper by introducing a scaled mean free path to the conventional Gökçen’s model. Hypersonic argon flows over a circular cylinder and a blunt plate in the near-continuum regime are simulated by the proposed slip model with the conventional Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations and an extended continuum model, which was recently developed to model the shear nonequilibrium effect in high-speed flows. The accuracy of the new boundary model is evaluated by comparing the results with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The effects of Knudsen number, Mach number, and wall temperature on the nonequilibrium degree and aerodynamic predictions are also investigated. The numerical results show that the improved model can well predict the surface friction and heat transfer coefficients, exhibiting much better performance than the existing continuum models.},

  abstract     = {The structural integrity of sapphire optical windows was numerically and experimentally evaluated under the wall heat flux of the scramjet intake. The considered heating profile was during 60 s, and the heating profile for the numerical and experimental approaches was the same. A numerical study was performed using the finite element method; the numerical results predicted that the maximum temperature of the optical window under the heating condition was about 600 K, the maximum principal stress was less than the strength of the sapphire, and the failure of the optical window would not occur based on the brittle Coulomb–Mohr material failure theory. The heating test was performed using an electrical heater under the heating condition, and the morphology was investigated using scanning electron and atomic force microscopies. The experimental results indicated that no cracks or fractures occurred on the surface of the optical window after the heating test, except for a slight change in the shape and roughness of the microstructure.},
