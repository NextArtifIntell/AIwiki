  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale model reduction strategy tailored to address the Poisson equation within heterogeneous perforated domains. The numerical simulation of this intricate problem is impeded by its multiscale characteristics, necessitating an exceptionally fine mesh to adequately capture all relevant details. To overcome the challenges inherent in the multiscale nature of the perforations, we introduce a coarse space constructed using the constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM). This involves constructing basis functions through a sequence of local energy minimization problems over eigenspaces containing localized information pertaining to the heterogeneities. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that the oversampling layers depend on the local eigenvalues, thereby implicating the local geometry as well. Additionally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

In this paper, we develop a multiscale hierarchy framework for objective molecular dynamics (OMD), a reduced-order molecular dynamics with a certain symmetry, that connects it to the statistical kinetic equation, and the macroscopic hydrodynamic model. In the mesoscopic regime, we exploit two interaction scalings that lead, respectively, to either a mean-field type or to a Boltzmann-type equation. It turns out that, under the special symmetry of OMD, the mean-field scaling leads to a substantially simplified Vlasov equation that extinguishes the underlying molecular interaction rule, whereas the Boltzmann scaling yields a meaningful reduced model called the HOMO-energetic Boltzmann equation. At the macroscopic level, we derive the corresponding Euler and Navier–Stokes systems by conducting a detailed asymptotic analysis. The symmetry again significantly reduces the complexity of the resulting hydrodynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nematic ordering describes the phenomenon where anisotropic molecules tend to locally align, like matches in a matchbox. This ordering can arise in solids (as nematic elastomers), liquids (as liquid crystals), and in gases. In the 1940s, Onsager described how nematic ordering can arise in dilute colloidal suspensions from the molecular point of view. However, the kinetic theory of nonspherical molecules has not, thus far, accounted for phenomena relating to the presence of nematic ordering. In this work we develop a kinetic theory for the behavior of rarified calamitic (rodlike) gases in the presence of nematic ordering. Building on previous work by Curtiss, we derive from kinetic theory the rate of work hypothesis that forms the starting point for Leslie–Ericksen theory. We incorporate ideas from the variational theory of nematic liquid crystals to create a moment closure that preserves the coupling between the laws of linear and angular momentum. The coupling between these laws is a key feature of our theory, in contrast to the kinetic theory proposed by Curtiss and Dahler, where the couple stress tensor is assumed to be zero. This coupling allows the characterization of anisotropic phenomena arising from the nematic ordering. Furthermore, the theory leads to an energy functional that is a compressible variant of the classical Oseen–Frank energy (with a pressure-dependent Frank constant) and to an inviscid compressible analogue of the Leslie–Ericksen equations. The emergence of compressible aspects in the theory for nematic fluids enhances our understanding of these complex systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work we develop a homogenization methodology to upscale mathematical descriptions of microcirculatory blood flow from the microscale (where individual vessels are resolved) to the macroscopic (or tissue) scale. Due to the assumed two-phase nature of blood and specific features of red blood cells (RBCs), mathematical models for blood flow in the microcirculation are highly nonlinear, coupling the flow and RBC concentrations (haematocrit). In contrast to previous works which accomplished blood-flow homogenization by assuming that the haematocrit level remains constant, here we allow for spatial heterogeneity in the haematocrit concentration and thus begin with a nonlinear microscale model. We simplify the analysis by considering the limit of small haematocrit heterogeneity which prevails when variations in haematocrit concentration between neighboring vessels are small. Homogenization results in a system of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow and haematocrit transport at the macroscale, in which a nonlinear Darcy-type model relates the flow and pressure gradient via a haematocrit-dependent permeability tensor. During the analysis we obtain further that haematocrit transport at the macroscale is governed by a purely advective equation. Applying the theory to particular examples of two- and three-dimensional geometries of periodic networks, we calculate the effective permeability tensor associated with blood flow in these vascular networks. We demonstrate how the statistical distribution of vessel lengths and diameters, together with the average haematocrit level, affect the statistical properties of the macroscopic permeability tensor. These data can be used to simulate blood flow and haematocrit transport at the macroscale.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We employ intelligent dissipative particle dynamics that combines dissipative particle dynamics and machine learning techniques to perform the coarse graining of a water molecule system, including single- and multiple-water coarse graining. This coarse graining is a challenging task due to the high-density nature of water, the presence of long-range electrostatic interaction, and the difficulty of packing multiple molecules. A TIP3P model is used to simulate water in molecular dynamics simulations, providing the raw data for the machine learning model. The machine learning model predicts the conservative and dissipative force fields used in dissipative particle dynamics to replicate the static and dynamic properties in the molecular dynamics simulation. A constrained K-means clustering method is used to dynamically pack an equal number of water molecules into a coarse graining particle, ensuring uniform size and mass for every particle. The six coarse graining levels are examined to determine whether both the static and dynamic properties are replicated for the single-water and multiple-water models. The simulation results show that the static properties of water, such as temperature, radial distribution function, and velocity probability density function, can be successfully preserved by the present coarse graining method at each level. The dynamic properties, such as viscosity and diffusion, are difficult to preserve due to an overestimated friction force, and depend on a tunable parameter called time correlation limit, such that these properties can be successfully replicated by choosing a proper time correlation limit for each coarse graining level.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, our goal is to integrate classical mathematical models with deep neural networks by introducing two novel deep neural network models for image segmentation known as Double-well Nets. Drawing inspirations from the Potts model, our models leverage neural networks to represent a region force functional. We extend the well-known MBO (Merriman–Bence–Osher) scheme to solve the Potts model. The widely recognized Potts model is approximated using a double-well potential and then solved by an operator-splitting method, which turns out to be an extension of the well-known MBO scheme. Subsequently, we replace the region force functional in the Potts model with a UNet-type network, which is data-driven and is designed to capture multiscale features of images, and also introduce control variables to enhance effectiveness. The resulting algorithm is a neural network activated by a function that minimizes the double-well potential. What sets our proposed Double-well Nets apart from many existing deep learning methods for image segmentation is their strong mathematical foundation. They are derived from the network approximation theory and employ the MBO scheme to approximately solve the Potts model. By incorporating mathematical principles, Double-well Nets bridge the MBO scheme and neural networks, and offer an alternative perspective for designing networks with mathematical backgrounds. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the performance of Double-well Nets, showcasing their superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art neural networks. Overall, our work represents a valuable contribution to the field of image segmentation by combining the strengths of classical variational models and deep neural networks. The Double-well Nets introduce an innovative approach that leverages mathematical foundations to enhance segmentation performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Machine-learning (ML) based discretization has been developed to simulate complex partial differential equations (PDEs) with tremendous success across various fields. These learned PDE solvers can effectively resolve the underlying solution structures of interest and achieve a level of accuracy which often requires an order-of-magnitude finer grid for a conventional numerical method using polynomial-based approximations. In a previous work [13], we introduced a learned finite volume discretization that further incorporates the semi-Lagrangian (SL) mechanism, enabling larger CFL numbers for stability. However, the efficiency and effectiveness of such a methodology heavily rely on the availability of abundant high-resolution training data, which can be prohibitively expensive to obtain. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel multifidelity ML-based SL method for transport equations. This method leverages a combination of a small amount of high-fidelity data and sufficient but cheaper low-fidelity data. The approach is designed based on a composite convolutional neural network architecture that explores the inherent correlation between high-fidelity and low-fidelity data. The proposed method demonstrates the capability to achieve a reasonable level of accuracy, particularly in scenarios where a single-fidelity model fails to generalize effectively. We further extend the method to the nonlinear Vlasov–Poisson system by employing high-order Runge–Kutta exponential integrators. A collection of numerical tests are provided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In order to alleviate the computational costs of fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics, we present a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) particle method based on the theory of Koopman wavefunctions. Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg’s principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman’s classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz that introduces the trajectories of computational particles—the koopmons—sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully’s nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.},

We employ a highly effective adaptive mesh method to resolve the potential singularity sufficiently close to the potential blow-up time. Resolution study shows that our numerical method is at least second-order accurate. Scaling analysis and the dynamic rescaling method are presented to quantitatively study the scaling properties of the potential singularity. We demonstrate that this potential blow-up is stable with respect to the perturbation of initial data. Our numerical study shows that the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations with our initial data develop finite-time blow-up when the Hölder exponent is smaller than some critical value , which has the potential to be . We also study the -dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with no swirl, and observe that the critical Hölder exponent is close to . Compared with Elgindi’s blow-up result in a similar setting [T. M. Elgindi, Ann. of Math., 194 (2021), pp. 647–727], our potential blow-up scenario has a different Hölder continuity property in the initial data and the scaling properties of the two initial data are also quite different. We also propose a relatively simple one-dimensional model and numerically verify its approximation to the -dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations. This one-dimensional model sheds useful light to our understanding of the blow-up mechanism for the -dimensional Euler equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by an application involving additively manufactured bioresorbable polymer scaffolds supporting bone tissue regeneration, we investigate the impact of uncertain geometry perturbations on the effective mechanical properties of elastic rods. To be more precise, we consider elastic rods modeled as three-dimensional linearly elastic bodies occupying randomly perturbed domains. Our focus is on a model where the cross-section of the rod is shifted along the longitudinal axis with stationary increments. To efficiently obtain accurate estimates on the resulting uncertainty of the effective elastic moduli, we use a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Specifically, we rigorously derive a one-dimensional surrogate model by analyzing the slender-rod Gamma-limit. Additionally, we establish qualitative and quantitative stochastic homogenization results for the one-dimensional surrogate model. To compare the fluctuations of the surrogate with the original three-dimensional model, we perform numerical simulations by means of finite element analysis and Monte Carlo methods.},

We derive a minimal port-Hamiltonian formulation of a general class of interacting particle systems driven by alignment and potential-based force dynamics which include the Cucker–Smale model with potential interaction and the second order Kuramoto model. The port-Hamiltonian structure allows us to characterize conserved quantities, such as Casimir functions, as well as the long-time behavior using a LaSalle-type argument on the particle level. It is then shown that the port-Hamiltonian structure is preserved in the mean-field limit, and an analogue of the LaSalle invariance principle is studied in the space of probability measures equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. The results on the particle and mean-field limit yield a new perspective on uniform stability of general interacting particle systems. Moreover, as the minimal port-Hamiltonian formulation is closed, we identify the ports of the subsystems which admit generalized mass-spring-damper structure modeling the binary interaction of two particles. Using the information about these ports, we discuss the coupling of difference species in a port-Hamiltonian preserving manner.},

This reference medium is a thin periodic domain (the thickness is denoted ) with a hexagonal structure, which is close to a honeycomb quantum graph. In a first step, we show the existence of Dirac points (conical crossings) at arbitrarily large frequencies if is chosen small enough. We then perturb the domain by cutting the perfectly periodic medium along the so-called zigzag direction, and we consider either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the cut edge. In the two cases, we prove the existence of edge modes as well as their robustness with respect to some perturbations, namely, the location of the cut and the thickness of the perturbed edge. In particular, we show that different locations of the cut lead to almost-nondispersive edge states, the number of locations increasing with the frequency. All the results are obtained via asymptotic analysis and semiexplicit computations done on the limit quantum graph. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results.},

Starting at the microscopic level, we develop a kinetic model that characterizes the behavior of large flocks with transient leadership. One significant challenge lies in managing topological interactions, as identifying nearest neighbors in extensive systems can be computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a novel stochastic particle method to simulate the mesoscopic dynamics and reduce the computational cost of identifying closer agents from quadratic to logarithmic complexity using a -nearest neighbors search algorithm with a binary tree. Finally, we conduct various numerical experiments for different scenarios to validate the algorithm’s effectiveness and investigate collective dynamics in both two and three dimensions.},

Image registration matches the features of two images by minimizing the intensity difference, so that useful and complementary information can be extracted from the mapping. However, in real life problems, images may be affected by the imaging environment, such as varying illumination and noise during the process of imaging acquisition. This may lead to the local intensity distortion, which makes it meaningless to minimize the intensity difference in the traditional registration framework. To address this problem, we propose a variational model for joint image registration and intensity correction. Based on this model, a related greedy matching problem is solved by introducing a multiscale approach for joint image registration and intensity correction. An alternating direction method (ADM) is proposed to solve each multiscale step, and the convergence of the ADM method is proved. For the numerical implementation, a coarse-to-fine strategy is further proposed to accelerate the numerical algorithm, and the convergence of the proposed coarse-to-fine strategy is also established. Some numerical tests are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Both are coupled through a Neumann–boundary condition modeling the lithium intercalation reaction . The active material phase is considered to be phase separating upon lithium intercalation. We assume that the porous material is a given periodic microstructure and perform analytical homogenization. Effectively, the microscopic model consists of a diffusion and a Cahn–Hilliard equation, whereas the limit model consists of a diffusion and an Allen–Cahn equation. Thus, we observe a Cahn–Hilliard to Allen–Cahn transition during the upscaling process. In the sense of gradient flows, the transition coincides with a change in the underlying metric structure of the PDE system.},

These models are of great practical importance but notoriously difficult to solve due to prohibitively small mesh and time step sizes limited by the scaling parameter and CFL condition. Another challenge in scientific computing could come from curse-of-dimensionality. In this paper, we aim to provide a quantum algorithm, based on either direct approximations of the original PDEs or their homogenized models, for prototypical multiscale problems inPDEs, including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs. To achieve this, we will lift these problems to higher dimensions and leverage the recently developed Schrödingerization based quantum simulation algorithms to efficiently reduce the computational cost of the resulting high-dimensional and multiscale problems. We will examine the error contributions arising from discretization, homogenization, and relaxation, and analyze and compare the complexities of these algorithms in order to identify the best algorithms in terms of complexities for different equations in different regimes.},

Obtaining fine-scale solutions of multiscale PDEs can be challenging, but there are many inexpensive computational methods for obtaining coarse-scale solutions. Additionally, in many real-world applications, fine-scale solutions can only be observed at a limited number of locations. In order to obtain approximations or predictions of fine-scale solutions over general regions of interest, we propose to learn the operator mapping from coarse-scale solutions to fine-scale solutions using observations of a limited number of (possible noisy) fine-scale solutions. The approach is to train multi-fidelity homogenization maps using mathematically motivated neural operators. The operator learning framework can efficiently obtain the solution of multiscale PDEs at any arbitrary point, making our proposed framework a mesh-free solver. We verify our results on multiple numerical examples showing that our approach is an efficient mesh-free solver for multiscale PDEs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Despite the numerous ways now available to quantify which parts or subsystems of a network are most important, there remains a lack of centrality measures that are related to the complexity of information flows and are derived directly from entropy measures. Here, we introduce a ranking of edges based on how each edge’s removal would change a system’s von Neumann entropy (VNE), which is a spectral-entropy measure that has been adapted from quantum information theory to quantify the complexity of information dynamics over networks. We show that a direct calculation of such rankings is computationally inefficient (or unfeasible) for large networks, since the possible removal of edges requires that one compute all the eigenvalues of distinct matrices. To overcome this limitation, we employ spectral perturbation theory to estimate VNE perturbations and derive an approximate edge-ranking algorithm that is accurate and has a computational complexity that scales as for networks with nodes. Focusing on a form of VNE that is associated with a transport operator , where is a graph Laplacian matrix and is a diffusion timescale parameter, we apply this approach to diverse applications including a network encoding polarized voting patterns of the 117th U.S. Senate, a multimodal transportation system including roads and metro lines in London, and a multiplex brain network encoding correlated human brain activity. Our experiments highlight situations where the edges that are considered to be most important for information diffusion complexity can dramatically change as one considers short, intermediate, and long timescales for diffusion.},

In this article, we introduce semi-implicit particle-in-cell (PIC) methods based on a discretization of the Vlasov–Maxwell system in the electrostatic regime and embedding sparse grid reconstructions: the semi-implict sparse-PIC (SISPIC-sg) scheme, its standard extension (SISPIC-std), and the energy-conserving sparse-PIC (ECSPIC) scheme. These schemes are inspired by the energy-conserving semi-implicit method introduced in [G. Lapenta, J. Comput. Phys., 334 (2017), pp. 349–366]. The particle equations are linearized so that the particle response to the field can be computed by solving a linear system with a stiffness matrix. The methods feature the three following properties: the scheme is unconditionally stable with respect to the plasma period; the finite grid instability is eliminated, allowing the user to use any desired grid discretization; the statistical error is significantly reduced compared to semi-implicit and explicit schemes with standard grid for the same number of particles. The ECSPIC scheme conserves exactly the discrete total energy of the system but we have experienced numerical instability related to the loss of the field energy nonnegativity genuine to the sparse grid combination technique. The SISPIC methods are exempted from this instability and are unconditionally stable with respect to the time and spatial discretization, but do not conserve exactly the discrete total energy. The methods have been investigated on a series of two-dimensional test cases, and gains in terms of memory storage and computational time compared to explicit and existing semi-implicit methods have been observed. These gains are expected to be larger for three-dimensional computations for which the full potential of sparse grid reconstructions can be achieved.},

We numerically analyze how phase-field models converge to sharp-interface limits when the interface thickness tends to zero, and investigate scalings of the Cahn–Hilliard mobility for . In the presence of interfaces, certain sharp-interface limits are only valid for an interval , i.e., there is an upper and lower bound on the range of valid scaling exponents .

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns the optimization of microstructures within a surface when considering the propagation of scalar waves across a periodic row of inclusions embedded within a homogeneous matrix. The approach relies on the low-frequency homogenized model, which consists, in the present case, of some effective jump conditions through a discontinuity within the ambient medium. The topological derivatives of the effective parameters defining these jump conditions are computed from an asymptotic analysis. Their expressions are validated numerically and then used to study the sensitivity of the homogenized model to the geometry in the case of elliptic inclusions. Finally, a topological optimization algorithm is used to minimize a given cost functional. This relies on the expression of the topological derivatives to iteratively perform phase changes in the unit cell characterizing the material, and on FFT-accelerated solvers previously adapted to solve the band cell problems underlying the homogenized model. To illustrate this approach, the resulting procedure is applied to the design of a microstructure that minimizes transmitted fields along a given direction.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Numerical homogenization of multiscale equations typically requires taking an average of the solution to a microscale problem. Both the boundary conditions and domain size of the microscale problem play an important role in the accuracy of the homogenization procedure. In particular, imposing naive boundary conditions leads to an error in the computation, where is the characteristic size of the microscopic fluctuations in the heterogeneous media, and is the size of the microscopic domain. This so-called boundary or “cell resonance” error can dominate discretization error and pollute the entire homogenization scheme. There exist several techniques in the literature to reduce the error. Most strategies involve modifying the form of the microscale cell problem. Below we present an alternative procedure based on the observation that the resonance error itself is an oscillatory function of domain size . After rigorously characterizing the oscillatory behavior for one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional microscale domains, we present a novel strategy to reduce the resonance error. Rather than modifying the form of the cell problem, the original problem is solved for a sequence of domain sizes, and the results are averaged against kernels satisfying certain moment conditions and regularity properties. Numerical examples in one and two dimensions illustrate the utility of the approach.},

The theory of boundary homogenization seeks to encapsulate the effective reactivity of such a patchy surface by a single trapping rate parameter. In this paper, we derive the trapping rate for partially reactive patches occupying a small fraction of a surface. We use matched asymptotic analysis, double perturbation expansions, and homogenization theory to derive formulas for the trapping rate in terms of the far-field behavior of solutions to certain partial differential equations (PDEs). We then develop kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms to rapidly compute these far-field behaviors. These KMC algorithms depend on probabilistic representations of PDE solutions, including using the theory of Brownian local time. We confirm our results by comparing to KMC simulations of the full stochastic system. We further compare our results to prior heuristic approximations.},

Due to the nanobubble with damping, the Minnaert resonance can be induced at certain discrete resonant frequencies, which forms the fundamental basis of effectively constructing elastic metamaterials via the composite material theory. There are two major contributions in this work. First, we ansatz a special form of the density, approximate the incident field with a finite number of modes, and then obtain an expansion with a finite number of modes for the acoustic-elastic wave scattering in the time-harmonic regime. Second, we show that the low-frequency part of the scattered field in the time domain can be well approximated by using the modal expansion with sharp error estimates. Interestingly, we find that the 0th mode is the main contribution to reconstruct the information of the low-frequency part of the scattered field.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Kinetic transport equations are notoriously difficult to simulate because of their complex multiscale behaviors and the need to numerically resolve a high-dimensional probability density function. Past literature has focused on building reduced order models (ROM) by analytical methods. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in developing ROM using data-driven or computational tools that offer more applicability and flexibility. This paper is a work toward that direction. Motivated by our previous work of designing ROM for the stationary radiative transfer equation in [Z. Peng, Y. Chen, Y. Cheng, and F. Li, J. Sci. Comput., 91 (2022), pp. 1–27] by leveraging the low-rank structure of the solution manifold induced by the angular variable, we here further advance the methodology to the time-dependent model. Particularly, we take the celebrated reduced basis method (RBM) approach and propose a novel micro-macro decomposed RBM (MMD-RBM). The MMD-RBM is constructed by exploiting, in a greedy fashion, the low-rank structures of both the micro- and macro-solution manifolds with respect to the angular and temporal variables. Our reduced order surrogate consists of reduced bases for reduced order subspaces and a reduced quadrature rule in the angular space. The proposed MMD-RBM features several structure-preserving components: (1) an equilibrium-respecting strategy to construct reduced order subspaces which better utilize the structure of the decomposed system, and (2) a recipe for preserving positivity of the quadrature weights thus to maintain the stability of the underlying reduced solver. The resulting ROM can be used to achieve a fast online solve for the angular flux in angular directions outside the training set and for arbitrary order moment of the angular flux. We perform benchmark test problems in 2D2V, and the numerical tests show that the MMD-RBM can capture the low-rank structure effectively when it exists. A careful study in the computational cost shows that the offline stage of the MMD-RBM is more efficient than the proper orthogonal decomposition method, and in the low-rank case, it even outperforms a standard full-order solve. Therefore, the proposed MMD-RBM can be seen both as a surrogate builder and a low-rank solver at the same time. Furthermore, it can be readily incorporated into multiquery scenarios to accelerate problems arising from uncertainty quantification, control, inverse problems, and optimization.},

We formulate the model as an evolutionary rate independent system. In an earlier work we derived a homogenized continuum model, which has the form of linearized elastoplasticity, as an evolutionary -limit as the lattice parameter tends to zero. In the present paper we introduce a periodic representative volume element (RVE) approximation for the homogenized system. As a main result we prove convergence of the RVE approximation as the size of the RVE tends to infinity. We also show that the hysteretic stress-strain relation of the effective system can be described with the help of a generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii operator, and we prove convergence of a periodic RVE approximation for that operator. We combine the RVE approximation with a numerical scheme for rate-independent systems and obtain a computational scheme that we use to numerically investigate the homogenized system in the specific case when the original network is given by a two-dimensional lattice model. We simulate the response of the system to cyclic and uniaxial, monotonic loading, and numerically investigate the convergence rate of the periodic RVE approximation. In particular, our simulations show that the RVE error decays with the same rate as the RVE error in the static case of linear elasticity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) model describes the voltage configurations of neuron networks with an interacting many-particles system at a microscopic level. When simulating neuron networks of large sizes, computing a coarse-grained mean-field Fokker–Planck equation solving the voltage densities of the networks at a macroscopic level practically serves as a feasible alternative in its high efficiency and credible accuracy when the interaction within the network remains relatively low. However, the macroscopic model fails to yield valid results of the networks when simulating considerably synchronous networks with active firing events. In this paper, we propose a multiscale solver for the NLIF networks, inheriting the macroscopic solver’s low cost and the microscopic solver’s high reliability. For each temporal step, the multiscale solver uses the macroscopic solver when the firing rate of the simulated network is low, while it switches to the microscopic solver when the firing rate tends to blow up. Moreover, the macroscopic and microscopic solvers are integrated with a high-precision switching algorithm to ensure the accuracy of the multiscale solver. The validity of the multiscale solver is analyzed from two perspectives: first, we provide practically sufficient conditions that guarantee the mean-field approximation of the macroscopic model and present rigorous numerical analysis on simulation errors when coupling the two solvers; second, the numerical performance of the multiscale solver is validated through simulating several large neuron networks, including networks with either instantaneous or periodic input currents which prompt active firing events over some time.},

Nonlinear Fokker–Planck equations play a major role in modeling large systems of interacting particles with a proved effectiveness in describing real world phenomena ranging from classical fields such as fluids and plasma to social and biological dynamics. Their mathematical formulation often has to face physical forces having a significant random component or with particles living in a random environment whose characterization may be deduced through experimental data and leading consequently to uncertainty-dependent equilibrium states. In this work, to address the problem of effectively solving stochastic Fokker–Planck systems, we will construct a new equilibrium preserving scheme through a micro-macro approach based on stochastic Galerkin methods. The resulting numerical method, contrarily to the direct application of a stochastic Galerkin projection in the parameter space of the unknowns of the underlying Fokker–Planck model, leads to a highly accurate description of the uncertainty-dependent large time behavior. Several numerical tests in the context of collective behavior for social and life sciences are presented to assess the validity of the present methodology against standard ones.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We are interested in the resonant electromagnetic scattering by all-dielectric metasurfaces made of a two-dimensional lattice of nanoparticles with high refractive indices. In [Ammari, Li, and Zou, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 376 (2023), pp. 39–90], it has been shown that a single high-index nanoresonator can couple with the incident wave and exhibit a strong magnetic dipole response. Recent physics experiments reveal that when the particles are arranged in certain periodic configurations, they may have different anomalous scattering effects in the macroscopic scale, compared to the single-particle case. In this work, we shall develop a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the resonant behaviors of all-dielectric metasurfaces. We start with the characterization of subwavelength scattering resonances in such a periodic setting and their asymptotic expansions in terms of the refractive index of the nanoparticles. Then we show that real resonances always exist below the essential spectrum of the periodic Maxwell operator and that they are the simple poles of the scattering resolvent with the exponentially decaying resonant modes. By using group theory, we discuss the implications of the symmetry of the metasurface on the subwavelength band functions and their associated eigenfunctions. For the symmetric metasurfaces with the normal incidence, we use a variational method to show the existence of embedded eigenvalues (i.e., real subwavelength resonances embedded in the continuous radiation spectrum). Furthermore, we break the configuration symmetry either by introducing a small deformation of particles or by slightly deviating from the normal incidence and prove that Fano-type reflection and transmission anomalies can arise in both of these scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Coarse-graining or model reduction is a term describing a range of approaches used to extend the timescale of molecular simulations by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. In the context of molecular simulation, standard coarse-graining approaches approximate the potential of mean force and use this to drive an effective Markovian model. To gain insight into this process, the simple case of a quadratic energy is studied in an overdamped setting. A hierarchy of reduced models is derived and analyzed, and the merits of these different coarse-graining approaches are discussed. In particular, while standard recipes for model reduction accurately capture static equilibrium statistics, it is shown that dynamical statistics, such as the mean-squared displacement, display systematic error, even when a system exhibits large timescale separation. In the linear setting studied, it is demonstrated both analytically and numerically that such models can be augmented in a simple way to better capture dynamical statistics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There are two main approaches to modelling interfaces within nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the so-called sharp and diffuse interface models. Both of them are based on the local equilibrium assumption (LEA) in the bulk, but the latter additionally assumes the validity of this concept also within the interface itself (as the thermodynamic description is available and smoothly varying even within the interface), that is, on a finer length scale, which we call super-LEA. Instead of testing the two approaches against molecular dynamic simulations, we explore the mutual compatibility of these two descriptions of an interface in a nonequilibrium situation. Based on the level of detail in the two frameworks, one naturally cannot reconstruct a diffuse interface model from a sharp interface counterpart. One can test, however, whether diffuse interface models are indeed a more detailed description of the interface. Namely, assuming that both approaches are valid, we use the diffuse interface model (van der Waals entropy together with the Cahn–Hilliard type energy with the mass density as the order parameter) and its sharp interface counterpart (with the additional set of interfacial state variables subjected to known thermodynamic constraints) to test their mutual compatibility and indirectly verify the correctness of the additional super-LEA of the diffuse models. That is, thanks to super-LEA, we define five interfacial temperatures that should be equal. However, when we analyze diffuse interface results like experimental or simulation data in terms of sharp interfaces, we show that, contrary to molecular simulation data, they do not yield equal interfacial temperatures. We argue that the culprit is the super-LEA which is most prominently expressed in the accessibility of the entropy density profile. Nevertheless, it is observed that there is an inconsistency between diffuse and sharp interface descriptions; they cannot both be correct. The sharp interface framework has been recently tested against molecular dynamics and the obtained results suggest that super-LEA is the potential weakness of the diffuse framework. In this sense, sharp interfaces are found to be superior to diffuse interfaces in their general ability to model physical systems with interfaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we consider a nonlinear strain-limiting elastic model in heterogeneous domains. We investigate heterogeneous material with soft and stiff inclusions and perforations that are important to understand an elastic solid’s behavior and crack-tip fields. Numerical solutions of problems in computational domains with inclusions and perforations require the construction of a sufficiently fine grid that resolves heterogeneity on the grid level. Approximations on such grids lead to a large system of equations with large computational costs. To reduce the size of the system and provide an accurate solution, we present a generalized multiscale finite element approximation on the coarse grid. In this method, we construct multiscale basis functions in each local domain associated with the coarse-grid cell and based on the construction of the snapshot space and solution of the local spectral problem reduce the size of the snapshot space. Two types of multiscale basis function construction are presented. The first type is a general case that can handle any boundary conditions on the global boundary of the heterogeneous domain. The considered problem requires an accurate approximation of the crack-surface boundary. In the second type of multiscale basis functions, we incorporate global boundary conditions in the basis construction process which provide an accurate approximation of the stress and strain on the crack boundary. We present numerical results for three cases of heterogeneity: soft inclusions, stiff inclusions, and perforations. A numerical investigation is presented for the two examples of loading on the domain with and without crack boundary conditions. The presented generalized multiscale finite element solver provides an accurate solution with a large reduction of the discrete system size. Our results illustrate the significant error reduction on the crack surface when we use the second type of basis functions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a scheme for data-driven parameterization of unresolved dimensions of dynamical systems based on the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and Koopman operator theory. Given a system in which some components of the state are unknown, this method involves defining a surrogate system in a time-dependent quantum state which determines the fluxes from the unresolved degrees of freedom at each timestep. The quantum state is a density operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over time under an action induced by the Koopman operator. The quantum state also updates with new values of the resolved variables according to a quantum Bayes’ law, implemented via an operator-valued feature map. Kernel methods are utilized to learn data-driven basis functions and represent quantum states, observables, and evolution operators as matrices. The resulting computational schemes are automatically positivity-preserving, aiding in the physical consistency of the parameterized system. We analyze the results of two different modalities of this methodology applied to the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 multiscale systems and show how this approach preserves important statistical and qualitative properties of the underlying chaotic dynamics.},

A generalized finite element method (FEM) is proposed for solving a heterogeneous reaction-diffusion equation with a singular perturbation parameter , based on locally approximating the solution on each subdomain by solution of a local reaction-diffusion equation and eigenfunctions of a local eigenproblem. These local problems are posed on some domains slightly larger than the subdomains with oversampling size .

Exponential decay rates for local approximation errors with respect to and (at the discrete level with denoting the fine FE mesh size) and with the local degrees of freedom are established. In particular, it is shown that the method at the continuous level converges uniformly with respect to in the standard norm, and that if the oversampling size is relatively large with respect to and (at the discrete level), the solutions of the local reaction-diffusion equations provide good local approximations for the solution and thus the local eigenfunctions are not needed.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Sea ice profoundly influences the polar environment and the global climate. Traditionally, sea ice has been modeled as a continuum under Eulerian coordinates to describe its large-scale features, using, for instance, viscous-plastic rheology. Recently, Lagrangian particle models, also known as the discrete element method models, have been utilized for characterizing the motion of individual sea ice fragments (called floes) at scales of 10 km and smaller, especially in marginal ice zones. This paper develops a multiscale model that couples the particle and the continuum systems to facilitate an effective representation of the dynamical and statistical features of sea ice across different scales. The multiscale model exploits a Boltzmann-type system that links the particle movement with the continuum equations. For the small-scale dynamics, it describes the motion of each sea ice floe. Then, as the large-scale continuum component, it treats the statistical moments of mass density and linear and angular velocities. The evolution of these statistics affects the motion of individual floes, which in turn provides bulk feedback that adjusts the large-scale dynamics. Notably, the particle model characterizing the sea ice floes is localized and fully parallelized in a framework that is sometimes called superparameterization, which significantly improves computational efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate the effective performance of the multiscale model. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the multiscale model has a linear-order approximation to the truth model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The distinct timescales of synaptic plasticity and neural activity dynamics play an important role in the brain’s learning and memory systems. Activity-dependent plasticity reshapes neural circuit architecture, determining spontaneous and stimulus-encoding spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. Neural activity bumps maintain short term memories of continuous parameter values, emerging in spatially organized models with short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. Previously, we demonstrated nonlinear Langevin equations derived using an interface method which accurately describe the dynamics of bumps in continuum neural fields with separate excitatory/inhibitory populations. Here we extend this analysis to incorporate effects of short term plasticity that dynamically modifies connectivity described by an integral kernel. Linear stability analysis adapted to these piecewise smooth models with Heaviside firing rates further indicates how plasticity shapes the bumps’ local dynamics. Facilitation (depression), which strengthens (weakens) synaptic connectivity originating from active neurons, tends to increase (decrease) stability of bumps when acting on excitatory synapses. The relationship is inverted when plasticity acts on inhibitory synapses. Multiscale approximations of the stochastic dynamics of bumps perturbed by weak noise reveal that the plasticity variables evolve to slowly diffusing and blurred versions of their stationary profiles. Nonlinear Langevin equations associated with bump positions or interfaces coupled to slowly evolving projections of plasticity variables accurately describe how these smoothed synaptic efficacy profiles can tether or repel wandering bumps.},

In this paper, we study two-grid preconditioners for three-dimensional single-phase nonlinear compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous media arising from reservoir simulation. Our goal is to develop robust and efficient preconditioners that converge independently of the contrast of the media and types of boundary conditions and source term. This is accomplished by constructing coarse space that can capture important features of the local heterogeneous media. To detect these features, local eigenvalue problems are defined and eigenvectors are adaptively selected to form the coarse space. The coarse space just needs to be constructed only once with parallel computing, although the compressible flow is a time-dependent problem and the permeability field changes in different time steps. Smoothers such as Gauss–Seidel iteration and ILU(0) are used to remove high-frequency errors. We analyze this preconditioner by proving the smoothing property and approximation property. In particular, a new coarse interpolation operator is defined to facilitate the analysis. Extensive numerical experiments with different types of large-scale heterogeneous permeability fields and boundary conditions are provided to show the impressive performance of the proposed preconditioner.},

Over very long timescales, fluctuations may push the system to transition between them, drastically changing its macroscopic configuration. In realistic systems, these transitions can happen via multiple physical mechanisms, corresponding to multiple distinct transition channels for a pair of states. In this paper, we use the fact that the transition path ensemble is equivalent to the invariant measure of a gradient flow in pathspace, which can be efficiently sampled via metadynamics. We demonstrate how this pathspace metadynamics, previously restricted to reversible molecular dynamics, is in fact very generally applicable to metastable stochastic systems, including irreversible and time-dependent ones, and allows rigorous estimation of the relative probability of competing transition paths. We showcase this approach on the study of a stochastic partial differential equation describing magnetic field reversal in the presence of advection.},
