  abstract     = {Abstract. Isolated patches of spatially oscillating pattern have been found to emerge near a pattern-forming instability in a wide variety of experiments and mathematical models. However, there is currently no mathematical theory to explain this emergence or characterize the structure of these patches. We provide a method for formally deriving radial amplitude equations to planar patterns via nonautonomous multiple-scale analysis and convolutional sums of products of Bessel functions. Our novel approach introduces nonautonomous differential operators, which allow for the systematic manipulation of Bessel functions, as well as previously unseen identities involving infinite sums of Bessel functions. Solutions of the amplitude equations describe fully localized patterns with nontrivial angular dependence, where localization occurs in a purely radial direction. Amplitude equations are derived for multiple examples of patterns with dihedral symmetry, including fully localized hexagons and quasipatterns with twelve-fold rotational symmetry. In particular, we show how to apply the asymptotic method to the Swift–Hohenberg equation and general reaction-diffusion systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by problems arising in the piecewise construction of physically relevant solutions to models of shallow water fluid flows, we study the initial value problem for quasilinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in dimensions when the initial data are continuous with “corners,” i.e., derivative discontinuities. While it is well known that generically such discontinuities propagate along characteristics, under which conditions the initial corner points may fission into several ones, and which characteristics they end up following during their time evolution, seems to be less understood; this study aims at filling this knowledge gap. To this end, a distributional approach to moving singularities is constructed, and criteria for selecting the corner-propagating characteristics are identified. The extreme case of initial corners occurring with at least a one-sided infinite derivative is special. Generically, these gradient catastrophe initial conditions for hyperbolic systems (or their parabolic limits) can be expected to evolve instantaneously into either shock discontinuities or rarefaction waves. It is shown that when genuine nonlinearity does not hold uniformly and fails at such singular points, the solutions’ continuity along with their infinite derivatives persist for finite times. All the results are demonstrated in the context of explicit solutions of problems emerging from applications to fluid flows.},

We find that in the weak coupling regime the combinatorial code depends only on the connectivity graph, and not on the particulars of the synaptic strengths. Moreover, we prove that the combinatorial code of a weakly coupled network is a sublattice, and we provide a learning rule for encoding a sublattice in a weakly coupled excitatory network. In the strong coupling regime we prove that the combinatorial code of a generic Dale network is intersection-complete and is therefore a convex code, as is common in some sensory systems in the brain.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Anisotropic fluids appear in a diverse array of systems, from liquid crystal displays to bacterial swarms, and are characterized by orientational order. Large colloidal particles immersed in such environments disturb the medium’s orientational order, resulting in a stored elastic energy within the bulk. As a consequence, multiple immersed bodies interact at equilibrium through fluid-mediated forces and torques, which depend on the bodies’ positions, orientations, and shapes. We provide the equilibrium configuration of a model nematic liquid crystal with multiple immersed bodies or inclusions in two dimensions, as well as the associated body forces, torques, and surface tractions. A complex variables approach is taken which leans on previous work by Crowdy [Solving Problems in Multiply Connected Domains, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2020] for describing solutions with multiply connected domains. Free periods of a complex director field, which correspond to topological defect positioning and net topological charge, are determined numerically to minimize a global stored elastic energy, including a contribution of a weak (finite) anchoring strength on the body surfaces. Finally, a general, analytical description of two-body far-field interactions is provided, along with examples using two cylindrical inclusions of arbitrary position and size, and two triangles of arbitrary position and orientation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When an inverse problem is solved by a gradient-based optimization algorithm, the corresponding forward and adjoint problems, which are introduced to compute the gradient, can be also solved iteratively. The idea of iterating at the same time on the inverse problem unknown and on the forward and adjoint problem solutions yields the concept of one-shot inversion methods. We are especially interested in the case where the inner iterations for the direct and adjoint problems are incomplete, that is, stopped before achieving a high accuracy on their solutions. Here, we focus on general linear inverse problems and generic fixed-point iterations for the associated forward problem. We analyze variants of the so-called multistep one-shot methods, in particular semi-implicit schemes with a regularization parameter. We establish sufficient conditions on the descent step for convergence by studying the eigenvalues of the block matrix of the coupled iterations. Several numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the convergence of these methods in comparison with the classical gradient descent, where the forward and adjoint problems are solved exactly by a direct solver instead. We observe that very few inner iterations are enough to guarantee good convergence of the inversion algorithm, even in the presence of noisy data.},

In this paper, we present an analytic noniterative approach for recovering a planar isotropic elastic inclusion embedded in an unbounded medium from the elastic moment tensors (EMTs), which are coefficients for the multipole expansion of a field perturbation caused by the inclusion. EMTs contain information about the inclusion’s material and geometric properties, and, as is well known, the inclusion can be approximated by a disk from leading-order EMTs. We define the complex contracted EMTs as the linear combinations of EMTs where the expansion coefficients are given from complex-valued background polynomial solutions. By using the layer potential technique for the Lamé system and the theory of conformal mapping, we derive explicit asymptotic formulas in terms of the complex contracted EMTs for the shape of the inclusion, treating the inclusion as a perturbed disk. These formulas lead us to an analytic noniterative algorithm for elastic inclusion reconstruction using EMTs. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity and limitations of our proposed method.},

Assuming plane-wave modulation, we transform the imaging problem to an inverse problem with internal data and derive a reconstruction procedure to recover the bioluminescent source. Subsequently, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) estimate is established to assess the robustness of the reconstruction. To facilitate practical implementation, we discretize the diffusive model using the staggered grid scheme, resulting in a discrete formulation of the UMBLT inverse problem. A discrete reconstruction procedure is then presented along with a discrete UQ estimate. Finally, the reconstruction procedure is quantitatively validated through numerical examples to demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed approach and estimates.},

Multilayer structures are ubiquitous in constructing microfluidic devices for manipulating fluids to realize various frontier applications, including energy harvesting and invisibility cloaking. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework for analyzing electro-osmotic flow (EOF) within multilayer microfluidic structures. These structures are formed by Hele–Shaw configurations, with cross-sectional shapes that are concentric disks or confocal ellipses, and each layer is filled with a fluid material characterized by a zeta potential. The number of layers can vary, and the zeta potentials in each layer may differ. By dynamically adjusting the zeta potential, the multilayer EOF structure can effectively manipulate fluids without requiring metamaterials in microfluidic devices. Considering the impingement of an arbitrary nonuniform incident field on the multilayer structure, we first establish the representation formula of the solution of the coupled system using the layer potential techniques, and then the concept of contracted hydrodynamic Generalized Polarization Tensors (GPTs) is defined by multipolar expansion. Utilizing Fourier series and spectral theory, we derive a closed-form solution for the coupled system in the control region with multilayer concentric disks or confocal ellipses. This framework provides a convenient algebraic approach for studying hydrodynamic cloaking and shielding in multilayer structures, laying the groundwork for various microfluidic applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This study addresses the modelling of elastic bodies, particularly when the relaxed configuration is unknown or nonexistent. We adopt the theory of initially stressed materials, incorporating the deformation gradient and stress state of the reference configuration (initial stress tensor) into the response function. We show that for the theory to be applicable, the response function of the relaxed material is invertible up to an element of the material symmetry group. Additionally, we establish that commonly imposed constitutive restrictions, namely the initial stress compatibility condition and initial stress reference independence, naturally arise when assuming the initial stress is generated solely from elastic distortion. This paper delves into modelling aspects concerning incompressible materials, showcasing the expressibility of strain energy density as a function of the deviatoric part of the initial stress tensor and the isochoric part of the deformation gradient. This not only reduces the number of independent invariants in the energy functional, but also enhances numerical robustness in finite element simulations. The findings of this research hold significant implications for modelling materials with initial stress, extending potential applications to areas such as mechanobiology, soft robotics, and 4D printing.},

This approach also provides a generalized Newton–Busemann law on the distribution of pressures on the cone’s boundary. The construction of Radon measure solutions is reduced to solving a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE) for weights of Dirac measures supported on the edge of the cone on the unit 2-sphere. It is further reduced to solving nonnegative periodic solutions of a singular and nonlinear nonautonomous ODE. A numerical algorithm based on the combination of the Fourier spectral method and Newton’s method is developed to solve the ODE. The numerical simulations for different attack angles exhibit proper theoretical properties and excellent accuracy.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Flour beetles (genus Tribolium) have long been used as a model organism to understand population dynamics in ecological research. A rich and rigorous body of work has cemented flour beetles’ place in the field of mathematical biology. One of the most interesting results using flour beetles is the induction of chaos in a laboratory beetle population, in which the well-established LPA (larvae-pupae-adult) model was used to inform the experimental factors that would lead to chaos. However, whether chaos is an intrinsic property of flour beetles remains an open question. Inspired by new experimental data, we extend the LPA model by stratifying the adult population into newly emerged and mature adults and considering cannibalism as a function of mature adults. We fit the model to longitudinal data of larvae, pupae, and adult beetle populations to demonstrate the model’s ability to recapitulate the transient dynamics of flour beetles. We present local and global stability results for the trivial and positive steady states and explore bifurcations and limit cycles numerically. Our results suggest that, while chaos is a possibility, it is a rare phenomenon within realistic ranges of the parameters obtained from our experiment and is likely induced by environmental changes connected to media changes and population censusing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the spectral evolution of four-wave-resonant systems in the presence of a large-scale strong condensate, using the two-dimensional Majda–McLaughlin–Tabak model as a generalizable example. We show that, under dominance of nonlocal interactions with the condensate, the high-wavenumber spectral evolution is governed by a diffusion equation. Two approaches are developed in deriving the diffusion equation, one starting from the wave kinetic equation of MMT model, and the other starting from the MMT model itself with a WKB analysis, with both yielding the same end result. We further analyze the diffusion dynamics, which is shown to be remarkably different for cases with and , where controls the dispersion relation . For , the diffusion has similar time scale in radial and circumferential directions, with a stationary constant-flux solution of wave action (where controls the order of derivatives in the nonlinear term of the MMT model). For , the diffusion is much faster in circumferential direction, with a stationary solution of . We finally discuss the extension of results to higher dimensions and the validity of the diffusion equation depending on and .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Human movement is a leading cause of the rapid global spread of infectious diseases. Factors such as emerging pathogens and outbreaks, large-scale events, bilateral or multilateral agreements, resource allocation, and urban planning can lead to unsynchronized changes in population movement among regions. In this paper, based on a two-patch susceptible-infected-susceptible model, we investigate the dependence of disease persistence (measured by the basic reproduction number) and disease prevalence (proportion of people being infected) of both patches and each patch on dispersal asymmetry, respectively. It is shown that their dependencies are completely consistent, i.e., strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, or constant. Biologically speaking, an increase in migration from the high-risk patch (where the patch reproduction number is larger) to the low-risk patch (where the patch reproduction number is smaller) will reduce both infection risk and size. In addition, the basic reproduction number and the global and local disease prevalences at zero and infinite dispersal asymmetry are given. Numerical simulations suggest that there are some substantial differences between the two-patch case and the three or more patches case, such as the appearance of Simpson’s paradox on disease prevalence in the three-patch case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The singularly perturbed Gierer–Meinhardt (GM) system in a bounded -dimensional domain is known to exhibit boundary layer (BL) solutions for a nonzero activator flux. It was previously shown that such BL solutions can be destabilized by decreasing the activator flux below a stability threshold. Moreover, numerical simulations previously indicated that solutions consisting of a boundary layer and an interior spike emerge after the destabilization of a BL solution. In this paper we use the method of matched asymptotic expansions to investigate the structure and stability of such “boundary layer spike” (BLS) solutions in the presence of an asymptotically small activator diffusivity . We find that two types of BLS solutions, one of which is unconditionally linearly stable and the other unstable, can be constructed provided that the activator flux is sufficiently small. In this way we determine that there is an asymptotically large range of activator flux values for which both the BL solution and one of the BLS solutions are linearly stable. Formal asymptotic calculations are further validated by numerically simulating the singularly perturbed GM system.},

In this study we construct a reaction-diffusion model on a periodically evolving domain subject to the no-flux boundary condition, with a novel feature that the growth mechanism of populations also periodically varies. For this model we identify key factors to determine the long-term behavior of populations when the growth is of KPP type, strong Allee type, and weak Allee type, respectively. In particular, when a bistability structure appears, by appealing to the dynamical system theory developed in [Y. Wang and J. Yao, J. Funct. Anal., 283 (2022), 109538] we obtain a sharp convergence to periodic solutions. For bistable populations, we prove that there exists a unique critical distribution distinguishing population survival and extinction when we continuously vary a family of ordered initial distributions. Further, numerical simulations indicate that such critical distributions may depend on the connectivity of the varying domain; the loss of connectivity may suppress population survival, although there is no loss in the emerging boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Our study focuses on fractional order compartment models derived from underlying physical stochastic processes, providing a more physically grounded approach compared to models obtained by simply replacing integer order derivatives with fractional order derivatives. In these models, inherent stochasticity becomes important, particularly when dealing with the dynamics of small populations far from the continuum limit of large particle numbers. The necessity for stochastic simulations arises from deviations of the mean states from the solutions obtained from the governing equations in these scenarios. To address this, our work presents an exact stochastic simulation algorithm designed for fractional order compartment models, based on a semi-Markov process. We have considered a fractional order resusceptibility SIS model and a fractional order recovery SIR model as illustrative examples, highlighting significant disparities between deterministic and stochastic dynamics when the total population is small. Beyond its modeling applications, the algorithm presented serves as a versatile tool for solving fractional order differential equations via Monte Carlo simulations.},

We investigate the energy dissipation law of the derived LDPNP equations. For a planar bounded radially symmetric domain, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solution of LDPNP equations.},

Specifically, we define the function spaces on which the interaction kernels can be identified given infinite i.i.d. observational derivative data sampled from a distribution. Our methodology involves casting the learning problem as a linear statistical inverse problem using an operator theoretical framework. We prove the well-posedness of the inverse problem by establishing the strict positivity of a related integral operator, and our analysis allows us to refine the results on specific manifolds such as the sphere and the hyperbolic space. Our findings indicate that a numerically stable procedure exists to recover the interaction kernel from finite (noisy) data, and the estimator will be convergent to the ground truth. These findings also answer an open question in [M. Maggioni et al., Learning  interaction kernels for agent systems on Riemannian manifolds, in Proceedings of the International  Conference on Machine Learning, 2021] and demonstrate that least square estimators can be statistically optimal in certain scenarios. Finally, our theoretical analysis could be extended to the mean-field case, revealing that the corresponding nonparametric inverse problem is ill-posed in general and necessitates effective regularization techniques.},

This result is in the spirit of entropy – entropy production inequalities for diffusive PDEs. The asymptotics of the modified system, with a redistributive tax, are derived and shown to agree with the original, taxed yard-sale model, which implies that the modified system is as suitable for matching real wealth distributions.

We show mathematically and numerically that two-layer networks are suppressors of selection, which means that they suppress the effects of the different fitness values among the different types on the final outcomes of the evolutionary dynamics (called fixation probability) relative to the constituent one-layer networks. In fact, many two-layer networks are suppressors of selection relative to the most basic baseline, the Moran process. This result is in stark contrast with the results for conventional one-layer networks for which most networks are amplifiers of selection.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The availability of cancer measurements over time enables the personalized assessment of tumor growth and therapeutic response dynamics. However, many tumors are treated after diagnosis without collecting longitudinal data, and cancer monitoring protocols may include infrequent measurements. To facilitate the estimation of disease dynamics and better guide ensuing clinical decisions, we investigate an inverse problem enabling the reconstruction of earlier tumor states by using a single spatial tumor dataset and a biomathematical model describing disease dynamics. We focus on prostate cancer, since aggressive cases of this disease are usually treated after diagnosis. We describe tumor dynamics with a phase field model driven by a generic nutrient ruled by reaction-diffusion dynamics. The model is completed with another reaction-diffusion equation for the local production of prostate-specific antigen, which is a key prostate cancer biomarker. We first improve previous well-posedness results by further showing that the solution operator is continuously Fréchet differentiable. We then analyze the backward inverse problem concerning the reconstruction of earlier tumor states starting from measurements of the model variables at the final time. Since this problem is severely ill-posed, only very weak conditional stability of logarithmic type can be recovered from the terminal data. However, by restricting the unknowns to a compact subset of a finite-dimensional subspace, we can derive an optimal Lipschitz stability estimate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The purpose of this article is the mathematical analysis of a new class of models to describe the flow in shallow aquifers, alternatives to the 3D Richards model. This type of model was introduced in a previous work and consists of the coupling of an almost 1D vertical flow in the upper part of the aquifer with a 2D horizontal flow in the lower part. These two regions are separated by a time-dependent interface, an unknown of the problem. A result of existence of weak solutions is proved for a very general form of the hydraulic conductivity (anisotropic case). The strategy is based on the classical framework of parabolic equations in noncylindrical domains. It also exploits the compressibility of the soil to overcome the difficulty associated with the degeneracy in the time derivative term of the Richards equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider viscous steady streaming induced by oscillatory flow past a cylinder between two plates, where the cylinder’s axis is normal to the plates. While this phenomenon was first studied in the 1930s, it has received renewed interest recently for possible applications in particle manipulations and non-Newtonian flows. The flow is driven at the ends of the channel by the boundary condition which is a series solution of the oscillating flow problem in a rectangular channel in the absence of a cylinder. We use a combination of Fourier series and an asymptotic expansion to study the confinement effects for steady streaming. The Fourier series in time naturally simplifies to a finite series. In contrast, it is necessary to truncate the Fourier series in , which is in the direction of the axis of the cylinder, to solve numerically. The successive equations for the Fourier coefficients resulting from the asymptotic expansion are then solved numerically using finite element methods. We use our model to evaluate how steady streaming depends on the domain width and distance from the cylinder to the outer walls, including the possible breaking of the four-fold symmetry due to the domain shape. We utilize the tangential steady streaming velocity along the radial chord at an angle of to analyze our solutions over an extensive range of oscillating frequencies and multiple levels in the -direction. Finally, higher-order solutions are computed and an asymptotic correction to steady streaming is included.},

However, up to now, the models studied from an algebraic viewpoint are either too general or too restrictive (as group-based models with a uniform stationary distribution) to be used in practice. In this paper we provide a new framework to study time-reversible models, which are the most widely used by biologists. In our approach we consider algebraic time-reversible models on phylogenetic trees (as defined by Allman and Rhodes) and introduce a new inner product to make all transition matrices of the process diagonalizable through the same orthogonal eigenbasis. This framework generalizes the Fourier transform widely used to work with group-based models and recovers some of the well-known results. As illustration, we combine our technique with algebraic geometry tools to provide relevant phylogenetic invariants for trees evolving under the Tamura–Nei model of nucleotide substitution.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For problems in the Calculus of Variations that exhibit the Lavrentiev phenomenon, it is known that a repulsion property may hold, that is, if one approximates the global minimizer in these problems by smooth functions, then the approximate energies will blow up. Thus, standard numerical schemes, like the finite element method, may fail when applied directly to these types of problems. In this paper we prove that a repulsion property holds for variational problems in three-dimensional elasticity that exhibit cavitation. In addition, we propose a numerical scheme that circumvents the repulsion property, which is an adaptation of the Modica and Mortola functional for phase transitions in liquids, in which the phase function is coupled, via the determinant of the deformation gradient, to the stored energy functional. We show that the corresponding approximations by this method satisfy the lower bound –convergence property in the multidimensional, nonradial, case. The convergence to the actual cavitating minimizer is established for a spherical body, in the case of radial deformations.},

This framework enables consistent navigation, ultimately providing Boussinesq equations supplemented by jump conditions at the depth discontinuity that encompass the effect of step on wave propagation.},

The new scheme is used to compute the energy release rate function, based on which predictions are offered for the threshold thickness below which the gel/substrate system is stable against debonding. This study, in turn, makes it possible to validate a theoretical estimate for the energy release rate obtained in the cited works, which is based on a thin-film asymptotic analysis and which, due to its explicit nature, is potentially valuable in medical device development.

To investigate the model system in the case of asymptotically unbounded domain, we first prove the global attractivity for nonautonomous reaction-diffusion systems with asymptotically vanishing diffusion coefficients via the method of sub- and supersolutions and then use the comparison arguments to obtain the threshold dynamics. We also apply these analytical results to a reaction-diffusion model of dengue fever transmission to investigate the effect of time-varying domain on the basic reproduction number. It turns out that the basic reproduction numbers with dengue fever transmission for the asymptotically bounded and unbounded domains are always less than that for the spatially homogeneous case, and under appropriate conditions, the basic reproduction numbers for asymptotically bounded and periodic domains are larger than or equal to that for the stationary bounded domain.},

The study is motivated by maximizing the sensitivity of electrode measurements to conductivity changes when monitoring the condition of a stroke patient, which justifies adopting a linearized version of the complete electrode model as the forward model. The algorithm is based on finding a (locally) A-optimal measurement configuration via gradient descent with respect to the electrode positions. The efficient computation of the needed derivatives of the complete electrode model is one of the focal points. Two algorithms are introduced and numerically tested on a three-layer head model. The first one assumes a region of interest and a Gaussian prior for the conductivity in the brain, and it can be run offline, i.e., prior to taking any measurements. The second algorithm first computes a reconstruction of the conductivity anomaly caused by the stroke with an initial electrode configuration by combining lagged diffusivity iteration with sequential linearizations, which can be interpreted to produce an approximate Gaussian probability density for the conductivity perturbation. It then resorts to the first algorithm to find new, more informative positions for the available electrodes with the constructed density as the prior.},

This paper shows both analytically and numerically that the skin effect in systems of non-Hermitian subwavelength resonators is robust with respect to random imperfections in the system. The subwavelength resonators are highly contrasting material inclusions that resonate in a low-frequency regime. The non-Hermiticity is due to the introduction of a directional damping term (motivated by an imaginary gauge potential), which leads to a skin effect that is manifested by the system’s eigenmodes accumulating at one edge of the structure. We elucidate the topological protection of the associated (real) eigenfrequencies and illustrate numerically the competition between the two different localization effects present when the system is randomly perturbed: the non-Hermitian skin effect and the disorder-induced Anderson localization. We show numerically that, as the strength of the disorder increases, more and more eigenmodes become localized in the bulk. Our results are based on an asymptotic matrix model for subwavelength physics and can be generalized also to tight-binding models in condensed matter theory.},

Previous experimental studies have revealed the existence of two distinct pools, namely the surface-adsorbed pool and the intracellular pool, in certain species of algae. Motivated by these observations, a novel stoichiometric model, which incorporates a two-stage uptake process, is proposed and analyzed to investigate the impact of these pools on algal growth. Model validation results show that with proper parameterizations, this model can accurately capture algal growth dynamics in the laboratory and in the field. The asymptotic dynamics are explored through a complete mathematical analysis and the transient dynamics are explored through multiscale analysis, revealing the driving mechanism of different growth phases of algae. Furthermore, we derive an approximate formula for estimating the switching time from high to low growth rate in algae, which can serve as a valuable tool for predicting the duration of HABs. These findings contribute to the strengthening of prediction and improving understanding of HABs.},

In this paper, the classical problem of two-dimensional flow in a cylindrical domain, driven by a nonuniform tangential velocity imposed at the boundary, is reconsidered in straightforward manner. When the boundary velocity is a pure rotation plus a small perturbation and when the Reynolds number based on is large (Re ), this flow is of “Prandtl–Batchelor” type, namely, a flow of uniform vorticity in a core region inside a viscous boundary layer of thickness O(Re). The O contribution to is determined here by asymptotic analysis up to O. The result is in good agreement with numerical computation for Re .},

The implementation of this imaging functional is simple and avoids the need to solve an ill-posed problem. The resolution and stability analysis of the imaging functional is investigated. Results from our numerical study indicate that this imaging functional is more stable than that of the factorization method and more accurate than that of the orthogonality sampling method in reconstructing periodic scatterers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. To strike a balance between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency for simulations of ultrasound waves in soft tissues, we derive a pseudodifferential factorization of the wave operator with fractional attenuation. This factorization allows us to approximately solve the Helmholtz equation via one-way (transmission) or two-way (transmission and reflection) sweeping schemes tailored to high-frequency wave fields. We provide explicitly the three highest order terms of the pseudodifferential expansion to incorporate the well-known square-root first order symbol for wave propagation, the zeroth order symbol for amplitude modulation due to changes in wave speed and damping, and the next symbol to model fractional attenuation. We also propose wide-angle Padé approximations for the pseudodifferential operators corresponding to these three highest order symbols. Our analysis provides insights regarding the role played by the frequency and the Padé approximations in the estimation of error bounds. We also provide a proof-of-concept numerical implementation of the proposed method and test the error estimates numerically.},

It utilizes a complex-scaled Laplace free-space Green’s function, resulting in a BIE posed on the infinite boundaries of the domain. The perfectly matched layer (PML) coordinate stretching that is used to render propagating waves exponentially decaying allows for the effective truncation and discretization of the BIE unbounded domain. We show through a variety of numerical examples that, despite the logarithmic growth of the complex-scaled Laplace free-space Green’s function, the truncation errors are exponentially small with respect to the truncation length. Our formulation uses only simple function evaluations (e.g., complex logarithms and square roots), hence avoiding the need to compute the involved water-wave Green’s function. Finally, we show that the proposed approach can also be used to find complex resonances through a linear eigenvalue problem since the Green’s function is frequency-independent.},

Adaptive control and synchronization techniques have been extensively developed over the years due to their ability to operate without prior analytical knowledge of the system. However, their application in real-world systems necessitates the consideration of various factors such as delays and stochastic disturbances. Moreover, the conventional hypothesis of a global Lipschitzian condition is often overly restrictive for real-world systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by jointly incorporating these factors. We introduce a novel parameter in the algebraic power associated with the adaptive rule. This modification enhances the effectiveness of the adaptive scheme in more realistic systems. Additionally, we investigate how the power and the nonlinear degrees of vector fields affect the performance of the adaptive scheme. The adaptive scheme proves to be effective in controlling or synchronizing stochastic complex dynamics in ecosystems and biosystems, demonstrating its broad applicability in various fields.},

The model also takes into consideration the effect of the environmental wind and of the pyrogenic flow. The simplicity of the model is highlighted by the fact that it is described by a single scalar equation, containing only four terms, making it very handy for rapid and effective numerical simulations which run in real time. In spite of its simplicity, the model is in agreement with data collected from bushfire experiments in the lab, as well as with spreading of bushfires that have been observed in the real world. Moreover, the equation describing the temperature evolution can be easily linked to a geometric evolution problem describing the level sets of the ignition state.},

We examine a misleadingly simple linear second-order eigenvalue problem (the Hermite-with-pole equation) that was previously proposed as a model problem of an equatorially trapped Rossby wave. In the singularly perturbed limit representing small latitudinal shear, the eigenvalue contains an exponentially small imaginary part; the derivation of this component requires exponential asymptotics. In this work, by considering the problem in the complex plane, we show that it contains a number of interesting features that were not remarked upon in the original studies of this equation. These include, in particular, the presence of inactive Stokes lines due to the higher-order Stokes phenomenon. Since an understanding of the behavior in the complex plane is often crucial for problems in exponential asymptotics, we hope that our results, as well as the techniques developed, will prove useful when solving more general linear (and even nonlinear) eigenvalue problems involving asymptotics beyond-all-orders.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Households play an important role in disease dynamics. Many infections happen there due to the close contact, while mitigation measures mainly target the transmission between households. Therefore, one can see households as boosting the transmission depending on household size. To study the effect of household size and size distribution, we differentiated within and between household reproduction rates. There are basically no preventive measures, and thus the close contacts can boost the spread. We explicitly incorporated that typically only a fraction of all household members are infected. Thus, viewing the infection of a household of a given size as a splitting process generating a new small fully infected subhousehold and a remaining still susceptible subhousehold, we derive a compartmental ODE model for the dynamics of the subhouseholds. In this setting, the basic reproduction number as well as prevalence and the peak of an infection wave in a population with given household size distribution can be computed analytically. We compare numerical simulation results of this novel household ODE model with results from an agent-based model using data for realistic household size distributions of different countries. We find good agreement of both models showing the catalytic effect of large households on the overall disease dynamics.},

In particular, we prove that the proposed viscous flux preserves positivity of density and internal energy, satisfies the minimum entropy principle, is consistent with all generalized entropies, and is Galilean and rotationally invariant. We also provide a variation of the viscous flux that conserves angular momentum.

We introduce an auxiliary variable to remove singularities from the domain in order to facilitate robust numerical simulations. From the asymptotics, we identify three distinct regions: bulk, boundary, and intermediate layers. The boundary and intermediate layers form the space charge layer of the solid electrolyte, which we can further distinguish as strong and weak space charge layers, respectively. The weak space charge layer is characterized by a length, which is equivalent to the Debye length of a standard liquid electrolyte. The strong space charge layer is characterized by a scaled Debye length, which is larger than . We find that both layers exhibit distinct behavior; we see quadratic behavior in the strong space charge layer and exponential behavior in the weak space charge layer. We find that matching between these two asymptotic regimes is not standard, and we implement a pseudomatching approach to facilitate the transition between the quadratic and exponential behaviors.

This paper aims to present a novel isotropic bidirectional model for studying weakly dispersive and weakly nonlinear atmospheric internal waves in a three-dimensional system consisting of two superimposed, incompressible, and inviscid fluids. The newly developed equation is the Benjamin–Benney–Luke (BBL) equation, a generalization of the famous two-dimensional Benjamin–Ono (2DBO) equation and the Benney–Luke equation, derived using the nonlocal Ablowitz–Fokas–Musslimani formulation of water waves. The evolution results of the BBL and 2DBO equations, performed by implementing the classic fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, the pseudospectral scheme with the integrating factor method, and the windowing scheme, show that the anisotropic 2DBO equation agrees well with the isotropic BBL model for problems being investigated, namely the focus is the central part of the soliton evolution/interaction zone. By applying the Whitham modulation theory, modulation equations for the 2DBO equation are obtained in this paper for analyzing the soliton dynamics in five different initial-value problems (truncated line soliton, line soliton, bent-stem soliton, bent soliton, and reverse bent soliton). In addition, corresponding numerical results are obtained and shown to agree well with the theoretical predictions. Both theoretical and numerical results reveal the formation conditions of the Mach expansion, as well as the specific relationship between the amplitude of the Mach stem and the initial data.},

We propose to study an inverse problem of determining multiple anomalies embedded in a multilayered background medium by the associated electric measurement which arises in Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). There are several salient features of our study. First, the anomaly considered in our study is extremely general which is characterized by its location, support, varying size, conductivity parameter, as well as a carry-on source intensity. Second, we make use of the measurement of the electric field generated by the active anomalies. This corresponds to a single passive measurement. Third, the background medium is of a multilayered and piecewise-constant structure and can be used to model a more general scenario from practical applications; say, e.g., the human body. Under the condition that the anomalies are small, but still in multiple scales considering their varying sizes, we derive a sharp formula of the electric field in terms of the polarization tensors, which enables us to establish comprehensive unique identifiability results in determining the characteristic parameters of the active anomalies in different situations.},

The Whitham modulation equations are obtained for the FDNLS equation with general linear dispersion and a generalized, local nonlinearity. Assuming the existence of a four-parameter family of two-phase solutions, a multiple-scales approach yields a system of four independent, first-order, quasi-linear conservation laws of hydrodynamic type that correspond to the slow evolution of the two wavenumbers, mass, and momentum of modulated periodic traveling waves. The modulation equations are further analyzed in the dispersionless and weakly nonlinear regimes. The ill-posedness of the dispersionless equations corresponds to the classical criterion for modulational instability (MI). For modulations of linear waves, ill-posedness coincides with the generalized MI criterion, recently identified by Amiranashvili and Tobisch [New J. Phys., 21 (2019), 033029]. A new instability index is identified by the transition from real to complex characteristics for the weakly nonlinear modulation equations. This instability is associated with long wavelength modulations of nonlinear two-phase wavetrains and can exist even when the corresponding one-phase wavetrain is stable according to the generalized MI criterion. Another interpretation is that while infinitesimal perturbations of a periodic wave may not grow, small but finite amplitude perturbations may grow, hence this index identifies a nonlinear instability mechanism for one-phase waves. Classifications of instability indices for multiple FDNLS equations with higher-order dispersion, including applications to finite-depth water waves and the discrete NLS equation, are presented and compared with direct numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Pine wilt disease is one of the most serious forest diseases and pests in China, which seriously influences the realization of the goal of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality.” In our article, we divide longhorns into susceptible ones and infected ones since pine wilt disease is spread by longhorns. Considering the saturation incidence of pine wilt disease, we establish a delayed reaction-diffusion model with nonlocal effect for susceptible and infected longhorns. First, we consider the well-posedness of solutions and the type of equilibria for the nonspatial system. Next, we discuss the dynamics of the spatial system with nonlocal effect. According to the multiple time scales method, we derive the normal form of Hopf bifurcation for a system associated with nonlocal effect, and the stability and direction of bifurcating periodic solutions are analyzed. Finally, using real data for China to perform data analysis, we select suitable values of parameters. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the ecological significance. Combined with the current situation, we provide some theoretical support for the prevention and control of pine wilt disease in China. Especially, we find that the nonlocal term can induce spatially stable inhomogeneous bifurcating periodic solutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have enjoyed tremendous success in image generation and processing and have recently attracted growing interest in financial modeling. This paper analyzes GANs from the perspectives of mean-field games (MFGs) and optimal transport: GANs are interpreted as MFGs under the Pareto optimality criterion or mean-field controls; meanwhile, GANs are to minimize the optimal transport cost indexed by the generator from the known latent distribution to the unknown true distribution of data. In particular, we provide a universal approximation result, which shows that there exists an appropriate neural network architecture for GANs training to capture the mean-field solution. The derivation of this universal approximation result leads to an explicit construction of the deep neural network for the transport mapping. The MFGs perspective of GANs leads to a GAN-based computational method (MFGANs) to solve MFGs: one neural network for the backward Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and one neural network for the forward Fokker–Planck equation, with the two neural networks trained in an adversarial way. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior performance of this proposed algorithm, especially in higher dimensional cases, when compared with existing neural network approaches.},

The study of living microorganisms using resource allocation models has been key in elucidating natural behaviors of bacteria, by allowing allocation of microbial resources to be represented through optimal control strategies. The approach can also be applied to research in microbial cell factories, to investigate the optimal production of value-added compounds regulated by an external control. The latter is the subject of this paper, in which we study batch bioprocessing from a resource allocation perspective. Based on previous works, we propose a simple bacterial growth model accounting for the dynamics of the bioreactor and intracellular composition, and we analyze its asymptotic behavior and stability. Using optimization and optimal control theory, we study the production of biomass and metabolites of interest for infinite- and finite-time horizons. The resulting optimal control problems are studied using Pontryagin’s maximum principle and numerical methods, and the solutions found are characterized by the presence of the Fuller phenomenon (producing an infinite set of switching points occurring in a finite-time window) at the junctions with a second-order singular arc. The approach, inspired by biotechnological engineering, aims to shed light upon the role of cellular composition and resource allocation during batch processing and, at the same time, poses very interesting and challenging mathematical problems.},

We model muscles as a fiber-reinforced composite and transversely isotropic material. We introduce a flexible computational framework to approximate the deformations of skeletal muscle to provide new insights into the underlying mechanics of these tissues. The model parameters and mechanical properties are obtained through experimental data and can be specified locally. A semi-implicit in-time, conforming, finite element in space scheme is used to approximate the solutions to the governing nonlinear dynamic model.

Experimental and theoretical studies have indicated that interactions of certain proteins lead to the cell polarization which plays a key role in controlling the cell movement. We study the cell polarity and movement based on a class of biophysical models that consist of reaction-diffusion equations for different proteins and the dynamics of a moving cell boundary. Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase-field model. We first apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp-interface model of the cell boundary from a phase-field model. We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level-set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction-diffusion equations on the moving cell region. Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimuli and capture both the linear and the circular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time. In particular, we have identified some key parameters controlling different cell trajectories that are less accurately predicted by reduced models. Our work has linked different models and also developed tools that can be adapted for the challenging three-dimensional simulations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The existence of HIV post-treatment controllers (PTCs) offers hope for an HIV functional cure, and understanding the critical mechanisms determining PTC represents a key step toward this goal. Here, we have studied these mechanisms by analyzing an established mathematical model for HIV viral dynamics. In mathematical models, critical mechanisms are represented by parameters that affect the tipping points to induce qualitatively different dynamics, and in cases with multiple stability, the initial conditions of the system also play a role in determining the fate of the solution. As such, for the tipping points in parameter space, we developed and implemented a sensitivity analysis of the threshold conditions of the associated bifurcations to identify the critical mechanisms for this model. Our results suggest that the infected cell death rate and the saturation parameter for cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation significantly affect post-treatment control. For the case with multiple stability, in state space of initial conditions, we first investigated the saddle-type equilibrium point to identify its stable manifold, which delimits trapping regions associated to the high and low viral set points. The identified stable manifold serves as a guide for the loads of immune cells and HIV virus at the time of therapy termination to achieve post-treatment control.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The circadian clock is an internal timer that coordinates the daily rhythms of behavior and physiology, including sleep and hormone secretion. Accurately tracking the state of the circadian clock, or circadian phase, holds immense potential for precision medicine. Wearable devices present an opportunity to estimate the circadian phase in the real world, as they can noninvasively monitor various physiological outputs influenced by the circadian clock. However, accurately estimating circadian phase from wearable data remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of methods that integrate minute-by-minute wearable data with prior knowledge of the circadian phase. To address this issue, we propose a framework that integrates multitime scale physiological data and estimates the circadian phase, along with an efficient implementation algorithm based on Bayesian inference and a new state space estimation method called the level set Kalman filter. Our numerical experiments indicate that our approach outperforms previous methods for circadian phase estimation consistently. Furthermore, our method enables us to examine the contribution of noise from different sources to the estimation, which was not feasible with prior methods. We found that internal noise unrelated to external stimuli is a crucial factor in determining estimation results. Last, we developed a user-friendly computational package and applied it to real-world data to demonstrate the potential value of our approach. Our results provide a foundation for systematically understanding the real-world dynamics of the circadian clock.},

We start from a microscopic description of the stochastic processes underlying the cell re-orientation mechanism related to the change of cell speed and direction. Then, we formally derive the corresponding kinetic model that implements exactly the prescribed microscopic dynamics, and, from it, it is possible to deduce the macroscopic limit in the appropriate regime. Moreover, we test our model in several scenarios. In particular, we numerically investigate the minimal microscopic mechanisms that are necessary to reproduce cell dynamics by comparing the outcomes of our model with some experimental results related to breast cancer cell migration.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper considers resource-driven pattern formation in consumer-resource systems. Here, a planar pattern consists of many big patches, and a big patch can be regarded as combination of many patches on the plane. The consumer moves between patches asymmetrically, while the asymmetry is driven by the resource abundance. Based on experimental models with linearly-linked patches, we propose a planarly-linked-patch model with asymmetric dispersal. Using dynamical systems theory, we show global stability of equilibria in the model, and demonstrate how the resource-driven dispersal forms patterns. It is shown that appropriate asymmetry in dispersal would make the consumer persist in the system, even in sink patches. The asymmetry could also make the consumer’s total population abundance larger than that without dispersal. However, inappropriate asymmetry would make the consumer go into extinction, even in source patches. Dispersal rates are also shown to play a role in the persistence and abundance increase. Our results are consistent with experimental observations and provide new insights. Numerical simulations by the model reproduce various vegetation patterns in the real world. This work has potential applications in spatial pattern formation in biological research.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work addresses the modelling of oxygenic photogranules (OPGs), by introducing a mathematical model which describes both the genesis and growth of photogranules and the related treatment process. The photogranule has been modelled as a free boundary domain with radial symmetry, which evolves over time as a result of microbial growth, attachment, and detachment processes. Hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs have been considered to model at mesoscale the transport and growth of sessile biomass and the diffusion and conversion of soluble substrates. The macroscale behavior of the system has been modelled through first order impulsive ordinary differential equations (IDEs), which reproduce a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) configuration. Phototrophic biomass has been considered for the first time in granular biofilms, and cyanobacteria and microalgae have been accounted separately, to model their metabolic differences. To describe the key role of cyanobacteria in the photogranulation process, the attachment velocity of all suspended microbial species has been modelled as a function of the cyanobacteria concentration in suspended form. The model takes into account the main biological processes involved in OPG-based systems: metabolic activity of cyanobacteria, microalgae, heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria, microbial decay, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, symbiotic and competitive interactions between different species, light-dark cycle, light attenuation across the granule, and photoinhibition phenomena. The model has been integrated numerically, and the results show its consistency in describing the photogranule evolution and ecology, and highlight the advantages of the OPG technology, analyzing the effects of the influent wastewater composition and light conditions on the process.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Accurate estimation of the transmissibility of an infectious disease is critical to understanding disease transmission dynamics and designing effective control strategies. However, it has always been difficult to estimate the transmission rates due to the unobservability and multiple contributing factors. In this paper, we develop a data-driven inverse method based on discretizations of compartmental differential equation models for estimating time-varying transmission rates of infectious diseases. By developing iteration algorithms for three typical classes of infectious diseases, namely, a disease with seasonal cycles, a disease with nonseasonal cycles, and a disease with no obvious periodicity, we demonstrate that the discrete inverse method is a valuable tool for extracting information from available pandemic or epidemic incidence data. We also obtain insights for some epidemiological phenomena and issues of concern based on each application. Our method is highly intuitive and generates rapid implementation even with multiple years of data instances. In particular, it can be used in conjunction with other data-driven technologies, such as machine learning, to forecast future disease dynamics based on future weather conditions, policy decisions, or human mobility trends, providing guidance to public health authorities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Biological systems are known to be inherently uncertain and complex, and it is often difficult to justify rigorously functional forms used in a mathematical model. Generally, one chooses some simple function having qualitatively correct behavior without concern for the precise choice of function; the assumption has been that qualitatively similar functions will produce qualitatively similar behavior from the model. However, it has been shown that, in some cases, the qualitative predictions from a model are sensitive to the particular functional form used; this property is known as structural sensitivity. A promising tool for quantification of structural sensitivity is the use of partially specified models, in which some number of functions in equations are not defined explicitly. However, in this approach we cannot rely on the traditional parameter-based framework, where all functional forms are well defined but contain parameters to be determined. The main difficulties are that, mathematically, we need to deal with an infinite-dimensional function space and that a well-defined measure on that space is needed. We propose a novel framework to reveal the structural sensitivity and quantify uncertainty in partially specified biological models based on ordinary differential equations backed up by empirical data. Our method uses path integration, previously introduced in theoretical physics. As an insightful example, we explore structural sensitivity of a well-known tritrophic food chain model in which the functional response of the predator is uncertain, using available experimental data on protozoan predation on bacteria. For the mentioned model, we compare the novel framework with the classical methods of parameter-based sensitivity analysis and demonstrate distinct outcomes for the two approaches. Finally, we discuss a further extension of the proposed framework.},

Using the time dependent flux for the solution of the diffusion equation, we compute asymptotically the mean time for the fastest to escape alive. We use the present theory to study the role of several killing distributions on the mean extreme escape time for the fastest and compare the results with Brownian simulations.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The critical patch (KISS) size is the minimum habitat size needed for a population to survive in a region. Habitats larger than the critical patch size allow a population to persist, while smaller habitats lead to extinction. We perform a rigorous derivation of the critical patch size associated with a 2-population glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model that divides the tumor cells into proliferating and quiescent/necrotic populations. We determine that the critical patch size of our model is consistent with that of the Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation, one of the first reaction-diffusion models proposed for GBM, and does not depend on parameters pertaining to the quiescent/necrotic population. The critical patch size may indicate that GBM tumors have a minimum size depending on the location in the brain. We also derive a theoretical relationship between the size of a GBM tumor at steady-state and its maximum cell density, which has potential applications for patient-specific parameter estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging data. Finally, we identify a positively invariant region for our model, which guarantees that solutions remain positive and bounded from above for all time.},

Spatial systems with heterogeneities are ubiquitous in nature, from precipitation, temperature, and soil gradients controlling vegetation growth to morphogen gradients controlling gene expression in embryos. Such systems, generally described by nonlinear dynamical systems, often display complex parameter dependence and exhibit bifurcations. The dynamics of heterogeneous spatially extended systems passing through bifurcations are still relatively poorly understood, yet recent theoretical studies and experimental data highlight the resulting complex behaviors and their relevance to real-world applications. We explore the consequences of spatial heterogeneities passing through bifurcations via two examples strongly motivated by applications. These model systems illustrate that studying heterogeneity-induced behaviors in spatial systems is crucial for a better understanding of ecological transitions and functional organization in brain development.},

By our analyses we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair. We derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. Our general model can be specialized to include a number of subcases relevant for epidemics like COVID-19, such as, e.g., the arrival of vaccines in a second stage of the epidemic, and vaccine rationing, making social distancing the only optimizable instrument.

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, is a systemic neurological disorder associated with the formation of toxic, pathological aggregates of proteins within the brain that lead to severe cognitive decline, and eventually, death. In normal physiological conditions, the brain rids itself of toxic proteins using various clearance mechanisms. The efficacy of brain clearance can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic proteins and is also known to decline with age. Motivated by recent findings, such as the connection between brain cerebrospinal fluid clearance and sleep, we propose a mathematical model coupling the progression of toxic proteins over the brain’s structural network and protein clearance. The model is used to study the interplay between clearance in the brain, toxic seeding, brain network connectivity, aging, and progression in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for the growing body of medical research showing that clearance plays an important role in the etiology, progression, and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The study of a receptor-ligand system generally relies on the analysis of its dose-response (or concentration-effect) curve, which quantifies the relation between ligand concentration and the biological effect (or cellular response) induced when binding its specific cell surface receptor. Mathematical models of receptor-ligand systems have been developed to compute a dose-response curve under the assumption that the biological effect is proportional to the number of ligand-bound receptors. Given a dose-response curve, two quantities (or metrics) have been defined to characterize the properties of the ligand-receptor system under consideration: amplitude and potency (or half-maximal effective concentration, and denoted by EC ). Both the amplitude and the EC are key quantities commonly used in pharmaco-dynamic modeling, yet a comprehensive mathematical investigation of the behavior of these two metrics is still outstanding; for a large (and important) family of receptors, called cytokine receptors, we still do not know how amplitude and EC depend on receptor copy numbers. Here we make use of algebraic approaches (Gröbner basis) to study these metrics for a large class of receptor-ligand models, with a focus on cytokine receptors. In particular, we introduce a method, making use of two motivating examples based on the interleukin-7 (IL-7) receptor, to compute analytic expressions for the amplitude and the EC . We then extend the method to a wider class of receptor-ligand systems, sequential receptor-ligand systems with extrinsic kinase, and provide some examples. The algebraic methods developed in this paper not only reduce computational costs and numerical errors, but allow us to explicitly identify key molecular parameters and rates which determine the behavior of the dose-response curve. Thus, the proposed methods provide a novel and useful approach to perform model validation, assay design and parameter exploration of receptor-ligand systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The mystery of soaring birds, such as albatrosses and eagles, has intrigued biologists, physicists, aeronautical/control engineers, and applied mathematicians for centuries. These fascinating avian organisms are able to fly for long durations while expending little to no energy, utilizing wind to gain lift. This flight technique/maneuver is called dynamic soaring (DS). For biologists and physicists, the DS phenomenon is nothing but a wonder of the very elegant ability of these birds to interact with nature and use its physical ether in an optimal way for better survival and energy efficiency. For the engineering community, the DS phenomenon is a source of inspiration and an unequivocal opportunity for biomimicking. Mathematical characterization of the DS phenomenon in the literature has been limited to optimal control configurations that utilized developments in numerical optimization algorithms along with control methods to identify the optimal DS trajectory taken (or to be taken) by the bird/mimicking system. Unfortunately, all of these methods are highly complex and non-real-time. Hence, the mathematical characterization of the DS problem, we believe, appears to be at odds with the phenomenon/birds-behavior. In this paper, we provide a novel two-layered mathematical approach to characterize, model, mimic, and control DS in a simple real-time implementation, which we believe more effectively decodes the biological behavior of soaring birds. First, we present a differential geometric control formulation and analysis of the DS problem, which allow us to introduce a control system that is simple yet controllable. Second, we establish a link between the DS philosophy and a class of dynamical control systems known as extremum seeking systems. This linkage provides the control input that makes DS a real-time reality. We believe our framework accurately describes the biological behavior of soaring birds and opens the door for geometric control theory and extremum seeking systems to be utilized in biological systems and natural phenomena. Simulation results are provided along with comparisons to powerful optimal control solvers, illustrating the advantages of the introduced method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Investigation of biological systems often requires reconstruction of an unobservable continuous process from discrete time-series data sampled from a related process or processes. When the reconstructed process cannot be validated with experimental data, it is particularly important to quantify the uncertainty on the inferred process, and new methodologies are needed to support both the inference and uncertainty quantification. This work derives a novel statistical model that combines an established differential model of intra- and extravascular C-peptide dynamics with a Gaussian process model of insulin secretion rate (ISR) in order to provide clinical measures of beta-cell function with quantified uncertainty. These measures are computed from the ISR that is inferred from measured C-peptide data. The model is first validated using synthetic data, and then applied to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) data from youth participants with and without cystic fibrosis (CF). Because CF is characterized by scarring and fibrosis of the pancreas, impairment of beta-cell function, rather than reduced insulin sensitivity, is implicated in the early etiology of CF-related diabetes (CFRD). ISR-derived measures of beta-cell function show worsening beta-cell function from healthy control to CF to CFRD groups consistent with previous reports on dysglycemia in CF. However, the model additionally allows uncertainty in the data to be propagated to ISR and ISR-derived measures of beta-cell function. These results provide insight into uncertainty in ISR-derived measures of beta cell function, characterize interindividual variability in CFRD etiology, and provide novel metrics to quantify the pathogenesis of CFRD.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Social insects are ecologically and evolutionarily the most successful organisms on earth and can achieve robust collective behaviors through local interactions among group members. Colony migration has been considered as a leading example of collective decision making in social insects. In this paper, a piecewise colony migration system with recruitment switching is proposed to explore underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects of colony size and quorum on the outcomes of collective decision. The dynamical behavior of the nonsmooth system is studied, and sufficient conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium are provided. The theoretical results suggest that large colonies are more likely to emigrate to a new site. More interesting findings include but are not limited to that (a) the system may exhibit oscillation when the colony size is below a critical level and (b) the system may also exhibit a bistable state, i.e., the colony migrates to a new site or the old nest depending on the initial size of recruiters. Bifurcation analysis shows that the variations of colony size and quorum threshold greatly impact the dynamics. The results suggest that it is important to distinguish between two populations of recruiters in modeling. This work may provide important insights on how simple and local interactions achieve the collective migrating activity in social insects.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cell-cell adhesion is one the most fundamental mechanisms regulating collective cell migration during tissue development, homeostasis, and repair, allowing cell populations to self-organize and eventually form and maintain complex tissue shapes. Cells interact with each other via the formation of protrusions or filopodia and they adhere to other cells through binding of cell surface proteins. The resulting adhesive forces are then related to cell size and shape and, often, continuum models represent them by nonlocal attractive interactions. In this paper, we present a new continuum model of cell-cell adhesion which can be derived from a general nonlocal model in the limit of short-range interactions. This new model is local, resembling a system of thin-film type equations, with the various model parameters playing the role of surface tensions between different cell populations. Numerical simulations in one and two dimensions reveal that the local model maintains the diversity of cell sorting patterns observed both in experiments and in previously used nonlocal models. In addition, it also has the advantage of having explicit stationary solutions, which provides a direct link between the model parameters and the differential adhesion hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Circadian oscillations have been reported in major renal functions such as renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary excretion. These oscillations can be explained, in part, by the rhythmic variations in renal transporter expressions. However, given that a multitude of renal transporters are regulated by the circadian clock, and that the functions of some of these transporters are coupled, the underlying mechanisms that link variations in transporter expression to the observed changes in kidney function have yet to be fully elucidated. To better understand the impact of the circadian clock on renal solute and water transport, we have developed a computational model of the epithelial transport of the rat kidney that represents the observed rhythmic variations in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and in the activities of Na/H exchanger 3, sodium-gLucose cotransporter 1, epithelial Na channels, pendrin, and renal outer-medullary K channels. The model predicts the rhythmic oscillations in GFR and key renal transporter activities give rise to a significant shift in transport loads among different nephron segments. Together, these oscillations yield 3-4-fold daily fluctuations in urine output and urinary electrolyte excretion rates.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Stochastic oscillations in individual cells are usually characterized by a nonmonotonic power spectrum with an oscillatory autocorrelation function. Here we develop an analytical approach to stochastic oscillations in a minimal hybrid model of stochastic gene expression including promoter state switching, protein synthesis and degradation, as well as a genetic feedback loop. The oscillations observed in our model are noise-induced since the deterministic theory predicts stable fixed points. The autocorrelated function, power spectrum, and steady-state distribution of protein concentration fluctuations are computed in closed form. Using the exactly solvable model, we illustrate sustained oscillations as a circular motion along a stochastic hysteresis loop induced by gene state switching. A triphasic stochastic bifurcation upon the increasing strength of negative feedback is observed, which reveals how stochastic bursts evolve into stochastic oscillations. In our model, oscillations tend to occur when the protein is relatively stable and when gene switching is relatively slow. Translational bursting is found to enhance the robustness and broaden the region of stochastic oscillations. These results provide deeper insights into R. Thomas’s two conjectures for single-cell gene expression kinetics.},

We allow for curved menisci, specified via a depression angle at the contact line. We focus on the limit of small solid fractions where the length of the wetted portion of the slat is small compared with the period. Following an earlier analysis of the comparable flow over noninvaded grooves [O. Schnitzer, J. Fluid Mech., 820 (2017), pp. 580–603], this singular limit is treated using matched asymptotic expansions, with an outer region on the scale of a single period and an inner region on the scale of the wetted portion of the slat. The flow problem in both regions is solved using conformal mappings. Asymptotic matching yields a closed-form approximation for the slip length as a function of the solid fraction and depression angle.},

In the first method, some superposition of wave functions with random frequencies and angles of propagation are used to get periodic rough surfaces with analytic parametric equations. The amplitude of such surfaces is also an important variable in the provided eigenvalue analysis for the Laplace–Beltrami operator and in the generation of pattern formation. Numerical experiments show that the patterns become irregular as the amplitude and frequency of the rough surface increase. For the sake of easy generalization to closed manifolds, we propose a second construction method for rough surfaces, which uses random nodal values and discretized heat filters. We provide numerical evidence that both surface construction methods yield comparable patterns to those observed in real-life animals.},

FHTs have been well-studied for diffusive search, especially for small targets, which is called the narrow capture or narrow escape problem. In this paper, we study the FHT to small targets for a one-dimensional superdiffusive search described by a Lévy flight. By applying the method of matched asymptotic expansions to a fractional differential equation we obtain an explicit asymptotic expansion for the mean FHT (MFHT). For fractional order (describing a -stable Lévy flight whose squared displacement scales as in time ) and targets of radius , we show that the MFHT is order one for and diverges as for and for . We then use our asymptotic results to identify the value of which minimizes the average MFHT and find that (a) this optimal value of vanishes for sparse targets and (b) the value (corresponding to an inverse square Lévy search) is optimal in only very specific circumstances. We confirm our results by comparison to both deterministic numerical solutions of the associated fractional differential equation and stochastic simulations.},

We obtain the asymptotic band structures and corresponding eigenstates in the subwavelength regime using the layer potential theory. Specifically, we rigorously prove the existence of the double Dirac cones lying on the second to fifth bands when the six inclusions satisfy an additional symmetry. This type of inclusion will be referred to as super honeycomb-structured inclusions. Two distinct deformations breaking the additional symmetry, contraction and dilation, are further discussed. We prove that the double Dirac cone disappears, and a local spectral gap opens. The corresponding eigenstates are also obtained to show the topological differences between these two deformations.

When examining a model of opinion dynamics, it is beneficial to infer its parameters using empirical data. In this paper, we study an example of such an inference problem. We consider a mean-field bounded-confidence model with an unknown interaction kernel between individuals. This interaction kernel encodes how individuals with different opinions interact and affect each other’s opinions. Because it is often difficult to quantitatively measure opinions as empirical data from observations or experiments, we assume that the available data takes the form of partial observations of a cumulative distribution function of opinions. We prove that certain measurements guarantee a precise and unique inference of the interaction kernel and propose a numerical method to reconstruct an interaction kernel from a limited number of data points. Our numerical results suggest that the error of the inferred interaction kernel decays exponentially as we strategically enlarge the data set.},

We distinguish two cases depending on the tick life cycle, which acts as a delay in the tick population model. With a small delay, our equilibrium analysis gives sharp conditions for the occurrence of extinction, single-pathogen establishment, pathogen invasion, and pathogen co-existence. We develop a cascading argument and use the invasion reproduction number to characterize the global dynamics of co-infection. With a large delay, we characterize the co-infection dynamics as extinction and pathogen co-existence as a globally attractive periodic solution, depending on the invasion reproduction number calculated using the next-generation operator approach. Our numerical trials guided by our global convergence (to periodic solutions) results illustrate a new and interesting phenomenon: the co-infection transmission outcomes are sensitive to the variation of the developmental delay (which is affected by the climatic conditions) when the tick population converges to a periodic solution bifurcated from a co-existence equilibrium and when the co-infection basic reproduction number is, with the onset of Hopf bifurcation, close to the threshold.},

The challenge is that atomic-scale models of the dynamics are aperiodic for generic twist angles because of the incommensurability of the layers. The Bistritzer–MacDonald PDE model, which is periodic with respect to the bilayer’s moiré pattern, has recently been shown to rigorously describe these dynamics in a parameter regime. In this work, we first prove that the dynamics of the tight-binding model of incommensurate twisted bilayer graphene can be approximated by computations on finite domains. The main ingredient of this proof is a speed of propagation estimate proved using Combes–Thomas estimates. We then provide extensive numerical computations, which clarify the range of validity of the Bistritzer–MacDonald model.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Spatial memory is key in animal movement modeling, but it has been challenging to explicitly model learning to describe memory acquisition. In this paper, we study novel cognitive consumer-resource models with different consumer learning mechanisms and investigate their dynamics. These models consist of two PDEs in composition with one ODE such that the spectrum of the corresponding linearized operator at a constant steady state is unclear. We describe the spectra of the linearized operators and analyze the eigenvalue problems to determine the stability of the constant steady states. We then perform bifurcation analysis by taking the perceptual diffusion rate as the bifurcation parameter. It is found that steady-state and Hopf bifurcations can both occur in these systems, and the bifurcation points are given so that the stability region can be determined. Moreover, rich spatial and spatiotemporal patterns can be generated in such systems via different types of bifurcation. Our effort establishes a new approach to tackling a hybrid model of PDE-ODE composition and provides a deeper understanding of cognitive movement-driven consumer-resource dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The quantitative modeling and design of modern short-pulse fiber lasers cannot be performed with averaged models because of large variations in the pulse parameters within each round trip. Instead, lumped models obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser are required. Since the optical pulses in lumped models are periodic, their linear stability is investigated using the monodromy operator, which is the linearization of the roundtrip operator about the pulse. A gradient-based optimization method is developed to discover periodic pulses. The computation of the gradient of the objective function involves numerical computation of the action of both the roundtrip operator and the adjoint of the monodromy operator. A novel Fourier split-step method is introduced to compute solutions of the linearization of the nonlinear, nonlocal, stiff equation that models optical propagation in the fiber amplifier. This method is derived by linearizing the two solution operators in a split-step method for the nonlinear equation. The spectrum of the monodromy operator consists of the essential spectrum, for which there is an analytical formula, and the eigenvalues. There is a multiplicity two eigenvalue at , which is due to phase and translation invariance. The remaining eigenvalues are determined from a matrix discretization of the monodromy operator. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the numerical methods; show examples of periodically stationary pulses, their spectra, and their eigenfunctions; and discuss their stability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose and analyze a new methodology based on linear-quadratic regulation (LQR) for stabilizing falling liquid films via blowing and suction at the base. LQR methods enable rapidly responding feedback control by precomputing a gain matrix, but they are only suitable for systems of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). By contrast, the Navier–Stokes equations that describe the dynamics of a thin liquid film flowing down an inclined plane are too complex to stabilize with standard control-theoretical techniques. To bridge this gap, we use reduced-order models—the Benney equation and a weighted-residual integral boundary layer model—obtained via asymptotic analysis to derive a multilevel control framework. This framework consists of an LQR feedback control designed for a linearized and discretized system of ODEs approximating the reduced-order system, which is then applied to the full Navier–Stokes system. The control scheme is tested via direct numerical simulation (DNS) and compared to analytical predictions of linear stability thresholds and minimum required actuator numbers. Comparing the strategy between the two reduced-order models, we show that in both cases we can successfully stabilize towards a uniform flat film across their respective ranges of valid parameters, with the more accurate weighted-residual model outperforming the Benney-derived controls. The weighted-residual controls are also found to work successfully far beyond their anticipated range of applicability. The proposed methodology increases the feasibility of transferring robust control techniques towards real-world systems and is also generalizable to other forms of actuation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Foraging is crucial for animals to survive. Many species forage in groups, as individuals communicate to share information about the location of available resources. For example, eusocial foragers, such as honey bees and many ants, recruit members from their central hive or nest to a known foraging site. However, the optimal level of communication and recruitment depends on the overall group size, the distribution of available resources, and the extent of interference between multiple individuals attempting to forage from a site. In this paper, we develop a discrete-time Markov chain model of eusocial foragers, who communicate information with a certain probability. We compare the stochastic model and its corresponding infinite population limit. We find that foraging efficiency tapers off when recruitment probability is too high, a phenomenon that does not occur in the infinite population model, even though it occurs for any finite population size. The marginal inefficiency at high recruitment probability increases as the population increases, similar to a boundary layer. In particular, we prove there is a significant gap between the foraging efficiency of finite and infinite population models in the extreme case of complete communication. We also analyze this phenomenon by approximating the stationary distribution of foragers over sites in terms of mean escape times from multiple quasi-steady states. We conclude that, for any finite group of foragers, an individual who has found a resource should only sometimes recruit others to the same resource. We discuss the relationship between our analysis and multiagent multiarm bandit problems.},

Interest in this model stems from its ability to generate spatio-temporal structures, including pulses, spots, stripes, and self-replicating patterns. We consider an extension of this model in which the spread of the different chemicals is assumed to be nonlocal and can thus be represented by an integral operator. In particular, we focus on the case of strictly positive, symmetric, convolution kernels that have a finite second moment. Modeling the equations on a finite interval, we prove the existence of small-time weak solutions in the case of nonlocal Dirichlet and Neumann boundary constraints. We then use this result to develop a finite element numerical scheme that helps us explore the effects of nonlocal diffusion on the formation of pulse solutions.},

We establish the well-posedness of the model and examine the existence and stability of equilibria. Through extensive numerical simulations, we validate our findings and visually explore the interactive effects of fear and food quality. Our results reveal that the fear effect from predators stabilizes the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the fear effect amplifies the influence of food quality on consumers. When food quality is favorable, the fear effect enhances consumer production efficiency, whereas, in the case of poor food quality, the fear effect exacerbates the decline in production efficiency caused by low-nutrient food.},

In contrast to the usual applications of this nonlinear evolution equation of the reaction-diffusion type, the solution quantity in the present context needs to stay neither bounded nor positive. We focus on the solution behavior beyond a finite-time point blow-up event, which consists of two moving singularities (representing the cores of the vortex legs) propagating in opposite directions, and their initial motion is determined with the method of matched asymptotic expansions. After resolving subtleties concerning the transition between logarithmic and algebraic expansion terms regarding asymptotic layers, we find that the internal singularity structure resembles a combination of second- and first-order poles in the form of a singular traveling wave with a time-dependent speed imprinted through the characteristics of the preceding blow-up event.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we are interested in the spatiotemporal pattern formations and bifurcations for a nondegenerate reaction-diffusion rabies SIR model which was used to explain the epidemiological patterns observed in Europe. First, by using the iteration methods, we are able to show the global existence and boundedness of in-time solutions of the parabolic system. Second, for the ODEs, we analytically prove the phenomena observed by Anderson et al. [Nature, 289 (1981), pp. 765–771]: if the carrying capacity is smaller than some positive , then rabies eventually dies out; if is larger than , then the rabies prevails. Moreover, if for some positive , then the endemic equilibrium solution is (locally asymptotically) stable, while it is unstable if . In particular, at , the loss of the stability of the endemic equilibrium leads to a Hopf bifurcation. Finally, for the PDEs, we derive sufficient conditions on the diffusion rates so that under these conditions, Turing instability of both the endemic equilibrium solution and the Hopf bifurcating spatially homogeneous periodic solutions can occur. Once Turing instability of the solution (equilibrium or periodic solution) occurs, it is observed numerically that the system might have new spatiotemporal patterns.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cover times measure the speed of exhaustive searches which require the exploration of an entire spatial region(s). Applications include the immune system hunting pathogens, animals collecting food, robotic demining or cleaning, and computer search algorithms. Mathematically, a cover time is the first time a random searcher(s) comes within a specified “detection radius” of every point in the target region (often the entire spatial domain). Due to their many applications and their fundamental probabilistic importance, cover times have been extensively studied in the physics and probability literatures. This prior work has generally studied cover times of a single searcher with a vanishing detection radius or a large target region. This prior work has further claimed that cover times for multiple searchers can be estimated by a simple rescaling of the cover time of a single searcher. In this paper, we study cover times of many diffusive or subdiffusive searchers and show that prior estimates break down as the number of searchers grows. We prove a rather universal formula for all the moments of such cover times in the many searcher limit that depends only on (i) the searcher’s characteristic (sub)diffusivity and (ii) a certain geodesic distance between the searcher starting location(s) and the farthest point in the target. This formula is otherwise independent of the detection radius, space dimension, target size, and domain size. We illustrate our results in several examples and compare them to detailed stochastic simulations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Phages are ubiquitous in nature, but many essential factors of host-phage biology have not yet been integrated into mathematical models. In this paper, we investigate a spatial phage-bacteria model to describe the propagation of phages and bacteria in different types of nutrient media. Unlike existing models, we construct a more realistic reaction-diffusion model that incorporates inoculum and bacterial growth and movement, then rigorous mathematical analysis is challenging. We study traveling wave solutions and obtain complete information about the existence and nonexistence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions. The threshold conditions for the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions are obtained by using Schauder’s fixed point theorem, limiting argument, and one-sided Laplace transform. Considering different propagation media, we extend the existence of traveling wave solutions from liquid nutrition model to agar model. Moreover, in the absence of bacterial mortality, we obtain the existence of a new traveling wave solution describing phage invasion. We attempt to explain the occurrence of co-transport by the existence and nonexistence of traveling waves, and screen out the key parameters affecting the co-transport of phages and bacteria according to the definition of critical wave speed. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to verify the theoretical results and reveal the effects of key parameters on the propagation of phages and bacteria.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. As summarized by Papageorgiou [Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech., 51 (2019), pp. 155–187], a strong normal electric field can cause instability of the interface in a hydrodynamic system. In the present work, singularities arising in electrocapillary-gravity waves on a dielectric fluid of finite depth due to an electric field imposed in the direction perpendicular to the undisturbed free surface are investigated. In shallow water, for a small-amplitude periodic disturbance in the linearly unstable regime, the outcome of the system evolution is that the gas-liquid interface touches the solid bottom boundary, causing a rupture. A quasi-linear hyperbolic model is derived for the long-wave limit and used to study the formation of the touch-down singularity. The theoretical predictions are compared with the fully nonlinear computations by a time-dependent conformal mapping for the electrified Euler equations, showing good agreement. On the other hand, a nonlinear dispersive model system is derived for the deep-water scenario, which predicts the blowup singularity (i.e., the wave amplitude tends to infinity in a finite time). However, when the fluid thickness is significantly large, one can numerically show the self-intersection nonphysical wave structure or 2/3 power cusp singularity in the full Euler equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider conservation laws with nonlocal velocity and show, for nonlocal weights of exponential type, that the unique solutions converge in a weak or strong sense (dependent on the regularity of the velocity) to the entropy solution of the local conservation law when the nonlocal weight approaches a Dirac distribution. To this end, we first establish a uniform total variation bound on the nonlocal velocity, which can be used to pass to the limit in the weak solution. For the required entropy admissibility, we use a tailored entropy-flux pair and take advantage of a well-known result that a single strictly convex entropy-flux pair is sufficient for uniqueness, given some additional constraints on the velocity. For general weights, we show that the monotonicity of the initial datum is preserved over time, which enables us to prove convergence to the local entropy solution for rather general kernels if the initial datum is monotone. This case covers the archetypes of local conservation laws: shock waves and rarefactions. These results suggest that a “nonlocal in the velocity” approximation might be better suited to approximating local conservation laws than a nonlocal in the solution approximation, in which such monotonicity only holds for specific velocities.},

Based on lubrication approximation and thin air-foil theory, this problem is reduced to an integro-differential equation. The small-amplitude analysis is carried out to obtain two analytical solutions up to the second order. Numerical computation shows there exist two distinct primary bifurcation branches starting from infinitesimal waves, which approach solitary wave configuration in the long-wave limit when the values of physical parameters are above certain thresholds. New families of solutions manifest themselves either as secondary bifurcation occurring on primary branches or as isolated solution branches. The limiting configurations of the primary solution branches with the increase of two parameters are studied in two different cases, where one and two limiting configurations are obtained, respectively. For the latter case, the approximation of the configurations is given.},

This equation arises in many applications, for example, when solving the discrete Helmholtz equation associated with scattering on a domain with perpendicular boundary. The traditional Wiener–Hopf method is suitable for problems involving boundary data on co-linear semi-infinite intervals, not for boundaries at an angle. This significant extension will enable the analytical solution to a new class of problems with more boundary configurations. Progress is made by defining an underlining manifold that links the two variables. This allows one to meromorphically continue the unknown functions on this manifold and formulate a jump condition. As a result the problem is fully solvable in terms of Cauchy-type integrals, which is surprising since this is not always possible for this type of functional equation.},

The nonlinear interactions are studied by imposing finite amplitude disturbances to the classical model deliberated in Chang, Chen, and Straughan [J. Fluid Mech., 564 (2006), pp. 287–303]. The order parameter theory is used to ascertain the cubic Landau equation, and the regimes of instability for the bifurcations are determined henceforth. The well-established controlling parameters viz. the depth ratio depth of fluid domain/depth of porous domain), the Beavers–Joseph constant , and the Darcy number are inquired upon for the bifurcation phenomena. The imposed finite amplitude disturbances are viewed for bifurcations along the neutral stability curves and away from the critical point as a function of the wave number and the Reynolds number . The even-fluid-layer (porous) mode along the neutral stability curves correlates to the subcritical (supercritical) bifurcation phenomena. On perceiving the bifurcations as a function of and by moving away from the bifurcation/critical point, subcritical bifurcation is observed for increasing and decreasing . In contrast to only fluid flow through a channel, it is found that the inclusion of porous domain aids in the early appearance of subcritical bifurcation when . A considerable difference between the computed skin friction coefficient for the base and the distorted state is observed for small (large) values of .

Dynamics for periodic arrays of identical drops and pairwise droplet interactions are investigated, providing insights into the coarsening dynamics of a large droplet system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a study is carried out on the spatiotemporal dynamics of a Lengyel–Epstein model describing the chlorite-iodine-malonic-acid (CIMA) reaction with time delay and the Neumann boundary condition in a two-dimensional region. The existences for Turing, Hopf, Turing–Turing, Turing–Hopf, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations are derived by analyzing the dispersion relation between eigenvalues and wave numbers. In particular, to study the dynamics around a Turing–Hopf bifurcation singularity, the amplitude equations near a codimension-two bifurcation point are derived by employing the weakly nonlinear analysis method. Different spatiotemporal patterns for the system in parameter space are classified and various patterns identified, including spatially homogeneous periodic solutions, mixed mode, coexistence mode, bistable phenomenon, square, hexagon, black eye, two-phase oscillating staggered hexagon lattice, and other complex spatiotemporal patterns. The theoretical predictions are verified by numerical simulations showing an excellent agreement with many reported experiment results not only in chemistry but also in physics and biology. Results presented in this article reveal the mechanism of generating the spatiotemporal patterns of the CIMA reaction.},

The familiar walk-on-spheres method, often utilized for simulating Brownian motion, is modified to a novel walk-in-and-out-of-balls method adapted for modeling the stable path process on the exterior of regions “probed” by this type of generalized random walk. It accounts for the propensity of this class of random walk to jump through boundaries because of the path discontinuity. This method allows for the computationally efficient simulation of hitting locations of stable paths launched from the exterior of probed sets. Reliable methods of computing capacity from these locations are given, along with non-standard confidence intervals.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze and quantify the amount of heat generated by a nanoparticle, injected in a background medium, while excited by incident electromagnetic waves. These nanoparticles are dispersive with electric permittivity following the Lorentz model. The purpose is to determine the quantity of heat generated extremely close to the nanoparticle (at a distance proportional to the radius of the nanoparticle). This study extends our previous results, derived in the 2D TM and TE regimes, to the full Maxwell system. We show that by exciting the medium with incident frequencies close to the plasmonic or Dielectric resonant frequencies, we can generate any desired amount of heat close to the injected nanoparticle while the amount of heat decreases away from it. These results offer a wide range of potential applications in the areas of photo-thermal therapy, drug delivery, and material science, to cite a few. To do so, we employ time-domain integral equations and asymptotic analysis techniques to study the corresponding mathematical model for heat generation. This model is given by the heat equation where the body source term comes from the modulus of the electric field generated by the used incident electromagnetic field. Therefore, we first analyze the dominant term of this electric field by studying the full Maxwell scattering problem in the presence of plasmonic or all-dielectric nanoparticles. As a second step, we analyze the propagation of this dominant electric field in the estimation of the heat potential. For both the electromagnetic and parabolic models, the presence of the nanoparticles is translated into the appearance of large scales in the contrasts for the heat-conductivity (for the parabolic model) and the permittivity (for the full Maxwell system) between the nanoparticle and its surroundings.},

We first establish the representation formula of the solution of the coupled system using the layer potential techniques. Based on the Fourier series, the perfect hydrodynamic cloaking and shielding conditions are derived for the control region with the cross-sectional shape being an annulus or a confocal ellipses. Then we further propose an optimization scheme for the design of approximate cloaks and shields within general geometries. The well-posedness of the optimization problem is proved. In particular, the conditions that can ensure the occurrence of approximate cloaks and shields for general geometries are also established. Our theoretical findings are validated and supplemented by a variety of numerical results.

Perhaps more importantly, we provide the first numerical calculations of scattering phases for nonradial scatterers. They show that the asymptotic Weyl law is accurate even at low frequencies and reveal effects of trapping such as lack of monotonicity.

To overcome some limits of classical neuronal models, we propose a Markovian generalization of the classical model based on Jacobi processes by introducing downwards jumps to describe the activity of a single neuron. The statistical analysis of interspike intervals is performed by studying the first passage times of the proposed Markovian Jacobi process with jumps through a constant boundary. In particular, we characterize its Laplace transform, which is expressed in terms of some generalization of hypergeometric functions that we introduce, and deduce a closed-form expression for its expectation. Our approach, which is original in the context of first-passage-time problems, relies on intertwining relations between the semigroups of the classical Jacobi process and its generalization, which have been recently established in [P. Cheridito et al., J. Ec. Polytech. - Math., 8 (2021), pp. 331–378].

In this paper, we prove the Fourier diffraction theorem, which relates the two-dimensional Fourier transform of scattered waves with the Fourier transform of the scatterer in the three-dimensional spatial Fourier domain. Elastic wave mode separation is performed, which decomposes a wave into five modes. A new two-step inversion process is developed, providing information on the modes first and second on the elastic parameters. Finally, we discuss reconstructions with plane wave excitation experiments for different tomographic setups and with different plane wave excitation frequencies, respectively.},

In particular, we determine Riemann invariants and prove richness and total linear degeneracy of the hyperbolic systems. Moreover, a physically reasonable invariant domain is obtained for all equations of the hierarchy. Additionally, we investigate the full relaxation system with respect to stability and persistence of periodic (stop-and-go-type) solutions and derive a condition for the appearance of such solutions.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The mechanism of seed dispersal mutualism is fundamental to understanding vegetation diversity and its conservation. In this study, we propose a stochastic model that extends the classical framework of seed dispersal mutualism to explore the effects of environmental stochasticity on mutualistic interactions between seed dispersers and plants. We first provide a comprehensive picture of the long-term dynamics of seed dispersal mutualism in deterministic and stochastic environments. We then analyze the relationship between stochasticity and the probability and time that seed dispersal mutualism tips between stable states. Additionally, we evaluate the extinction risk of seed dispersal mutualism for different population values and accordingly assign extinction warning levels to these values. The analysis reveals that the impact of environmental stochasticity on tipping phenomena is scenario-dependent but follows some interpretable trends. The probability (resp., time) of tipping towards the extinction state typically increases (resp., decreases) monotonically with noise intensity, while the probability of tipping towards the coexistence state typically peaks at intermediate noise intensity. Noise in animal populations contributes to tipping toward the coexistence state, whereas noise in plant populations slows down the tipping toward the coexistence state. Noise-induced changes in warning levels of initial population values are most pronounced near the boundaries of the basin of attraction, but sufficiently loud noise (especially for plant populations) may alter the risk far from these boundaries. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for the effect of environmental stochasticity on multistability transitions in seed dispersal mutualism and can be utilized to study the interplay between other population systems and environmental stochasticity.},

In the setting of a microbial community, this property induces a Nash equilibrium problem because access to environmental resources is bounded. If microbes are also distributed in space, then those resources are subject to transport limitations (encoded in a PDE) and so microbial strategies at one location influence resources and, hence, microbial strategies, at another. Here we formulate the resulting PDE-coupled generalized Nash equilibrium problem for a multispecies biofilm community, and propose a domain-decomposition-based method for its solution.

All these authors obtained their results applying variational methods to compute the maximum of a functional ratio derived from the Reynolds–Orr energy identity. Orr and Joseph obtained different results; for instance, in the Couette case Orr computed the critical Reynolds value of 44.3 (on spanwise perturbations) and Joseph 20.65 (on streamwise perturbations). Recently in [P. Falsaperla, G. Mulone, and C. Perrone, Eur. J. Mech. B Fluids, 93 (2022), pp. 93–100], the authors conjectured that the search of the maximum should be restricted to a subspace of the space of kinematically admissible perturbations. With this conjecture, the critical nonlinear energy Reynolds number was found among spanwise perturbations (a Squire theorem for nonlinear systems). With a direct proof and an appropriate and original decomposition of the dissipation terms in the Reynolds–Orr identity we show the validity of this conjecture in the space of three-dimensional perturbations.},

We identify a taxonomic property on the growth functions in the multispecies chemostat model which ensures the coexistence of a subset of species under periodic removal rate. We show that proportions of some powers of the species densities are periodic functions, leading to an infinity of distinct neutrally stable periodic orbits depending on the initial condition. This condition on the species for neutral stability possesses the feature to be independent of the shape of the periodic signal for a given mean value. We also give conditions allowing the coexistence of two distinct subsets of species. Although these conditions are nongeneric, we show in simulations that when these conditions are only approximately satisfied, the behavior of the solutions is close to that of the nongeneric case over a long time interval, justifying the interest of our study.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze the well-posedness of certain field-only boundary integral equations (BIEs) for frequency domain electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting spheres. Starting from the observations that (1) the three components of the scattered electric field and (2) scalar quantity are radiative solutions of the Helmholtz equation, we see that novel boundary integral equation formulations of electromagnetic scattering from perfectly conducting obstacles can be derived using Green’s identities applied to the aforementioned quantities and the boundary conditions on the surface of the scatterer. The unknowns of these formulations are the normal derivatives of the three components of the scattered electric field and the normal component of the scattered electric field on the surface of the scatterer, and thus these formulations are referred to as field-only BIEs. In this paper we use the combined field methodology of Burton and Miller within the field-only BIE approach, and we derive new boundary integral formulations that feature only Helmholtz boundary integral operators, which we subsequently show to be well posed for all positive frequencies in the case of spherical scatterers. Relying on the spectral properties of Helmholtz boundary integral operators in spherical geometries, we show that the combined field-only boundary integral operators are diagonalizable in the case of spherical geometries and their eigenvalues are nonzero for all frequencies. Furthermore, we show that for spherical geometries one of the field-only integral formulations considered in this paper exhibits eigenvalues clustering at one—a property similar to second-kind integral equations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Repulsion between individuals within a finite radius is encountered in numerous applications, including cell exclusion, i.e., avoidance of overlapping cells, bird flocks, or microscopic pedestrian models. We define such individual-based particle dynamics in one spatial dimension with minimal assumptions of the repulsion force as well as their external velocity and prove their characteristic properties. Moreover, we are able to perform a rigorous limit from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale, where we could recover the finite interaction radius as a density threshold. Specific choices for the repulsion force lead to well-known nonlinear diffusion equations on the macroscopic scale, as, e.g., the porous medium equation. At both scaling levels, numerical simulations are presented and compared to underline the analytical results.},
