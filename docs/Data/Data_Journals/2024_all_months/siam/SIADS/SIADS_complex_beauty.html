  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach using symbolic differentiation for the discovery of slow invariant manifolds (SIMs), for the general class of fast-slow dynamical systems of ODEs. In contrast to other machine learning approaches that construct reduced order black-box surrogate models using simple regression, and/or require a priori knowledge of the fast and slow variables per se, our approach simultaneously decomposes the vector field into fast and slow components and provides a functional of the underlying SIM in a closed form. The decomposition is achieved by finding a transformation of the state variables to the fast and slow ones, which enables the derivation of an explicit, in terms of fast variables, SIM functional. The latter is obtained by solving a PDE corresponding to the invariance equation within the geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) using a single-layer feedforward neural network with symbolic differentiation. The performance of the proposed numerical framework is assessed via three benchmark problems. We also provide a comparison with other GSPT methods, namely the quasi steady state approximation (QSSA), the partial equilibrium approximation (PEA), and computational singular perturbation (CSP) with one and two iterations. We show that the proposed PINN scheme provides SIM approximations of equivalent or even higher numerical accuracy than those provided by QSSA, PEA, and CSP, especially close to the boundaries of the underlying SIMs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Computing reduced-order models using non-intrusive methods is particularly attractive for systems that are simulated using black-box solvers. However, obtaining accurate data-driven models can be challenging, especially if the underlying systems exhibit large-amplitude transient growth. Although these systems may evolve near a low-dimensional subspace that can be easily identified using standard techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), computing accurate models often requires projecting the state onto this subspace via a non-orthogonal projection. While appropriate oblique projection operators can be computed using intrusive techniques that leverage the form of the underlying governing equations, purely data-driven methods currently tend to achieve dimensionality reduction via orthogonal projections, and this can lead to models with poor predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a non-intrusive framework designed to simultaneously identify oblique projection operators and reduced-order dynamics. In particular, given training trajectories and assuming reduced-order dynamics of polynomial form, we fit a reduced-order model by solving an optimization problem over the product manifold of a Grassmann manifold, a Stiefel manifold, and several linear spaces (as many as the tensors that define the low-order dynamics). Furthermore, we show that the gradient of the cost function with respect to the optimization parameters can be conveniently written in closed form, so that there is no need for automatic differentiation. We compare our formulation with state-of-the-art methods on three examples: a three-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, the complex Ginzburg–Landau (CGL) equation, and a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural mass models offer a robust mathematical framework for studying the collective behavior of neural populations and their role in brain function and dysfunction. In this work, we consider a neural mass model which consists of a network of an arbitrary number of Wilson–Cowan nodes with homeostatic adjustment of the inhibitory coupling strength and time-delayed, excitatory coupling. We extend previous work on this model to include distributed time delays with commonly used kernel distributions: delta function, uniform distribution, and gamma distribution. Focusing on networks which satisfy a constant row sum condition, we show how each eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix may be related to a Hopf bifurcation and that the eigenvalue determines whether the bifurcation leads to synchronized or desynchronized oscillatory behavior. We consider two example networks, one with all real eigenvalues (bidirectional ring) and one with some complex eigenvalues (unidirectional ring). In bidirectional rings, the Hopf curves are organized so that only the synchronized Hopf leads to asymptotically stable behavior. Thus the behavior in the network is always synchronous. In the unidirectional ring networks, however, intersection points of asynchronous and synchronous Hopf curves may occur, resulting in codimension-two Hopf-Hopf bifurcation points. Thus asymptotically stable synchronous and asynchronous limit cycles can occur as well as torus-like solutions which combine synchronous and asynchronous behavior. Increasing the size of the network or a discrete time delay makes these intersection points, and the associated asynchronous behavior, more likely to occur. The effect of distributed time delays is subtle, with some distributions showing asynchronous behavior more likely for small mean delays and less for larger. Numerical approaches are used to confirm the findings, with Hopf bifurcation curves plotted using Wolfram Mathematica. These insights offer a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying desynchronization in large networks of oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Ecosystems are shaped by disturbances such as fires and harvests that occur on faster timescales than recovery processes like population growth. Flow-kick models resolve these disturbances as discrete, periodic impulses in time, while ODE models smooth out disturbances in time as continuous processes. Here we assess this simplification by comparing dynamics of continuously disturbed ODE models to those of flow-kick models with the same average disturbance rate. In the case that kicks are small and high-frequency, we find that an ODE predicts similar dynamics as an analogous discrete disturbance model. First, we prove that flow-kick maps generate an analogous vector field in the limit as the kick magnitude and return period approach zero in a fixed proportion. Second, we present conditions under which equilibria, saddle-node bifurcations, and transcritical bifurcations continue from ODE to analogous flow-kick systems. We also provide numerical evidence that similarities between continuous and discrete disturbance models can break down as kicks become less frequent and larger. We illustrate implications of these differences in a nonspatial Klausmeier model of vegetation and precipitation dynamics. We conclude that although ODEs may suffice to model high-frequency disturbances, resolving lower-frequency disturbances in time may be essential to effectively predicting their effects.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Hybrid dynamical systems are systems which undergo both continuous and discrete transitions. As typical in dynamical analysis, an essential goal is to study the long-term behavior of these systems. In this work, we present two different novel approaches for studying these systems. The first approach is based on constructing an analogue of the Frobenius–Perron (transport) operator for hybrid systems. Rather than tracking the evolution of a single trajectory, this operator encodes the asymptotic nature of an ensemble of trajectories. The second approach presented applies to an important subclass of hybrid systems, mechanical impact systems. We develop an analogue of Lie–Poisson(–Suslov) reduction for left-invariant impact systems on Lie groups. In addition to the Hamiltonian (and constraints) being left-invariant, the impact surface must also be a right coset of a normal subgroup. This procedure allows a reduction from a -dimensional system to an -dimensional one. We conclude the paper by presenting numerical results on a diverse array of applications.},

Assuming a transcritical normal form for the reaction term and viewing the slow variable as a dynamic bifurcation parameter, we analyze the passage through the fast subsystem bifurcation point for the spectral Galerkin approximation of the PDE. We characterize the invariant manifolds for the finite-dimensional Galerkin ODEs using geometric desingularization via a blow-up analysis. In addition to the crucial approximation procedure, we also make the domain dynamic during the blow-up analysis. Finally, we elaborate in which sense our results approximate the infinite-dimensional problem. Within our analysis, we find that the PDEs appearing in entry and exit blow-up charts are quasi-linear free boundary value problems, while in the central/scaling chart, we obtain a PDE, which is often encountered in classical reaction-diffusion problems exhibiting solutions with finite-time singularities.},

The main purpose is to show that the slow component of such a coupled system can be described by a stochastic evolution equation with averaged coefficients. Our first result provides a pathwise mild solution for the system of mixed stochastic evolution equations. Our main result deals with an averaging procedure which proves that the slow component converges almost surely to the solution of the corresponding averaged equation using the approach of time discretization.

  abstract     = {Abstract. A deterministic dynamical system that slowly passes through a generic fold-type (saddle-node) bifurcation can be reduced to one-dimensional dynamics close to the bifurcation because of the center manifold theorem. It is often tacitly assumed that the same is true in the presence of stochasticity or noise so that, for example, critical slowing down (CSD) indicators can be applied as if the system were one-dimensional. In this work, we show that this is only true when given suitable system observables; specifically, we demonstrate that noise in other dimensions may interfere with indicators of CSD, also referred to as early warning signals (EWS). We point out a generic mechanism by which both variance and lag-1 autocorrelation (AC(1)), as well as other EWS, can fail to signal an approaching bifurcation. This can, in principle, occur whenever one noise source drives multiple system components simultaneously. Even under the favorable assumptions of uncoupled deterministic dynamics and stationary noise, some system observables can then exhibit false negative or false positive CSD indications. We isolate this phenomenon in an example that represents a generic two-dimensional fold-type bifurcation setting.},

In addition, considering the effect of memory-based diffusion on the population dynamics of the predator-prey model with a Holling–Tanner-type functional response function, we improve the conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation and establish the conditions for the constant steady state to lose its stability through double-Hopf bifurcation. Further, by analyzing the normal form of the double-Hopf bifurcation, we prove that memory-based diffusion can lead to a bistable phenomenon, i.e., two stable spatially asynchronous periodic orbits with different wave numbers coexist in the model and can also lead to a spatially inhomogeneous quasi-periodic orbit, revealing that species of animals with spatial memory may survive in diverse patterns.},

In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework to rigorously validate and extend beyond these computational findings. Viewing our stochastic model of a chromatin modification circuit as a singularly perturbed, finite state, continuous time Markov chain, we extend beyond existing theory in order to characterize the leading coefficients in the series expansions of stationary distributions and mean first passage times. In particular, we characterize the limiting stationary distribution in terms of a reduced Markov chain, provide an algorithm to determine the orders of the poles of mean first passage times, and determine how changing erasure rates affects system behavior. The theoretical tools developed in this paper not only allow us to set a rigorous mathematical basis for the computational findings of our prior work, highlighting the effect of chromatin modification dynamics on epigenetic cell memory, but they can also be applied to other singularly perturbed Markov chains beyond the applications in this paper, especially those associated with chemical reaction networks.},

Taking the thermodynamics limit, the network’s dynamics can be accurately represented by a partial differential equation coupled with a nonlocal differential equation. The stationary state of the nonlocal system is determined, and a perturbation analysis is performed to analytically characterize the conditions for the occurrence of Turing instabilities. Considering neural network parameters, such as the synaptic coupling and the external drive, we numerically obtain the bifurcation line that separates the asynchronous regime from the emergence of patterns. Our theoretical findings provide a new and insightful perspective on the emergence of Turing patterns in spiking neural networks. In the long term, our formalism will enable the study of neural patterns while maintaining the connections between microscopic cellular properties, network coupling, and the emergence of Turing instabilities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We focus on learning unknown dynamics from data using ODE-nets templated on implicit numerical initial value problem solvers. First, we perform inverse modified error analysis of the ODE-nets using unrolled implicit schemes for ease of interpretation. It is shown that training an ODE-net using an unrolled implicit scheme returns a close approximation of an inverse modified differential equation (IMDE). In addition, we establish a theoretical basis for hyperparameter selection when training such ODE-nets, whereas current strategies usually treat numerical integration of ODE-nets as a black box. We thus formulate an adaptive algorithm which monitors the level of error and adapts the number of (unrolled) implicit solution iterations during the training process, so that the error of the unrolled approximation is less than the current learning loss. This helps accelerate training while maintaining accuracy. Several numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared to nonadaptive unrollings and validate the theoretical analysis. We also note that this approach naturally allows for incorporating partially known physical terms in the equations, giving rise to what is termed “gray box” identification.},

In this study, we analyze our mathematical model of whole-body regulation to investigate the sensitivity of different model outcomes to parameter values. We used the Morris method, a global sensitivity analysis method, to evaluate the impact of the parameters on both steady state results and simulations of a single meal. Our results show that the most influential parameters and processes depend on what is being measured. Specifically, variations in steady state results relied primarily on parameters that were involved in kidney function, while transient results relied on hormonal feedback mechanisms. This study shows that our mathematical model of whole-body potassium regulation captures known physiological function of potassium regulation despite a large number of uncertain parameters. Furthermore, this analysis will serve as a foundation for future model development and applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. InfoMap is a popular approach to detect densely connected “communities” of nodes in networks. To detect such communities, InfoMap uses random walks and ideas from information theory. Motivated by the dynamics of disease spread on networks, whose nodes can have heterogeneous disease-removal rates, we adapt InfoMap to absorbing random walks. To do this, we use absorption-scaled graphs (in which edge weights are scaled according to absorption rates) and Markov time sweeping. One of our adaptations of InfoMap converges to the standard version of InfoMap in the limit in which the node-absorption rates approach 0. We demonstrate that the community structure that one obtains using our adaptations of InfoMap can differ markedly from the community structure that one detects using methods that do not account for node-absorption rates. We also illustrate that the community structure that is induced by heterogeneous absorption rates can have important implications for susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) dynamics on ring-lattice networks. For example, in some situations, the outbreak duration is maximized when a moderate number of nodes have large node-absorption rates.},

We initially perform a Lie–Deprit normalization (truncation of the higher-order terms), and a singular reduction by the oscillator symmetry is done. Considering the averaging method for Hamiltonian systems, the existence and an approximation of two families of periodic solutions are proved together with their linear stability. A third family of periodic solutions is found by using the Lyapunov center theorem. In addition, the existence of KAM 3-tori is obtained by enclosing the stable periodic solutions. After that, since the Hamiltonian is axially symmetric, we carry out another reduction induced by this exact symmetry. Studying its Poisson vector field on the reduced space by the exact symmetry, we show the existence of two equilibrium points. We reconstruct these points as two families of periodic solutions of the complete Hamiltonian system together with their linear stability. Next, we make a second singular reduction using the axial symmetry. A geometrical study of the twice-reduced space is done to characterize the singularities. Precisely, we study the critical points (relative equilibria) on the twice-reduced space together with the stability, and parametric bifurcations are determined. The equilibria occurring in the twice-reduced space are reconstructed as 3-tori filled by quasi-periodic solutions of the full system. Our analysis permits us to determine the main representative parameters of the cubic and quartic terms to get our results. Important differences with the case of resonance 1:1:1 are detected.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cellular processes are open systems, situated in a heterogeneous context, rather than operating in isolation. Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) whose reaction rates are modelled as external stochastic processes account for the heterogeneous environment when describing the embedded process. A marginal description of the embedded process is of interest for (i) marginal simulations that bypass the co-simulation of the environment, (ii) obtaining new process equations from which moment equations can be derived, (iii) the computation of information-theoretic quantities, and (iv) state estimation. It is known since Snyder’s and related works that marginalization over a stochastic intensity turns point processes into self-exciting ones. While the Snyder filter specifies the exact history-dependent propensities in the framework of CRNs in a Markov environment, it was recently suggested to use approximate filters for the marginal description. By regarding the chemical reactions as events, we establish a link between CRNs in a linear random environment and Hawkes processes, a class of self-exciting counting processes widely used in event analysis. The Hawkes approximation can be obtained via a moment closure scheme or as the optimal linear approximation under the quadratic criterion. We show the equivalence of both approaches. Furthermore, we use martingale techniques to provide results on the agreement of the Hawkes process and the exact marginal process in their second-order statistics, i.e., covariance, auto/cross-correlation. We introduce an approximate marginal simulation algorithm and illustrate it in case studies.},

As a consequence, the nature of the forward attraction of a dissipative nonautonomous dynamical system was then revealed: the vector field in the distant future of the system determines the (nonuniform) forward asymptotic behavior. A criterion for certain semiuniform attractors to have finite fractal dimension was given and the finite dimensionality of uniform attractors was discussed. Forward attracting time-dependent sets were studied also. A sufficient condition and a necessary condition for a time-dependent set to be forward attracting were given with illustrative counterexamples.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Complex networked systems in fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences often involve interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise ones. Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the intricate behaviors of systems with multibody interactions. Herein, we investigate discrete-time dynamics with three-body interactions, described by an underlying 3-uniform hypergraph, where vertices update their states through a nonlinearly weighted average depending on their neighboring pairs’ states. These dynamics capture reinforcing group effects, such as peer pressure, and exhibit higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the dynamics converge to a multiplicatively shifted average of the initial states, with high probability. We further characterize the shift as a function of two parameters describing the initial state and interaction strength, as well as the convergence time as a function of the hypergraph structure.},

Our analysis yields an explicit upper bound on the time of extinction in terms of the initial condition and the flux function. Moreover, in the case of a smooth flux function, we characterize the generic bifurcations arising at a coalescence event with and without the presence of odd symmetry.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate the collective dynamics of a network of heterogeneous Izhikevich neurons with global constant-delay coupling using a mean-field approximation, valid in the thermodynamic limit. The introduction of a biologically motivated synaptic current expression and a spike frequency adaptation mechanism give rise to significantly different bifurcation structures. Our study emphasizes the impact of heterogeneity in the quenched current, adaptation intensity, and synaptic delay on the emergence of collective oscillations. The effects of heterogeneity and adaptation vary across different scenarios but essentially result from the balance of excitatory drives, including input currents that cause neurons to spike, adaptation currents that terminate spiking, and synaptic currents that predominantly favor spiking in excitatory networks but hinder it in inhibitory cases. Our perturbation and bifurcation analysis reveal interesting transitions in the behavior in both limits of extremely weak heterogeneity and coupling strength. Finally, our analysis indicates that synaptic delays exhibit little impact on the generation of collective oscillations in weakly coupled heterogeneous networks. This effect becomes more pronounced with increasing heterogeneity. Moreover, a larger delay does not necessarily enhance the likelihood of oscillations, especially in weakly adapting neural networks. Beyond that, delays primarily function as an excitatory drive, promoting the emergence of oscillations and even inducing new macroscopic dynamics. Specifically, torus bifurcations may occur in a single population of neurons without an external drive, serving as a crucial mechanism for the emergence of population bursting with two nested frequencies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Homeostasis is a regulatory mechanism that keeps a specific variable close to a set value as other variables fluctuate. The notion of homeostasis can be rigorously formulated when the model of interest is represented as an input-output network, with distinguished input and output nodes, and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. In this context, homeostasis can be defined as an “infinitesimal” notion, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. Combining this approach with graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory provides a systematic framework for calculating homeostasis points in models and classifying the different homeostasis types in input-output networks. In this paper we extend this theory by introducing the notion of a homeostasis pattern, defined as a set of nodes, in addition to the output node, that are simultaneously infinitesimally homeostatic. We prove that each homeostasis type leads to a distinct homeostasis pattern. Moreover, we describe all homeostasis patterns supported by a given input-output network in terms of a combinatorial structure associated to the input-output network. We call this structure the homeostasis pattern network.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The mirror descent algorithm is known to be effective in situations where it is beneficial to adapt the mirror map to the underlying geometry of the optimization model. However, the effect of mirror maps on the geometry of distributed optimization problems has not been previously addressed. In this paper we study an exact distributed mirror descent algorithm in continuous time under additive noise. We establish a linear convergence rate of the proposed dynamics for the setting of convex optimization. Our analysis draws motivation from the augmented Lagrangian and its relation to gradient tracking. To further explore the benefits of mirror maps in a distributed setting we present a preconditioned variant of our algorithm with an additional mirror map over the Lagrangian dual variables. This allows our method to adapt to both the geometry of the primal variables and the geometry of the consensus constraint. We also propose a Gauss–Seidel type discretization scheme for the proposed method and establish its linear convergence rate. For certain classes of problems we identify mirror maps that mitigate the effect of the graph’s spectral properties on the convergence rate of the algorithm. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of the methodology on convex models, both with and without constraints. Our findings show that the proposed method outperforms other methods, especially in scenarios where the model’s geometry is not captured by the standard Euclidean norm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An important problem in biological modeling is choosing the right model. Given experimental data, one is supposed to find the best mathematical representation to describe the real-world phenomena. However, there may not be a unique model representing that real-world phenomena. Two distinct models could yield the same exact dynamics. In this case, these models are called indistinguishable. In this work, we consider the indistinguishability problem for linear compartmental models, which are used in many areas, such as pharmacokinetics, physiology, cell biology, toxicology, and ecology. We exhibit sufficient conditions for indistinguishability for models with a certain graph structure: paths from input to output with “detours.” The benefit of applying our results is that indistinguishability can be proven using only the graph structure of the models, without the use of any symbolic computation. This can be very helpful for medium-to-large sized linear compartmental models. These are the first sufficient conditions for the indistinguishability of linear compartmental models based on graph structure alone, as previously only necessary conditions for indistinguishability of linear compartmental models existed based on graph structure alone. We prove our results by showing that the indistinguishable models are the same up to a renaming of parameters, which we call permutation indistinguishability.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates the intricate connection between visual perception and the mathematical modeling of neural activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The focus is on modeling the visual MacKay effect [D. M. MacKay, Nature, 180 (1957), pp. 849–850]. While bifurcation theory has been a prominent mathematical approach for addressing issues in neuroscience, especially in describing spontaneous pattern formations in V1 due to parameter changes, it faces challenges in scenarios with localized sensory inputs. This is evident, for instance, in MacKay’s psychophysical experiments, where the redundancy of visual stimuli information results in irregular shapes, making bifurcation theory and multiscale analysis less effective. To address this, we follow a mathematical viewpoint based on the input-output controllability of an Amari-type neural fields model. In this framework, we consider sensory input as a control function, a cortical representation via the retino-cortical map of the visual stimulus that captures its distinct features. This includes highly localized information in the center of MacKay’s funnel pattern “MacKay rays.” From a control theory point of view, the Amari-type equation’s exact controllability property is discussed for linear and nonlinear response functions. For the visual MacKay effect modeling, we adjust the parameter representing intra-neuron connectivity to ensure that cortical activity exponentially stabilizes to the stationary state in the absence of sensory input. Then, we perform quantitative and qualitative studies to demonstrate that they capture all the essential features of the induced after-image reported by MacKay.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Reaction-nonlinear diffusion partial differential equations (RND PDEs) have recently been developed as a powerful and flexible modeling tool in order to investigate the emergence of steep fronts in biological and ecological contexts. In this work, we demonstrate the utility and scope of regularization as a technique to investigate the existence and uniqueness of steep-fronted traveling wave solutions in RND PDE models with forward-backward-forward diffusion. In a recent work (see [Y. Li et al., Phys. D, 423 (2021), 132916]), geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) was introduced as a framework to analyze these regularized RND PDEs. Using the GSPT toolbox, different regularizations were shown to give rise to distinct families of monotone steep-fronted traveling waves which limit to their shock-fronted singular counterparts, obeying either the equal area or extremal area (i.e., algebraic decay) rules that are well known in the shockwave literature. In this work, we extend those earlier results by showing that composite regularizations can be used to construct families of monotone shock-fronted traveling waves sweeping out distinct generalized area rules, which smoothly interpolate between these two extremal rules for shock selection. Our analysis blends Melnikov methods—including a new variant of the method which can be applied to autonomous piecewise-smooth systems—with GSPT techniques applied to the traveling wave problem of the regularized RND model over distinct spatiotemporal scales. We further demonstrate using numerical continuation that our composite model supports more exotic shock-fronted solutions, namely, nonmonotone shock-fronted waves as well as shock-fronted waves containing slow tails in the aggregation (backward diffusion) regime. We complement these existence results with a numerical spectral stability analysis of some of these new “interpolated” steep-fronted waves. Using techniques from geometric spectral stability theory, our numerical results suggest that the monotone families remain spectrally stable in the “interpolation” regime, which extends recent stability results by some of the authors in [I. Lizarraga and R. Marangell, Phys. D, 460 (2024), 134069], [I. Lizarraga and R. Marangell, J. Nonlinear Sci., 33 (2023), 82]. The multiple-scale nature of the composite regularized RND PDE model continues to play an important role in the numerical analysis of the spatial eigenvalue problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A hybrid asymptotic-numerical approach is developed to study the existence and linear stability of steady-state hotspot patterns for a three-component one-dimensional reaction-diffusion (RD) system that models urban crime with police intervention. Our analysis is focused on a new scaling regime in the RD system where there are two distinct competing mechanisms of hotspot annihilation and creation that, when coincident in a parameter space, lead to complex spatio-temporal dynamics of hotspot patterns. Hotspot annihilation events are shown numerically to be triggered by an asynchronous oscillatory instability of the hotspot amplitudes that arises from a secondary instability on the branch of periodic solutions that emerges from a Hopf bifurcation of the steady-state solution. In addition, hotspots can be nucleated from a quiescent background when the criminal diffusivity is below a saddle-node bifurcation threshold of hotspot equilibria, which we estimate from our asymptotic analysis. To investigate instabilities of hotspot steady states, the spectrum of the linearization around a two-boundary hotspot pattern is computed, and instability thresholds due to either zero-eigenvalue crossings or Hopf bifurcations are shown. The bifurcation software pde2path is used to follow the branch of periodic solutions and detect the onset of the secondary instability. Overall, these results provide a phase diagram in parameter space where distinct types of dynamical behaviors occur. In one region of this phase diagram, where the police diffusivity is small, a two-boundary hotspot steady state is unstable to an asynchronous oscillatory instability in the hotspot amplitudes. This instability typically triggers a nonlinear process leading to the annihilation of one of the hotspots. However, for parameter values where this instability is coincident with the nonexistence of a one-hotspot steady state, we show that hotspot patterns undergo complex “nucleation-annihilation” dynamics that are characterized by large-scale persistent oscillations of the hotspot amplitudes. In this way, our results identify parameter ranges in the three-component crime model where the effect of police intervention is to simply displace crime between adjacent hotspots and where new crime hotspots regularly emerge “spontaneously” from regions that were previously free of crime. More generally, it is suggested that when these annihilation and nucleation mechanisms are coincident for other multihotspot patterns, the problem of predicting the spatial-temporal distribution of crime is largely intractable.},

In particular, we construct approximate inverses of differential operators via Fourier series approximations. Combining this construction with a Newton–Kantorovich approach, we develop a numerical method to prove existence of strong solutions. To do so, we introduce a finite-dimensional trace theorem from which we build smooth functions with support on a hypercube. The method is then generalized to systems of PDEs with extra equations/parameters, such as eigenvalue problems. As an application, we prove the existence of a traveling wave (soliton) in the Kawahara equation in as well as eigenpairs of the linearization about the soliton. These results allow us to prove the stability of the aforementioned traveling wave.},

State-of-the-art Langevin samplers such as the ensemble Kalman sampler (EKS) or the affine invariant Langevin dynamics (ALDI) rely on successive evaluations of the forward model or its gradient. A main drawback of these methods hence is their vast number of required forward calls as well as their possible lack of convergence in the case of more involved posterior measures such as multimodal distributions. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges to some extent. First, several possible adaptive ensemble enrichment strategies that successively enlarge the number of particles in the underlying Langevin dynamics are discussed that in turn lead to a significant reduction of the total number of forward calls. Second, analytical consistency guarantees of the ensemble enrichment method are provided for linear forward models. Third, to address more involved target distributions, the method is extended by applying adapted Langevin dynamics based on a homotopy formalism for which convergence is proved. Finally, numerical investigations of several benchmark problems illustrate the possible gain of the proposed method, comparing it to state-of-the-art Langevin samplers.},

After showing that the relevant systems can be viewed as singular perturbations of a limiting system with a discontinuity in time, we develop an analytical framework for their analysis based on geometric blow-up techniques. We then provide sufficient conditions for the occurrence of bifurcation and rate induced transitions in low dimensions, as well as sufficient conditions for “tracking” in arbitrary (finite) dimensions, i.e., the persistence of an attracting and normally hyperbolic manifold through the transitionary regime. The proofs rely on geometric blow-up, a variant of the Melnikov method which applies on noncompact domains, and general invariant manifold theory. The formalism is applicable in arbitrary (finite) dimensions, and for systems with forward and backward attractors characterized by nontrivial (i.e., nonconstant) dependence on time. The results are demonstrated for low dimensional applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Inertial focusing in curved microfluidic ducts exploits the interaction of the drag force from the Dean flow with the inertial lift force to separate particles or cells laterally across the cross-section width according to their size. Experimental work has identified that using a trapezoidal cross section, as opposed to a rectangular one, can enhance the sized based separation of particles/cells over a wide range of flow rates. Using our model, derived by carefully examining the way the Dean drag and inertial lift forces interact at low flow rates, we calculate the leading order approximation of these forces for a range of trapezoidal ducts, both vertically symmetric and nonsymmetric, with an increasing amount of skew towards the outside wall. We then conduct a systematic study to examine the bifurcations in the particle equilbira that occur with respect to a shape parameter characterizing the trapezoidal cross section. We reveal how the dynamics associated with particle migration are modified by the degree of skew in the cross-section shape, and show the existence of cusp bifurcations (with the bend radius as a second parameter). Additionally, our investigation suggests an optimal amount of skew for the trapezoidal cross section for the purposes of maximizing particle separation over a wide range of bend radii.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work provides a systematic recipe for computing accurate high order Fourier expansions of quasiperiodic invariant circles (and systems of such circles) in area preserving maps. The recipe requires only a finite data set sampled from the quasiperiodic circle. Our approach, being based on the parameterization method of [A. Haro and R. de la Llave, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 6 (2007), pp. 142–207; A. Haro and R. de la Llave, Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. Ser. B, 6 (2006), pp. 1261–1300; A. Haro and R. de la Llave, J. Differential Equations, 228 (2006), pp. 530–579], uses a Newton scheme to iteratively solve a conjugacy equation describing the invariant circle (or systems of circles). A critical step in properly formulating the conjugacy equation is to determine the rotation number of the quasiperiodic subsystem. For this we exploit the weighted Birkhoff averaging method of [S. Das et al., Nonlinearity, 30 (2017), pp. 4111–4140; S. Das et al., The Foundations of Chaos Revisited, Springer, Cham, 2016, pp. 103–118; S. Das and J. A. Yorke, Nonlinearity, 31 (2018), pp. 491–501]. This approach facilities accurate computation of the rotation number given nothing but the already mentioned orbit data. The weighted Birkhoff averages also facilitate the computation of other integral observables like Fourier coefficients of the parameterization of the invariant circle. Since, the parameterization method is based on a Newton scheme, we only need to approximate a small number of Fourier coefficients with low accuracy (say, a few correct digits) to find a good enough initial approximation so that Newton converges. Moreover, the Fourier coefficients may be computed independently, so we can sample the higher modes to guess the decay rate of the Fourier coefficients. This allows us to choose, a priori, an appropriate number of modes in the truncation. We illustrate the utility of the approach for explicit example systems including the area preserving Hénon map and the standard map (polynomial and trigonometric nonlinearity respectively). We present example computations for invariant circles and for systems of invariant circles with as many as 120 components. We also employ a numerical continuation scheme (where the rotation number is the continuation parameter) to compute large numbers of quasiperiodic circles in these systems. During the continuation we monitor the Sobolev norm of the parameterization, as explained in [R. Calleja and R. de la Llave, Nonlinearity, 23 (2010), pp. 2029–2058], to automatically detect the breakdown of the family.},

In the settings of these models, every oscillator directly interacts with each other in the same group. In each group, only one oscillator directly interacts with one oscillator in another group. We prove that if the coupling strength is large and the initial configuration of each group is confined to a sector with the arc length less than , then all oscillators achieve a complete frequency synchronization asymptotically. We emphasize that there is no need to impose any initial condition on the connection between different groups. If, in addition, the natural frequencies in one group are the same, then partial phase synchronization occurs. Moreover, if all natural frequencies are identical, we prove that all oscillators either achieve a complete phase synchronization asymptotically or tend to a bipolar phase-locking state.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nearly all emerging diseases in humans are a result of host-range expansion, in which a pathogen of one species evolves the ability to infect a new host species. To present a rigorous analysis of pathogen host-range expansion, we derive a Lotka–Volterra dynamical system with two competing host species and a single parasite species; the parasite infects only one of the host species. We provide a stability and bifurcation analysis of this model. We then ask what happens if the parasite evolves the ability to infect the alternate host, extending the model to include a parasite population with an expanded host range. We derive explicit global stability and bifurcation conditions for this four-dimensional model in terms of the system parameters. We demonstrate that only four outcomes may occur following the range expansion of a parasite or pathogen, and provide both local and global asymptotic stability conditions for these outcomes. While three of these outcomes were expected, the fourth is counterintuitive, predicting that host-range expansion can drive the original host species to extinction. For example, a native species could be driven to extinction by a longstanding native parasite if that parasite acquires the ability to infect a cultivated species. We briefly discuss the phenomena driving this unexpected prediction and its implications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Phase reduction is a well-established method to study weakly driven and weakly perturbed oscillators. Traditional phase-reduction approaches characterize the perturbed system dynamics solely in terms of the timing of the oscillations. In the case of large perturbations, the introduction of amplitude (isostable) coordinates improves the accuracy of the phase description by providing a sense of distance from the underlying limit cycle. Importantly, phase-amplitude coordinates allow for the study of both the timing and shape of system oscillations. A parallel tool is the infinitesimal shape response curve (iSRC), a variational method that characterizes the shape change of a limit-cycle oscillator under sustained perturbation. Despite the importance of oscillation amplitude in a wide range of physical systems, systematic studies on the shape change of oscillations remain scarce. Both phase-amplitude coordinates and the iSRC represent methods to analyze oscillation shape change, yet a relationship between the two has not been previously explored. In this work, we establish the iSRC and phase-amplitude coordinates as complementary tools to study oscillation amplitude. We extend existing iSRC theory and specify conditions under which a general class of systems can be analyzed by the joint iSRC phase-amplitude approach. We show that the iSRC takes on a dramatically simple form in phase-amplitude coordinates, and directly relate the phase and isostable response curves to the iSRC. We apply our theory to weakly perturbed single oscillators, and to study the synchronization and entrainment of coupled oscillators.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The bifurcation from a simple eigenvalue (BSE) theorem is the foundation of steady-state bifurcation theory for one-parameter families of functions. When eigenvalues of multiplicity greater than one are caused by symmetry, the equivariant branching lemma (EBL) can often be applied to predict the branching of solutions. The EBL can be interpreted as the application of the BSE theorem to a fixed point subspace. There are functions which have invariant linear subspaces that are not caused by symmetry. For example, networks of identical coupled cells often have such invariant subspaces. We present a generalization of the EBL, where the BSE theorem is applied to nested invariant subspaces. We call this the bifurcation lemma for invariant subspaces (BLIS). We give several examples of bifurcations and determine if BSE, EBL, or BLIS applies. We extend our previous automated bifurcation analysis algorithms to use the BLIS to simplify and improve the detection of branches created at bifurcations.},

For star-shaped networks where all nodes only connect to a center, we obtain the same epidemic threshold formulas as previously found for fully connected networks, considering all nodes with the same infection rate except one. We thus create a new terminology by saying that fully connected and star-shaped networks have the Standard Threshold Property. Next, we analyze cycle-shaped networks, which yield epidemic thresholds different from those obtained using star-shaped networks. We then analyze more general classes of networks by combining the star, cycle, and other structures, obtaining classes of networks with the Standard Threshold Property. We present some conjectures on even more flexible networks and complete our analysis by presenting simulations to explore the epidemic dynamics for the different structures.},

We study synchronization for linearly coupled temporal networks of heterogeneous time-dependent nonlinear agents via the convergence of attracting trajectories of each node. The results are obtained by constructing and studying the stability of a suitable linear nonautonomous problem bounding the evolution of the synchronization errors. Both the case of the entire network and that of only a cluster are addressed, and the persistence of the obtained synchronization against perturbation is also discussed. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the existence of attracting trajectories of each node is given. In all cases, the considered dependence on time requires only local integrability, which is a very mild regularity assumption. Moreover, our results mainly depend on the network structure and its properties and achieve synchronization up to a constant in finite time. Hence they are quite suitable for applications. The applicability of the results is showcased via several examples: coupled van der Pol/FitzHugh–Nagumo oscillators, weighted/signed opinion dynamics, and coupled Lorenz systems.},

The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm can be applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to estimate the drift and the diffusion function using data from a realization of the SDE. The SINDy algorithm requires sample data from each of these functions, which is typically estimated numerically from the data of the state. We analyze the performance of the previously proposed estimates for the drift and the diffusion function to give bounds on the error for finite data. However, since this algorithm only converges as both the sampling frequency and the length of trajectory go to infinity, obtaining approximations within a certain tolerance may be infeasible. To combat this, we develop estimates with higher orders of accuracy for use in the SINDy framework. For a given sampling frequency, these estimates give more accurate approximations of the drift and diffusion functions, making SINDy a far more feasible system identification method.},

These coupling functions enable the study of oscillator networks in terms of phase-locked states, whose stability can be determined using straightforward linear stability arguments. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with two examples. First, we use a diffusely coupled complex Ginzburg–Landau (CGL) model with and show that the loss of stability in its splay state occurs through a Hopf bifurcation viewing the nonweak diffusive coupling as the bifurcation parameter. Our reduction also captures asymptotic limit-cycle dynamics in the phase differences. Second, we use realistic conductance-based thalamic neuron models and show that our method correctly predicts a loss in stability of a splay state for nonweak synaptic coupling. In both examples, our theory accurately captures model behaviors that weak and recent nonweak coupling theories cannot.},

A notable result is a closed-form relationship between graph topology and the stability of polarized states in a simple special case that models echo chambers in social networks.

We find that is an important quantity, with the special case separating circularization where the eccentricity converges to zero, i.e., as , from cases where as , both on open sets of initial conditions. We find that circularization for occurs due to asymptotic stability of a zero-Hopf equilibrium point (i.e., the eigenvalues are ) of a three-dimensional reduced problem (which is analytic in the blowup coordinates). The attraction is therefore not hyperbolic and in particular not covered by standard dynamical systems theory. Instead we use recent results on normal forms of the zero-Hopf to locally bring the system into a form where the stability can be addressed directly. The case relates to a certain scaling symmetry (that is also present in the undamped Kepler problem) and in this case the system can be reduced to a planar system. We find that the eccentricity limits to on an open subset of initial conditions for ( and ). We also describe different properties of the solutions, including finite time blowup and the limit of the eccentricity vector. Interestingly, we find that circularization implies finite time blowup of solutions. We believe that our approach can be used to describe unbounded solutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the endemic behavior of a multi-competitive networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Specifically, the paper deals with three competing virus systems (i.e., tri-virus systems) spreading over a population. First, we show that a tri-virus system, unlike a bi-virus system, is not a monotone dynamical system. Using the Parametric Transversality Theorem, we show that, generically, a tri-virus system has a finite number of equilibria and that the Jacobian matrices associated with each equilibrium are nonsingular. The endemic equilibria of this system can be classified as follows: (a) single-virus endemic equilibria (also referred to as the boundary equilibria), where precisely one of the three viruses is present in the population; (b) 2-coexistence equilibria, where exactly two of the three viruses are present in the population; and (c) 3-coexistence equilibria, where all three viruses present in the population. By leveraging the notions of basic reproduction number (i.e., the number of infections caused by an infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and invasion reproduction number (i.e., the average number of infections caused by an individual in a setting where other endemic virus(es) are at equilibrium), we provide a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees local exponential convergence to a boundary equilibrium. Further, we secure conditions for the nonexistence of 3-coexistence equilibria (resp., for various kinds of 2-coexistence equilibria). We also identify sufficient conditions for the existence of a 2-coexistence (resp., 3-coexistence) equilibrium. We identify conditions on the model parameters that give rise to a continuum of coexistence equilibria. More specifically, we establish (i) a scenario that admits the existence and local exponential attractivity of a line of coexistence equilibria; and (ii) scenarios that admit the existence of, and, in the case of one such scenario, global convergence to, a plane of 3-coexistence equilibria.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In a recent article by Guglielmi and Hairer [SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 14 (2015), pp. 1454–1477], an analysis in the limit was proposed of regularized discontinuous ODEs in codimension-2 switching domains; this was obtained by studying a certain 2-dimensional system describing the so-called hidden dynamics. In particular, the existence of a unique limit solution was not proved in all cases, a few of which were labeled as ambiguous, and it was not clear whether or not the ambiguity could be resolved. In this paper, we show that it cannot be resolved in general. A first contribution of this paper is an illustration of the dependence of the limit solution on the form of the switching function. Considering the parameter dependence in the ambiguous class of discontinuous systems, a second contribution is a bifurcation analysis, revealing a range of possible behaviors. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of solutions in the transition from codimension-2 domains to codimension-3 when there is a limit cycle in the hidden dynamics.},

Second, we employ the energy method, probing the nonlinear stability and establishing the nonlinear thresholds of the Marangoni number. Third, we apply the technique of center manifold reduction to reduce the corresponding infinite-dimensional model to finite-dimensional ODEs. According to the ODEs, we establish a dynamic bifurcation theorem with the transition number that determines the bifurcation type of the model.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Extensive modeling studies on viral infection have significantly improved immunological insights into the dynamics of host responses to infectious agents and helped to design new avenues for experimentation. Various dynamical behaviors have been found in existing models, in particular, the global stability of the boundary equilibrium or the positive equilibrium, as well as different types of bifurcations. However, limited studies have been performed on the connection of invariant sets when global stability results no longer hold. This motivates the current study through considering the dynamics of a viral infection model, with new features that nonmonotonic functional responses are contained in the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) growth rate and incidence rate. The well-posedness of the four-dimensional differential equation model is established, and the model is further reduced into a three-dimensional nonmonotone system. The reduced system is demonstrated to admit three types of equilibria that represent different states of viral infection. The local stability and global stability of these equilibria are established under some suitable conditions. The coexistence of two positive equilibria poses challenges to model analysis, which is addressed through an algebraic-topological invariant, the Conley index. The index provides a topological description of the local dynamics around each equilibrium. With the aid of connection matrices, nontrivial invariant sets are detected, and the existence of connecting orbits between these invariant sets are determined. Further numerical simulations are conducted to supplement and verify the analytical results. It is shown that the model exhibits the rich dynamical phenomenon including bistability and periodic solutions due to diverse nonmonotonicities. Global dynamics from local stability analysis in the current study extensively extend and improve some existing studies on virus dynamics models.},

Similar to the CS system free of inherent dynamics, our results exhibit threshold phenomena depending on the quantity of collectivity in of the rooted digraph. For the case with switching topologies being rooted in a sequence of time-blocks, we present similar sufficient frameworks leading to convergence of flocking in terms of initial state and system parameters.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In recent years, classical epidemic models, which assume stationary behavior of individuals, have been extended to include an adaptive heterogeneous response of the population to the current state of the epidemic. However, it is widely accepted that human behavior can exhibit history-dependence as a consequence of learned experiences. This history-dependence is similar to the hysteresis effects that have been well studied in control theory. To illustrate the importance of history-dependence for epidemic theory, we study the dynamics of a variant of the SIRS model where individuals exhibit lazy-switch responses to prevalence dynamics. The resulting model, which includes the Preisach hysteresis operator, possesses a continuum of endemic equilibrium states characterized by different proportions of susceptible, infected, and recovered populations. We discuss stability properties of the endemic equilibrium set and relate them to the degree of heterogeneity of the adaptive response. In particular, our results suggest that heterogeneity promotes the convergence of the epidemic trajectory to an equilibrium state. Heterogeneity can be achieved by selective intervention policies targeting specific population groups. On the other hand, heterogeneous responses can lead to a higher peak of infection during the epidemic and a higher prevalence at the endemic equilibrium after the epidemic. These results support the argument that public health responses during the emergence of a new disease have long-term consequences for subsequent management efforts. The main mathematical contribution of this work is a new method of global stability analysis, which uses a family of Lyapunov functions corresponding to different branches of the hysteresis operator. It is well known that instability can result from switching from one flow to another even though each flow is stable (if the flows have different Lyapunov functions). We provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of trajectories to the equilibrium set for switched systems with the Preisach hysteresis operator.},

Utilizing the antioxidant parameter as a bifurcation parameter, we establish that the system exhibits saddle-node bifurcation backward and forward bifurcations. Specifically, when , the virus will rebound if the antioxidant parameter falls below the post-treatment control threshold. Conversely, when the antioxidant parameter exceeds the elite control threshold, the virus remains under elite control. The region between the two thresholds represents a bistable interval.

We demonstrate that, in the context of a fast harmonic oscillator forced by one component of the Lorenz 1963 model, this principle can be used to construct time-discrete surrogate models by numerically extracting approximate locations and residues of complex poles via adaptive Antoulas–Anderson (AAA) rational interpolation and feeding this information into the known “connection formula” to compute the resulting fast amplitude. Despite small but nonnegligible local errors, the surrogate model maintains excellent accuracy over very long times. In addition, we observe that the long-time behavior of fast energy offers a continuous-time analogue of Gottwald and Melbourne’s 2004 “0–1 test for chaos”; that is, the asymptotic growth rate of the energy in the oscillator can discern whether or not the forcing function is chaotic.},

In light of the recently emerged interest in their use as tools in model reduction, we propose an extension of the relevant theory to the realm of fluid dynamics. We show the existence of a large (and the most pertinent) subclass of spectral submanifolds and foliations—describing the behavior of nearby trajectories—about fixed points and periodic orbits of the Navier–Stokes equations. Their uniqueness and smoothness properties are discussed in detail, due to their significance from the perspective of model reduction. The machinery is then put to work via a numerical algorithm developed along the lines of the parameterization method, which computes the desired manifolds as power series expansions.

We start with an overview of a variety of nonlinear system identification techniques, namely SINDy, weak-SINDy, and the occupation kernel method. Under the assumption that the dynamics are a finite linear combination of a set of basis functions, these methods establish a linear system to recover coefficients. We illuminate the structural similarities between these techniques and establish a projection property for the weak-SINDy technique. Following the overview, we analyze the error of surrogate models generated by a simplified version of weak-SINDy. In particular, under the assumption of boundedness of a composition operator given by the solution, we show that (i) the surrogate dynamics converges towards the true dynamics and (ii) the solution of the surrogate model is reasonably close to the true solution. Finally, as an application, we discuss the use of a combination of weak-SINDy surrogate modeling and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to build a surrogate model for partial differential equations (PDEs).},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quadratization of polynomial and nonpolynomial systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is advantageous in a variety of disciplines, such as systems theory, fluid mechanics, chemical reaction modeling, and mathematical analysis. A quadratization reveals new variables and structures of a model, which may be easier to analyze, simulate, and control, and provides a convenient parametrization for learning. This paper presents novel theory, algorithms, and software capabilities for quadratization of nonautonomous ODEs. We provide existence results, depending on the regularity of the input function, for cases when a quadratic-bilinear system can be obtained through quadratization. We further develop existence results and an algorithm that generalizes the process of quadratization for systems with arbitrary dimension that retain the nonlinear structure when the dimension grows. For such systems, we provide dimension-agnostic quadratization. An example is semidiscretized PDEs, where the nonlinear terms remain symbolically identical when the discretization size increases. As an important aspect for practical adoption of this research, we extended the capabilities of the QBee software towards both nonautonomous systems of ODEs and ODEs with arbitrary dimension. We present several examples of ODEs that were previously reported in the literature, and where our new algorithms find quadratized ODE systems with lower dimension than the previously reported lifting transformations. We further highlight an important area of quadratization: reduced-order model learning. This area can benefit significantly from working in the optimal lifting variables, where quadratic models provide a direct parametrization of the model that also avoids additional hyperreduction for the nonlinear terms. A solar wind example highlights these advantages.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work is devoted to investigating the noise-induced rare transition of periodically driven systems. The maximum likelihood paths (MLPs) are often sought, in order to reveal the transition mechanism. We show that MLPs between metastable periodic states could persist to a small nonautonomous forcing under appropriate conditions. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form explicit expression for approximating the transition rate change. They are obtained based on standard perturbation techniques for the Euler–Lagrange equation, the Melnikov theory, as well as a linear-theory calculation. Our methods indicate a route for a detailed understanding for the interaction between periodic forcing and noise in rather general systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Nonlinear ODEs can rarely be solved analytically. Koopman operator theory provides a way to solve two-dimensional nonlinear systems, under suitable restrictions, by mapping nonlinear dynamics to a linear space using Koopman eigenfunctions. Unfortunately, finding such eigenfunctions is difficult. We introduce a method for constructing Koopman eigenfunctions from a two-dimensional nonlinear ODE’s one-dimensional invariant manifolds. This method, when successful, allows us to find analytical solutions for autonomous, nonlinear systems. Previous data-driven methods have used Koopman theory to construct local Koopman eigenfunction approximations valid in different regions of phase space; our method finds analytic Koopman eigenfunctions that are exact and globally valid. We demonstrate our Koopman method of solving nonlinear systems on one-dimensional and two-dimensional ODEs. The nonlinear examples considered have simple expressions for their codimension-1 invariant manifolds which produce tractable analytical solutions. Thus our method allows for the construction of analytical solutions for previously unsolved ODEs. It also highlights the connection between invariant manifolds and eigenfunctions in nonlinear ODEs and presents avenues for extending this method to solve more nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Data-driven models for nonlinear dynamical systems based on approximating the underlying Koopman operator or generator have proven to be successful tools for forecasting, feature learning, state estimation, and control. It has become well known that the Koopman generators for control-affine systems also have affine dependence on the input, leading to convenient finite-dimensional bilinear approximations of the dynamics. Yet there are still two main obstacles that limit the scope of current approaches for approximating the Koopman generators of systems with actuation. First, the performance of existing methods depends heavily on the choice of basis functions over which the Koopman generator is to be approximated; and there is currently no universal way to choose them for systems that are not measure preserving. Second, if we do not observe the full state, then it becomes necessary to account for the dependence of the output time series on the sequence of supplied inputs when constructing observables to approximate Koopman operators. To address these issues, we write the dynamics of observables governed by the Koopman generator as a bilinear hidden Markov model and determine the model parameters using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The E step involves a standard Kalman filter and smoother, while the M step resembles control-affine dynamic mode decomposition for the generator. We demonstrate the performance of this method on three examples, including recovery of a finite-dimensional Koopman-invariant subspace for an actuated system with a slow manifold; estimation of Koopman eigenfunctions for the unforced Duffing equation; and model-predictive control of a fluidic pinball system based only on noisy observations of lift and drag.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Threshold-linear networks consist of simple units interacting in the presence of a threshold nonlinearity. Competitive threshold-linear networks have long been known to exhibit multistability, where the activity of the network settles into one of potentially many steady states. In this work, we find conditions that guarantee the absence of steady states, while maintaining bounded activity. These conditions lead us to define a combinatorial family of competitive threshold-linear networks, parametrized by a simple directed graph. By exploring this family, we discover that threshold-linear networks are capable of displaying a surprisingly rich variety of nonlinear dynamics, including limit cycles, quasi-periodic attractors, and chaos. In particular, several types of nonlinear behaviors can co-exist in the same network. Our mathematical results also enable us to engineer networks with multiple dynamic patterns. Taken together, these theoretical and computational findings suggest that threshold-linear networks may be a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between network connectivity and emergent dynamics.},

For polynomial ODE models, we introduce and discuss the concepts of exact and approximate conservation laws, which are the first integrals of the full and truncated sets of ODEs. For fast-slow systems, truncated ODEs describe the fast dynamics. We define compatibility classes as subsets of the state space, obtained by equating the conservation laws to constants. A set of conservation laws is complete when the corresponding compatibility classes contain a finite number of steady states. Complete sets of conservation laws can be used for model order reduction and for studying the multistationarity of the model. We provide algorithmic methods for computing linear, monomial, and polynomial conservation laws of polynomial ODE models and for testing their completeness. The resulting conservation laws and their completeness are either independent or dependent on the parameters. In the latter case, we provide parametric case distinctions. In particular, we propose a new method to compute polynomial conservation laws by comprehensive Gröbner systems and syzygies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Moment systems arise in a wide range of contexts and applications, e.g., in network modeling of complex systems. Since moment systems consist of a high or even infinite number of coupled equations, an indispensable step in obtaining a low-dimensional representation that is amenable to further analysis is, in many cases, to select a moment closure. A moment closure consists of a set of approximations that express certain higher-order moments in terms of lower-order ones, so that applying those leads to a closed system of equations for only the lower-order moments. Closures are frequently found drawing on intuition and heuristics to come up with quantitatively good approximations. In contrast to that, we propose an alternative approach where we instead focus on closures giving rise to certain qualitative features, such as bifurcations. Importantly, this fundamental change of perspective provides one with the possibility of classifying moment closures rigorously in regard to these features. This makes the design and selection of closures more algorithmic, precise, and reliable. In this work, we carefully study the moment systems that arise in the mean-field descriptions of two widely known network dynamical systems, the SIS epidemic and the adaptive voter model. We derive conditions that any moment closure has to satisfy so that the corresponding closed systems exhibit the transcritical bifurcation that one expects in these systems coming from the stochastic particle model.},

The Kuramoto model is a classical mathematical model in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems that describes the evolution of coupled oscillators in a network that may reach a synchronous state. The relationship between the network’s topology and whether the oscillators synchronize is a central question in the field of synchronization, and random graphs are often employed as a proxy for complex networks. On the other hand, the random graphs on which the Kuramoto model is rigorously analyzed in the literature are homogeneous models and fail to capture the underlying geometric structure that appears in several examples. In this work, we leverage tools from random matrix theory, random graphs, and mathematical statistics to prove that the Kuramoto model on a random geometric graph on the sphere synchronizes with probability tending to one as the number of nodes tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous result for the Kuramoto model on random geometric graphs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the soliton dynamics for the Rabi-coupled Gross–Pitaevskii model in multicomponent Bose–Einstein condensates. The model has variable nonlinearities and external potentials and is used to construct a complex multisoliton in an explicit form. The variable nonlinearity and external potential cause the soliton to compress and change its velocity, respectively. A new generalized similarity transformation is proposed to eliminate the Rabi-coupled terms in the -component model, which can make the Hirota bilinear method be applied to obtain multisoliton solutions. The bound state of the two-soliton forms the soliton molecule under velocity resonance. Asymptotic analysis can give the asymptotic expressions of each single soliton in multisoliton solutions, which can clearly give each soliton’s width, velocity, amplitude, and energy; these parameters can control multisolitons. When the solitons’ relative velocity or the solitons’ width is large, the interferogram between solitons will be observed. Numerical simulation shows that these solitons can steadily propagate. It is easy for the soliton molecule and interference dynamics to occur because of the controlled soliton. Since the coupled Gross–Pitaevskii equation describes the mechanics of matter waves in Bose–Einstein condensates, it is proved that we can observe the stable solitons and soliton molecules in Bose–Einstein condensates. The method and results presented in this paper are also common to other similar models. When observing particle multiple distributions, quantum interferometry, and interferometers, the results presented and the model in this paper can provide a reference for these applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A class of four-component reaction-diffusion systems are studied in one spatial dimension, with one of four specific reaction kinetics. Models of this type seek to capture the interaction between active and inactive forms of two G-proteins, known as ROPs in plants, thought to underly cellular polarity formation. The systems conserve total concentration of each ROP, which enables reduction to simple canonical forms when one seeks conditions for homogeneous equilibria or heteroclinic connections between them. Transitions between different multiplicities of such states are classified using a novel application of catastrophe theory. For the time-dependent problem, the heteroclinic connections represent so-called wave-pinned states that separate regions of the domain with different ROP concentrations. It is shown numerically how the form of wave-pinning reached can be predicted as a function of the domain size and initial total ROP concentrations. This leads to state diagrams of different polarity forms as a function of total concentrations and system parameters.},

Our variables allow for a well-suited formulation in action-angle type coordinates associated with the averaged angles, which provide geometric insight into the problem. After introducing extra fictitious variables and through a symplectic transformation, we move to a singularity-free quaternionic triple-chart. This choice allows for a global chart to avoid the classical singularities associated with angles and renders all the invariants as homogeneous quadratic polynomials. Additionally, it permits one to quickly write the Hamiltonian of the system in terms of the invariants and the Poisson structure at each stage of the reduction process. In contrast with existing literature, the geometrical approach of this research completely describes all the dynamical aspects of the full reduced space since it involves the relative position of the rotational and orbital angular momenta and their orientation, which has yet to be considered in previous studies. Our program includes a preliminary parametric analysis of relative equilibria and a complete description of the fibers in the reconstruction of the reduced system.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We previously showed that three-dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms have anti-integrable (AI) limits that correspond to a quadratic correspondence, a pair of one-dimensional maps. At the AI limit the dynamics is conjugate to a full shift on two symbols. Here we consider a more general AI limit, allowing two parameters of the map to go to infinity. We prove the existence of AI states for each symbol sequence for three cases of the quadratic correspondence: parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. A contraction argument gives parameter domains such that this is a bijection, but the correspondence also is observed to apply more generally. We show that orbits of the original map can be obtained by numerical continuation for a volume-contracting case. These results show that periodic AI states evolve into the observed periodic attractors of the diffeomorphism. We also continue a periodic AI state with a symbol sequence chosen so that it continues to an orbit resembling a chaotic attractor that is a 3D version of the classical 2D Hénon attractor.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Due to cost concerns, it is optimal to gain insight into the connectivity of biological and other networks using as few experiments as possible. Data selection for unique network connectivity identification has been an open problem since the introduction of algebraic methods for reverse engineering for almost two decades. In this manuscript we determine what data sets uniquely identify the unsigned wiring diagram corresponding to a system that is discrete in time and space. Furthermore, we answer the question of uniqueness for signed wiring diagrams for Boolean networks. Computationally, unsigned and signed wiring diagrams have been studied separately, and in this manuscript we also show that there exists an ideal capable of encoding both unsigned and signed information. This provides a unified approach to studying reverse engineering that also gives significant computational benefits.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Traditional sensitivity analysis methods fail for chaotic systems due to the unstable characteristics of the linearized equations. To overcome these issues two methods have been developed in the literature, one being the shadowing approach, which results in a minimization problem, and the other being numerical viscosity, where a damping term is added to the linearized equations to suppress the instability. The shadowing approach is computationally expensive but produces accurate sensitivities, while numerical viscosity can produce less accurate sensitivities but with significantly reduced computational cost. However, it is not fully clear how the solutions generated by these two approaches compare to each other. In this work we aim to bridge this gap by introducing a control term, found with optimal control theory techniques, to prevent the exponential growth of solution of the linearized equations. We will refer to this method as optimal control shadowing. We investigate the computational aspects and performance of this new method on the Lorenz and Kuramoto–Sivashinsky systems and compare its performance with simple numerical viscosity schemes. We show that the tangent solution generated by the proposed approach is similar to that generated by shadowing methods, suggesting that optimal control attempts to stabilize the unstable shadowing direction. Further, for the spatially extended system, we examine the energy budget of the tangent equation and show that the control term found via the solution of the optimal control problem acts only at length scales where production of tangent energy dominates dissipation, which is not necessarily the case for the numerical viscosity methods.},

By considering a continuous family of forced periodic orbits defined in relation to a stable fixed point and subsequently leveraging phase-amplitude-based reduction strategies, we arrive at a low order model capable of accurately capturing nonlinear oscillations resulting from arbitrary external inputs. In the limit that oscillations are small, the system dynamics relax to those obtained from local linearization, i.e., that can be fully described using linear eigenmodes. For larger amplitude oscillations, the behavior can be understood in terms of the dynamics of a small number of nonlinear modes. We illustrate the proposed strategy in a variety of examples yielding results that are substantially better than those obtained using standard linearization-based techniques.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Physics-based and first-principles models pervade the engineering and physical sciences, allowing for the ability to model the dynamics of complex systems with a prescribed accuracy. The approximations used in deriving governing equations often result in discrepancies between the model and sensor-based measurements of the system, revealing the approximate nature of the equations and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor itself. In modern dynamical systems, such discrepancies between model and measurement can lead to poor quantification, often undermining the ability to produce accurate and precise control algorithms. We introduce a discrepancy modeling framework to identify the missing physics and resolve the model-measurement mismatch with two distinct approaches: (i) by learning a model for the evolution of systematic state-space residual, and (ii) by discovering a model for the deterministic dynamical error. Regardless of approach, a common suite of data-driven model discovery methods can be used. Specifically, we use four fundamentally different methods to demonstrate the mathematical implementations of discrepancy modeling: (i) the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, (ii) dynamic mode decomposition, (iii) Gaussian process regression, and (iv) neural networks. The choice of method depends on one’s intent (e.g., mechanistic interpretability) for discrepancy modeling, sensor measurement characteristics (e.g., quantity, quality, resolution), and constraints imposed by practical applications (e.g., state- or dynamical-space operability). We demonstrate the utility and suitability for discrepancy modeling using the suite of data-driven modeling methods on four dynamical systems under varying signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, we emphasize structural shortcomings of each discrepancy modeling approach depending on error type. In summary, if the true dynamics are unknown (i.e., an imperfect model), one should learn a discrepancy model of the missing physics in the dynamical space. Yet, if the true dynamics are known yet model-measurement mismatch still exists, one should learn a discrepancy model in the state space.},

Moreover, a correct transform between approximations to solutions in the normal form and approximations to solutions on the parameter-dependent center manifold is derived rigorously. A detailed comparison is done between applying different normal forms (smooth and orbital), different phase conditions, and different perturbation methods (regular and Lindstedt–Poincaré) to approximate the homoclinic solution near Bogdanov–Takens points.

More precisely, the sparse data is used to construct a statistical surrogate model based on a Gaussian process (GP). The dynamics of the surrogate model is interrogated using combinatorial methods and characterized using algebraic topological invariants (Conley index). The GP predictive distribution provides a lower bound on the confidence that these topological invariants, and hence the characterized dynamics, apply to the unknown dynamical system (assumed to be a sample path of the GP). The focus of this paper is on explaining the ideas, thus we restrict our examples to one-dimensional systems and show how to capture the existence of fixed points, periodic orbits, connecting orbits, bistability, and chaotic dynamics.},

First of all, we consider the convergence relation of invariant measures between the stochastic neural field lattice model and the corresponding deterministic model in weighted spaces, and prove any limit of a sequence of invariant measures of such a lattice model must be an invariant measure of its limiting system as the noise intensity tends to zero. Then we are devoted to studying the numerical approximation of invariant measures of such a stochastic neural lattice model. To this end, we first consider convergence of invariant measures between such a neural lattice model and the system with neurons only interacting with its n-neighborhood; then we further prove the convergence relation of invariant measures between the system with an n-neighborhood and its finite dimensional truncated system. By this procedure, the invariant measure of the stochastic neural lattice models can be approximated by the numerical invariant measure of a finite dimensional truncated system based on the backward Euler–Maruyama (BEM) scheme. Therefore, the invariant measure of a deterministic neural field lattice model can be observed by the invariant measure of the BEM scheme when the noise is not negligible.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Generalized mass-action systems are power-law dynamical systems arising from chemical reaction networks. Essentially, every nonnegative ODE model used in chemistry and biology (for example, in ecology and epidemiology) and even in economics and engineering can be written in this form. Previous results have focused on existence and uniqueness of special steady states (complex-balanced equilibria) for all rate constants, thereby ruling out multiple (special) steady states. Recently, necessary conditions for linear stability have been obtained. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions for the linear stability of complex-balanced equilibria for all rate constants (and also for the nonexistence of other steady states). In particular, via sign vector conditions (on the stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic orders), we guarantee that the Jacobian matrix is a -matrix. Technically, we use a new decomposition of the graph Laplacian which allows us to consider orders of (generalized) monomials. Alternatively, we use cycle decomposition which allows a linear parametrization of all Jacobian matrices. In any case, we guarantee stability without explicit computation of steady states. We illustrate our results in examples from chemistry and biology: generalized Lotka–Volterra systems and SIR models, a two-component signaling system, and an enzymatic futile cycle.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Model reduction of fast-slow chemical reaction networks based on the quasi-steady state approximation fails when the fast subsystem has first integrals. We call these first integrals approximate conservation laws. In order to define fast subsystems and identify approximate conservation laws, we use ideas from tropical geometry. We prove that any approximate conservation law evolves more slowly than all the species involved in it and therefore represents a supplementary slow variable in an extended system. By elimination of some variables of the extended system, we obtain networks without approximate conservation laws, which can be reduced by standard singular perturbation methods. The field of applications of approximate conservation laws covers the quasi-equilibrium approximation, which is well known in biochemistry. We discuss reductions of slow-fast as well as multiple timescale systems. Networks with multiple timescales have hierarchical relaxation. At a given timescale, our multiple timescale reduction method defines three subsystems composed of (i) slaved fast variables satisfying algebraic equations, (ii) slow driving variables satisfying reduced ordinary differential equations, and (iii) quenched much slower variables that are constant. The algebraic equations satisfied by fast variables define chains of nested normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds. In such chains, faster manifolds are of higher dimension and contain the slower manifolds. Our reduction methods are introduced algorithmically for networks with monomial reaction rates and linear, monomial, or polynomial approximate conservation laws. We propose symbolic algorithms to reshape and rescale the networks such that geometric singular perturbation theory can be applied to them, test the applicability of the theory, and finally reduce the networks. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to a model of the TGF-beta signaling pathway.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In view of the molecular biological mechanism of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes proliferation induced by hepatitis B virus infection in vivo, a novel dynamical model with interval delay is proposed. The interval delay is determined by two delay parameters, namely delay center and delay radius. We derive the basic reproduction number for the viral infection and obtain that the virus-free equilibrium (VFE) is globally asymptotically stable if . When , besides VFE, the unique virus-present equilibrium (VPE) exists and the conditions of its asymptotical stability are obtained. Moreover, we study the Hopf bifurcations induced by the two delay parameters. Although there is no mitotic term in the target-cell dynamics, the results indicate that both these delay parameters can lead to periodic fluctuations at VPE, but only the smaller delay radius will destabilize the system, which is different from the classical discrete delay or distributed delay. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed model can capture the profiles of the clinical data of two untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. The ability of interval delay to destabilize the system is between discrete delay and distributed delay, and the delay center plays the primary role. Pharmaceutical treatment can affect the stability of VPE and induce the fast-slow periodic phenomenon.},

If the CPG dynamics is periodic, so is the lifted dynamics. Synchrony with the CPG manifests as a standing wave, and a regular phase pattern creates a traveling wave. We discuss Liapunov, asymptotic, and Floquet stability of the lifted periodic orbit and introduce transverse versions of these conditions that imply stability for signals propagating along arbitrarily long chains. We compare these notions to a simpler condition, transverse stability of the synchrony subspace, which is equivalent to Floquet stability when nodes are 1 dimensional.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The aim of this paper is to present a method to compute parameterizations of partially hyperbolic invariant tori and their invariant bundles in nonautonomous quasi-periodic Hamiltonian systems. We generalize flow map parameterization methods to the quasi-periodic setting. To this end, we introduce the notion of fiberwise isotropic tori and sketch definitions and results on fiberwise symplectic deformations and their moment maps. These constructs are vital to work in a suitable setting and lead to the proofs of “magic cancellations” that guarantee the existence of solutions of cohomological equations. We apply our algorithms in the elliptic restricted three body problem and compute nonresonant 3-dimensional invariant tori and their invariant bundles around the point.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a methodology for the computation of whole sets of heteroclinic connections between isoenergetic slices of center manifolds of center center saddle fixed points of autonomous Hamiltonian systems. It involves (a) computing Taylor expansions of the center-unstable and center-stable manifolds of the departing and arriving fixed points through the parameterization method, using a new style that uncouples the center part from the hyperbolic one, thus making the fibered structure of the manifolds explicit; (b) uniformly meshing isoenergetic slices of the center manifolds, using a novel strategy that avoids numerical integration of the reduced differential equations and makes an explicit three-dimensional representation of these slices as deformed solid ellipsoids; (c) matching the center-stable and center-unstable manifolds of the departing and arriving points in a Poincaré section. The methodology is applied to obtain the whole set of isoenergetic heteroclinic connections from the center manifold of to the center manifold of in the Earth-Moon circular, spatial restricted three-body problem, for nine increasing energy levels that reach the appearance of halo orbits in both and .

  abstract     = {Abstract. Connection matrices are a generalization of Morse boundary operators from the classical Morse theory for gradient vector fields. Developing an efficient computational framework for connection matrices is particularly important in the context of a rapidly growing data science that requires new mathematical tools for discrete data. Toward this goal, the classical theory for connection matrices has been adapted to combinatorial frameworks that facilitate computation. We develop an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute a connection matrix from a given combinatorial (multi) vector field on a simplicial complex. This algorithm requires a single pass, improving upon a known algorithm that runs an implicit recursion executing two passes at each level. Overall, the new algorithm is more simple, direct, and efficient than the state-of-the-art. Because of the algorithm’s similarity to the persistence algorithm, one may take advantage of various software optimizations from topological data analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Two competing types of interactions often play an important part in shaping system behavior, such as activatory and inhibitory functions in biological systems. Hence, signed networks, where each connection can be either positive or negative, have become popular models over recent years. However, the primary focus of the literature is on the unweighted and structurally balanced ones, where all cycles have an even number of negative edges. Hence here, we first introduce a classification of signed networks into balanced, antibalanced, or strictly unbalanced ones, and then characterize each type of signed networks in terms of the spectral properties of the signed weighted adjacency matrix. In particular, we show that the spectral radius of the matrix with signs is smaller than that without if and only if the signed network is strictly unbalanced. These properties are important to understand the dynamics on signed networks, both linear and nonlinear ones. Specifically, we find consistent patterns in a linear and a nonlinear dynamics theoretically, depending on their type of balance. We also propose two measures to further characterize strictly unbalanced networks, motivated by perturbation theory. Finally, we numerically verify these properties through experiments on both synthetic and real networks.},

We calculate in-phase and antiphase limit cycles as well as quasi-periodic solutions via double Hopf bifurcation analysis and center manifold reduction. Moreover, we uncover further details on the global dynamic behavior by numerical continuation, including the occurrence of limit cycles in phase quadrature and 1-1 locking of quasi-periodic solutions.},
