  abstract     = {Abstract. In submodular -partition, the input is a submodular function (given by an evaluation oracle) along with a positive integer , and the goal is to find a partition of the ground set into nonempty parts in order to minimize . Narayanan, Roy, and Patkar [J. Algorithms, 21 (1996), pp. 306–330] designed an algorithm for submodular -partition based on the principal partition sequence and showed that the approximation factor of their algorithm is 2 for the special case of graph cut functions (which was subsequently rediscovered by Ravi and Sinha [European J. Oper. Res., 186 (2008), pp. 77–90]). In this work, we study the approximation factor of their algorithm for three subfamilies of submodular functions—namely monotone, symmetric, and posimodular—and show the following results: (1) The approximation factor of their algorithm for monotone submodular -partition is . This result improves on the 2-factor that was known to be achievable for monotone submodular -partition via other algorithms. Moreover, our upper bound of matches the recently shown lower bound under polynomial number of function evaluation queries [R. Santiago, Proceedings of the International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms, IWOCA, 2021, pp. 516–530]. Our upper bound of is also the first improvement beyond 2 for a certain graph partitioning problem that is a special case of monotone submodular -partition. (2) The approximation factor of their algorithm for symmetric submodular -partition is 2. This result generalizes their approximation factor analysis beyond graph cut functions. (3) The approximation factor of their algorithm for posimodular submodular -partition is 2. We also construct an example to show that the approximation factor of their algorithm for arbitrary submodular functions is .},

The first problem is Intersection Emptiness, which asks whether a finite number of given finitely generated semigroups have empty intersection. This problem was first studied by Markov in the 1940s. We show that Intersection Emptiness is PTIME decidable in the Heisenberg groups over any algebraic number field . We also extend our decidability result to arbitrary finitely generated 2-step nilpotent groups. The second problem is Orbit Intersection, which asks whether the orbits of two matrices under multiplication by two semigroups intersect with each other. This problem was first studied by Babai, Beals, Cai, Ivanyos, and Luks (1996), who showed its decidability in commutative matrix groups. We show that Orbit Intersection is decidable in the Heisenberg group .},

A natural problem, akin to that of coloring a 3-colorable graph with few colors, is to color a 2-colorable tournament with few colors. This problem does not seem to have been addressed before, although it is a special case of coloring a 2-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph with few colors, which is a well-studied problem with super-constant lower bounds. We present a new efficient decomposition lemma for tournaments, which we use to design polynomial-time algorithms to color various classes of tournaments with few colors, notably to color a 2-colorable tournament with 10 colors. We also use this lemma to prove equivalence between the problems of coloring 3-colorable tournaments and coloring 3-colorable graphs with constantly many colors. For the classes of tournaments considered, we complement our upper bounds with strengthened lower bounds, painting a comprehensive picture of the algorithmic and complexity aspects of coloring tournaments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) is a fundamental computational problem that has received a lot of attention in parameterized complexity. In this paper, we initiate the study of a wide generalization of this problem called the -free Strong Connected Component Deletion problem, where is a finite family of digraphs. Here, one is given a digraph and an integer , and the objective is to decide whether there is a vertex set of size at most whose deletion results in a digraph where every strongly connected component excludes graphs in family as (not necessarily induced) subgraphs. When comprises only the digraph with a single arc, then this problem is precisely the DFVS problem. Our main result is a proof that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the size of the deletion set if only contains rooted graphs or if contains at least one directed path. Along with generalizing the fixed-parameter tractability result for DFVS, our result also generalizes the results of Göke, Marx, and Mnich [Proceedings of the International Conference on Algorithms and Complexity, Springer, 2019, pp. 249–261] for the 1-Out-Regular Vertex Deletion and Bounded Size Strong Component Vertex Deletion problems. Moreover, we design algorithms for the two above-mentioned problems, whose running times are better and that match with the best bounds for DFVS, without using the heavy machinery of shadow removal as is done by Göke, Marx, and Mnich [Proceedings of the International Conference on Algorithms and Complexity, Springer, 2019, pp. 249–261].},

We study vulnerability of a uniformly distributed random graph to an attack by an adversary who aims for a global change of the distribution while being able to make only a local change in the graph. We call a graph property antistochastic if the probability that a random graph satisfies is small but, with high probability, there is a small perturbation transforming into a graph satisfying . While for labeled graphs such properties are easy to obtain from binary covering codes, the existence of antistochastic properties for unlabeled graphs or, in other words, isomorphism-invariant antistochastic properties, is not so evident. If an admissible perturbation is either the addition or the deletion of one edge, we exhibit an isomorphism-invariant antistochastic property that is satisfied by a random graph of order with probability , which is as small as possible. We also express another antistochastic property in terms of the degree sequence of a graph. This property has probability , which is optimal up to a factor of 2.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Graph modification problems ask for the minimal number of vertex/edge additions/deletions needed to make a graph satisfy some predetermined property. A (meta-)problem of this type, which was raised by Yannakakis in 1981, asks to determine for which properties it is NP-hard to compute the smallest number of edge deletions needed to make a graph satisfy . Despite being extensively studied in the past 40 years, this problem is still wide open. In fact, it is open even when is the property of being -free, for some fixed graph . In this case we use to denote the smallest number of edge deletions needed to turn into an -free graph. Alon, Shapira, and Sudakov proved that if is not bipartite, then computing is NP-hard. They left open the problem of classifying the bipartite graphs for which computing is NP-hard. In this paper we resolve this problem when is a forest, showing that computing is polynomial-time solvable if is a star forest and NP-hard otherwise. Our main innovation in this work lies in introducing a new graph-theoretic approach for Yannakakis’s problem, which differs significantly from all prior works on this subject. In particular, we prove new results concerning an old and famous conjecture of Erdős and Sós, which are of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A proper coloring of a graph is conflict-free if, for every nonisolated vertex, some color is used exactly once on its neighborhood. Caro, Petruševski, and Škrekovski [Discrete Math., 346 (2023), 113221] proved that every graph has a proper conflict-free coloring with at most colors and conjectured that colors suffice for every connected graph with . Our first main result is that even for list-coloring, colors suffice for every graph with ; we also prove slightly weaker bounds for all graphs with . These results follow from our more general framework on proper conflict-free list-coloring of a pair consisting of a graph and a “conflict” hypergraph . As another corollary of our results in this general framework, every graph has a proper -list-coloring such that every bichromatic component is a path on at most three vertices, where the number of colors is optimal up to a constant factor. Our proof uses a fairly new type of recursive counting argument called Rosenfeld counting, which is a variant of the Lovász local lemma or entropy compression. We also prove an asymptotically optimal result for a fractional analogue of our general framework for proper conflict-free coloring for pairs of a graph and a conflict hypergraph. A corollary states that every graph has a fractional -coloring such that every fractionally bichromatic component has at most two vertices. In particular, it implies that the fractional analogue of the conjecture of Caro, Petruševski, and Škrekovski holds asymptotically in a strong sense.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the direct sum of -matroids by way of their cyclic flats. Using that the rank function of a -matroid is fully determined by the cyclic flats and their ranks, we show that the cyclic flats of the direct sum of two -matroids are exactly all the direct sums of the cyclic flats of the two summands. This simplifies the rank function of the direct sum significantly. A -matroid is called irreducible if it cannot be written as a (nontrivial) direct sum. We provide a characterization of irreducibility in terms of the cyclic flats and show that every -matroid can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible -matroids, which are unique up to equivalence.},

This is the first contribution of a sequence of papers introducing the notions of -weak order and -permutahedra, certain discrete objects that are indexed by a sequence of nonnegative integers . In this first paper, we concentrate purely on the combinatorics and lattice structure of the -weak order, a partial order on certain decreasing trees which generalizes the classical weak order on permutations. In particular, we show that the -weak order is a semidistributive and congruence uniform lattice, generalizing known results for the classical weak order on permutations. Restricting the -weak order to certain trees gives rise to the -Tamari lattice, a sublattice which generalizes the classical Tamari lattice. We show that the -Tamari lattice can be obtained as a quotient lattice of the -weak order when has no zeros, and show that the -Tamari lattices (for arbitrary ) are isomorphic to the -Tamari lattices of Préville-Ratelle and Viennot. The underlying geometric structure of the -weak order will be studied in a sequel of this paper, where we introduce the notions of -permutahedra and -associahedra.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The approximate uniform sampling of graphs with a given degree sequence is a well-known, extensively studied problem in theoretical computer science and has significant applications, e.g., in the analysis of social networks. In this work we study a generalization of the problem, where degree intervals are specified instead of a single degree sequence. We are interested in sampling and counting graphs whose degree sequences satisfy the corresponding degree interval constraints. A natural scenario where this problem arises is in hypothesis testing on networks that are only partially observed. We provide the first fully polynomial almost uniform sampler (FPAUS) as well as the first fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for sampling and counting, respectively, graphs with near-regular degree intervals, i.e., graphs in which every node has a degree from an interval not too far away from a given . In order to design our FPAUS, we rely on various state-of-the-art tools from Markov chain theory and combinatorics. In particular, by carefully using Markov chain decomposition and comparison arguments, we reduce part of our problem to the recent breakthrough of Anari et al. [Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2019, pp. 1–12] on sampling a base of a matroid under a strongly log-concave probability distribution, and we provide the first nontrivial algorithmic application of a breakthrough asymptotic enumeration formula of Liebenau and Wormald [J. Eur. Math. Soc., 26 (2023), pp. 1–40]. As a more direct approach, we also study a natural Markov chain recently introduced by Rechner, Strowick and Müller-Hannemann [J. Complex Netw., 6 (2018), pp. 833–858], based on three local operations—switches, hinge flips, and additions/deletions of an edge. We obtain the first theoretical results for this Markov chain, showing it is rapidly mixing for the case of near-regular degree intervals of size at most one.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We give a nearly linear-time algorithm to approximately sample satisfying assignments in the random -SAT model when the density of the formula scales exponentially with . The best previously known sampling algorithm for the random -SAT model applies when the density of the formula is less than and runs in time [Galanis et al., SIAM J. Comput., 50 (2021), pp. 1701–1738]. Here is the number of variables and is the number of clauses. Our algorithm achieves a significantly faster running time of and samples satisfying assignments up to density . The main challenge in our setting is the presence of many variables with unbounded degree, which causes significant correlations within the formula and impedes the application of relevant Markov chain methods from the bounded-degree setting [Feng et al., J. ACM, 68 (2021) 40; Jain, Pham, and Vuong, On the Sampling Lovász Local Lemma for Atomic Constraint Satisfaction Problems, 2021]. Our main technical contribution is a bound of the sum of influences in the -SAT model which turns out to be robust against the presence of high-degree variables. This allows us to apply the spectral independence framework and obtain fast mixing results of a uniform-block Glauber dynamics on a carefully selected subset of the variables. The final key ingredient in our method is to take advantage of the sparsity of logarithmic-sized connected sets and the expansion properties of the random formula, and establish relevant connectivity properties of the set of satisfying assignments that enable the fast simulation of this Glauber dynamics. Our results also allow us to conclude that, with high probability, a random -CNF formula with density at most has a giant component of solutions that are connected in a graph where solutions are adjacent if they have Hamming distance . We are also able to deduce looseness results for random -CNFs in the same regime.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Boolean network (BN) is a discrete dynamical system defined by a Boolean function that maps to the domain itself. A trap space of a BN is a generalization of a fixed point, which is defined as a subhypercube closed by the function of the BN. A trap space is minimal if it does not contain any smaller trap space. Minimal trap spaces have applications for the analysis of attractors of BNs with various update modes. This paper establishes the computational complexity results of three decision problems related to minimal trap spaces: the decision of the trap space property of a subhypercube, the decision of its minimality, and the decision of the membership of a given configuration to a minimal trap space. Under several cases on Boolean function representations, we investigate the computational complexity of each problem. In the general case, we demonstrate that the trap space property is coNP-complete, and the minimality and the membership properties are -complete. The complexities drop by one level in the polynomial hierarchy whenever the local functions of the BN either are unate or are represented using truth-tables, binary decision diagrams, or double disjunctive normal forms (Petri net encoding): the trap space property can be decided in polynomial time, whereas deciding the minimality and the membership are coNP-complete. When the BN is given as its functional graph, all these problems are in P.},

A network on a finite set , is a connected directed acyclic graph with leaf set in which every root in has outdegree at least 2 and no vertex in has indegree and outdegree equal to 1; is arboreal if the underlying unrooted, undirected graph of is a tree. Networks are of interest in evolutionary biology since they are used, for example, to represent the evolutionary history of a set of species whose ancestors have exchanged genes in the past. For some arbitrary set of symbols, is a symbolic arboreal map if there exists some arboreal network whose vertices with outdegree 2 or more are labeled by elements in and so that , is equal to the label of the least common ancestor of and in if this exists, and otherwise. Important examples of symbolic arboreal maps include the symbolic ultrametrics, which arise in areas such as game theory, phylogenetics, and cograph theory. In this paper we show that a map is a symbolic arboreal map if and only if satisfies certain 3- and 4-point conditions and the graph with vertex set and edge set consisting of those pairs with is Ptolemaic (i.e., its shortest path distance satisfies Ptolemy’s inequality). To do this, we introduce and prove a key theorem concerning the shared ancestry graph for a network on , where this is the graph with vertex set and edge set consisting of those such that and share a common ancestor in . In particular, we show that for any connected graph with vertex set and edge clique cover in which there are no two distinct sets in with one a subset of the other, there is some network with roots and leaf set whose shared ancestry graph is .},

As an extension of this result for longer cycles, we prove that for each odd , the balanced blow-up of (uniquely) maximizes the number of -cycles among -free graphs on vertices, as long as is sufficiently large. We also show that this is no longer true if is not assumed to be sufficiently large. Our result strengthens results of Grzesik and Kielak who proved that for each odd , the balanced blow-up of maximizes the number of -cycles among graphs with a given number of vertices and no odd cycles of length less than . We further show that if and are odd and is sufficiently large compared to , then the balanced blow-up of does not asymptotically maximize the number of -cycles among -free graphs on vertices.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate preprocessing for vertex-subset problems on graphs. While the notion of kernelization, originating in parameterized complexity theory, is a formalization of provably effective preprocessing aimed at reducing the total instance size, our focus is on finding a nonempty vertex set that belongs to an optimal solution. This decreases the size of the remaining part of the solution which still has to be found, and therefore shrinks the search space of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for parameterizations based on the solution size. We introduce the notion of a -essential vertex as one that is contained in all -approximate solutions. For several classic combinatorial problems such as Odd Cycle Transversal and Directed Feedback Vertex Set, we show that under mild conditions a polynomial-time preprocessing algorithm can find a subset of an optimal solution that contains all 2-essential vertices, by exploiting packing/covering duality. This leads to FPT algorithms to solve these problems where the exponential term in the running time depends only on the number of nonessential vertices in the solution.},

A celebrated conjecture of Tuza states that in any finite graph the minimum size of a cover of triangles by edges is at most twice the maximum size of a set of edge-disjoint triangles.

We further investigate a different notion of popularity, where the agents vote with respect to lexicographic preferences, and show that both existence and verification problems become coNP-hard even in the -matching case.},

Each test can be conducted at cost , and it succeeds independently with probability . Further, a partition of the (integer) interval into smaller intervals is known. The goal is to conduct tests so as to determine that interval from the partition in which the number of successful tests lies while minimizing the expected cost. Ghuge, Gupta, and Nagarajan (IPCO 2022) recently showed that a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm exists. We show that interweaving the two strategies that order tests increasingly by their and ratios, respectively—as already proposed by Gkensosis et al. for a special case—yields a small approximation ratio. We also show that the approximation ratio can be slightly decreased from 6 to by adding in a third strategy that simply orders tests increasingly by their costs. The similar analyses for both algorithms are nontrivial but arguably clean. Finally, we complement the implied upper bound of on the adaptivity gap with a lower bound of 3/2. Since the lower-bound instance is a so-called unit-cost -of- instance, we settle the adaptivity gap in this case.},

Foniok and Tardif [Discrete Math., 338 (2015), pp. 527–535] described some functors on the category of digraphs that allow both left and right adjoints.

We generalize results of Foniok and Tardif to arbitrary relational structures, and coincidently, we also provide more right adjoints on digraphs, and since these constructions are connected to finite duality, we also provide a new construction of duals to trees. Our results are inspired by an application in promise constraint satisfaction—it has been shown that such functors can be used as efficient reductions between these problems.},

A finer property is global linkedness: we say that a vertex pair of is globally linked in in if in every generic -dimensional framework the distance between and is uniquely determined by the edge lengths. In this paper we investigate globally linked pairs in graphs in . We give several characterizations of those rigid graphs in which a pair is globally linked if and only if there exist internally disjoint paths from to in . We call these graphs -joined. Among others, we show that is -joined if and only if for each pair of generic frameworks of with the same edge lengths, one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of partial reflections along hyperplanes determined by -separators of . We also show that the family of -joined graphs is closed under edge addition, as well as under gluing along or more vertices. As a key ingredient to our main results, we prove that rigid graphs in contain no crossing -separators.

  abstract     = {Abstract. A recent trend in the context of graph theory is to bring theoretical analyses closer to empirical observations by focusing the studies on random graph models that are used to represent practical instances. There, it was observed that geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) yield good representations of complex real-world networks by expressing edge probabilities as a function that depends on (heterogeneous) vertex weights and distances in some underlying geometric space that the vertices are distributed in. While most of the parameters of the model are understood well, it was unclear how the dimensionality of the ground space affects the structure of the graphs. In this paper, we complement existing research into the dimension of geometric random graph models and the ongoing study of determining the dimensionality of real-world networks by studying how the structure of GIRGs changes as the number of dimensions increases. We prove that, in the limit, GIRGs approach nongeometric inhomogeneous random graphs and present insights on how quickly the decay of the geometry impacts important graph structures. In particular, we study the expected number of cliques of a given size as well as the clique number and characterize phase transitions at which their behavior changes fundamentally. Finally, our insights help in better understanding previous results about the impact of the dimensionality on geometric random graphs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A Sidorenko bigraph is one whose density in a bigraphon is minimized precisely when is constant. Several techniques in the literature to prove the Sidorenko property consist of decomposing (typically in a tree decomposition) the bigraph into smaller building blocks with stronger properties. One prominent such technique is that of -decompositions of Conlon and Lee, which uses weakly Hölder (or weakly norming) bigraphs as building blocks. In turn, to obtain weakly Hölder bigraphs, it is typical to use the chain of implications reflection bigraph cut-percolating bigraph weakly Hölder bigraph. In an earlier result by the author with Razborov, we provided a generalization of -decompositions, called reflective tree decompositions, that uses much weaker building blocks, called induced-Sidorenko bigraphs, to also obtain Sidorenko bigraphs. In this paper, we show that “left-sided” versions of the concepts of reflection bigraph and cut-percolating bigraph yield a similar chain of implications: left-reflection bigraph left-cut-percolating bigraph induced-Sidorenko bigraph. We also show that under mild hypotheses the “left-sided” analogue of the weakly Hölder property (which is also obtained via a similar chain of implications) can be used to improve bounds on another result of Conlon and Lee that roughly says that bigraphs with enough vertices on the right side of each realized degree have the Sidorenko property.},

As a nonempty family of sets, a convex geometry has a well defined -dimension. In the literature, a second parameter, called the convex dimension, has been defined expressly for these structures. Partially ordered by inclusion, a convex geometry is also a poset, and four additional dimension parameters have been defined for this larger class, called the Dushnik–Miller dimension, Boolean dimension, local dimension, and fractional dimension, respectively.

  abstract     = {Abstract. An obstacle representation of a graph consists of a set of pairwise disjoint simply connected closed regions and a one-to-one mapping of the vertices of to points such that two vertices are adjacent in if and only if the line segment connecting the two corresponding points does not intersect any obstacle. The obstacle number of a graph is the smallest number of obstacles in an obstacle representation of the graph in the plane such that all obstacles are simple polygons. It is known that the obstacle number of each -vertex graph is [M. Balko, J. Cibulka, and P. Valtr, Discrete Comput. Geom., 59 (2018), pp. 143–164] and that there are -vertex graphs whose obstacle number is [V. Dujmović and P. Morin, Electron. J. Combin., 22 (2015), 3.1]. We improve this lower bound to for simple polygons and to for convex polygons. To obtain these stronger bounds, we improve known estimates on the number of -vertex graphs with bounded obstacle number, solving a conjecture by Dujmović and Morin. We also show that if the drawing of some -vertex graph is given as part of the input, then for some drawings obstacles are required to turn them into an obstacle representation of the graph. Our bounds are asymptotically tight in several instances. We complement these combinatorial bounds by two complexity results. First, we show that computing the obstacle number of a graph is fixed-parameter tractable in the vertex cover number of . Second, we show that, given a graph and a simple polygon , it is NP-hard to decide whether admits an obstacle representation using as the only obstacle.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, it was proved by Bérczi and Schwarcz that the problem of factorizing a matroid into rainbow bases with respect to a given partition of its ground set is algorithmically intractable. On the other hand, many special cases were left open. We first show that the problem remains hard if the matroid is graphic, answering a question of Bérczi and Schwarcz. As another special case, we consider the problem of deciding whether a given digraph can be factorized into subgraphs which are spanning trees in the underlying sense and respect upper bounds on the indegree of every vertex. We prove that this problem is also hard. This answers a question of Frank. In the second part of the article, we deal with the relaxed problem of covering the ground set of a matroid by rainbow bases. Among other results, we show that there is a linear function such that every matroid that can be factorized into bases for some can be covered by rainbow bases if every partition class contains at most 2 elements.},

We provide multiple characterizations of hypergraph Horn functions in terms of implicate-duality and the closure operator, which are, respectively, regarded as generalizations of matroid duality and the Mac Lane–Steinitz exchange property of matroid closure. We also study algorithmic issues on hypergraph Horn functions and show that the recognition problem (i.e., deciding if a given definite Horn CNF represents a hypergraph Horn function) and key realization (i.e., deciding if a given hypergraph is realized as a key set by a hypergraph Horn function) can be done in polynomial time, while implicate sets can be generated with polynomial delay.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The voter model is a classical interacting particle system, modeling how global consensus is formed by local imitation. We analyze the time to consensus for a particular family of voter models when the underlying structure is a scale-free inhomogeneous random graph in the high edge–density regime, where this graph features a giant component. In this regime, we verify that the polynomial orders of consensus agree with those of their mean-field approximation in [A. Moinet, A. Barrat, and R. Pastor-Satorras, Phys. Rev. E, 98 (2018), 022303]. This “discursive” family of models has a symmetrized interaction to better model discussions and is indexed by a temperature parameter that, for certain parameters of the power law tail of the network’s degree distribution, is seen to produce two distinct phases of consensus speed. Our proofs rely on the well-known duality to coalescing random walks and a novel bound on the mixing time of these walks using the known fast mixing of the Erdős–Rényi giant subgraph. Unlike in the subcritical case [J. Fernley and M. Ortgiese, Random Structures Algorithms, 62 (2023), pp. 376–429], which requires tail exponent of the limiting degree distribution as well as low edge density, in the giant component case, we also address the “ultrasmall world” power law exponents .},

It is known that popular max-matchings always exist in and one such matching can be efficiently computed. In this paper we are in the weighted setting, i.e., there is a cost function , and our goal is to find a min-cost popular max-matching. We prove that such a matching can be computed in polynomial time by showing a compact extended formulation for the popular max-matching polytope. By contrast, it is known that the popular matching polytope has near-exponential extension complexity and finding a min-cost popular matching is NP-hard. We also consider Pareto-optimality. Though it is easy to find a Pareto-optimal matching/max-matching, we show that it is NP-hard to find a min-cost Pareto-optimal matching/max-matching.},

The List-3-Coloring Problem is to decide, given a graph and a list of colors assigned to each vertex of , whether admits a proper coloring with for every vertex of , and the 3-Coloring Problem is the List-3-Coloring Problem on instances with for every vertex of . The List-3-Coloring Problem is a classical NP-complete problem, and it is well-known that while restricted to -free graphs (meaning graphs with no induced subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph ), it remains NP-complete unless is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of a path. However, the current state of art is far from proving this to be sufficient for a polynomial time algorithm; in fact, the complexity of the 3-Coloring Problem on -free graphs (where denotes the eight-vertex path) is unknown. Here we consider a variant of the List-3-Coloring Problem called the Ordered Graph List-3-Coloring Problem, where the input is an ordered graph, that is, a graph along with a linear order on its vertex set. For ordered graphs and , we say is -free if is not isomorphic to an induced subgraph of with the isomorphism preserving the linear order. We prove, assuming to be an ordered graph, a nearly complete dichotomy for the Ordered Graph List-3-Coloring Problem restricted to -free ordered graphs. In particular, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if has at most one edge, and remains NP-complete if has at least three edges. Moreover, in the case where has exactly two edges, we give a complete dichotomy when the two edges of share an end, and prove several NP-completeness results when the two edges of do not share an end, narrowing the open cases down to three very special types of two-edge ordered graphs.},

ACM, 67 (2020), 22] states that every planar graph is a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This result has been the key tool to resolve important open problems regarding queue layouts, nonrepetitive colorings, centered colorings, and adjacency labeling schemes. In this paper, we extend this line of research by utilizing shallow minors to prove analogous product structure theorems for several beyond-planar graph classes. The key observation that drives our work is that many beyond-planar graphs can be described as a shallow minor of the strong product of a planar graph with a small complete graph. In particular, we show that powers of bounded degree planar graphs, -planar, -cluster planar, fan-planar, and -fan-bundle planar graphs have such a shallow-minor structure. Using a combination of old and new results, we deduce that these classes have bounded queue-number, bounded nonrepetitive chromatic number, polynomial -centered chromatic numbers, linear strong coloring numbers, and cubic weak coloring numbers. In addition, we show that -gap planar graphs have at least exponential local treewidth and, as a consequence, cannot be described as a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In most social choice settings, the participating agents express their preferences over the different alternatives in the form of linear orderings. While this clearly simplifies preference elicitation, it inevitably leads to poor performance with respect to optimizing a cardinal objective, such as the social welfare, since the values of the agents remain virtually unknown. This loss in performance because of lack of information is measured by the notion of distortion. A recent array of works put forward the agenda of designing mechanisms that learn the values of the agents for a small number of alternatives via queries, and use this limited extra information to make better-informed decisions, thus improving distortion. Following this agenda, in this work we focus on a class of combinatorial problems that includes most well-known matching problems and several of their generalizations. For problems such as One-Sided Matching, Two-Sided Matching, General Graph Matching, and Short Cycle Packing, we design two-query mechanisms that achieve the best-possible worst-case distortion in terms of social welfare, and outperform the best-possible expected distortion achieved by randomized ordinal mechanisms. Our results extend to problems like -Constrained Resource Allocation, General Graph -Matching, and -Clique Packing, when is restricted to be any constant.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A circle graph is an intersection graph of a set of chords of a circle. We describe the unavoidable induced subgraphs of circle graphs with large treewidth. This includes examples that are far from the “usual suspects.” Our results imply that treewidth and Hadwiger number are linearly tied on the class of circle graphs and that the unavoidable induced subgraphs of a vertex-minor-closed class with large treewidth are the usual suspects if and only if the class has bounded rank-width. Using the same tools, we also study the treewidth of graphs that have a circular drawing whose crossing graph is well-behaved in some way. In this setting, we show that if the crossing graph is -minor-free, then has treewidth at most and has no -topological minor. On the other hand, we show that there are graphs with arbitrarily large Hadwiger number that have circular drawings whose crossing graphs are 2-degenerate.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We show that the eigenpolytopes of graphs are universal in the sense that every polytope, up to affine equivalence, appears as the eigenpolytope of some positively weighted graph. We next extend the theory of graphical designs, which are quadrature rules for graphs, to positively weighted graphs. Through Gale duality for polytopes, we show a bijection between graphical designs and the faces of eigenpolytopes. This bijection proves the existence of graphical designs with positive quadrature weights and upper bounds the size of a minimal graphical design. Connecting this bijection with the universality of eigenpolytopes, we establish three complexity results: It is strongly NP-complete to determine if there is a graphical design smaller than the mentioned upper bound, it is NP-hard to find a smallest graphical design, and it is #P-complete to count the number of minimal graphical designs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Since the seminal result of Karger, Motwani, and Sudan, algorithms for approximate 3-coloring have primarily centered around rounding the solution to a Semidefinite Program. However, it is likely that important combinatorial or algebraic insights are needed in order to break the threshold. One way to develop new understanding in graph coloring is to study special subclasses of graphs. For instance, Blum studied the 3-coloring of random graphs, and Arora and Ge studied the 3-coloring of graphs with low threshold-rank. In this work, we study graphs that arise from a tensor product, which appear to be novel instances of the 3-coloring problem. We consider graphs of the form with and , where is any edge set such that no vertex has more than an -fraction of its edges in . We show that one can construct with that is close to . For arbitrary , satisfies . Additionally, when is a mild expander, we provide a 3-coloring for in polynomial time. These results partially generalize an exact tensor factorization algorithm of Imrich. On the other hand, without any assumptions on , we show that it is NP-hard to 3-color .},

In matroidal terms, the cocircumference of is the circumference of the bond matroid of . Our first result is the following “dual” version of Birmelé’s theorem: The treewidth of a graph is at most its cocircumference.

These results complete the picture in which in addition to, or instead of, the matrix one forbids the matrix (which has rows 11,10). It is well known that in these two cases one obtains the class of interval graphs and the class of strongly chordal graphs, respectively. By complementation, we obtain the class of strong comparability graphs, whose adjacency matrix can be rearranged by a simultaneous row and column permutation to avoid the two-by-two identity submatrix. Thus our results give characterizations and algorithms for this class of irreflexive graphs as well. In other words, our results may be interpreted as solving the following problem: given a symmetric 0,1-matrix with 0-diagonal, can the rows and columns of be simultaneously permuted to avoid the two-by-two identity submatrix?},

The range assignment induces a directed communication graph on , which contains an edge iff . In the broadcast range-assignment problem, the goal is to assign the ranges such that contains an arborescence rooted at a designated root node and the cost of the assignment is minimized. We study the dynamic version of this problem. In particular, we study trade-offs between the stability of the solution—the number of ranges that are modified when a point is inserted into or deleted from —and its approximation ratio. To this end we study -stable algorithms, which are algorithms that modify the range of at most points when they update the solution. We also introduce the concept of a stable approximation scheme, or SAS for short. A SAS is an update algorithm that, for any given fixed parameter , is -stable and that maintains a solution with approximation ratio , where the stability parameter only depends on and not on the size of . We study such trade-offs in three settings. (1) For the problem in , we present a SAS with . Furthermore, we prove that this is tight in the worst case: any SAS for the problem must have . We also present 1-, 2-, and 3-stable algorithms with constant approximation ratio. (2) For the problem in (that is, when the underlying space is a circle) we prove that no SAS exists. This is in spite of the fact that, for the static problem in , we prove that an optimal solution can always be obtained by cutting the circle at an appropriate point and solving the resulting problem in . (3) For the problem in , we also prove that no SAS exists, and we present a -stable -approximation algorithm.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we study a biased version of the nearest-neighbor transposition Markov chain on the set of permutations where neighboring elements and are placed in order with probability . Our goal is to identify the class of parameter sets for which this Markov chain is rapidly mixing. Specifically, we consider the open conjecture of Jim Fill [Background on the Gap Problem (2003) and An Interesting Spectral Gap Problem (2003)] that all monotone, positively biased distributions are rapidly mixing. We resolve Fill’s conjecture in the affirmative for distributions arising from -class particle processes, where the elements are divided into classes and the probability of exchanging neighboring elements depends on the particular classes the elements are in. We further require that is a constant and that all probabilities between elements in different classes are bounded away from . These particle processes arise in the context of self-organizing lists, and our result also applies beyond permutations to the setting where all particles in a class are indistinguishable. Our work generalizes recent work by Haddadan and Winkler [Mixing of permutations by biased transposition (2017)] studying 3-class particle processes. Additionally, we show that a broader class of distributions based on trees is also rapidly mixing, which generalizes a class analyzed by Bhakta et al. [Mixing times of Markov chains for self-organizing lists and biased permutations (2013)]. Our proof involves analyzing a generalized biased exclusion process, which is a nearest-neighbor transposition chain applied to a 2-particle system. Biased exclusion processes are of independent interest, with applications in self-assembly. We generalize the results of Greenberg et al. [Sampling biased lattice configurations using exponential metrics (2009)] and Benjamini et al. [Mixing times of the biased card shuffling and the asymmetric exclusion process (2005)] on biased exclusion processes to allow the probability of swapping neighboring elements to depend on the entire system, as long as the minimum bias is bounded away from 1.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Modular decomposition focuses on repeatedly identifying a module (a collection of vertices that shares exactly the same neighborhood outside of ) and collapsing it into a single vertex. This notion of exactitude of neighborhood is very strict, especially when dealing with real-world graphs. We study new ways to relax this exactitude condition. However, generalizing modular decomposition is far from obvious. Most of the previous proposals lose algebraic properties of modules and thus most of the nice algorithmic consequences. We introduce the notion of an -module, a relaxation that maintains some of the algebraic structure. It leads to a new combinatorial decomposition with interesting properties. Among the main results in this work, we show that minimal -modules can be computed in polynomial time, and we generalize series and parallel operation between graphs. This leads to -cographs which have interesting properties. We study how to generalize Gallai’s theorem corresponding to the case for , but unfortunately we give evidence that computing such a decomposition tree can be difficult.},

We prove that for any process in this class the gap between the maximum and average load is w.h.p. for any number of balls . For the Packing process, we also provide a matching lower bound. Additionally, we prove that the Packing process is sample efficient in the sense that the expected number of balls allocated per sample is strictly greater than one.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The investigation of combinatorial diameters of polyhedra is a classical topic in linear programming due to its connection with the possibility of an efficient pivot rule for the simplex method. We are interested in the diameters of polyhedra formed from the so-called parallel or series connection of oriented matroids. Oriented matroids are the natural way to connect representable matroid theory with the combinatorics of linear programming, and these connections are fundamental operations for the construction of more complicated matroids from elementary matroid blocks. We prove that, for polyhedra whose combinatorial diameter satisfies the Hirsch-conjecture bound regardless of the right-hand sides in a standard-form description, the diameters of their parallel or series connections remain small in the Hirsch-conjecture bound. These results are a substantial step toward devising a diameter bound for all polyhedra defined through totally unimodular matrices based on Seymour’s famous decomposition theorem. Our proof techniques and results exhibit a number of interesting features. While the parallel connection leads to a bound that adds just a constant, for the series connection one has to linearly take into account the maximal value in a specific coordinate of any vertex. Our proofs also require a careful treatment of non-revisiting edge walks in degenerate polyhedra as well as the construction of edge walks that may take a “detour&quot; to facets that satisfy the non-revisiting conjecture when the underlying polyhedron may not.},

For such graphs, no fpt isomorphism test was known before. The algorithm builds on an elegant combination of simple group-theoretic, combinatorial, and graph-theoretic approaches.

Informally, convex characters are measurements on the contemporary species in which the subset of species (both contemporary and extinct) that share a given state form a connected subtree. Kelk and Stamoulis [Adv. Appl. Math., 84 (2017), pp. 34–46] showed how to efficiently count, list, and sample certain restricted subfamilies of convex characters, and algorithmic applications were given. We continue this work in a number of directions. First, we show how combining the enumeration of convex characters with existing parameterized algorithms can be used to speed up exponential-time algorithms for the maximum agreement forest problem in phylogenetics. Second, we revisit the quantity , defined as the number of convex characters on in which each state appears on at least 2 taxa. We use this to give an algorithm with running time , where is the golden ratio and is the number of taxa in the input trees for computation of maximum parsimony distance on two state characters. By further restricting the characters counted by we open an interesting bridge to the literature on enumeration of matchings. By crossing this bridge we improve the running time of the aforementioned parsimony distance algorithm to and obtain a number of new results in themselves relevant to enumeration of matchings on at most binary trees.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Network creation games are a well-known approach for explaining and analyzing the structure, quality, and dynamics of real-world networks that evolved via the interaction of selfish agents without a central authority. In these games selfish agents corresponding to nodes in a network strategically buy incident edges to improve their centrality. However, past research on these games only considered the creation of networks with unit-weight edges. In practice, e.g., when constructing a fiber-optic network, the choice of which nodes to connect and also the induced price for a link crucially depend on the distance between the involved nodes, and such settings can be modeled via edge-weighted graphs. We incorporate arbitrary edge weights by generalizing the well-known model by Fabrikant et al. [Proceedings of PODC ’03, ACM, 2003, pp. 347–351] to edge-weighted host graphs and focus on the geometric setting where the weights are induced by the distances in some metric space. In stark contrast to the state of the art for the unit-weight version, where the price of anarchy is conjectured to be constant and where resolving this is a major open problem, we prove a tight nonconstant bound on the price of anarchy for the metric version and a slightly weaker upper bound for the nonmetric case. Moreover, we analyze the existence of equilibria, the computational hardness, and the game dynamics for several natural metrics. The model we propose can be seen as the game-theoretic analogue of the classical network design problem. Thus, low-cost equilibria of our game correspond to decentralized and stable approximations of the optimum network design.},

In this article, we explore the applicability of flow augmentation to other weighted graph separation problems parameterized by the size of the cutset. We show the following: In weighted undirected graphs, Multicut is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in both the edge- and the vertex-deletion version. The weighted version of Group Feedback Vertex Set is FPT, even with oracle access to group operations. The weighted version of Directed Subset Feedback Vertex Set is FPT. Our study reveals Directed Symmetric Multicut as the next important graph separation problem whose parameterized complexity remains unknown, even in the unweighted setting.},

We study a testing model, where the first test reveals whether the realized value is smaller or larger than the -quantile of the underlying distribution of some constant . Subsequent tests allow us to further narrow down the interval in which the realization is located. There is a limited number of possible tests, and our goal is to design near-optimal testing strategies that allow us to maximize the expected value of the chosen item.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The basis exchange axiom has been a driving force in the development of matroid theory. However, the axiom gives only a local characterization of the relation of bases, which is a major stumbling block to further progress, and providing a global understanding of the structure of matroid bases is a fundamental goal in matroid optimization. While studying the structure of symmetric exchanges, Gabow proposed the problem that any pair of bases admits a sequence of symmetric exchanges. A different extension of the exchange axiom was proposed by White, who investigated the equivalence of compatible basis sequences. These conjectures suggest that the family of bases of a matroid possesses much stronger structural properties than we are aware of. In the present paper, we study the distance of basis pairs of a matroid in terms of symmetric exchanges. In particular, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that determines a shortest possible exchange sequence that transforms a basis pair into another for split matroids, a class that was motivated by the study of matroid polytopes from a tropical geometry point of view. As a corollary, we verify the above-mentioned long-standing conjectures for this large class. As paving matroids form a subclass of split matroids, our result settles the conjectures for paving matroids as well.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Grigoriev (2001) and Laurent (2003) independently showed that the sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs does not exactly represent the hypercube until degree at least of the hierarchy. Laurent also observed that the pseudomoment matrices her proof constructs appear to have surprisingly simple and recursively structured spectra as increases. While several new proofs of the Grigoriev–Laurent lower bound have since appeared, Laurent’s observations have remained unproved. We give yet another, representation-theoretic proof of the lower bound, which also yields exact formulas for the eigenvalues of the Grigoriev–Laurent pseudomoments. Using these, we prove and elaborate on Laurent’s observations. Our proof shows that the Grigoriev–Laurent pseudomoments are a special case of a Gram matrix construction of pseudomoments proposed by Bandeira and Kunisky (2020). In the course of the proof, we also find a new realization of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group corresponding to Young diagrams with two rows, as spaces of multivariate polynomials that are multiharmonic with respect to an equilateral simplex.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We establish a connection between tangles, a concept from structural graph theory that plays a central role in Robertson and Seymour’s graph minor project, and hierarchical clustering. Tangles cannot only be defined for graphs, but in fact for arbitrary connectivity functions, which are functions defined on the subsets of some finite universe. In typical clustering applications, these universes consist of points in some metric space. Connectivity functions are usually required to be submodular. It is our first contribution to show that the central duality theorem connecting tangles with hierarchical decompositions (so-called branch decompositions) also holds if submodularity is replaced by a different property that we call maximum-submodular. We then define a connectivity function on finite data sets in an arbitrary metric space and prove that its tangles are in one-to-one correspondence with the clusters obtained by applying the well-known single linkage clustering algorithms to the same data set. Last, we generalize this correspondence for any hierarchical clustering. We show that the data structure that represents hierarchical clustering results, called dendograms, are equivalent to maximum-submodular connectivity functions and their tangles. The idea of viewing tangles as clusters was first proposed by Diestel and Whittle in 2016 as an approach to image segmentation.},

Two pairs of graphs are called Ramsey equivalent if they have the same collection of Ramsey graphs. The symmetric setting, that is, the case , received considerable attention. This led to the open question whether there are connected graphs and such that and are Ramsey equivalent. We make progress on the asymmetric version of this question and identify several nontrivial families of Ramsey equivalent pairs of connected graphs. Certain pairs of stars provide a first, albeit trivial, example of Ramsey equivalent pairs of connected graphs. Our first result characterizes all Ramsey equivalent pairs of stars. The rest of the paper focuses on pairs of the form , where is a tree and is a complete graph. We show that if belongs to a certain family of trees, including all nontrivial stars, then is Ramsey equivalent to a family of pairs of the form , where is obtained from by attaching disjoint smaller cliques to some of its vertices. In addition, we establish that for to be Ramsey equivalent to , must have roughly this form. On the other hand, we prove that for many other trees , including all odd-diameter trees, is not equivalent to any such pair, not even to the pair , where is a complete graph with a single edge attached.},

The conjecture is known to hold true only when . In light of this conjecture, a natural question is to understand structural properties of -modular matrices. We consider the column number question, how many nonzero, pairwise nonparallel columns can a rank- -modular matrix have? We prove that for each positive integer and sufficiently large integer , every rank- -modular matrix has at most nonzero, pairwise nonparallel columns, which is tight up to the term . This is the first upper bound of the form with a polynomial function. Underlying our results is a partial list of matrices that cannot exist in a -modular matrix. We believe this partial list may be of independent interest in future studies of -modular matrices.},
