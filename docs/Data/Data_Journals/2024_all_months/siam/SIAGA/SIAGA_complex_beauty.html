In contrast to previous work, our approach and equivalence results generalize to arbitrary dimension . In accordance with three-dimensional theory, our defining equations emerge as the Euler–Lagrange equations of hierarchies of variational principles—distinguished by the topological constraints they impose—and retain the known inclusions of the special cases from each other. Specifically, we relate stationary points of hierarchies of  respectively -optimization problems by a conformal change of metric, provide an explicit construction of the conformal factors relating the relevant metrics and identify the field lines of physical vector fields fields as conformal geodesics.},

These results generalize Descartes’ rule of signs in the sense that they provide a bound which is independent of the values of the coefficients and the degree of the polynomial. Based on how the exponent vectors lie on the faces of the Newton polytope, we give a recursive algorithm that verifies a sufficient condition for the set to have one connected component.

To do so, we equip the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree with the metric induced by the essential rank, which is the minimal number of linear forms needed to express a polynomial. We provide bounds on the minimum distance and dimension of the essential-rank-metric codes we construct and provide an efficient decoding algorithm. Finally, we show how essential-rank-metric codes can be seen as special instances of rank-metric codes and compare our construction to known rank-metric codes with the same parameters.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A recent result by Gudoshnikov, Makarenkov, and Rachinskii [SIAM J. Control Optim., 60 (2022), pp. 1320–1346] ensures finite-time convergence of the stress-vector of elastoplastic network spring models under assumption that the vector of the applied displacement-controlled loading lies strictly inside the normal cone to the associated polyhedral set (that depends on mechanical parameters of the springs). Determination of the terminal distribution of stresses has been thereby linked to a problem of spotting a face on the boundary of the polyhedral set where the normal cone contains vector . In this paper the abovementioned problem of spotting an eligible face is converted into a search for an eligible set of springs that have a certain topological property with respect to the entire graph (of springs). Specifically, we prove that eligible springs are those that keep nonzero lengths after their nodes are collapsed with the nodes of the displacement-controlled loading through a finite number of eligible displacements of the nodes of the graph. The proposed result allows us to judge about possible distribution of plastic deformations in network spring models directly from the topology of the associated graph of springs. A benchmark example is provided.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Polynomial dynamical systems (i.e., dynamical systems with polynomial right-hand side) are ubiquitous in applications, especially as models of reaction networks and interaction networks. The properties of general polynomial dynamical systems can be very difficult to analyze, due to nonlinearity, bifurcations, and the possibility for chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, toric dynamical systems are polynomial dynamical systems that appear naturally as models of reaction networks and have very robust and stable properties. A disguised toric dynamical system is a polynomial dynamical system generated by a reaction network and some choice of positive parameters, such that (even though it may not be toric with respect to ) it has a toric realization with respect to some network . Disguised toric dynamical systems enjoy all the robust stability properties of toric dynamical systems. In this paper, we study a larger set of dynamical systems where the rate constants are allowed to take both positive and negative values. More precisely, we analyze the -disguised toric locus of a reaction network , i.e., the subset in the space rate constants (positive or negative) of for which the corresponding polynomial dynamical system is disguised toric. We focus especially on finding a lower bound on the dimension of the -disguised toric locus.},

Hence, by computing the dimension of the hull we now have all the parameters of the symmetric and asymmetric entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes constructed with projective Reed–Muller codes over the projective plane.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In 1995, Reznick showed an important variant of the obvious fact that any positive semidefinite (real) quadratic form is a sum of squares of linear forms: If a form (of arbitrary even degree) is positive definite, then it becomes a sum of squares of forms after being multiplied by a sufficiently high power of the sum of its squared variables. If the form is just positive semidefinite instead of positive definite, this fails badly in general. In this work, however, we identify two classes of positive semidefinite even quartic forms for which the statement continues to hold even though they have, in general, infinitely many projective real zeros. The first class consists of all even quartic positive semidefinite forms in five variables. This provides a natural certificate for a matrix of size five being copositive and answers positively a question asked by Laurent and Vargas in 2022. The second class consists of certain quartic positive semidefinite forms that arise from graphs and their stability number. This shows finite convergence of a hierarchy of semidefinite approximations for the stability number of a graph proposed by de Klerk and Pasechnik in 2002. In both cases, the main tool for the proofs is the method of pure states on ideals developed by Burgdorf, Scheiderer, and Schweighofer in 2012. We hope to make this method more accessible by introducing the notion of a test state.},

We present the first algorithm for sampling random configurations of closed -gons with any fixed edgelengths in any dimension which is proved to sample correctly from standard probability measures on these spaces. We generate open -gons as weighted sets of edge vectors on the unit sphere and close them by taking a Möbius transformation of the sphere which moves the center of mass of the edges to the origin. Using previous results of the authors, such a Möbius transformation can be found in time. The resulting closed polygons are distributed according to a pushforward measure. The main contribution of the present paper is the explicit calculation of reweighting factors which transform this pushforward measure to any one of a family of standard measures on closed polygon space, including the symplectic volume for polygons in . For fixed dimension, these reweighting factors may be computed in time. Experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient and accurate in practice, and an open-source reference implementation is provided.},

We present a polynomial description of this set for the Weyl groups associated to root systems of types , and . Our description is given through a polynomial matrix inequality. The novelty lies in an approach via Hermite quadratic forms and a closed form formula for the matrix entries. The orbit space of the multiplicative Weyl group action is the orthogonality region of generalized Chebyshev polynomials. In this polynomial basis, we show that the matrices obtained for the five types follow the same, surprisingly simple pattern. This is applied to the optimization of trigonometric polynomials with crystallographic symmetries.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An symmetric matrix is copositive if the quadratic form is nonnegative on the nonnegative orthant . The cone of copositive matrices strictly contains the cone of completely positive matrices, i.e., all matrices of the form for some matrix with nonnegative entries. The main result, proved using Blekherman’s real algebraic geometry inspired techniques and tools of convex geometry, shows that asymptotically, as goes to infinity, the ratio of volume radii of the two cones is strictly positive. Consequently, the same holds true for the ratio of volume radii of any two cones sandwiched between them, e.g., the cones of positive semidefinite matrices, matrices with nonnegative entries, their intersection, and their Minkowski sum.},

In this paper, we study the polytope structure of the service rate region with the primary goal of describing its geometric shape and properties. We achieve this by introducing various structural parameters of the service rate region and establishing upper and lower bounds for them. The techniques we apply in this paper range from coding theory to optimization. One of our main results shows that every rational point of the service rate region has a so-called rational allocation, answering an open question in the research area.},

Using our correspondence, we reinterpret familiar classes of models with rational MLE, such as directed (and decomposable undirected) Gaussian graphical models. We also find new models with rational MLE. For linear concentration models with rational MLE, we show that homaloidal polynomials from birational geometry lead to solutions to the PDE. We thus shed light on the problem of classifying Gaussian models with rational MLE by relating it to the open problem in birational geometry of classifying homaloidal polynomials.},

We demonstrate how codes whose hulls are algebraic geometry codes may be defined using only rational places of Kummer extensions (and Hermitian function fields in particular). Our primary tool is explicitly constructing non-special divisors of degrees and on certain families of function fields with many rational places, accomplished by appealing to Weierstrass semigroups. We provide explicit algebraic geometry codes with hulls of specified dimensions, producing along the way linear complementary dual (LCD) algebraic geometric codes from the Hermitian function field (among others) using only rational places and an answer to an open question posed by Ballet and Le Brigand for particular function fields. These results complement earlier work by Mesnager, Tang, and Qi that use lower-genus function fields as well as instances using places of a higher degree from Hermitian function fields to construct LCD codes and that of Carlet, Mesnager, Tang, Qi, and Pellikaan to provide explicit algebraic geometry codes with the LCD property rather than obtaining codes via monomial equivalences.},

We prove that a directed version of the moralization operation applied to the graphical representation of a context-specific model does not affect the implied independence relations, thus affirming that these models are algebraically described by a finite collection of decomposable graphical models. More generally, we establish that several algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric properties of decomposable context-specific models generalize those of decomposable graphical models to the context-specific setting.},

Over the past several decades, algebraic geometry has provided innovative approaches to biological experimental design that resolved theoretical questions and improved computational efficiency. However, guaranteeing uniqueness and perfect recovery of models are still open problems. In this work, we study the problem of uniqueness of wiring diagrams. We use as a modeling framework polynomial dynamical systems and utilize the correspondence between simplicial complexes and square-free monomial ideals from Stanley–Reisner theory to develop theory and construct an algorithm for identifying input data sets that are guaranteed to correspond to a unique minimal wiring diagram regardless of the experimental output. We apply the results on a tumor-suppression network mediated by epidermal-derived growth factor receptor and demonstrate how careful experimental design decisions can lead to a unique minimal wiring diagram identification. One of the insights of the theoretical work is the connection between the uniqueness of a wiring diagram for a given and the uniqueness of the reduced Gröbner basis of the ideal of polynomials that vanish on , . We discuss existing results and introduce a new necessary condition on the points in for uniqueness of the reduced Gröbner basis of . These results also point to the importance of the relative proximity of the experimental input points on the number of minimal wiring diagrams, which we then study computationally. We find that there is a concrete heuristic way to generate data that tends to result in fewer minimal wiring diagrams.},

Physical distance constraints within the material transform into quadratic polynomial constraints via the Euclidean distance between two points, enabling associated numerical strategies for finding feasible configurations and deformation pathways. When adding elastic elements, the resulting material is called a tensegrity framework and can be used to model curvilinear cylinder packings. In this paper, we build the necessary geometric formulations to robustly transform rod packings to tensegrity frameworks, leading to a nonlinear optimization problem with polynomial constraints. Since the constraints are smooth almost everywhere, techniques from Riemannian optimization become admissible, allowing us to provide numerical strategies for exploring the deformative behavior of two exemplary 3-periodic cylinder packings. As a result of this investigation, we are able to show that the structures are auxetic by multiple definitions, intuitively meaning that when expanded in a fixed direction, these materials also expand in their lateral directions.},

Using Weyl’s tube formula, we turn this question into a differential geometric one involving the study of metric invariants of the real Veronese variety. More precisely, we give an explicit formula for its reach and curvature coefficients with respect to the Bombieri–Weyl metric. These results are obtained using techniques from random matrix theory and an explicit description of the second fundamental form of the Veronese variety in terms of Gaussian orthogonal ensemble matrices. Our findings give a complete solution to the original problem. In the case of rational normal curves it leads to a simple formula describing explicitly exponential decay with respect to the degree of the tensor.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce harmonic persistent homology spaces for filtrations of finite simplicial complexes. As a result, we can associate concrete subspaces of cycles to each bar of the barcode of the filtration. We prove stability of the harmonic persistent homology subspaces as well as the subspaces associated to the bars of the barcodes under small perturbations of functions defining them. We relate the notion of “essential simplices” introduced in an earlier work to identify simplices which play a significant role in the birth of a bar with that of harmonic persistent homology. We prove that the harmonic representatives of simple bars maximize the “relative essential content” among all representatives of the bar, where the relative essential content is the weight a particular cycle puts on the set of essential simplices.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Coupled cluster theory produced arguably the most widely used high-accuracy computational quantum chemistry methods. Despite the approach’s overall great computational success, its mathematical understanding is so far limited to results within the realm of functional analysis. The coupled cluster amplitudes, which are the targeted objects in coupled cluster theory, correspond to solutions to the coupled cluster equations, which is a system of polynomial equations of at most degree four. The high dimensionality of the electronic Schrödinger equation and the nonlinearity of the coupled cluster ansatz have so far stalled a formal analysis of this polynomial system. In this article, we present algebraic investigations that shed light on the coupled cluster equations and the root structure of this ansatz. This is of importance for the a posteriori evaluation of coupled cluster calculations. To that end, we investigate the root structure by means of Newton polytopes. We derive a general v-description, which is subsequently turned into an h-description for explicit examples. This perspective reveals an apparent connection between Pauli’s exclusion principle and the geometrical structure of the Newton polytopes. We also propose an alternative characterization of the coupled cluster equations projected onto singles and doubles as cubic polynomials on an algebraic variety with certain sparsity patterns. Moreover, we provide numerical simulations of two computationally tractable systems, namely, the two electrons in four spin-orbitals system and the three electrons in six spin-orbitals system. These simulations provide novel insight into the root structure of the coupled cluster solutions when the coupled cluster ansatz is truncated.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A model of genomic sequence evolution on a species tree should include not only a sequence substitution process, but also a coalescent process, since different sites may evolve on different gene trees due to incomplete lineage sorting. Chifman and Kubatko initiated the study of such models, leading to the development of the SVDquartets methods of species tree inference. A key observation was that symmetries in an ultrametric species tree led to symmetries in the joint distribution of bases at the taxa. In this work, we explore the implications of such symmetry more fully, defining new models incorporating only the symmetries of this distribution, regardless of the mechanism that might have produced them. The models are thus supermodels of many standard ones with mechanistic parameterizations. We study phylogenetic invariants for the models and establish identifiability of species tree topologies using them.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multigraded Betti numbers are one of the simplest invariants of multiparameter persistence modules. This invariant is useful in theory—it completely determines the Hilbert function of the module and the isomorphism type of the free modules in its minimal free resolution—as well as in practice—it is easy to visualize, and it is one of the main outputs of current multiparameter persistent homology software, such as RIVET. However, to the best of our knowledge, no stability result with respect to the interleaving distance has been established for this invariant so far, and this potential lack of stability limits its practical applications. We prove a stability result for multigraded Betti numbers, using an efficiently computable bottleneck-type dissimilarity function we introduce. Our notion of matching is inspired by recent work on signed barcodes and allows matching bars of the same module in homological degrees of different parity, in addition to matchings bars of different modules in homological degrees of the same parity. Our stability result is a combination of Hilbert’s syzygy theorem, Bjerkevik’s bottleneck stability for free modules, and a novel stability result for projective resolutions. We also prove, in the two-parameter case, a 1-Wasserstein stability result for Hilbert functions with respect to the 1-presentation distance of Bjerkevik and Lesnick.},

We derive the reduced necessary conditions in the case of Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant metric, and study the artificial potential design in the special case that the Lie group admits a bi-invariant metric. We repeated this analysis for Riemannian homogeneous spaces, where we derive the reduced equations by considering an alternative variational problem written in terms of a connection on the horizontal bundle of the underlying Lie group. We study the artificial potential design in the case that the underlying Lie group admits a bi-invariant metric, and consider the special case that the homogeneous space is in fact a Riemannian symmetric space. These ideas are applied to the obstacle avoidance task for a rigid body evolving on , and to derive reduced modified Riemannian cubics on the unit sphere .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The Positivstellensätze of Putinar and Schmüdgen show that any polynomial positive on a compact semialgebraic set can be represented using sums of squares. Recently, there has been great interest in proving effective versions of these results, namely to show bounds on the required degree of the sums of squares in such representations. These effective Positivstellensätze have direct implications for the convergence rate of the celebrated moment-SOS hierarchy in polynomial optimization. In this paper, we restrict to the fundamental case of the hypercube . We show an upper degree bound for Putinar-type representations on of the order , where , are the maximum and minimum of on , respectively. Previously, specialized results of this kind were available only for Schmüdgen-type representations and not for Putinar-type ones. Complementing this upper degree bound, we show a lower degree bound in . This is the first lower bound for Putinar-type representations on a semialgebraic set with nonempty interior described by a standard set of inequalities.},
