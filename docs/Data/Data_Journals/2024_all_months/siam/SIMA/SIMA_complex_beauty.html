Such waves exist only in the weak surface tension regime and are necessarily bimodal; they are located at double bifurcation points satisfying a certain symmetry breaking condition. Our bifurcation argument is an extension of the one applied by Ehrnström et al. in [Water Waves, 1 (2019), pp. 275–313] to find symmetric waves: Here, two additional scalar equations arise. Combining the variational structure of our problem with its translation symmetry, we show that these two additional equations are in fact linearly dependent and can (at “symmetry breaking” bifurcation points) be solved by incorporating the surface tension as a bifurcation parameter. Contrary to the symmetric case, only very specific modal pairs give rise to (small) asymmetrical periodic waves and we here provide a partial characterization of such pairs.},

We combine these estimates with existing literature on global well-posedness for regular data to extend the well-posedness theory to small data with arbitrarily close to . The threshold agrees with previous work on conditional regularity for the Landau equation in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In light of the monotonicity of the Fisher information shown in the recent preprint (arXiv:2311.09420), our primary nonlinear regularization estimate holds even in the far-from-equilibrium regime. As a consequence, we obtain exponential convergence to equilibrium for suitably localized solutions in every Sobolev norm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove global well-posedness of the ocean primitive equations coupled to advection-diffusion equations of the oceanic tracers temperature and salinity that are supplemented by the eddy parametrization model due to Gent, McWilliams, and Redi. This parametrization forms a milestone in global ocean modeling and constitutes a central part of any general ocean circulation model computation. The eddy parametrization adds a secondary transport velocity to the tracer equation and renders the original Laplacian operators in the advection-diffusion equations nonlinear, with a diffusion matrix that depends via the equation of state in a nonlinear fashion on both tracers simultaneously. The eddy parametrization of Gent, McWilliams, and Redi augments the complexity of the mathematical analysis of the whole system which we present here. We show first that weak solutions exist globally in time, provided the parametrization uses a regularized density. Then we prove by a detailed analysis of the eddy operators the global well-posedness. Our results apply also to the “small-slope approximation” that is commonly used in global ocean simulations.},

To construct solutions we resort to approximation in terms of viscous evolutions, where viscosity affects both damage and plasticity with the same rate. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the available estimates do not provide sufficient regularity on the limiting evolutions to guarantee that forces and velocities are in a duality pairing, and hence we cannot use a chain rule for the driving energy. Nonetheless, via careful techniques we can characterize the limiting rate-independent evolution by means of an energy-dissipation balance, which encodes the onset of viscous effects in the behavior of the system at jumps.},

This modified energy is the sum of the neo-Hookean energy and a term penalizing the singularities of the inverse deformation. The new functional attains its minimum in the larger space, so the initial question of existence of minimizers of the neo-Hookean energy is thus transformed into a question of regularity of minimizers of this new energy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The inverse optimal transport problem is to find the underlying cost function from the knowledge of optimal transport plans. While this amounts to solving a linear inverse problem, in this work we will be concerned with the nonlinear inverse problem to identify the cost function when only a set of marginals and its corresponding optimal values are given. We focus on absolutely continuous probability distributions with respect to the -dimensional Lebesgue measure and classes of concave and convex cost functions. Our main result implies that the cost function is uniquely determined from the union of the ranges of the gradients of the optimal potentials. Since, in general, the optimal potentials may not be observed, we derive sufficient conditions for their identifiability—if an open set of marginals is observed, the optimal potentials are then identified via the value of the optimal costs. We conclude with a more in-depth study of this problem in the univariate case, where an explicit representation of the transport plan is available. Here, we link the notion of identifiability of the cost function with that of statistical completeness.},

A system of degenerate drift–diffusion equations for the electron, hole, and oxygen vacancy densities, coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric potential, is analyzed in a three-dimensional bounded domain with mixed Dirichlet–Neumann boundary conditions. The equations model the dynamics of the charge carriers in a memristor device in the high-density regime. Memristors can be seen as nonlinear resistors with memory, mimicking the conductance response of biological synapses. The global existence of weak solutions and the weak–strong uniqueness property is proved. Thanks to the degenerate diffusion, better regularity results compared to linear diffusion can be shown, in particular, the boundedness of the solutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The feasibility of extrapolation of completely monotone functions can be quantified by examining the worst-case scenario, whereby a pair of completely monotone functions agree on a given interval to a given relative precision, but differ as much as it is theoretically possible at a given point. We show that extrapolation is impossible to the left of the interval, while the maximal discrepancy to the right exhibits a power law typical for extrapolation of similar classes of complex analytic functions. The power law exponent is derived explicitly and shows a precipitous drop immediately beyond the right end-point, with a subsequent decay to zero inversely proportional to the distance from the interval. The local extrapolation problem, where the worst discrepancy from a given completely monotone function is sought, is also analyzed. In this case explicit and easily verifiable optimality conditions are derived, enabling us to solve the problem exactly for a single decaying exponential. In the general case, our approach leads to a natural algorithm for computing solutions to the local extrapolation problem numerically. The methods developed in this paper can easily be adapted to other classes of analytic functions represented as integral transforms of positive measures with analytic kernels.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The celebrated experiment of Tuval et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 102 (2005), pp. 2277–2282] showed that the bacteria living a water drop can form a thin layer near the air-water interface, where a so-called chemotaxis-fluid system with physical boundary conditions was proposed to interpret the mechanism underlying the pattern formation alongside numerical simulations. However, the rigorous proof for the existence and convergence of the boundary layer solutions to the proposed model still remains open. This paper shows that the model with physical boundary conditions proposed by Tuval et al. in one dimension can generate a boundary layer solution as the oxygen diffusion rate is small. Specifically, we show that the solution of the model with will converge to the solution with (outer-layer solution) plus the boundary layer profiles (inner-layer solution) with a sharp transition near the boundary as . There are two major difficulties in our analysis. First, the global well-posedness of the model is hard to prove since the Dirichlet boundary condition cannot contribute to the gradient estimates needed for the cross-diffusion structure in the model. Resorting to the technique of taking the antiderivative, we remove the cross-diffusion structure such that the Dirichlet boundary condition can facilitate the needed estimates. Second, the outer-layer profile of bacterial density is required to be degenerate at the boundary as , which incapacitates the traditional cancellation technique. Here we employ the Hardy inequality and delicate weighted energy estimates to overcome this obstacle and derive the requisite uniform-in- estimates allowing us to pass the limit to achieve our results.},

For this system we prove existence of three-dimensional steady gravity-capillary waves with nonzero vorticity. We obtain nonzero vorticity by prescribing the relative velocity fields to be Beltrami fields, for which the vorticity and velocity are parallel. The main result is a multiparameter bifurcation result for small amplitude waves given in two variants: a first theorem guaranteeing existence under some general parameter assumptions, and a second specific but less exhaustive theorem, for which the assumptions may be explicitly verified, yielding the existence of both in-phase and off-phase motions in the different layers. The proof relies on an implicit function theorem corresponding to multiparameter bifurcation. This theorem is presented in an appendix as an abstract result that can be applied directly to other problems.},

This article considers the case where the structure can have unrestricted displacement and explores the Navier-slip boundary condition imposed at the fluid-structure interface, displacement of which is not known a priori and is a part of the solution itself. The proof takes a time-discretization approach based on a Lie splitting scheme. The geometric nonlinearity stemming from the nonlinear coupling, the possibility of random fluid domain degeneracy, the potential jumps in the tangential components of the fluid and structure velocities at the moving interface, and the low regularity of the structure velocity require the development of new techniques that lead to the local-in-time existence of analytically weak martingale solutions.},

Liquid crystal elastomers are special cross-linked polymer materials combining the large elastic deformability of elastomers with the orientational orders of liquid crystals. This model exhibits markedly different phenomena from the liquid crystal model due to the strong coupling between mechanical elastic deformation and orientation vector. Our results are threefold. (i) First we derive the hydrodynamics of liquid crystal elastomers with inertial effect by an energetic variational approach inspired by Liu [An introduction of elastic complex fluids: An energetic variational approach, in Multi-scale Phenomena in Complex Fluids, Contemp. Appl. Math. CAM 12, World Scientific, Singapore, 2009, pp. 286–337]. (ii) Then we study the hyperbolic liquid crystal elastomers from a mathematical perspective, which is a fully quasilinear hyperbolic system. The local well-posedness for large data is proved by a zero-viscosity limit method. (iii) Finally, we show the global regularity for small and smooth initial data near the constant equilibrium in three dimensions, which is achieved by carefully investigating the structure of second-order material derivatives and the cancellations in the system. This is the first global result on hyperbolic liquid crystal elastomers.},

Based on the analysis of -convergence, we prove that the Dirichlet boundary condition can be correctly imposed in a nonlocal diffusion model in the sense of -convergence as long as the penalty term satisfies a few mild conditions.

The analysis accounts for both symmetric and antisymmetric exchange. Our result is twofold. First, we extend the Bourgain–Brezis–Mironescu formula to encompass the scenario where antisymmetric contributions are encoded into the energy. Second, we prove that, under physically relevant assumptions on the families of exchange kernels, the family of nonlocal functionals gamma-converges to their local counterparts. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain a rigorous justification of Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions in chiral magnets under the form commonly adopted in the variational theory of micromagnetism when modeling antisymmetric exchange interactions.},

For the case of , after showing the boundedness of the density by using the divergence form, we prove the convergence of the solutions to their nontrivial asymptotic states with the convergence order in the -sense. In order to overcome the degeneracy caused by the critical sonic boundary, we introduce an inverse transform as a technical tool to remove the second-order degeneracy, and observe the advantage of a first-order degeneracy due to the monotonicity of this transformation. Moreover, when with different boundary values, where the boundary layers appear, we show the strong convergence order or for different boundary cases. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the boundary layer, we propose a new technique in asymptotic limit analysis and identify the width of the boundary layers as . These new proposed methods develop and improve upon the existing studies. Finally, a series of numerical simulations are conducted, which corroborate our theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the formation of boundary layers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider a family of boundary integral operators supported on a collection of parametrically defined bounded Lipschitz boundaries. Consequently, the boundary integral operators themselves also depend on the parametric variables, thus leading to a parameter-to-operator map. The main result of this article is to establish the analytic or holomorphic dependence of said boundary integral operators upon the parametric variables, i.e., of the parameter-to-operator map. As a direct consequence we also establish holomorphic dependence of solutions to boundary integral equations, i.e., holomorphy of the parameter-to-solution map. To this end, we construct a holomorphic extension to complex-valued boundary deformations and investigate the complex Fréchet differentiability of boundary integral operators with respect to each parametric variable. The established parametric holomorphy results have been identified as a key property to overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality in the approximation of parametric maps with distributed, high-dimensional inputs. To demonstrate the applicability of the derived results, we consider as a concrete example the sound-soft Helmholtz acoustic scattering problem and its frequency-robust boundary integral formulations. For this particular application, we explore the consequences of our results in reduced order modelling, Bayesian shape inversion, and the construction of efficient surrogates using artificial neural networks.},

The running and terminal costs are assumed to be continuous in each edge but not necessarily globally continuous on the network. A Lagrangian formulation is proposed and studied. It leads to relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. The existence of such relaxed equilibria is obtained. The proof requires the existence of optimal trajectories and a closed graph property for the map which associates with each point the set of optimal trajectories starting from that point. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution of the mean field game, i.e., a pair made of the value function of a related optimal control problem, and a family of probability measures on the network. Given , the value function is a viscosity solution of a Hamilton–Jacobi problem on the network. Regularity properties of and a weak form of a continuity equation satisfied by are investigated.},

We consider the initial-boundary value problem for an incompressible Oldroyd-B model with stress diffusion in a two-dimensional upper half plane which describes the motion of viscoelastic polymeric fluids. From a physical point of view, the diffusive coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller than other parameters in the model and is usually assumed to be zero. However, the link between the diffusive model and the standard one (zero diffusion) via the vanishing diffusion limit is still unknown, in particular for the initial-boundary value problem. Some numerical results [L. Chupin and S. Martin, J. Non-Newton. Fluid Mech., 218885 (2015), pp. 27–39] suggest that this should be true.

Then we show that harmonic fields which are harmonic in a proper neighborhood of the underlying plasma domain can in fact be approximated in any -norm by elements of the image of the Biot–Savart operator. In the second part of this work we establish an explicit isomorphism between the space of harmonic Neumann fields and the kernel of the Biot–Savart operator which in particular implies that the dimension of the kernel of the Biot–Savart operator coincides with the genus of the CWS and hence turns out to be a homotopy invariant among regular domains in 3-space.

First, it is difficult to establish its relation to physics, in particular a variational model. Second, it lacks uniqueness. The former has been recently studied within the realm of BV theory. The latter only holds under various simplifications. This article introduces a pseudo-parabolic version of the KWC system. A direct relationship with variational model (as gradient flow) and uniqueness are established without making any unrealistic simplifications. Namely, this is the first KWC system which is both physically and mathematically valid. The proposed model overcomes the well-known open issues.},

In this work, we consider steady rarefied flows arising from the evaporation and condensation process between two parallel condensed phases, which is formulated in this paper as the existence problem of stationary solutions to the ES-BGK model in a bounded interval with the mixed boundary conditions. One of the key difficulties arises in the uniform control of the temperature tensor from below. In the noncritical case , we utilize the property that the temperature tensor is equivalent to the temperature. In the critical case, where such equivalence relation breaks down, we observe that the size of bulk velocity in the direction can be controlled by the discrepancy of boundary flux, which enables one to bound the temperature tensor from below.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns subsonic jet flows from two-dimensional finitely long divergent nozzles with straight solid walls, which are governed by a free boundary problem for a quasilinear elliptic equation. It is assumed that the angle of the nozzle and the location of the inlet are fixed, while the length of the nozzle is free. For a given surrounding pressure and a given incoming mass flux, it is shown that there is a critical number not greater than for the angle of the nozzle such that there exists a unique subsonic jet flow if the angle of the nozzle is less than the critical number. If this critical number is less than , then there is not a subsonic jet flow when the angle of the nozzle takes this critical number; furthermore, as the angle of the nozzle tends to this critical number, either the length of the nozzle tends to zero, or a sonic point will occur at the inlet. Moreover, it is shown that the subsonic jet flow tends to a uniform horizontal flow exponentially at the downstream. As to the jet, it is smooth away from the connecting point with the wall of the nozzle, and it connects the wall of the nozzle with regularity for each exponent . Furthermore, the jet is strictly concave to the fluid and tends to a line parallel to the symmetrical axis exponentially.},

We justify that they are related to controlled local or nonlocal diffusions, and more generally in our setting, to a new control interpretation involving time change rates of stochastic (Lévy) processes. The main results are the existence and uniqueness of solutions under general assumptions. These results are applied to nondegenerate equations—including both local second-order and nonlocal with fractional Laplacians. Uniqueness holds under the monotonicity of couplings and convexity of the Hamiltonian, but neither monotonicity nor convexity need to be strict.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The two-dimensional stochastic Euler equations (EEs) perturbed by a linear multiplicative noise of Itô type on the bounded domain have been considered in this work. Our first aim is to prove the existence of global weak (analytic) solutions for stochastic EEs when the divergence-free initial data , and the external forcing . In order to prove the existence of weak solutions, a vanishing viscosity technique has been adopted. In addition, if and , we establish that the global weak (analytic) solution is unique. This work appears to be the first one to discuss the existence and uniqueness of global weak (analytic) solutions for stochastic EEs driven by linear multiplicative noise. Second, we prove the existence of a pullback stochastic weak attractor for stochastic nonautonomous EEs using the abstract theory available in the literature. Finally, we propose an abstract theory for weak asymptotic autonomy of pullback stochastic weak attractors. Then we consider the 2D stochastic EEs perturbed by a linear multiplicative noise as an example to discuss how to prove the weak asymptotic autonomy for concrete stochastic partial differential equations. As EEs do not contain any dissipative term, the results on attractors (deterministic and stochastic) are available in the literature for dissipative (or damped) EEs only. Since we are considering stochastic EEs without dissipation, all the results of this work for 2D stochastic EEs perturbed by a linear multiplicative noise are totally new.},

We are especially concerned with studying the behavior of perturbations of discontinuous waves. On the one hand, we show that singularities form in the unweighted Lipschitz norm on both sides of the shock for both models, extending classical results of John in [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 27 (1974), pp. 377–405] and Liu in [J. Differential Equations, 33 (1979), pp. 92–111] to suitable variable coefficient systems This involves adapting John’s argument to perturbations of nonconstant waves instead of perturbations of constants. On the other hand, we show instability in exponentially weighted Sobolev spaces for ZND and stability for the Majda model in similarly weighted spaces. This involves proving high order energy estimates, using convective effects and the partial decay coming from a damping term, while being careful with the boundary terms. We note that the convective effects are the origin of the instability in the weighted norm in the ZND model.},

Moreover, for less nonlinear flux, the solution still has a fractional regularity . The resulting general rule is that the regularity of entropy solutions for a discontinuous flux is less than for a smooth flux.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study a diffuse interface model describing the complex rheology and the interfacial dynamics during phase separation in a polar liquid-crystalline emulsion. More precisely, the physical systems comprises a two-phase mixture consisting of a polar liquid crystal immersed in a Newtonian fluid. Such composite material is a paradigmatic example of complex fluids arising in Soft Matter which exhibits multiscale interplay. Beyond the Ginzburg–Landau and Frank elastic energies for the concentration and the polarization, the free energy of the system is characterized by a quadratic anchoring term which tunes the orientation of the polarization at the interface. This leads to several quasi-linear nonlinear couplings in the resulting system describing the macroscopic dynamics. In this work, we establish the first mathematical results concerning the global dynamics of two-phase complex fluids with interfacial anchoring mechanism. First, we determine a set of sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions which guarantee the existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions. Second, we show that weak solutions are unique and globally regular in the two dimensional case. Finally, we complement our analysis with some numerical simulations to display polarization and interfacial anchoring.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Reactions with enzymes are critical in biochemistry, where the enzymes act as a catalyst in the process. One of the most widely used mechanisms for modeling enzyme-catalyzed reactions is the Michaelis–Menten (MM) kinetics. On the ODE level, i.e., when concentrations are only time-dependent, this kinetics can be rigorously derived from mass action law using quasi-steady-state approximation. This issue in the PDE setting, for instance, when molecular diffusion is taken into account, is considerably more challenging, and only formal derivations have been established. In this paper, we prove this derivation rigorously and obtain MM kinetics in the presence of slow spatial diffusion. In particular, we show in this case that, in general, the reduced problem is a cross-diffusion-reaction system. Our proof is based on an improved duality method, heat regularization, and a suitable modified energy function. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous derivation of MM kinetics from mass action kinetics in the PDE setting.},

The norm inflation is quantified from below by an explicit lower bound which depends on time and the size of the data and is valid for small times.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a classical imaging technique to reconstruct the mass distribution of a radioactive material. If the mass distribution is static, this essentially leads to inversion of the X-ray transform. However, if the mass distribution changes temporally, the measurement signals received over time (the so-called listmode data) belong to different spatial configurations. We suggest and analyze a Bayesian approach to solve this dynamic inverse problem that is based on optimal transport regularization of the temporally changing mass distribution. Our focus lies on a rigorous derivation of the Bayesian model and the analysis of its properties, treating both the continuous as well as the discrete (finitely many detectors and time binning) setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the theory of viscoelasticity, an important class of models admits a representation in terms of springs and dashpots. Widely used members of this class are the Maxwell model and its extended version. This paper concerns resolvent estimates for the system of equations for the anisotropic, extended Maxwell model (EMM) and its marginal model; special attention is paid to the introduction of augmented variables. This leads to the augmented system that will also be referred to as the “original” system. A reduced system is then formed which encodes essentially the EMM; it is a closed system with respect to the particle velocity and the difference between the elastic and viscous strains. Based on resolvent estimates, it is shown that the original and reduced systems generate -groups and the reduced system generates a -semigroup of contraction. Naturally, the EMM can be written in an integro-differential form with a relaxation tensor. However, there is a difference between the original and integro-differential systems, in general, with consequences for whether their solutions generate semigroups or not. Finally, an energy estimate is obtained for the reduced system, and it is proven that its solutions decay exponentially as time tends to infinity. The limiting amplitude principle follows readily from these two results.},

Under a monotonicity assumption we can also prove uniqueness of the limit solution, even though this remains an open question in full generality. We also consider a geometric evolution corresponding to the -gradient flow of the anisotropic perimeter. When the initial set is convex, we show that the limit solution is monotone for the inclusion, convex, and unique until it reaches the Cheeger set of the initial datum. Eventually, we show with some examples that uniqueness cannot be expected, in general, in the geometric case.},

In a first step, we show how the problem generally reduces to the derivation of specific frequency-restricted estimates, which are multiplier estimates in the spatial frequency alone.

This paper concerns the asymmetric transport observed along interfaces separating two-dimensional bulk topological insulators modeled by (continuous) differential Hamiltonians and how such asymmetry persists after numerical discretization. We first demonstrate that a relevant edge current observable is quantized and robust to perturbations for a large class of elliptic Hamiltonians. We then establish a bulk edge correspondence stating that the observable equals an integer-valued bulk difference invariant depending solely on the bulk phases. We next show how to extend such results to periodized Hamiltonians amenable to standard numerical discretizations. A form of no-go theorem implies that the asymmetric transport of periodized Hamiltonians necessarily vanishes. We introduce a filtered version of the edge current observable and show that it is approximately stable against perturbations and converges to its quantized limit as the size of the computational domain increases. To illustrate the theoretical results, we finally present numerical simulations that approximate the infinite domain edge current with high accuracy and show that it is approximately quantized even in the presence of perturbations.},

However, we show that this is not quite true in general. Actually, we derive the precise formula for the location of maximal norm of gradient of torsion function on nearly ball domains in , which displays nonlocal nature and thus does not inherently establish a connection to the aforementioned two types of points. Consequently, explicit counterexamples can be straightforwardly constructed to illustrate this deviation from conventional understanding.

As an application, we obtain nonperturbative results about the free-surface Rayleigh–Taylor instability, for any nonzero initial data. We also derive exact virial identities involving higher order energies. We illustrate these results by an explicit computation for standing waves.

The motivation for our study stems from mathematical physics and statistical mechanics, for example, Langevin dynamics and stochastic acceleration in a random environment. Our aim is to carry out asymptotic analysis to establish large deviations principles. Our focus is on obtaining the desired results for systems under weaker conditions. When the fast-varying process is a diffusion, neither Lipschitz continuity nor linear growth needs to be assumed. Our approach is based on combinations of the intuition from Smoluchowski–Kramers approximation and the methods initiated in [A. A. Puhalskii, Ann. Probab., 44 (2016), pp. 3111–3186] relying on the concepts of relatively large deviations compactness and the identification of rate functions. When the fast-varying process is under a general setup with no specified structure, the paper establishes the large deviations principle of the underlying system under the assumption on the local large deviations principles of the corresponding first-order system.},

In this paper, we study the Lipschitz continuous dependence of conservative Hölder continuous weak solutions to a variational wave system derived from a model for nematic liquid crystals. Since the solution of this system generally forms a finite time cusp singularity, the solution flow is not Lipschitz continuous under the Sobolev metric used in the existence and uniqueness theory. We establish a Finsler type optimal transport metric, and show the Lipschitz continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data under this metric. This kind of Finsler type optimal transport metrics was first established in [A. Bressan and G. Chen, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 226 (2017), pp. 1303-1343] for the scalar variational wave equation. This equation can be used to describe the unit direction of mean orientation of nematic liquid crystals, when is restricted on a circle. The model considered in this paper describes the propagation of without this restriction, i.e. , takes any value on the unit sphere. So we need to consider a wave system instead of a scalar equation.},

We first show that the static MFG with such a cost has an equilibrium, and we build from it a solution of the ergodic MFG system of first order PDEs with the same cost. Next we address the long-time limit of the solutions to finite horizon MFGs with cost functional satisfying various additional assumptions, but not the classical Lasry–Lions monotonicity condition. Instead we assume that the cost has the same set of minima for all measures describing the population. We prove the convergence of the distribution of the agents and of the value function to a solution of the ergodic MFG system as the horizon of the game tends to infinity, extending to this class of MFGs some results of weak KAM theory.},

Its formal Riemannian structure allows for a local linearization via a tangent space approximation. This in turn leads to a reduction of computational complexity and simplifies combination with other methods that require a linear structure. Recently this approach has been extended to the unbalanced Hellinger–Kantorovich (HK) distance. In this article we further extend the framework in various ways, including measures on manifolds, the spherical HK distance, a study of the consistency of discretization via the barycentric projection, and the continuity properties of the logarithmic map for the HK distance.},

This work investigates the well-posedness and optimal control of a sixth-order Cahn–Hilliard equation, a higher-order variant of the celebrated and well-established Cahn–Hilliard equation. The equation is endowed with a source term, where the control variable enters as a distributed mass regulator. The inclusion of additional spatial derivatives in the sixth-order formulation enables the model to capture curvature effects, leading to a more accurate depiction of isothermal phase separation dynamics in complex materials systems. We provide a well-posedness result for the aforementioned system when the corresponding nonlinearity of double-well shape is regular and then analyze a corresponding optimal control problem. For the latter, existence of optimal controls is established, and the first-order necessary optimality conditions are characterized via a suitable variational inequality. These results aim at contributing to improving the understanding of the mathematical properties and control aspects of the sixth-order Cahn–Hilliard equation, offering potential applications in the design and optimization of materials with tailored microstructures and properties.},

The proofs are based on maximal regularity techniques, positivity results, and sharp blow-up criteria developed in our recent works, combined with energy estimates based on Itô’s formula and stochastic Gronwall inequalities.

Zero retardation results in zero dissipation in the velocity equation, which is the main difficulty that prevents us from obtaining the long time well-posedness of solutions. Through dedicated analysis, we find that the linearized equations of this model have damping effects, which ensure the global-in-time existence of small data solutions. However, the nonlinear quadratic terms have one more order derivative than the linear part and no good structure is discovered to overcome this derivative loss problem. So we can only build the result in the analytical energy space rather than Sobolev space with finite order derivatives.},

To overcome difficulties caused by the radiation, inspired by [J. Li and Z. L. Liang, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 220 (2016), pp. 1195–1208; J. H. Zhang and H. J. Zhao, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 55 (2023), pp. 6229–6261], we construct a pointwise estimate between the radiative heat flux and the temperature; then we can establish the desired basic energy estimate by considering that the temperature has lower and upper bounds separately. And once that is obtained, the main result is proved by employing the elementary energy methods.},

Our results will be used in a companion work to propose a conjecture and prove partial results concerning the asymptotic mutual information in the assortative stochastic block model in the sparse regime. The equation we consider is naturally stated in terms of the Gateaux derivative of the solution, unlike previous works in which the derivative is usually of transport type. We introduce an approximating family of finite-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi equations and use the monotonicity of the nonlinearity to show that no boundary condition needs to be prescribed to establish well-posedness. The solution to the infinite-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi equation is then defined as the limit of these approximating solutions. In the special setting of a convex nonlinearity, we also provide a Hopf–Lax variational representation of the solution.},

We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham–Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal -gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.},

Moreover, in the case where lower order dispersion is absent, we prove the existence of a critical mass number that sharply determines the -dependence of the deduced ground states. In the mixed dispersion case, we encounter a major challenge as the BNLS is no longer scale-invariant and the arguments from [Terracini, Tzvetkov, and Visciglia, Anal. PDE, 7 (2014), pp. 73–96] for determining the sharp -dependence of the ground states fail. The main novelty of the present paper is to address this difficult and interesting issue: Using a different scaling argument, we show that -independence of ground states with small mass still holds in the case and . Additionally, we also prove that ground states with sufficiently large mass must possess nontrivial -dependence by appealing to some novel construction of test functions.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We shall prove the global existence of weak solutions to an initial boundary value problem for a novel phase-field model which is an elliptic-parabolic coupled system. This model is proposed as an attempt to describe the motion of grain boundaries, a type of interface motion by interface diffusion driven by bulk free energy in elastically deformable solids. Its applications include important processes arising in materials science, e.g., sintering. In this model the evolution equation for an order parameter is a nonuniformly, degenerate parabolic equation of fourth order, which differs from the Cahn–Hilliard equation by a nonsmooth term of the gradient of the unknown.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Laplace learning is a popular machine learning algorithm for finding missing labels from a small number of labeled feature vectors using the geometry of a graph. More precisely, Laplace learning is based on minimizing a graph-Dirichlet energy, equivalently a discrete Sobolev seminorm, constrained to taking the values of known labels on a given subset. The variational problem is asymptotically ill-posed as the number of unlabeled feature vectors goes to infinity for finite given labels due to a lack of regularity in minimizers of the continuum Dirichlet energy in any dimension higher than one. In particular, continuum minimizers are not continuous. One solution is to consider higher-order regularization, which is the analogue of minimizing Sobolev seminorms. In this paper we consider the asymptotics of minimizing a graph variant of the Sobolev seminorm with pointwise constraints. We show that, as expected, one needs , where is the dimension of the data manifold. We also show that there must be an upper bound on the connectivity of the graph; that is, highly connected graphs lead to degenerate behavior of the minimizer even when .},

We show the existence of minimizers for nonlocal variational problems with classically defined, local boundary constraints, together with the variational convergence of these functionals to classical counterparts in the localization limit.

Further, as an application of our new results, we derive the uniform far-field asymptotics of the scattered field to the acoustic scattering problem by buried obstacles in a two-layered medium with a locally rough interface. The results obtained in this paper provide a theoretical foundation for our recent work, where direct imaging methods have been developed to image the locally rough interface from phaseless total-field data or phased far-field data at a fixed frequency.

Then we establish the monotonicity of principal eigenvalues with respect to the frequency and investigate the limiting properties of principal eigenvalues as the frequency tends to zero or infinity. We also study the effects of dispersal rates and dispersal ranges on the principal eigenvalues, and the difficulty is that principal eigenvalues of time-periodic cooperative systems with Neumann boundary conditions are not monotone with respect to the domain. Finally, we apply our theory to a man-environment-man epidemic model and consider the impacts of dispersal rates, frequency, and dispersal ranges on the basic reproduction number and positive time-periodic solutions.},

Moreover, the relative entropy around the original Riemann solution consisting of shock and rarefaction under the large perturbation is shown to be uniformly bounded by the framework developed in [M. J. Kang and A. F. Vasseur, Invent. Math., 224 (2021), pp. 55–146]. The proof contains two new ingredients: (1) a cut-off technique and the expanding property of rarefaction are used to overcome the errors generated by the viscosity related to inviscid rarefaction; (2) the error terms concerning the interactions between shock and rarefaction are controlled by the compressibility of shock, the decay of derivative of rarefaction, and the separation of shock and rarefaction as time increases.},

The wave properties of this interacting system are determined by the spectral properties of a matrix Hamiltonian, involving a nonlocal partial differential operator, acting on photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. We study the spectral problem via a reduction to a spectral problem for a scalar nonlocal operator, which depends nonlinearly on the spectral parameter. We investigate two classes of solutions: Bound states are solutions that decay at infinity, while resonance states have locally finite energy and satisfy a non–self-adjoint outgoing radiation condition at infinity. We have found necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bound states, along with an upper bound on the number of such states. We have also considered these problems for atomic models with small, high-contrast inclusions. In this setting, we have derived asymptotic formulas for the resonances. Our results are illustrated with numerical computations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the equilibrium configurations for several fluid-structure interaction problems. The fluid is confined in a 2D unbounded channel that contains a body, free to move inside the channel with rigid motions (transversal translations and rotations). The motion of the fluid is generated by a Poiseuille inflow/outflow at infinity and governed by the stationary Navier–Stokes equations. For a model where the fluid is the air and the body represents the cross-section of a suspension bridge, therefore also subject to restoring elastic forces, we prove that for small inflows there exists a unique equilibrium position, while for large inflows we numerically show the appearance of additional equilibria. A similar uniqueness result is also obtained for a discretized 3D bridge, consisting in a finite number of cross-sections interacting with the adjacent ones. The very same model, but without restoring forces, is used to describe the mechanism of the Leonardo da Vinci ferry, which is able to cross a river without engines. We numerically determine the optimal orientation of the ferry that allows it to cross the river in minimal time.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the scaling behavior of a class of compatible two-well problems for higher order, homogeneous linear differential operators. To this end, we first deduce general lower scaling bounds which are determined by the vanishing order of the symbol of the operator on the unit sphere in the direction of the associated element in the wave cone. We complement the lower bound estimates by a detailed analysis of the two-well problem for generalized (tensor-valued) symmetrized derivatives with the help of the (tensor-valued) Saint-Venant compatibility conditions. In two spatial dimensions for highly symmetric boundary data (but arbitrary tensor order ) we provide upper bound constructions matching the lower bound estimates. This illustrates that for the two-well problem for higher order operators new scaling laws emerge which are determined by the Fourier symbol in the direction of the wave cone. The scaling for the symmetrized gradient from [A. Chan and S. Conti, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 25 (2015), pp. 1091–1124] which was also discussed in [B. Raiță, A. Rüland, and C.

The previous studies mostly focus on equations posed on bounded domains since they rely on different compactness properties and the discreteness of the spectrum of the Laplacian. In the present paper, we consider the damped complex Ginzburg–Landau equation on the real line driven by a white-in-time noise. Under the assumption that the noise is sufficiently nondegenerate, we establish the uniqueness of stationary measure and exponential mixing in the dual-Lipschitz metric. The proof is based on coupling techniques combined with a generalization of Foiaş–Prodi estimate to the case of the real line and special space-time weighted estimates, which help to handle the behavior of solutions at infinity.},

This appears to be the first Lipschitz stability result for infinite-dimensional spaces of perturbations in the context of the (linearized) Calderón problem. Previous optimal estimates with respect to the operator norm of the data map have been of the logarithmic type in infinite-dimensional settings. The remarkable improvement is enabled by using the Hilbert–Schmidt norm for the Neumann-to-Dirichlet boundary map and its Fréchet derivative with respect to the conductivity coefficient. We also derive a direct reconstruction method that inductively yields the orthogonal projections of a general perturbation onto the spaces, hence reconstructing any perturbation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A new set of Hadamard series expansions for the Airy functions, and , is presented. Previous Hadamard expansions were defined in terms of an infinite number of integration path subdivisions. Unlike the earlier expansions, the expansions in the present work originate in the splitting of the steepest descent into a number of segments that is not only finite but very small, and these segments are defined on the basis of the location of the branch points. One of the segments reaches to infinity, and this gives rise to the presence of upper incomplete gamma functions. This is one of the most important differences from the Hadamard series as defined in the work of R.B. Paris, where all the incomplete gamma functions are of the lower type. The interest of the new series expansion is twofold. First, it shows how to convert an asymptotic series into a convergent one with a finite splitting of the steepest descent path in a process that can be named “exactification.” Second, the inverse of the phase function that is part of the Laplace-type integral is Taylor-expanded around branch points to produce Puiseux series when necessary. Regarding their computational application, these series expansions require a relatively small number of terms for each of them to reach a very high precision.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns the relaxation time limits for the one-dimensional steady hydrodynamic model of semiconductors in the form of Euler–Poisson equations with sonic or nonsonic boundary. The sonic boundary is the critical and difficult case because of the degeneracy at the boundary and the formation of the boundary layers. In order to avoid the degeneracy of the second order derivatives, we technically introduce an invertible transform to the working equation. This guarantees that the remaining one order degeneracy becomes a good term since the transform used here is strictly increasing. Then we efficiently overcome the degenerate effect. When the relaxation time , we first show the strong convergence of the approximate solutions to their asymptotic profiles in norm with the order . When , the boundary layer appears because the boundary data are not equal to each other, and we further derive the uniform error estimates of the approximate solutions to their background profiles in norm with the order or according to the different cases of boundary data. Unlike the methods adopted in the previous studies, we propose some altogether new techniques of the asymptotic limit analysis to successfully describe the width of the boundary layer, which is almost the order provided . These original approaches develop and improve the existing studies. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out, which confirm our theoretical study, in particular, the appearance of boundary layers.},

We illustrate this construction by several examples, including the Hughes model with affine cost (a variant of the original problem that is encompassed in the framework of El-Khatib, Goatin, and Rosini [Z. Angew. Math. Phys., 64 (2013), pp. 223–251]. Existence holds either with open-end boundary conditions or with boundary conditions corresponding to panic behavior with capacity drop at exits. Other examples put forward versions of the Hughes model with inertial dynamics of the turning curve and with general costs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The quasi-geostrohpic (QG) equation has been used to capture the asymptotic dynamics of the rotating stratified Boussinesq flows in the regime of strong stratification and rapid rotation. In this paper, we establish the invalidity of such approximation when the rotation-stratification ratio is either fixed to be unity or tends to unity sufficiently slowly in the asymptotic regime: the difference between the rotating stratified Boussinesq flow and the corresponding QG flow remains strictly away from zero, independently of the intensities of rotation and stratification. In contrast, we also show that the convergence occurs when the rotation-stratification ratio is fixed to be a number other than unity or converges to unity sufficiently fast. As a corollary, we compute a lower bound of the convergence rate, which blows up as the rotation-stratification ratio goes to unity.},

This is motivated by certain situations where a central planner of a deterministic controlled system has only imperfect information on the initial state of the system. The lack of information here is very specific. It is described by a Borel probability measure along which the initial state is distributed. We define a new notion of viscosity in this space by taking test functions that are directionally differentiable and can be written as a difference of two semiconvex functions. With this choice of test functions, we extend the notion of viscosity to Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations in Wasserstein spaces and we establish that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation in the Wasserstein space over .},

Such a structure typically appears when the stable state behind a Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovskii–Piskunov front destabilizes when going through an essential Turing bifurcation, giving rise to oscillating patterns. Despite the instability of both end-states, we obtain for the first time stability of such a structure against suitably localized perturbations, with algebraic temporal decay . To deal with the instability behind the front, we simultaneously control the error in two different norms. In the first norm, enhanced diffusive decay is obtained at a linear level through pointwise resolvent estimates. In the second norm, better suited for nonlinear analysis, we show that the error stays bounded in time by use of mode filters.},

As a consequence of our new analysis, we settle affirmatively an open problem of convergence toward Lagrangian solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation whose vorticity is unbounded ( for any fixed ). Moreover, we prove the convergence of kinetic vorticities toward the vorticity of the Lagrangian solution of the Euler equation.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper concerns the physical behaviors of any solutions to the one-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations for viscous and heat conductive gases with constant viscosities and heat conductivity for fast decaying density at far fields only. First, it is shown that the specific entropy becomes not uniformly bounded immediately after the initial time, as long as the initial density decays to vacuum at the far field at the rate not slower than with . Furthermore, for faster decaying initial density, i.e., a sharper result is discovered that the absolute temperature becomes uniformly positive at each positive time, no matter whether it is uniformly positive or not initially, and consequently the corresponding entropy behaves as at each positive time, independent of the boundedness of the initial entropy. Such phenomena are in sharp contrast to the case with slowly decaying initial density of the rate no faster than , for which our previous works [J. Li and Z. Xin, Adv. Math., 361 (2020), 106923; Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 75 (2022), pp. 2393–2445; Sci. China Math., 66 (2023), pp. 2219–2242] show that the uniform boundedness of the entropy can be propagated for all positive time and thus the temperature decays to zero at the far field. These give a complete answer to the problem concerning the propagation of uniform boundedness of the entropy for the heat conductive ideal gases and, in particular, show that the algebraic decay rate 2 of the initial density at the far field is sharp for the uniform boundedness of the entropy. The tools to prove our main results are based on some scaling transforms, including the Kelvin transform, and a Hopf type lemma for a class of degenerate equations with possible unbounded coefficients.},

It is well-known that point sources with sufficient mutual distance can be reconstructed exactly from finitely many Fourier measurements by solving a convex optimization problem with Tikhonov-regularization (this property is sometimes termed superresolution). In the case of noisy measurements one can bound the reconstruction error in unbalanced Wasserstein distances or weak Sobolev-type norms. A natural question is to what other settings the phenomenon of superresolution extends. We here keep the same measurement operator but replace the regularizer to anisotropic total variation, which is particularly suitable for regularizing piecewise constant images with horizontal and vertical edges. Under sufficient mutual distance between the horizontal and vertical edges we prove exact reconstruction results and error bounds in terms of the measurement noise.},

These latter are based on a fine investigation of the infinitesimal behavior of the underlying reachable sets, through which we show that up to a negligible set of times, every admissible velocity of a continuity inclusion can be approximately realized as the metric derivative of a solution of the dynamics, and vice versa. Building upon these results, we are able to establish necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for the viability and invariance of stationary and time-dependent constraint sets which involve a suitable notion of contingent cones in Wasserstein spaces, and presented in ascending order of generality. We then close the article by exhibiting two prototypical examples of constraint sets appearing in applications for which one can compute relevant subfamilies of contingent directions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Pattern formation in biological membranes is often explained by a coupling of the local curvature of the thin elastic membrane to its local composition. This ansatz introduces nonlocal terms to Canham-Helfrich-type models for membranes. This paper complements a study in [I. Fonseca et al., J. Nonlinear Sci., 26 (2016),  pp. 1191–1225]. The main result is the derivation of a -limit in a parameter regime in which complex pattern formation is not expected. We consider the full nonlocal model as well as a local approximation and prove that the -limit in both cases is of perimeter type. The main step in the proof is a general strategy to include Neumann boundary conditions in the construction of a recovery sequence.},

The model is physically relevant to observe the lower-dimensional dynamics of the Bose–Einstein condensate, but its ground state cannot be constructed by the standard method due to its supercritical nature. In Bellazzini et al. [Comm. Math. Phys. 353 (2017), pp. 229–251], a proper ground state is constructed, introducing a constrained energy minimization problem. In this paper, we further investigate the properties of the ground state. First, we show that, as the partial confinement is increased, the 1d ground state is derived from the 3d energy minimizer with a precise rate of convergence. Then, by employing this dimension reduction limit, we prove the uniqueness of the 3d minimizer, provided that the confinement is sufficiently strong. Consequently, we obtain the orbital stability of the minimizer, which improves that of the set of minimizers in the previous work Bellazini et al. [Comm. Math. Phys., 353 (2017), pp. 229–251].},

In this work we show the strong convergence of propagation of chaos for the particle approximation of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with singular -interactions as well as for the moderate interaction particle systems on the level of particle trajectories. One of the main obstacles is to establish the strong well-posedness of the SDEs for particle systems with singular interaction. To this end, we extend the results on strong well-posedness of Krylov and Röckner [Probab. Theory Related Fields, 131 (2005), pp. 154–196] to the case of mixed -drifts, where the heat kernel estimates play a crucial role. Moreover, when the interaction kernel is bounded measurable, we also obtain the optimal rate of strong convergence, which is partially based on Jabin and Wang’s entropy method [P.-E. Jabin and Z. Wang, J. Funct. Anal., 271 (2016), pp. 3588–3627] and Zvonkin’s transformation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the convergence of mean field games (MFGs) with finite state space to MFGs with a continuous state space. We examine a space discretization of a diffusive dynamics, which is reminiscent of the Markov chain approximation method in stochastic control, but also of finite difference numerical schemes; time remains continuous in the discretization, and the time horizon is arbitrarily long. We are mainly interested in the convergence of the solution of the associated master equations as the number of states tends to infinity. We present two approaches, to treat the case without or with common noise, both under monotonicity assumptions. The first one uses the system of characteristics of the master equation, which is the MFG system, to establish a convergence rate for the master equations without common noise and the associated optimal trajectories, both when there is a smooth solution to the limit master equation and when there is not. The second approach relies on the notion of monotone solutions introduced by [8, 9]. In the presence of common noise, we show convergence of the master equations, with a convergence rate if the limit master equation is smooth, and by compactness arguments otherwise.},

First, the spectral stability problem possesses only isolated eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. Second, the energetic stability argument holds in Sobolev spaces with exponential weights. Third, the black soliton persists with respect to the addition of a small decaying potential and remains spectrally stable when it is pinned to the minimum points of the effective potential. The same model exhibits a family of traveling dark solitons for every wave speed and we incorporate properties of these dark solitons for small wave speeds in the analysis of orbital stability of the black soliton.},

The argument has three main ingredients: 1. the logarithmic stability of the related inverse problem for the fractional Schrödinger equation by Rüland and Salo; 2. the Lipschitz stability of the exterior determination problem; 3. utilizing and identifying nonlocal analogies of Alessandrini’s work on the stability of the classical Calderón problem. The main contribution of the article is the resolution of the technical difficulties related to the last mentioned step. Furthermore, we show the optimality of the logarithmic stability estimates, following the earlier works by Mandache on the instability of the inverse conductivity problem, and by Rüland and Salo on the analogous problem for the fractional Schrödinger equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this contribution we are interested in the quantitative homogenization properties of linear elliptic equations with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data in polygonal domains with corners. To begin our study of this situation, we consider the setting of an angular sector in two dimensions: Unlike in the whole-space, on such a sector there exist nonsmooth harmonic functions (these depend on the angle of the sector). Here we construct extended homogenization correctors corresponding to these harmonic functions and prove growth estimates for these which are quasi-optimal, namely optimal up to a logarithmic loss. Our construction of the corner correctors relies on a large-scale regularity theory for -harmonic functions in the sector, which we also prove and which, as a by-product, yields a Liouville principle. We also propose a nonstandard 2-scale expansion, which is adapted to the sectoral domain and incorporates the corner correctors. Our final result is a quasi-optimal error estimate for this adapted 2-scale expansion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze a reaction-diffusion system on which models the dispersal of individuals between two exchanging environments for its diffusive component and incorporates a Fujita-type growth for its reactive component. The originality of this model lies in the coupling of the equations through diffusion, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied in Fujita-type problems. We first consider the underlying diffusive problem, demonstrating that the solutions converge exponentially fast towards those of two uncoupled equations, featuring a dispersive operator that is somehow a combination of Laplacians. By subsequently adding Fujita-type reaction terms to recover the entire system, we identify the critical exponent that separates systematic blow-up from possible global existence.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The square root normal field (SRNF) framework is a method in the area of shape analysis that defines a (pseudo)distance between unparametrized surfaces. For piecewise linear surfaces it was recently proved that the SRNF distance between unparametrized surfaces is equivalent to the Wasserstein Fisher Rao (WFR) metric on the space of finitely supported measures on . In the present article we extend this point of view to a much larger set of surfaces; we show that the SRNF distance on the space of Lipschitz surfaces is equivalent to the WFR distance between Borel measures on . For the space of spherical surfaces this result directly allows us to characterize the noninjectivity and the (closure of the) image of the SRNF transform. In the last part of the paper we further generalize this result by showing that the WFR metric for general measure spaces can be interpreted as an optimization problem over the diffeomorphism group of an independent background space.},

Then, we consider a specific class of energy-dependent Schrödinger equations without eigenvalues, defined with Miura potentials and boundary conditions at the origin. We solve the inverse resonance problem in this case and describe sets of isoresonance potentials and boundary condition parameters. Our strategy consists of exploiting a correspondence between Schrödinger and Dirac equations on the half-line. As a byproduct, we describe similar sets for Dirac operators and show that the scattering problem for a Schrödinger equation or Dirac operator with an arbitrary boundary condition can be reduced to the scattering problem with the Dirichlet boundary condition.},

Depending on the type of tissue, the velocity is linked to the pressure through Stoke’s law, Brinkman’s law, or Darcy’s law. While each of these velocity-pressure relations has been studied in the literature, little emphasis has been placed on the fine relationship between them. In this paper, we want to address this dearth of results in the literature, providing a rigorous argument that bridges the gap between a viscoelastic tumor model (of Brinkman type) and an inviscid tumor model (of Darcy type). Specifically, we prove the convergence of solutions of the Brinkman nonlocal transport system toward a weak solution of the Darcy nonlinear parabolic system in the limit of vanishing viscosity.},

Such systems arise in the kinetic theory of dilute solutions of polymeric liquids, where the motion of noninteracting polymer chains in a Newtonian solvent is modeled by a stochastic process exhibiting power-law waiting time in order to capture subdiffusive processes associated with non-Fickian diffusion. We outline the derivation of the model from a subordinated Langevin equation. The elastic properties of the polymer molecules immersed in the solvent are modeled by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic dumbbell model, and the drag term in the Fokker–Planck equation is assumed to be corotational. We prove the global-in-time existence of large-data weak solutions to this time-fractional model of order and derive an energy inequality satisfied by weak solutions.},

We consider generalized solutions of the Perona–Malik equation in dimension one, defined as all possible limits of solutions to the semidiscrete approximation in which derivatives with respect to the space variable are replaced by difference quotients. Our first result is a pathological example in which the initial data converge strictly as bounded variation functions, but strict convergence is not preserved for all positive times and, in particular, many basic quantities, such as the supremum or the total variation, do not pass to the limit. Nevertheless, in our second result we show that all our generalized solutions satisfy some of the properties of classical smooth solutions, namely, the maximum principle and the monotonicity of the total variation. The verification of the counterexample relies on a comparison result with suitable sub-/super-solutions. The monotonicity results are proved for a more general class of evolution curves, that we call -evolutions.},

First, the unique continuation principle is proved for the fourth order biharmonic wave equation with rough potentials, and the well-posedness of the direct scattering problem is established in the distribution sense. Second, the correlation strength of the random potential is shown to be uniquely determined by the high frequency limit of the second moment of the backscattering data averaged over the frequency band. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expectation in the data can be removed and the data of a single realization is sufficient for the uniqueness of the inverse problem with probability one when the medium is lossless.},

We also provide an estimate from below for the life span of solutions when initial data are close to some of the classes of data for which global existence is known, namely data with finitely many Fourier modes, analytic data, and quasi-analytic data.},

Two different natural fractional analogs of classical are considered: , a space induced from the Riesz-fractional gradient that has been recently studied by Comi–Stefani; and , induced by the Gagliardo-type fractional gradient often used in Dirichlet forms and Peridynamics—this one is naturally related to the Caffarelli–Roquejoffre–Savin fractional perimeter. Our main theoretical result is that the latter actually corresponds to the Gagliardo–Slobodeckij space . As an application, using the properties of these spaces, novel image denoising models are introduced and their corresponding Fenchel predual formulations are derived. The latter requires density of smooth functions with compact support. We establish this density property for convex domains.},

Local well-posedness theory, together with the sharp Gagliardo–Nirenberg inequality and the conservation laws of mass and energy, implies that the solution with mass less than is global existence in , where is the ground state of the -critical NLS without the delta potential (i.e., ). We are interested in the dynamics of the solution with threshold mass in . First, for the case , such a blow-up solution exists due to the pseudoconformal symmetry of the equation and is unique up to the symmetries of the equation in from Merle [Duke Math. J., 69 (1993), pp. 427–454] and recently in from Dodson [arXiv:2104.11690, 2021]. Second, for the case , a simple variational argument with the conservation laws of mass and energy implies that even solutions with threshold mass exist globally in . Finally, for the case , we show the existence of even threshold solutions with blow-up speed determined by the sign (i.e., ) of the delta potential perturbation since the refined blow-up profile to the rescaled equation is stable in a precise sense. The key ingredients here, including the Energy–Morawetz argument and the compactness method as well as modulation analysis, are close to the original one in Raphaël and Szeftel [J. Amer. Math.

Under certain mild conditions on and , we first determine clearly the global dynamics of the single species model in terms of critical habitat size or critical advection speed, and then further give a complete understanding on the global dynamics of the two species competition model.

Considering the problem of minimizing among convex subsets of of fixed volume, where is the perimeter functional, is a perturbative term, and is a small parameter, the stability of the ball for this perturbed isoperimetric problem means that the ball is the unique (local, up to translation) minimizer for any sufficiently small. We investigate independently two specific cases where is an energy arising from PDE theory, namely, the capacity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of a domain . While in both cases stability fails among all shapes, in the first case we prove the (nonsharp) stability of the ball among convex shapes, by building an appropriate competitor for the capacity of a perturbation of the ball. In the second case we prove the sharp stability of the ball among convex shapes by providing the optimal range of such that stability holds, relying on the selection principle technique and a regularity theory under convexity constraint.},

This paper explores the Lebesgue’s integrability propagation, of a system of space homogeneous Boltzmann equations modelling a multicomponent mixture of polyatomic gases based on the continuous internal energy. For typical collision kernels proposed in the literature, moment-entropy-based estimates for the collision operator gain part and a lower bound for the loss part are performed, leading to a vector valued inequality for the collision operator and, consequently, to a differential inequality for the vector valued solutions of the system. This allows one to prove the propagation property of the polynomially weighted norms associated to the vector valued solution of the system of Boltzmann equations.

In this paper, we study the well-posedness theory and the scattering asymptotics for fourth-order Schrödinger equations (4NLS) on waveguide manifolds (semiperiodic spaces) , . The torus component can be generalized to -dimensional compact manifolds . First, we modify Strichartz estimates for 4NLS on waveguide manifolds, with which we establish the well-posedness theory in proper function spaces via the standard contraction mapping method. Moreover, we prove the scattering asymptotics based on an interaction Morawetz-type estimate established for 4NLS on waveguides.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate both the mathematical modeling and stability methods for a new integro-differential system referred to as the viscoelastic Timoshenko–Boltzmann model. The modeling is developed for materials with hereditary memory under the creation time scenario whose foundation goes back to Boltzmann’s superposition principle in linear viscoelasticity, complemented by Timoshenko’s assumptions concerning shearing in certain beam vibrations. The mathematical methodology provides a comprehensive characterization of the uniform stability for the partially damped Timoshenko–Boltzmann system through the identity of wave speeds on the structural coefficients and a pointwise dissipative condition on the memory kernel that does not require differential inequalities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the first part of this paper we develop a theory for image restoration with a learned regularizer that is analogous to that of Meyer’s geometric characterization of solutions of the classical variational method of Rudin–Osher–Fatemi (ROF). The learned regularizer we use is a Kantorovich potential for an optimal transport problem of mapping a distribution of noisy images onto clean ones, as first proposed by Lunz, Öktem, and Schönlieb. We show that the effect of their restoration method on the distribution of the images is an explicit Euler discretization of a gradient flow on probability space, while our variational problem, dubbed Wasserstein ROF (WROF), is the corresponding implicit Euler discretization. We obtain our geometric characterization of the solution in this learned regularizer setting by first proving a much more general convex analysis theorem for variational problems having solutions characterized by projections. We then use optimal transport arguments to obtain the corresponding theorem for WROF from this general result, as well as a natural decomposition of a transport map into large scale “features” and small scale “details,” where scale refers to the magnitude of the transport distance. In the second part of the paper we leverage our theory for restoration with learned regularizers to analyze two algorithms which iterate WROF. We refer to these as iterative regularization and multiscale transport. For the former we obtain a proof of convergence to the clean data. For the latter we produce successive approximations to the target distribution that match it up to finer and finer scales. These two algorithms are in complete analogy to well-known effective methods based on ROF for iterative denoising, respectively hierarchical image decomposition. We also obtain an analogue of the Tadmor–Nezzar–Vese energy identity, which decomposes the Wasserstein 2 distance between two measures into a sum of nonnegative terms that correspond to transport costs at different scales.},

We first state the well-posedness of the problem via iterative approximations and energy estimates.

Next, we prove the existence of invariant measures when the problem is autonomous by means of the fact that is compactly embedded in with . Moreover, the uniqueness of this invariant measure is presented, which ensures the ergodicity of the problem. Finally, a large deviation principle result for solutions of stochastic PDEs perturbed by small Lévy noise and Brownian motion is obtained by a variational formula for positive functionals of a Poisson random measure and Brownian motion. Additionally, the results are illustrated by the fractional stochastic Chafee–Infante equations.},

Coarse-graining techniques play a central role in reducing the complexity of stochastic models and are typically characterized by a mapping which projects the full state of the system onto a smaller set of variables which captures the essential features of the system. Starting with a continuous-time Markov chain, in this work we propose and analyze an effective dynamics, which approximates the dynamical information in the coarse-grained chain. Without assuming explicit scale-separation, we provide sufficient conditions under which this effective dynamics stays close to the original system and provide quantitative bounds on the approximation error. We also compare the effective dynamics and corresponding error bounds to the averaging literature on Markov chains which involve explicit scale-separation. We demonstrate our findings on an illustrative test example.},

In particular, only smallness of with is imposed on initial data , where is the Fourier transform in space variable. This provides the first result on the global existence of such low-regularity solutions without relying on Sobolev embedding in the case of the whole space. Different from the use of sufficiently smooth Sobolev spaces in the classical results [P. T. Gressman and R. M. Strain, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 24 (2011), pp. 771–847] and [R. Alexandre et al., J. Funct. Anal., 262 (2012), pp. 915–1010], there is a crucial difference between the torus case and the whole space case for low-regularity solutions under consideration. In fact, for the former, it is enough to take the only norm corresponding to the Weiner space as studied in [R. J. Duan et al., Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 74 (2021), pp. 932–1020]. In contrast, for the latter, the extra interplay with the norm plays a vital role in controlling the nonlinear collision term due to the degenerate dissipation of the macroscopic component. Indeed, the propagation of the norm helps gain an almost optimal decay rate of the norm via the time-weighted energy estimates in the spirit of the idea of [S. Kawashima, J. Hyperbolic Differ. Equ., 1 (2004), pp. 581–603] and, in turn, this is necessarily used for establishing the global existence.},

The voltage-conductance kinetic model for the collective behavior of neurons has been studied by scientists and mathematicians for two decades, but the rigorous analysis of its solution structure has been only partially obtained in spite of plenty of numerical evidence in various scenarios. In this work, we consider a simplified voltage-conductance model in which the velocity field in the voltage variable is in a separable form. The long time behavior of the simplified model is fully investigated, leading to the following dichotomy: either the density function converges to the global equilibrium, or the firing rate diverges as time goes to infinity. Besides, the fast conductance asymptotic limit is justified and analyzed, where the solution to the limit model either blows up in finite time or globally exists leading to time periodic solutions. An important implication of these results is that the nonseparable velocity field, or physically the leaky mechanism, is a key element for the emergence of periodic solutions in the original model.},

It has recently been proved by Frank and Lieb that the ball is the unique (up to translation) global minimizer for sufficiently large mass. We focus on the issue of the stability of the ball, in the sense of the positivity of the second variation of the energy with respect to smooth perturbations of the boundary of the ball. We characterize the range of masses for which the second variation is positive definite (large masses) or negative definite (small masses). Moreover, we prove that the stability of the ball implies its local minimality among sets sufficiently close in the Hausdorff distance, but not in the -sense.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Chemotaxis is the physical phenomenon that bacteria adjust their motions according to chemical stimulus. A classical model for this phenomenon is a kinetic equation that describes the velocity jump process whose tumbling/transition kernel uniquely determines the effect of a chemical stimulus on bacteria. The model has been shown to be an accurate model that matches with bacteria motion qualitatively. For a quantitative modeling, biophysicists and practitioners are also highly interested in determining the explicit value of the tumbling kernel. Due to the experimental limitations, measurements are typically macroscopic in nature. Do macroscopic quantities contain enough information to recover microscopic behavior? In this paper, we give a positive answer. We show that when given a special design of initial data, the population density, one specific macroscopic quantity as a function of time, contains sufficient information to recover the tumbling kernel and its associated damping coefficient. Moreover, we can read off the chemotaxis tumbling kernel using the values of population density directly from this specific experimental design. This theoretical result using kinetic theory sheds light on how practitioners may conduct experiments in laboratories.},

Our results hold true for arbitrary long time horizons and for general nonseparable Hamiltonians that satisfy a so-called displacement monotonicity condition. This monotonicity condition that we propose for nonseparable Hamiltonians is sharper and more general than the one proposed in the work [W. Gangbo et al., Ann. Probab., 50 (2022), pp. 2178–2217]. The displacement monotonicity assumptions imposed on the data actually provide not only uniqueness, but also the existence and regularity of the solutions. Our analysis uses elementary arguments and does not rely on the well-posedness of the corresponding master equations.},

As its section shrinks to a point, the problem is spectrally stable and we quantitatively investigate the rate of convergence of the perturbed eigenvalues. We detect the proper quantity which sharply measures the perturbation’s magnitude. It is a sort of torsional rigidity of the tube’s section relative to the domain. This allows us to sharply describe the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed spectrum, even when eigenvalues converge to a multiple one. The final asymptotics of eigenbranches depend on the local behavior near the junction of eigenfunctions chosen in a proper way. The present techniques also apply when the perturbation of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem consists in prescribing homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on a small portion of the boundary of the domain.},

This paper studies highly oscillatory solutions to a class of systems of semilinear hyperbolic equations with a small parameter, in a setting that includes Klein–Gordon equations and the Maxwell–Lorentz system. The interest here is in solutions that are polarized in the sense that up to a small error, the oscillations in the solution depend on only one of the frequencies that satisfy the dispersion relation with a given wave vector appearing in the initial wave packet. The construction and analysis of such polarized solutions is done using modulated Fourier expansions. This approach includes higher harmonics and yields approximations to polarized solutions that are of arbitrary order in the small parameter, going well beyond the known first-order approximation via a nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The given construction of polarized solutions is explicit, uses in addition a linear Schrödinger equation for each further order of approximation, and is accessible to direct numerical approximation.},

This paper is inspired by an imaging problem encountered in the framework of Electrical Resistance Tomography involving two different materials, one or both of which are nonlinear. Tomography with nonlinear materials is in the early stages of development, although breakthroughs are expected in the not-too-distant future. We consider nonlinear constitutive relationships which, at a given point in the space, present a behavior for large arguments that is described by monomials of order and . The original contribution this work makes is that the nonlinear problem can be approximated by a weighted Laplace problem. From the perspective of tomography, this is a significant result because it highlights the central role played by the Laplacian in inverse problems with nonlinear materials. Moreover, when , this provides a powerful bridge to bring all the imaging methods and algorithms developed for linear materials into the arena of problems with nonlinear materials. The main result of this work is that for “large” Dirichlet data in the presence of two materials of different order (i) one material can be replaced by either a perfect electric conductor or a perfect electric insulator and (ii) the other material can be replaced by a material giving rise to a weighted Laplace problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The aim of this paper is to establish the asymptotically autonomous robustness of pullback random attractors of nonautonomous Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equations driven by nonlinear colored noise defined on 3D unbounded channels. We first prove the existence, uniqueness, and backward compactness of a special kind of pullback random attractor by the methods of spectral decomposition inside bounded domains as well as the uniform tail-estimates of solutions outside bounded domains over the infinite time interval in order to surmount the difficulties caused by lack of compact Sobolev embedding on unbounded domains and weak dissipative structure of the equation. The measurability of such an attractor is proven by showing that the defined two kinds of attractors with respect to two different universes are equal. Finally, the asymptotically autonomous upper semicontinuity of the attractors is investigated by assuming that the time-dependent external forcing term converges to the time-independent external force as the time-parameter tends to negative infinity. This work is a continuation of our previous work [Chen et al., Math. Ann., 386 (2023), pp. 343–373], which considered the existence and uniqueness of usual tempered pullback random attractors.},

Moreover, we also achieve some uniqueness results for homogenous nonlinearity in general convex domain. Compared to the results in [G. Huang, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 58 (2019), 73], we dispose the “uniformly convex” condition imposed on the domain. With a subtle approximation procedure and variant form of Hopf’s lemma, we overcome the technical difficulties caused by the degeneracy of the above equation. What’s more, we can also get the uniqueness property for domains whose geometry is close enough to the symmetric convex domain.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Plasticity of metals is the emergent phenomenon of many crystal defects (dislocations) which interact and move on microscopic time and length scales. Two of the commonly used models to describe such dislocation dynamics are the Peierls–Nabarro model and the so-called discrete dislocation dynamics model. However, the consistency between these two models is known only for a few number of dislocations or up to the first time at which two dislocations collide. In this paper we resolve these restrictions, and establish the consistency for any number of dislocations and without any restriction on their initial position or orientation. In more detail, the evolutive Peierls–Nabarro model which we consider describes the evolution of a phase-field function which represents the atom deformation in a crystal. The model is a reaction-diffusion equation of Allen–Cahn type with the half-Laplacian. The small parameter is the ratio between the atomic distance and the typical distance between phase transitions in . The position of a phase transition determines the position of a dislocation, and the sign of the transition (up or down) determines the orientation. The goal of this paper is to derive the asymptotic behavior of the function as up to arbitrary end time ; in particular, beyond collisions. We prove that converges to a piecewise constant function , whose jump points in the spatial variable satisfy the ODE system which represents discrete dislocation dynamics with annihilation. Our proof method is to explicitly construct and patch together several sub- and super-solutions of , and to show that they converge to the same limit .},

Using a localized entropy estimate and a Stampacchia-type lemma, we establish a finite speed of propagation result and sufficient conditions (and lower bounds) for the waiting-time phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a variational theory for lattice defects of rotational and translational type. We focus on finite systems of planar wedge disclinations, disclination dipoles, and edge dislocations, which we model as the solutions to minimum problems for isotropic elastic energies under the constraint of kinematic incompatibility. Operating under the assumption of planar linearized kinematics, we formulate the mechanical equilibrium problem in terms of the Airy stress function, for which we introduce a rigorous analytical formulation in the context of incompatible elasticity. Our main result entails the analysis of the energetic equivalence of systems of disclination dipoles and edge dislocations in the asymptotics of their singular limit regimes. By adopting the regularization approach via core radius, we show that, as the core radius vanishes, the asymptotic energy expansion for disclination dipoles coincides with the energy of finite systems of edge dislocations. This proves that Eshelby’s kinematic characterization of an edge dislocation in terms of a disclination dipole is exact also from the energetic standpoint.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study the regularity and long time behavior of the one-dimensional, local, first-order mean field games system and the planning problem, assuming a Hamiltonian of superlinear growth, with a nonseparated, strictly monotone dependence on the density. We improve upon the existing literature by obtaining two regularity results. The first is the existence of classical solutions without the need to assume blow-up of the cost function near small densities. The second result is the interior smoothness of weak solutions without the need to assume either blow-up of the cost function or that the initial density be bounded away from zero. We also characterize the long time behavior of the solutions, proving that they satisfy the turnpike property with an exponential rate of convergence and identifying their limit as the solution of the infinite horizon system. Our approach relies on the elliptic structure of the system and displacement convexity estimates. In particular, we apply displacement convexity methods to obtain both global and local a priori lower bounds on the density.},

We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for a class of stochastic porous media equations driven by Lévy-type noise on a -finite measure space , with the Laplacian replaced by a negative definite self-adjoint operator. One of the main contributions of this paper is that we do not assume the compactness of embeddings in the corresponding Gelfand triple, and to compensate for this generalization, a new procedure is provided. This is the first paper to deal with LDPs for stochastic evolution equations with Lévy noise without compactness conditions. The coefficient is assumed to satisfy nondecreasing Lipschitz nonlinearity, so an important physical problem covered by this case is the Stefan problem. Numerous examples of negative definite self-adjoint operators are applicable to our results, for example, for open , Laplacian or fractional Laplacians (i.e., ), and generalized Schrödinger operators (i.e., ); Laplacians on fractals is also included.},
