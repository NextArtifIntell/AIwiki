  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a novel method, called swarm-based simulated annealing (SSA), for nonconvex optimization which is at the interface between the swarm-based gradient-descent (SBGD) [J. Lu et al., arXiv:2211.17157; E. Tadmor and A. Zenginoglu, Acta Appl. Math., 190 (2024)] and simulated annealing (SA) [V. Cerny, J. Optim. Theory Appl., 45 (1985), pp. 41–51; S.

Similarly to SBGD, we introduce a swarm of agents, each identified with a position, and mass , to explore the ambient space. Similarly to SA, the agents proceed in the gradient descent direction, and are subject to Brownian motion. The annealing rate, however, is dictated by a decreasing function of their mass. As a consequence, instead of the SA protocol for time-decreasing temperature, here the swarm decides how to “cool down” agents, depending on their own accumulated mass. The dynamics of masses is coupled with the dynamics of positions: agents at higher ground transfer (part of) their mass to those at lower ground. Consequently, the resulting SSA optimizer is dynamically divided between heavier, cooler agents viewed as “leaders” and lighter, warmer agents viewed as “explorers.” Mean-field convergence analysis and benchmark optimizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSA method as a multidimensional global optimizer.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The computation of global radial basis function (RBF) approximations requires the solution of a linear system which, depending on the choice of RBF parameters, may be ill-conditioned. We study the stability and accuracy of approximation methods using the Gaussian RBF in all scaling regimes of the associated shape parameter. The approximation is based on discrete least squares with function samples on a bounded domain, using RBF centers both inside and outside the domain. This results in a rectangular linear system. We show for one-dimensional approximations that linear scaling of the shape parameter with the degrees of freedom is optimal, resulting in constant overlap between neighboring RBF’s regardless of their number, and we propose an explicit suitable choice of the proportionality constant. We show numerically that highly accurate approximations to smooth functions can also be obtained on bounded domains in several dimensions, using a linear scaling with the degrees of freedom per dimension. We extend the least squares approach to a collocation-based method for the solution of elliptic boundary value problems and illustrate that the combination of centers outside the domain, oversampling, and optimal scaling can result in accuracy close to machine precision in spite of having to solve very ill-conditioned linear systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We develop a two-stage, second-order, global-in-time energy stable implicit-explicit Runge–Kutta (IMEX RK(2, 2)) scheme for the phase field crystal equation with an time step constraint, and without the global Lipschitz assumption. A linear stabilization term is introduced to the system with Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization, and a novel compact reformulation is devised by rewriting the IMEX RK(2, 2) scheme as an approximation to the variation-of-constants formula. Under the assumption that all stage solutions are a priori bounded in the norm, we first demonstrate that the original energy obtained by this second-order scheme is nonincreasing for any time step with a sufficiently large stabilization parameter. To justify the a priori bound assumption, we establish a uniform-in-time estimate for all stage solutions, subject to an time step constraint. This results in a uniform-in-time bound for all stage solutions through discrete Sobolev embedding from to . Consequently, we achieve an stabilization parameter, ensuring global-in-time energy stability. Additionally, we provide an optimal rate convergence analysis and error estimate for the IMEX RK(2, 2) scheme in the norm. The global-in-time energy stability represents a novel achievement for a two-stage, second-order accurate scheme for a gradient flow without the global Lipschitz assumption. Numerical experiments substantiate the second-order accuracy and energy stability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In recent years, stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) have become a well-studied field in mathematics. With their increase in popularity, it becomes important to efficiently approximate their solutions. Thus, our goal is a contribution towards the development of efficient and practical time-stepping methods for SPDEs. Operator splitting schemes provide powerful, efficient, and flexible numerical methods for deterministic and stochastic differential equations. An example is given by domain decomposition schemes, where one splits the domain into subdomains and constructs the numerical approximation in a divide-and-conquer strategy. Instead of solving one expensive problem on the entire domain, one then deals with cheaper problems on the subdomains. This is particularly useful in modern computer architectures, as the subproblems may often be solved in parallel. While splitting methods have already been used to study domain decomposition methods for deterministic PDEs, this is a new approach for SPDEs. This implies that the existing convergence analysis is not directly applicable, even though the building blocks of the operator splitting domain decomposition method are standard. We provide an abstract convergence analysis of a splitting scheme for stochastic evolution equations and state a domain decomposition scheme as an application of the setting. The theoretical results are verified through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The ensemble Kalman filter is widely used in applications because, for high-dimensional filtering problems, it has a robustness that is not shared, for example, by the particle filter; in particular, it does not suffer from weight collapse. However, there is no theory which quantifies its accuracy as an approximation of the true filtering distribution, except in the Gaussian setting. To address this issue, we provide the first analysis of the accuracy of the ensemble Kalman filter beyond the Gaussian setting. We prove two types of results: The first type comprises a stability estimate controlling the error made by the ensemble Kalman filter in terms of the difference between the true filtering distribution and a nearby Gaussian, and the second type uses this stability result to show that, in a neighborhood of Gaussian problems, the ensemble Kalman filter makes a small error in comparison with the true filtering distribution. Our analysis is developed for the mean-field ensemble Kalman filter. We rewrite the update equations for this filter and for the true filtering distribution in terms of maps on probability measures. We introduce a weighted total variation metric to estimate the distance between the two filters, and we prove various stability estimates for the maps defining the evolution of the two filters in this metric. Using these stability estimates, we prove results of the first and second types in the weighted total variation metric. We also provide a generalization of these results to the Gaussian projected filter, which can be viewed as a mean-field description of the unscented Kalman filter.},

As a first main result, we show that, for the choice of a shifted Legendre basis, this method is equivalent to Padé approximation in the frequency domain. We illustrate that Lanczos tau methods straightforwardly give rise to sparse, self-nesting discretizations. Equivalence is also demonstrated with pseudospectral collocation, where the nonzero collocation points are chosen as the zeros of orthogonal polynomials. The importance of such a choice manifests itself in the approximation of the -norm, where, under mild conditions, supergeometric convergence is observed and, for a special case, superconvergence is proved, both of which are significantly faster than the algebraic convergence reported in previous work.},

This paper aims to address two issues of integral equations for the scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves by a perfect electric conductor with Lipschitz continuous boundary: ill-conditioned boundary element Galerkin discretization matrices on fine meshes and instability at spurious resonant frequencies. The remedy to ill-conditioned matrices is operator preconditioning, and resonant instability is eliminated by means of a combined field integral equation. Exterior traces of single and double layer potentials are complemented by their interior counterparts for a purely imaginary wave number. We derive the corresponding variational formulation in the natural trace space for electromagnetic fields and establish its well-posedness for all wave numbers. A Galerkin discretization scheme is employed using conforming edge boundary elements on dual meshes, which produces well-conditioned discrete linear systems of the variational formulation. Some numerical results are also provided to support the numerical analysis.},

The focus of the study is on the energy-conserving or energy-dissipating behavior of the method with some simple mesh-independent numerical fluxes we designed. We establish error estimates in the energy norm that require careful selection of a weak formulation for the auxiliary equation involving the time derivative of the displacement variable. A critical part of the convergence analysis is to establish the error bounds for the time derivative of the approximation error in the displacement variable by using the equation that determines its mean value. Using a special weak formulation, we show that one can create a linear system for the time evolution of the unknowns even when dealing with nonlinear properties in the original problem. Numerical experiments were performed to demonstrate the optimal convergence of the scheme in the norm. These experiments involved specific choices of numerical fluxes combined with specific choices of approximation spaces.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An a posteriori error estimator based on an equilibrated flux reconstruction is proposed for defeaturing problems in the context of finite element discretizations. Defeaturing consists in the simplification of a geometry by removing features that are considered not relevant for the approximation of the solution of a given PDE. In this work, the focus is on a Poisson equation with Neumann boundary conditions on the feature boundary. The estimator accounts both for the so-called defeaturing error and for the numerical error committed by approximating the solution on the defeatured domain. Unlike other estimators that were previously proposed for defeaturing problems, the use of the equilibrated flux reconstruction allows us to obtain a sharp bound for the numerical component of the error. Furthermore, it does not require the evaluation of the normal trace of the numerical flux on the feature boundary: this makes the estimator well suited for finite element discretizations, in which the normal trace of the numerical flux is typically discontinuous across elements. The reliability of the estimator is proven and verified on several numerical examples. Its capability to identify the most relevant features is also shown, in anticipation of a future application to an adaptive strategy.},

While the classical Koksma–Hlawka inequality cannot be directly applied to unbounded functions, we establish a novel framework to study the convergence rates of QMC for unbounded smooth integrands. We propose a projection method to modify the unbounded integrands into bounded and smooth ones, which differs from the low variation extension strategy of avoiding the singularities along the boundary of the unit cube in Owen [SIAM Rev., 48 (2006), pp. 487–503]. The total error is then bounded by the quadrature error of the transformed integrand and the projection error. We prove that if the function and its mixed partial derivatives do not grow too fast as the Euclidean norm tends to infinity, then projection-based QMC and randomized QMC (RQMC) methods achieve an error rate of with a sample size and an arbitrarily small . However, the error rate turns out to be only when the functions grow exponentially as with . Remarkably, we find that using importance sampling with -distribution as the proposal can dramatically improve the root mean squared error of RQMC from to .},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Numerical integration over the real line for analytic functions is studied. Our main focus is on the sharpness of the error bounds. We first derive two general lower estimates for the worst-case integration error, and then apply these to establish lower bounds for various quadrature rules. These bounds turn out to either be novel or improve upon existing results, leading to lower bounds that closely match upper bounds for various formulas. Specifically, for the suitably truncated trapezoidal rule, we improve upon general lower bounds on the worst-case error obtained by Sugihara [Numer. Math., 75 (1997), pp. 379–395] and provide exceptionally sharp lower bounds apart from a polynomial factor, and in particular we show that the worst-case error for the trapezoidal rule by Sugihara is not improvable by more than a polynomial factor. Additionally, our research reveals a discrepancy between the error decay of the trapezoidal rule and Sugihara’s lower bound for general numerical integration rules, introducing a new open problem. Moreover, the Gauss–Hermite quadrature is proven suboptimal under the decay conditions on integrands we consider, a result not deducible from upper-bound arguments alone. Furthermore, to establish the near-optimality of the suitably scaled Gauss–Legendre and Clenshaw–Curtis quadratures, we generalize a recent result of Trefethen [SIAM Rev., 64 (2022), pp. 132–150] for the upper error bounds in terms of the decay conditions.},

This construction requires a suitable extension of the domain and similar partitions on the left side with the same choice of scaling parameters. Smooth fractal MQ functions are proposed to solve initial value problems via a collocation method. Our numerical computations suggest that fractal MQ functions offer higher accuracy and more flexibility for the solutions compared to the existing classical MQ functions.

This paper presents biorthogonal basis functions to the primal basis functions mentioned above.

We employ the backward-Euler method as the coarse propagator and a general single-step time-integrator as the fine propagator. Specifically, we consider two implementations of the coarse grid correction: the standard time-stepping mode and the parallel mode via the so-called diagonalization technique. For both cases, we prove that under certain conditions of the stability function of the fine propagator, the convergence factor of the parareal algorithm is not larger than that of the associated algorithm with a uniform fine time grid. Furthermore, we show that when such conditions are not satisfied, one can indeed observe degenerations of the convergence rate. The model that is used for performing the analysis is the Dahlquist test equation with nonnegative parameter, and the numerical results indicate that the theoretical results hold for nonlinear ODEs and linear ODEs where the coefficient matrix has complex eigenvalues.},

The focus of this paper is on the concurrent reconstruction of both the diffusion and potential coefficients present in an elliptic/parabolic equation, utilizing two internal measurements of the solutions. A decoupled algorithm is constructed to sequentially recover these two parameters. In the first step, we implement a straightforward reformulation that results in a standard problem of identifying the diffusion coefficient. This coefficient is then numerically recovered, with no requirement for knowledge of the potential, by utilizing an output least-squares method coupled with finite element discretization. In the second step, the previously recovered diffusion coefficient is employed to reconstruct the potential coefficient, applying a method similar to the first step. Our approach is stimulated by a constructive conditional stability, and we provide rigorous a priori error estimates in for the recovered diffusion and potential coefficients. To derive these estimates, we develop a weighted energy argument and suitable positivity conditions. These estimates offer a beneficial guide for choosing regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes, in accordance with the noise level. Some numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the numerical scheme and support our theoretical results.},

Kernel interpolation is a versatile tool for the approximation of functions from data, and it can be proven to have some optimality properties when used with kernels related to certain Sobolev spaces. In the context of interpolation, the selection of optimal function sampling locations is a central problem, both from a practical perspective and as an interesting theoretical question. Greedy interpolation algorithms provide a viable solution for this task, being efficient to run and provably accurate in their approximation. In this paper we close a gap that is present in the convergence theory for these algorithms by employing a recent result on general greedy algorithms. This modification leads to new convergence rates which match the optimal ones when restricted to the -greedy target-data-independent selection rule and can additionally be proven to be optimal when they fully exploit adaptivity (-greedy). Other than closing this gap, the new results have some significance in the broader setting of the optimality of general approximation algorithms in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, as they allow us to compare adaptive interpolation with nonadaptive best nonlinear approximation.},

The energy stability analysis begins with a series of temporal differences about stage solutions. Then by exploring the stability mechanism from the temporal differences, and by constructing the seminegative definite symmetric form related to the discretization of the dispersion term, and by adopting the important relationships between the auxiliary variables with the prime variable to control the antidissipation terms, we derive the unconditional stability for a discrete energy involving the prime variable and all the auxiliary variables, in the sense that the time step is bounded by a constant that is independent of the spatial mesh size. We also propose a new projection technique and adopt the technique of summation by parts in the time direction to achieve the optimal order of accuracy. The new projection technique can serve as an analytical tool to be applied to general odd order wave equations. Finally, numerical experiments are shown to test the stability and accuracy of the considered schemes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The coupling of nonconservative hyperbolic systems at a static interface has been a delicate issue as common approaches rely on the Lax-curves of the systems, which are not always available. To address this a new linear relaxation system is introduced, in which a nonlocal source term accounts for the nonconservative product of the original system. Using an asymptotic analysis the relaxation limit and its stability are investigated in the uncoupled setting. It is shown that the path-conservative Lax–Friedrichs scheme arises from a discrete limit of an implicit-explicit scheme for the relaxation system. Employing the relaxation approach, a novel technique to couple two nonconservative systems under a large class of coupling conditions is established. A particular coupling strategy motivated from conservative Kirchhoff conditions is introduced and a corresponding Riemann solver provided. A fully discrete scheme for coupled nonconservative products is derived and studied in terms of path conservation. Numerical experiments applying the approach to a coupled model of vascular blood flow are presented.},

Thereby, a nonlinear bending energy is based on a homogenized quadratic form which acts on the second fundamental form associated with the elastic deformation. Convergence is proved for a multi-affine finite element discretization of the involved three-dimensional microscopic cell problems and a discrete Kirchhoff triangle discretization of the two-dimensional isometry-constrained macroscopic problem. Finally, the convergence properties are numerically verified in selected test cases and qualitatively compared with deformation experiments for microstructured sheets of paper.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Along with the practical success of the discovery of dynamics using deep learning, the theoretical analysis of this approach has attracted increasing attention. Prior works have established the grid error estimation with auxiliary conditions for the discovery of dynamics using linear multistep methods and deep learning. And we extend the existing error analysis in this work. We first introduce the concept of inverse modified differential equations (IMDE) for linear multistep methods and show that the learned model returns a close approximation of the IMDE. Based on the IMDE, we prove that the error between the discovered system and the target system is bounded by the sum of the LMM discretization error and the learning loss. Furthermore, the learning loss is quantified by combining the approximation and generalization theories of neural networks, and thereby we obtain the priori error estimates. Several numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical analysis.},

After a spatial semidiscretization, we use the Lagrange multiplier approach to derive a coupled forward-backward optimality system, which can then be solved using a time domain decomposition. Due to the forward-backward structure of the optimality system, three variants can be found for the Dirichlet–Neumann and Neumann–Dirichlet algorithms. We analyze their convergence behavior and determine the optimal relaxation parameter for each algorithm. Our analysis reveals that the most natural algorithms are actually only good smoothers, and there are better choices which lead to efficient solvers.

Our key finding is that coupling the number of random point evaluations with the choice of projection dimension, one can derive probabilistic convergence rates for the reconstruction error of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. Convergence rates in expectation are derived with a ML estimator complemented with a norm-based cutoff operation. Moreover, we prove that the obtained rates are minimax optimal.},

Based on the projection, we construct a second order Crank–Nicolson type finite difference scheme, which is linear (exclude the very efficient projection part), positivity preserving, and mass conserving. Rigorous error estimates in the norm are established, which are both second order accurate in space and time. The other choice of projection, e.g., projection, is discussed.

While DDMs have been extensively studied for linear problems, their application to fully nonlinear PDEs remains limited in the literature. To address this gap, we establish a proof of global convergence of these new iterative algorithms using a discrete comparison principle argument. We also provide a specific implementation for the Monge–Ampère equation. Several numerical tests are performed to validate the convergence theorem. These numerical experiments involve examples of varying regularity. Computational experiments show that method is efficient, robust, and requires relatively few iterations to converge. The results reveal great potential for DDM methods to lead to highly efficient and parallelizable solvers for large-scale problems that are computationally intractable using existing solution methods.},

In this article, we employ the construction of the time-marching discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) scheme we developed for linear problems to derive high-order multistage DPG methods for nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. The methodology extends to abstract evolution equations in Banach spaces, including a class of nonlinear partial differential equations. We present three nested multistage methods: the hybrid Euler method and the two- and three-stage DPG methods. We employ a linearization of the problem as in exponential Rosenbrock methods, so we need to compute exponential actions of the Jacobian that change from time step to time step. The key point of our construction is that one of the stages can be postprocessed from another without an extra exponential step. Therefore, the class of methods we introduce is computationally cheaper than the classical exponential Rosenbrock methods. We provide a full convergence proof to show that the methods are second-, third-, and fourth-order accurate, respectively. We test the convergence in time of our methods on a 2D+time semilinear partial differential equation after a semidiscretization in space.},

A variational formulation of the Ventcel problem is studied, leading to a finite element discretization. The focus is on the construction of high-order curved meshes for the discretization of the physical domain and on the definition of the lift operator, which is aimed at transforming a function defined on the mesh domain into a function defined on the physical one. This lift is defined in such a way as to satisfy adapted properties on the boundary relative to the trace operator. The Ventcel problem approximation is investigated both in terms of geometrical error and of finite element approximation error. Error estimates are obtained both in terms of the mesh order and to the finite element degree , whereas such estimates usually have been considered in the isoparametric case so far, involving a single parameter . The numerical experiments we led in both 2 and 3 dimensions allow us to validate the results obtained and proved on the a priori error estimates depending on the 2 parameters and .

For “good” potential and nonlinearity (-potential and ), we establish an optimal second-order error bound in the -norm. For low regularity potential and nonlinearity (-potential and ), we obtain a first-order -norm error bound accompanied with a uniform -norm bound of the numerical solution. Moreover, adopting a new technique of regularity compensation oscillation to analyze error cancellation, for some nonresonant time steps, the optimal second-order -norm error bound is proved under a weaker assumption on the nonlinearity: . For all the cases, we also present corresponding fractional order error bounds in the -norm, which is the natural norm in terms of energy. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error estimates and to demonstrate the superiority of the sEWI, including much weaker regularity requirements on potential and nonlinearity, and excellent long-time behavior with near-conservation of mass and energy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiscale partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in various applications, and several schemes have been developed to solve them efficiently. Homogenization theory is a powerful methodology that eliminates the small-scale dependence, resulting in simplified equations that are computationally tractable while accurately predicting the macroscopic response. In the field of continuum mechanics, homogenization is crucial for deriving constitutive laws that incorporate microscale physics in order to formulate balance laws for the macroscopic quantities of interest. However, obtaining homogenized constitutive laws is often challenging as they do not in general have an analytic form and can exhibit phenomena not present on the microscale. In response, data-driven learning of the constitutive law has been proposed as appropriate for this task. However, a major challenge in data-driven learning approaches for this problem has remained unexplored: the impact of discontinuities and corner interfaces in the underlying material. These discontinuities in the coefficients affect the smoothness of the solutions of the underlying equations. Given the prevalence of discontinuous materials in continuum mechanics applications, it is important to address the challenge of learning in this context, in particular, to develop underpinning theory that establishes the reliability of data-driven methods in this scientific domain. The paper addresses this unexplored challenge by investigating the learnability of homogenized constitutive laws for elliptic operators in the presence of such complexities. Approximation theory is presented, and numerical experiments are performed which validate the theory in the context of learning the solution operator defined by the cell problem arising in homogenization for elliptic PDEs.},

Finite element methods and kinematically coupled schemes that decouple the fluid velocity and structure displacement have been extensively studied for incompressible fluid-structure interactions (FSIs) over the past decade. While these methods are known to be stable and easy to implement, optimal error analysis has remained challenging. Previous work has primarily relied on the classical elliptic projection technique, which is only suitable for parabolic problems and does not lead to optimal convergence of numerical solutions for the FSI problems in the standard norm. In this article, we propose a new stable fully discrete kinematically coupled scheme for the incompressible FSI thin-structure model and establish a new approach for the numerical analysis of FSI problems in terms of a newly introduced coupled nonstationary Ritz projection, which allows us to prove the optimal-order convergence of the proposed method in the norm. The methodology presented in this article is also applicable to numerous other FSI models and serves as a fundamental tool for advancing research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by polynomial approximations of differential forms, we study analytical and numerical properties of a polynomial interpolation problem that relies on function averages over interval segments. The usage of segment data gives rise to new theoretical and practical aspects that distinguish this problem considerably from classical nodal interpolation. We will analyze fundamental mathematical properties of this problem as existence, uniqueness, and numerical conditioning of its solution. In a few selected scenarios, we will provide concrete conditions for unisolvence and explicit Lagrange-type basis systems for its representation. To study the numerical conditioning, we will provide respective concrete bounds for the Lebesgue constant.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider nonlinear delay differential and renewal equations with infinite delay. We extend the work of Gyllenberg et al. [Appl. Math. Comput., 333 (2018), pp. 490–505] by introducing a unifying abstract framework, and we derive a finite-dimensional approximating system via pseudospectral discretization. For renewal equations, we consider a reformulation in the space of absolutely continuous functions via integration. We prove the one-to-one correspondence of equilibria between the original equation and its approximation, and that linearization and discretization commute. Our most important result is the proof of convergence of the characteristic roots of the pseudospectral approximation of the linear(ized) equations when the collocation nodes are chosen as the family of scaled zeros or extrema of Laguerre polynomials. This ensures that the finite-dimensional system correctly reproduces the stability properties of the original linear equation if the dimension of the approximation is large enough. The result is illustrated with several numerical tests, which also demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for the bifurcation analysis of equilibria of nonlinear equations. The new approach used to prove convergence also provides the exact location of the spectrum of the differentiation matrices for the Laguerre zeros and extrema, adding new insights into properties that are important in the numerical solution of differential equations by pseudospectral methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quasiperiodic systems, related to irrational numbers, are space-filling structures without decay or translation invariance. How to accurately recover these systems, especially for low-regularity cases, presents a big challenge in numerical computation. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, the finite points recovery (FPR) method, which is available for both continuous and low-regularity cases, to address this challenge. The FPR method first establishes a homomorphism between the lower-dimensional definition domain of quasiperiodic function and the higher-dimensional torus, and then recovers the global quasiperiodic system by employing an interpolation technique with finite points in the definition domain without dimensional lifting. Furthermore, we develop accurate and efficient strategies of selecting finite points according to the arithmetic properties of irrational numbers. The corresponding mathematical theory, convergence analysis, and computational complexity analysis on choosing finite points are presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the FPR approach in recovering both continuous quasiperiodic functions and piecewise constant Fibonacci quasicrystals while existing spectral methods encounter difficulties in recovering piecewise constant quasiperiodic functions.},

When applying the classical multistep schemes for solving differential equations, one often faces the dilemma that smaller time steps are needed with higher-order schemes, making it impractical to use high-order schemes for stiff problems. We construct in this paper a new class of BDF and implicit-explicit schemes for parabolic type equations based on the Taylor expansions at time with being a tunable parameter. These new schemes, with a suitable , allow larger time steps at higher order for stiff problems than that which is allowed with a usual higher-order scheme. For parabolic type equations, we identify an explicit uniform multiplier for the new second- to fourth-order schemes and conduct rigorously stability and error analysis by using the energy argument. We also present ample numerical examples to validate our findings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This work proposes a discretization of the acoustic wave equation with possibly oscillatory coefficients based on a superposition of discrete solutions to spatially localized subproblems computed with an implicit time discretization. Based on exponentially decaying entries of the global system matrices and an appropriate partition of unity, it is proved that the superposition of localized solutions is appropriately close to the solution of the (global) implicit scheme. It is thereby justified that the localized (and especially parallel) computation on multiple overlapping subdomains is reasonable. Moreover, a restart is introduced after a certain number of time steps to maintain a moderate overlap of the subdomains. Overall, the approach may be understood as a domain decomposition strategy in space on successive short time intervals that completely avoids inner iterations. Numerical examples are presented.},

In this paper, we define and give explicit examples of interior -dispersion-relation-preserving schemes, of interior order of accuracy 4, 5, 6, and 7, with a complete methodology to construct them. These are dual-pair finite-difference schemes for systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations which satisfy the summation-by-parts principle and preserve the dispersion relation of the continuous problem uniformly to an error tolerance for their interior stencil. We give a general framework to design provably stable finite-difference operators whose interior stencil preserves the dispersion relation for hyperbolic systems such as the elastic wave equation. The operators we derive here can resolve the highest frequency (-mode) present on any equidistant grid at a tolerance of maximum error within the interior stencil, with minimal extra stencil points. As standard finite-difference schemes have a dispersion error for high-frequency components, fine meshes must be used to resolve these components. Our derived schemes may compute solutions with the same accuracy as traditional schemes on far coarser meshes, which in high dimensions significantly improves the computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work we connect machine learning techniques, in particular kernel machine learning, to inverse source and scattering problems. We show the proposed kernel machine learning has demonstrated generalization capability and has a rigorous mathematical foundation. The proposed learning is based on the Mercer kernel, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the kernel trick, as well as the mathematical theory of inverse source and scattering theory, and the restricted Fourier integral operator. The kernel machine learns a multilayer neural network which outputs an -neighborhood average of the unknown or its nonlinear transformation. We then apply the general architecture to the multifrequency inverse source problem for a fixed observation direction and the Born inverse medium scattering problem. We establish a mathematically justified kernel machine indicator with demonstrated capability in both shape identification and parameter identification, under very general assumptions on the physical unknowns. More importantly, stability estimates are established in the case of both noiseless and noisy measurement data. Of central importance is the interplay between a restricted Fourier integral operator and a corresponding Sturm–Liouville differential operator. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed kernel machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we first derive a time-dependent Maxwell’s equation model for simulating wave propagation in anisotropic dispersive media and hyperbolic metamaterials. The modeling equations are obtained by using the Drude–Lorentz model to approximate both the permittivity and permeability. Then we develop a time-domain finite element method and prove its discrete stability and optimal error estimate. This mathematical model and the proposed numerical method can be used to design effective hyperbolic superlenses by the dielectric-metal multilayer metamaterials in different frequency ranges. Extensive two-dimensional (2D) and 3D numerical results are presented to demonstrate the good performance of many 2D and 3D hyperbolic superlenses in different frequency ranges. This is the first finite element paper on solving the hyperbolic metamaterials in a time domain.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the multi-frequency factorization method for imaging the support of a wave-number-dependent source function. It is supposed that the source function is given by the inverse Fourier transform of some time-dependent source with a priori given radiating period. Using the multi-frequency far-field data at a fixed observation direction, we provide a computational criterion for characterizing the smallest strip containing the support and perpendicular to the observation direction. The far-field data from sparse observation directions can be used to recover a -convex polygon of the support. The inversion algorithm is proven valid even with multi-frequency near-field data in three dimensions. The connections to time-dependent inverse source problems are discussed in the near-field case. Numerical tests in both two and three dimensions are implemented to show effectiveness and feasibility of the approach. This paper provides numerical analysis for a frequency-domain approach to recover the support of an admissible class of time-dependent sources.},

We apply this methodology to various integration schemes which are popular in the molecular dynamics and machine learning communities. Further, we introduce the property “-limit convergent” to characterize underdamped Langevin schemes that converge to overdamped dynamics in the high-friction limit and which have step size restrictions that are independent of the friction parameter; we show that this property is not generic by exhibiting methods from both the class and its complement. Finally, we provide asymptotic bias estimates for the BAOAB scheme, which remain accurate in the high-friction limit by comparison to a modified stochastic dynamics which preserves the invariant measure.},

We prove a new numerical approximation result for the solutions of semilinear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations, driven by additive space-time white noise in dimension 1. The temporal discretization is performed using an accelerated exponential Euler scheme, and we show that, under appropriate regularity conditions on the nonlinearity, the total variation distance between the distributions of the numerical approximation and of the exact solution at a given time converges to 0 when the time-step size vanishes, with order of convergence . Equivalently, weak error estimates with order are thus obtained for bounded measurable test functions. This is an original and major improvement compared with the performance of the standard linear implicit Euler scheme or exponential Euler methods, which do not converge in the sense of total variation when the time-step size vanishes. Equivalently weak error estimates for the standard schemes require twice differentiable test functions. The proof of the total variation error bounds for the accelerated exponential Euler scheme exploits some regularization property of the associated infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations.},

All proofs are based on a probabilistic reformulation recently considered in the literature. The first scheme is a version of the time-stepping scheme studied by Kaushansky et al. [Ann. Appl. Probab., 33 (2023), pp. 274–298], but here the flux over the free boundary and its velocity are coupled implicitly. Moreover, we extend the analysis to more general driving processes than Brownian motion. The second scheme is a Donsker-type approximation, also interpretable as an implicit finite difference scheme, for which global convergence is shown under minor technical conditions. With stronger assumptions, which apply in cases without blow-ups, we obtain additionally a convergence rate arbitrarily close to 1/2. Our numerical results suggest that this rate also holds for less regular solutions, in contrast to explicit schemes, and allow a sharper resolution of the discontinuous free boundary in the blow-up regime.},

The nonlocal model involves an integral over the range measured by a horizon parameter and it recovers the local Lighthill–Richards–Whitham model as the nonlocal horizon parameter goes to zero. Good numerical schemes for simulating these parameterized nonlocal traffic flow models should be robust with respect to the change of the model parameters but this has not been systematically investigated in the literature. We fill this gap through a careful study of a class of finite volume numerical schemes with suitable discretizations of the nonlocal integral, which include several schemes proposed in the literature and their variants. Our main contributions are to demonstrate the asymptotically compatibility of the schemes, which includes both the uniform convergence of the numerical solutions to the unique solution of nonlocal continuum model for a given positive horizon parameter and the convergence to the unique entropy solution of the local model as the mesh size and the nonlocal horizon parameter go to zero simultaneously. It is shown that with the asymptotically compatibility, the schemes can provide robust numerical computation under the changes of the nonlocal horizon parameter.},

Except for sporadic-clustering at some spots, they become relatively far apart as the dimension of the ambient space grows. These features defy any theoretical treatment that requires local or global quasi-uniformity of distribution of data sites. Incorporating a recently-developed application of integral operator theory in machine learning, we propose and study in the current article a new framework to analyze kernel interpolation of high-dimensional data, which features bounding stochastic approximation error by the spectrum of the underlying kernel matrix. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that spectra of kernel matrices are reliable and stable barometers for gauging the performance of kernel-interpolation methods for high-dimensional data.},

Numerical approximations that mirror this property are said to be asymptotic preserving. In this paper we build a discontinuous Galerkin method to the semiconductor model, and we show this scheme is both uniformly stable in , where 1/ is the scale of the collision frequency, and asymptotic preserving. In particular, we discuss what properties the discrete Maxwellian must satisfy in order for the schemes to converge in to an accurate -approximation of the drift-diffusion limit.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, a novel mixed spectral-Galerkin method is proposed and studied for a Maxwell transmission eigenvalue problem in a spherical domain. The method utilizes vector spherical harmonics to achieve dimension reduction. By introducing an auxiliary vector function, the original problem is rewritten as an equivalent fourth-order coupled linear eigensystem, which is further decomposed into a sequence of one-dimensional fourth-order decoupled transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. Based on compact embedding theory and the spectral approximation property of compact operators, error estimates for both eigenvalue and eigenfunction approximations are established for the TE mode. For the TM mode, an efficient essential polar condition and a high-order polynomial approximation method are designed to cope with the singularity and complexity caused by the coupled boundary conditions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm.},

Our method works effectively to compute the first several eigenpairs, including both multiple and clustered eigenvalues with corresponding eigenfunctions, particularly. The method is highly parallelizable by constructing a new and efficient preconditioner using an overlapping domain decomposition (DD). It only requires computing a couple of small scale parallel subproblems and a quite small scale eigenvalue problem per iteration. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the convergence rate of the method is bounded by , where is the diameter of subdomains and is the overlapping size among subdomains. The constant is independent of the mesh size and the internal gaps among the target eigenvalues, demonstrating that our method is optimal and cluster robust. Meanwhile, the -dependent constant decreases monotonically to 1, as , which means that more subdomains lead to the better convergence rate. Numerical results supporting our theory are given.},

Our method is based on the global trapezoidal rule and trigonometric interpolation, resulting in an explicit quadrature formula. The method achieves spectral accuracy for nearly singular integrals on closed analytic curves. In order to extract the singularity from the complexified distance function, an efficient root finding method is proposed based on contour integration. Through the change of variables, we also extend the quadrature method to integrals on the piecewise analytic curves. Numerical examples for Laplace and Helmholtz equations show that high-order accuracy can be achieved for arbitrarily close field evaluation.},

We introduce a predictor-corrector discretization scheme for the numerical integration of a class of stochastic differential equations and prove that it converges with weak order 1.0. The key feature of the new scheme is that it builds up sequentially (and recursively) in the dimension of the state space of the solution, hence making it suitable for approximations of high-dimensional state space models. We show, using the stochastic Lorenz 96 system as a test model, that the proposed method can operate with larger time steps than the standard Euler–Maruyama scheme and, therefore, generate valid approximations with a smaller computational cost. We also introduce the theoretical analysis of the error incurred by the new predictor-corrector scheme when used as a building block for discrete-time Bayesian filters for continuous-time systems. Finally, we assess the performance of several ensemble Kalman filters that incorporate the proposed sequential predictor-corrector Euler scheme and the standard Euler–Maruyama method. The numerical experiments show that the filters employing the new sequential scheme can operate with larger time steps, smaller Monte Carlo ensembles, and noisier systems.},

In both cases, the normal component of the velocity is constrained using a multiplier, different from the standard pressure approximation. The divergence of the approximate velocities is pointwise zero over the whole mesh domain, and we derive optimal error estimates for the velocity and pressures, where the error constant is independent of how the physical domain intersects the computational mesh, and of the regularity of the pressure multiplier imposing the divergence-free condition.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain or random inputs have been considered in many studies of uncertainty quantification. In forward uncertainty quantification, one is interested in analyzing the stochastic response of the PDE subject to input uncertainty, which usually involves solving high-dimensional integrals of the PDE output over a sequence of stochastic variables. In practical computations, one typically needs to discretize the problem in several ways: approximating an infinite-dimensional input random field with a finite-dimensional random field, spatial discretization of the PDE using, e.g., finite elements, and approximating high-dimensional integrals using cubatures such as quasi–Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, we focus on the error resulting from dimension truncation of an input random field. We show how Taylor series can be used to derive theoretical dimension truncation rates for a wide class of problems and we provide a simple checklist of conditions that a parametric mathematical model needs to satisfy in order for our dimension truncation error bound to hold. Some of the novel features of our approach include that our results are applicable to nonaffine parametric operator equations, dimensionally truncated conforming finite element discretized solutions of parametric PDEs, and even compositions of PDE solutions with smooth nonlinear quantities of interest. As a specific application of our method, we derive an improved dimension truncation error bound for elliptic PDEs with lognormally parameterized diffusion coefficients. Numerical examples support our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Cell average decomposition (CAD) plays a critical role in constructing bound-preserving (BP) high-order discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Seeking optimal CAD (OCAD) that attains the mildest BP Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition is a fundamentally important yet difficult problem. The classic CAD, proposed in 2010 by Zhang and Shu using the Gauss–Lobatto quadrature, has been widely used over the past decade. Zhang and Shu only checked for the 1D and spaces that their classic CAD is optimal. However, we recently discovered that the classic CAD is generally not optimal for the multidimensional and spaces. Yet, it remained unknown for a decade what CAD is optimal for higher-degree polynomial spaces, especially in multiple dimensions. This paper presents the first systematical analysis and establishes the general theory on the OCAD problem, which lays a foundation for designing more efficient BP schemes. The analysis is very nontrivial and involves novel techniques from several branches of mathematics, including Carathéodory’s theorem from convex geometry, and the invariant theory of symmetric group in abstract algebra. Most notably, we discover that the OCAD problem is closely related to polynomial optimization of a positive linear functional on the positive polynomial cone, thereby establishing four useful criteria for examining the optimality of a feasible CAD. Using the established theory, we rigorously prove that the classic CAD is optimal for general 1D spaces and general 2D spaces of an arbitrary . For the widely used 2D spaces, the classic CAD is, however, not optimal, and we develop a generic approach to find out the genuine OCAD and propose a more practical quasi-optimal CAD, both of which provide much milder BP CFL conditions than the classic CAD yet require much fewer nodes. These findings notably improve the efficiency of general high-order BP methods for a large class of hyperbolic equations while requiring only a minor adjustment of the implementation code. The notable advantages in efficiency are further confirmed by numerical results.},

The discretization of the problem is further shown to be asymptotic preserving regarding the same limit, which ensures that a numerical method can be applied uniformly and the solutions converge to the one of the OT problem automatically. Particularly, there exists a critical value, which is independent of the mesh size, such that the discrete problem reduces to the discrete OT problem for being larger than this critical value. The discrete problem is solved by a convergent primal-dual hybrid algorithm and the iterates for UOT are also shown to converge to that for OT. Finally, numerical experiments on shape deformation and partial color transfer are implemented to validate the theoretical convergence and the proposed numerical algorithm.},

For parameter-dependent norms, we achieve uniform boundedness by the inclusion of face bubble functions that are polynomials on faces and decay exponentially in the interior. As an example, we consider a canonical DPG setting for reaction-dominated diffusion. Our test spaces guarantee uniform stability and quasi-optimal convergence of the scheme. We present numerical experiments that illustrate the loss of stability and error control by the residual for small diffusion coefficient when using standard polynomial test spaces, whereas we observe uniform stability and error control with our construction.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this manuscript, an original numerical procedure for the nonlinear peridynamics on arbitrarily shaped two-dimensional (2D) closed manifolds is proposed. When dealing with non-parameterized 2D manifolds at the discrete scale, the problem of computing geodesic distances between two non-adjacent points arise. Here, a routing procedure is implemented for computing geodesic distances by reinterpreting the triangular computational mesh as a non-oriented graph, thus returning a suitable and general method. Moreover, the time integration of the peridynamics equation is demanded to a P-(EC) formulation of the implicit -Newmark scheme. The convergence of the overall proposed procedure is questioned and rigorously proved. Its abilities and limitations are analyzed by simulating the evolution of a 2D sphere. The performed numerical investigations are mainly motivated by the issues related to the insurgence of singularities in the evolution problem. The obtained results return an interesting picture of the role played by the nonlocal character of the integrodifferential equation in the intricate processes leading to the spontaneous formation of singularities in real materials.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The aim of this paper is to carry out convergence analysis and algorithm implementation of a novel sample-wise backpropagation method for training a class of stochastic neural networks (SNNs). The preliminary discussion on such an SNN framework was first introduced in [Archibald et al., Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. Ser. S, 15 (2022), pp. 2807–2835]. The structure of the SNN is formulated as a discretization of a stochastic differential equation (SDE). A stochastic optimal control framework is introduced to model the training procedure, and a sample-wise approximation scheme for the adjoint backward SDE is applied to improve the efficiency of the stochastic optimal control solver, which is equivalent to the backpropagation for training the SNN. The convergence analysis is derived by introducing a novel joint conditional expectation for the gradient process. Under the convexity assumption, our result indicates that the number of SNN training steps should be proportional to the square of the number of layers in the convex optimization case. In the implementation of the sample-based SNN algorithm with the benchmark MNIST dataset, we adopt the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and demonstrate that our sample-based SNN algorithm is more robust than the conventional CNN.},

We consider approximating the integral of a function by the median of several integral estimates under independent and random choices of the underlying QMC point sets (either linearly scrambled digital nets or infinite-precision polynomial lattice point sets). Even though our approach does not require any information on the smoothness and weights of a target function space as an input, we can prove a probabilistic upper bound on the worst-case error for the respective weighted function space, where the failure probability converges to 0 exponentially fast as the number of estimates increases. Our obtained rates of convergence are nearly optimal for function spaces with finite smoothness, and we can attain a dimension-independent super-polynomial convergence for a class of infinitely differentiable functions. This implies that our median-based QMC rule is universal in the sense that it does not need to be adjusted to the smoothness and the weights of the function spaces and yet exhibits the nearly optimal rate of convergence.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we introduce a new simple approach to developing and establishing the convergence of splitting methods for a large class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), including additive, diagonal, and scalar noise types. The central idea is to view the splitting method as a replacement of the driving signal of an SDE, namely, Brownian motion and time, with a piecewise linear path that yields a sequence of ODEs—which can be discretized to produce a numerical scheme. This new way of understanding splitting methods is inspired by, but does not use, rough path theory. We show that when the driving piecewise linear path matches certain iterated stochastic integrals of Brownian motion, then a high order splitting method can be obtained. We propose a general proof methodology for establishing the strong convergence of these approximations that is akin to the general framework of Milstein and Tretyakov. That is, once local error estimates are obtained for the splitting method, then a global rate of convergence follows. This approach can then be readily applied in future research on SDE splitting methods. By incorporating recently developed approximations for iterated integrals of Brownian motion into these piecewise linear paths, we propose several high order splitting methods for SDEs satisfying a certain commutativity condition. In our experiments, which include the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model and additive noise SDEs (noisy anharmonic oscillator, stochastic FitzHugh–Nagumo model, underdamped Langevin dynamics), the new splitting methods exhibit convergence rates of and outperform schemes previously proposed in the literature.},

To that end, we characterize the Fréchet derivatives of the eigenpairs with respect to the perturbation and provide a new linear characterization for eigenpairs of higher multiplicity.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Quasiperiodic systems are important space-filling ordered structures, without decay and translational invariance. How to solve quasiperiodic systems accurately and efficiently is a great challenge. A useful approach, the projection method (PM) [J. Comput. Phys., 256 (2014), pp. 428–440], has been proposed to compute quasiperiodic systems. Various studies have demonstrated that the PM is an accurate and efficient method to solve quasiperiodic systems. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis of the PM. In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of the PM by establishing a mathematical framework of quasiperiodic functions and their high-dimensional periodic functions. We also give a theoretical analysis of the quasiperiodic spectral method (QSM) based on this framework. Results demonstrate that the PM and QSM both have exponential decay, and the QSM (PM) is a generalization of the periodic Fourier spectral (pseudospectral) method. Then, we analyze the computational complexity of the PM and QSM in calculating quasiperiodic systems. The PM can use a fast Fourier transform, while the QSM cannot. Moreover, we investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the PM, QSM, and periodic approximation method in solving the linear time-dependent quasiperiodic Schrödinger equation.},

We introduce a numerical approach to computing the Schrödinger map (SM) based on the Hasimoto transform which relates the SM flow to a cubic nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation. In exploiting this nonlinear transform we are able to introduce the first fully explicit unconditionally stable symmetric integrators for the SM equation. Our approach consists of two parts: an integration of the NLS equation followed by the numerical evaluation of the Hasimoto transform. Motivated by the desire to study rough solutions to the SM equation, we also introduce a new symmetric low-regularity integrator for the NLS equation. This is combined with our novel fast low-regularity Hasimoto (FLowRH) transform, based on a tailored analysis of the resonance structures in the Magnus expansion and a fast realization based on block-Toeplitz partitions, to yield an efficient low-regularity integrator for the SM equation. This scheme in particular allows us to obtain approximations to the SM in a more general regime (i.e., under lower-regularity assumptions) than previously proposed methods. The favorable properties of our methods are exhibited both in theoretical convergence analysis and in numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce an efficient numerical method for second-order linear ODEs whose solution may vary between highly oscillatory and slowly changing over the solution interval. In oscillatory regions the solution is generated via a nonoscillatory phase function that obeys the nonlinear Riccati equation. We propose a defect correction iteration that gives an asymptotic series for such a phase function; this is numerically approximated on a Chebyshev grid with a small number of nodes. For analytic coefficients we prove that each iteration, up to a certain maximum number, reduces the residual by a factor of order of the local frequency. The algorithm adapts both the stepsize and the choice of method, switching to a conventional spectral collocation method away from oscillatory regions. In numerical experiments we find that our proposal outperforms other state-of-the-art oscillatory solvers, most significantly at low to intermediate frequencies and at low tolerances, where it may use up to times fewer function evaluations. Even in high-frequency regimes, our implementation is on average 10 times faster than other specialized solvers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Surface Stokes and Navier–Stokes equations are used to model fluid flow on surfaces. They have attracted significant recent attention in the numerical analysis literature because approximation of their solutions poses significant challenges not encountered in the Euclidean context. One challenge comes from the need to simultaneously enforce tangentiality and conformity (continuity) of discrete vector fields used to approximate solutions in the velocity-pressure formulation. Existing methods in the literature all enforce one of these two constraints weakly either by penalization or by use of Lagrange multipliers. Missing so far is a robust and systematic construction of surface Stokes finite element spaces which employ nodal degrees of freedom, including MINI, Taylor–Hood, Scott–Vogelius, and other composite elements which can lead to divergence-conforming or pressure-robust discretizations. In this paper we construct surface MINI spaces whose velocity fields are tangential. They are not -conforming, but do lie in and do not require penalization to achieve optimal convergence rates. We prove stability and optimal-order energy-norm convergence of the method and demonstrate optimal-order convergence of the velocity field in via numerical experiments. The core advance in the paper is the construction of nodal degrees of freedom for the velocity field. This technique also may be used to construct surface counterparts to many other standard Euclidean Stokes spaces, and we accordingly present numerical experiments indicating optimal-order convergence of nonconforming tangential surface Taylor–Hood elements.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The formulation of mean field games (MFG) typically requires continuous differentiability of the Hamiltonian in order to determine the advective term in the Kolmogorov–Fokker–Planck equation for the density of players. However, in many cases of practical interest, the underlying optimal control problem may exhibit bang-bang controls, which typically lead to nondifferentiable Hamiltonians. We develop the analysis and numerical analysis of stationary MFG for the general case of convex, Lipschitz, but possibly nondifferentiable Hamiltonians. In particular, we propose a generalization of the MFG system as a partial differential inclusion (PDI) based on interpreting the derivative of the Hamiltonian in terms of subdifferentials of convex functions. We establish the existence of a weak solution to the MFG PDI system, and we further prove uniqueness under a similar monotonicity condition to the one considered by Lasry and Lions. We then propose a monotone finite element discretization of the problem, and we prove strong -norm convergence of the approximations of the value function and strong -norm convergence of the approximations of the density function. We illustrate the performance of the numerical method in numerical experiments featuring nonsmooth solutions.},

With the understanding of we analyze the nonregularized first-order implicit-explicit scheme for the LogSE.

Our new error bounds greatly improve the existing results for the NLSE with low regularity potential and/or nonlinearity.

An emerging tool to efficiently reduce computational costs and memory footprint in such settings is dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA). Despite its efficiency, numerical methods for DLRA need to be carefully constructed to guarantee stability while preserving crucial properties of the original problem. Important physical effects that one likes to preserve with DLRA include capturing the diffusion limit in the high-scattering regimes as well as dissipating energy. In this work we propose and analyze a dynamical low-rank method based on the “unconventional” basis update &amp; Galerkin step integrator. We show that this method is asymptotic preserving, i.e., it captures the diffusion limit, and energy stable under a CFL condition. The derived CFL condition captures the transition from the hyperbolic to the parabolic regime when approaching the diffusion limit.},

This paper outlines the first algebraic theory of WSO, and establishes general order barriers that relate the WSO of a RK scheme to its order and number of stages for both fully-implicit and DIRK schemes. It is shown in several scenarios that the constructed bounds are sharp. The theory characterizes WSO in terms of orthogonal invariant subspaces and associated minimal polynomials. The resulting necessary conditions on the structure of RK methods with WSO are then shown to be of practical use for the construction of such schemes.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Lattice Green’s functions (LGFs) are fundamental solutions to discretized linear operators, and as such they are a useful tool for solving discretized elliptic PDEs on domains that are unbounded in one or more directions. The majority of existing numerical solvers that make use of LGFs rely on a second-order discretization and operate on domains with free-space boundary conditions in all directions. Under these conditions, fast expansion methods are available that enable precomputation of 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional (3D) LGFs in linear time, avoiding the need for brute-force multidimensional quadrature of numerically unstable integrals. Here we focus on higher-order discretizations of the Laplace operator on domains with more general boundary conditions, by (1) providing an algorithm for fast and accurate evaluation of the LGFs associated with high-order dimension-split centered finite differences on unbounded domains, and (2) deriving closed-form expressions for the LGFs associated with both dimension-split and Mehrstellen discretizations on domains with one unbounded dimension. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate that these techniques provide LGF evaluations with near machine-precision accuracy, and that the resulting LGFs allow for numerically consistent solutions to high-order discretizations of the Poisson’s equation on fully or partially unbounded 3D domains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One of the core problems in mean-field control and mean-field games is to solve the corresponding McKean–Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs). Most existing methods are tailored to special cases in which the mean-field interaction only depends on expectation or other moments and thus are inadequate to solve problems when the mean-field interaction has full distribution dependence. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for computing MV-FBSDEs with a general form of mean-field interactions. Specifically, built on fictitious play, we recast the problem into repeatedly solving standard FBSDEs with explicit coefficient functions. These coefficient functions are used to approximate the MV-FBSDEs’ model coefficients with full distribution dependence, and are updated by solving another supervising learning problem using training data simulated from the last iteration’s FBSDE solutions. We use deep neural networks to solve standard BSDEs and approximate coefficient functions in order to solve high-dimensional MV-FBSDEs. Under proper assumptions on the learned functions, we prove that the convergence of the proposed method is free of the curse of dimensionality (CoD) by using a class of integral probability metrics previously developed in [J. Han, R. Hu, and J. Long, Stochastic Process. Appl., 164 (2023), pp. 242–287]. The proved theorem shows the advantage of the method in high dimensions. We present the numerical performance in high-dimensional MV-FBSDE problems, including a mean-field game example of the well-known Cucker–Smale model, the cost of which depends on the full distribution of the forward process.},
