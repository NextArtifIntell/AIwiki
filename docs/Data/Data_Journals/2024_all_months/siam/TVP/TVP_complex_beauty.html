We investigate the composition of the urn at different stages of drawing. Assuming the urn starts with $n$ balls, of which $\alpha n + g(n)$, with $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and $g(n) = o(n)$, are white, we find a major phase transition between a sublinear number of draws $j = o(n)$ and the linear case in which $j = \theta n + h(n)$. In both sublinear and linear phases, we get central limit theorems; however, the normalization in each phase is significantly different. The interplay of the different forces, such as $\theta$, $\alpha$, and the perturbation functions $g(n)$ and $h(n)$, enforce a number of restrictions and influences the parameterization in the central limit theorem. The methods of proof are based on recurrence, martingales, and asymptotic analysis. We then discuss two possible applications of this class. One application is a generalized OK Corral urn, and the other is on the dynamics of market depth in the stock market.},

A particle may transit only to neighboring points of $\mathbf{Z}_+$, i.e., for each single motion of the particle, its coordinate changes by 1. The sojourn time of the particle at a point depends on its coordinate. The process is equipped with a branching mechanism. Branching sources may be located at each point of $\mathbf{Z}_+$. We do not assume that the intensities are uniformly bounded. At a moment of branching, new particles appear at the branching point and then evolve independently of one another (and of the other particles) by the same rules as the original particle. To such a branching Markov process there corresponds a Jacobi matrix. In terms of orthogonal polynomials corresponding to this matrix, we obtain formulas for the mean number of particles at an arbitrary fixed point of $\mathbf{Z}_+$ at time $t&gt;0$. The results obtained are applied to some concrete models, an exact value for the mean number of particles in terms of special functions is given, and an asymptotic formula for this quantity for large time is presented.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian random fields on finite-dimensional smooth manifolds, whose variance functions reach their maximum values at smooth submanifolds, are considered, and the exact asymptotic behavior of large excursion probabilities is established. It is shown that our conditions on the behavior of the covariation and variance are best possible in the context of the classical Pickands double sum method. Applications of our asymptotic formulas to large deviations of Gaussian vector processes are considered, and some examples are given. This paper continues the previous study of the author with Kobelkov, Rodionov, and Hashorva [J. Math. Sci., 262 (2022), pp. 504--513] which was concerned with Gaussian processes and fields on manifolds with a single point of maximum of the variance.},

  abstract     = {Consider the random process $Y(t)=at-\nu_+(pt)+\nu_-(-qt)$, $t\in(-\infty,\infty)$, where $\nu_{\pm}(t)$ are independent standard Poisson processes for $t\geqslant 0$ and $\nu_{\pm}(t)=0$ for $t&lt;0$. The parameters $a$, $p$, and $q$ are such that $\mathbf{E}Y(t)&lt;0$, $t\neq0$. We evaluate the sums $\varphi_m(z,r)=\sum_{k\geq0}(re^{-r})^{k}(z+k)^{m+k-1}/k!$, $m=1,2,\dots$, $z\geq0$, of function series with parameter $ r\in(0,1) $. These series are used for recursive evaluation of the moments $\mathbf{E}(t^*)^m$, $m\geq 1$, for the time $t^*$ when the trajectory of the process $Y(t)$ attains its maximum value. The results obtained are applied to the problem of estimating the parameter $\theta$ from $n$ observations with density $f(x,\theta)$, which has a jump at the point $x=x(\theta)$, $x&#39;(\theta)\neq 0$. If $\widehat\theta_n$ is a maximum likelihood estimator for the true parameter $\theta_0$, then the limit distribution as $n\to\infty$ for the normalized estimators $n(\widehat\theta_n-\theta_0)$ is the distribution of the argument of the maximum $t^*_{\theta_0}$ of the trajectory of the process $Y(t)$ with parameters $a$, $p$, and $q$, which depend on both the one-sided limits of the density at the point $x(\theta_0)$ and the derivative $x&#39;(\theta_0)$. In this case, by evaluating the moments $\mathbf{E}(t^*_{\theta_0})^m$, $m=1, 2$, one can estimate both the asymptotic bias for the maximum likelihood estimator and its efficiency.},

The problem of absolute continuity of the Erdös measure is reduced to the problem of determining when the corresponding hidden Markov chain is a Parry--Markov chain. For the golden ratio and a 1-Markov chains, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute continuity of the Erdös measure and, using Blackwell--Markov chains, provide a new proof that the necessary conditions obtained earlier by Bezhaeva and Oseledets [Theory Probab.

The proposed method is capable of evaluating the prices of floating and fixed strike lookback options not only at the initial time but also during the entire period when the current position of the Lévy process may be different from its extremum. Our algorithm involves three stages: approximation of the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the extremum process, evaluation of its inversion, and simulation of the final position of the extremum of the Lévy process. We obtain new approximate formulas for the c.d.f.&#39;s of the supremum and infimum processes for Lévy models via Wiener--Hopf factorization. We also describe the principles of developing a hybrid Monte Carlo method, which combines classical numerical methods for construction of the c.d.f. of the final position of the extremum process and machine learning methods for inverting the c.d.f. with the help of tensor neural networks. The efficiency of the universal Monte Carlo method for lookback option pricing is supported by numerical experiments.},

Earlier, only two classes of right-unbounded distributions were considered, and it was assumed a priori that the normalization of $\overline{\xi}_n$ is linear; in addition, the components of the normalization (in their explicit form) were unknown. For the two new classes, the required normalization turns our to be nonlinear. Results of this kind are also obtained for four classes of distributions with right-bounded support, which are analogues of the above four right-unbounded distributions (earlier, only the class of distributions with right-bounded support was considered).

A limit theorem for the rightmost terms of this series was proved by the author of this note earlier. The study of limit properties of the sequence $\eta_n(m)$ dates back to the paper by Shepp and Lloyd [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 121 (1966), pp. 340--357] who considered the case $A=\mathbf N$.},

Under the Cramér condition on $\xi_1$ and moment assumptions on a number of descendants of one particle, we know the asymptotics of the large deviation probabilities $\mathbf{P}(\ln Z_n &gt; x)$, where $x/n &gt; \mu^*$. Here, $\mu^*$ is a parameter depending on the process type. We study the asymptotic behavior of the process trajectory under the condition of a large deviation event. In particular, we obtain a conditional functional limit theorem for the trajectory of $(Z_{[nt]},\, t\in [0,1])$ given $\ln Z_n&gt;x$. This result is obtained in a more general model of linear recurrence sequence $Y_{n+1}=A_n Y_n + B_n$, $n\ge 0$, where $\{A_i\}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables, $Y_0$, $B_i$, $i\ge 0$, are possibly dependent and have different distributions, and we need only some moment assumptions on them.},

  abstract     = {We consider a continuous-time homogeneous Markov process on the state space $\mathbf{Z}_+=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$. The process is interpreted as the motion of a particle. A particle may transit only to neighboring points $\mathbf{Z}_+$, i.e., for each single motion of the particle, its coordinate changes by 1. The process is equipped with a branching mechanism. Branching sources may be located at each point of $\mathbf{Z}_+$. At a moment of branching, new particles appear at the branching point and then evolve independently of each other (and of the other particles) by the same rules as the initial particle. To such a branching Markov process there corresponds a Jacobi matrix. In terms of orthogonal polynomials corresponding to this matrix, we obtain formulas for the mean number of particles at an arbitrary fixed point of $\mathbf{Z}_+$ at time $t&gt;0$. The results obtained are applied to some concrete models, an exact value for the mean number of particles in terms of special functions is given, and an asymptotic formula for this quantity for large time is found.},

We consider the problem of nonparametric estimation of the mean function $\mu(t) = \mathbf{E}f(t)$ and of the covariance function $\psi(t,s)=\operatorname{Cov}\{f(t),f(s)\}$ if the noise values of each of the copies $f_i(t)$, $i=1,\dots,n$, are observed in some collection of generally random (in general) time points (regressors). Under wide assumptions on the time points, we construct uniformly consistent kernel estimators for the mean and covariance functions both in the case of sparse data (where the number of observations for each copy of the stochastic process is uniformly bounded) and in the case of dense data (where the number of observations at each of $n$ series is increasing as $n\to\infty$). In contrast to the previous studies, our kernel estimators are universal with respect to the structure of time points, which can be either fixed rather than necessarily regular, or random rather than necessarily formed of independent or weakly dependent random variables.},

  abstract     = {The foundations of the general theory of Markov random processes were laid by A.N. Kolmogorov. Such processes include, in particular, branching random walks on lattices $\mathbf{Z}^d$, $d \in \mathbf{N}$. In the present paper, we consider a branching random walk where particles may die or produce descendants at any point of the lattice. Motion of each particle on $\mathbf{Z}^d$ is described by a symmetric homogeneous irreducible random walk. It is assumed that the branching rate of particles at $x \in \mathbf{Z}^d$ tends to zero as $\|x\| \to \infty$, and that an additional condition on the parameters of the branching random walk, which gives that the mean population size of particles at each point $\mathbf{Z}^d$ grows exponentially in time, is met. In this case, the walk generation operator in the right-hand side of the equation for the mean population size of particles undergoes a perturbation due to possible generation of particles at points $\mathbf{Z}^d$. Equations of this kind with perturbation of the diffusion operator in $\mathbf{R}^2$, which were considered by Kolmogorov, Petrovsky, and Piskunov in 1937, continue being studied using the theory of branching random walks on discrete structures. Under the above assumptions, we prove a limit theorem on mean-square convergence of the normalized number of particles at an arbitrary fixed point of the lattice as $t\to\infty$.},

Later it turned out that these approaches are essentially equivalent in that they define the same curve in different coordinates.

  abstract     = {A linear stationary model $\mathrm{AR}(p)$ with unknown expectation, coefficients, and the distribution function of innovations $G(x)$ is considered. Autoregression observations contain gross errors (outliers, contaminations). The distribution of contaminations $\Pi$ is unknown, their intensity is $\gamma n^{-1/2}$ with unknown $\gamma$, and $n$ is the number of observations. The main problem here (among others) is to test the hypothesis on the normality of innovations $\boldsymbol H_{\Phi}\colon G (x)\in \{\Phi(x/\theta),\,\theta&gt;0\}$, where $\Phi(x)$ is the distribution function of the normal law $\boldsymbol N(0,1)$. In this setting, the previously constructed tests for autoregression with zero expectation do not apply. As an alternative, we propose special symmetrized chi-square type tests. Under the hypothesis and $\gamma=0$, their asymptotic distribution is free. We study the asymptotic power under local alternatives in the form of the mixture $G(x)=A_{n,\Phi}(x):=(1-n^{-1/2})\Phi(x/\theta_0)+n^{-1/2}H(x)$, where $H(x)$ is a distribution function, and $\theta_0^2$ is the unknown variance of the innovations under $\boldsymbol H_{\Phi}$. The asymptotic qualitative robustness of the tests is established in terms of equicontinuity of the family of limit powers (as functions of $\gamma$, $\Pi,$ and $H(x)$) relative to $\gamma$ at the point $\gamma=0$.},
