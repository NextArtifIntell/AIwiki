  abstract     = {Abstract. Risk measures for random vectors have been considered in multiasset markets with transaction costs and financial networks in the literature. While the theory of set-valued risk measures provides an axiomatic framework for assigning to a random vector its set of all capital requirements or allocation vectors, the actual decision-making process requires an additional rule to select from this set. In this paper, we define vector-valued risk measures by an analogous list of axioms and show that, in the convex and lower semicontinuous case, such functionals always ignore the dependence structures of the input random vectors. We also show that set-valued risk measures do not have this issue as long as they do not reduce to a vector-valued functional. Finally, we demonstrate that our results also generalize to the conditional setting. These results imply that convex vector-valued risk measures are not suitable for defining capital allocation rules for a wide range of financial applications including systemic risk measures.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper investigates the callable convertible bond problem in the presence of a liquidity constraint modeled by Poisson signals. We assume that neither the bondholder nor the firm has absolute priority when they stop the game simultaneously, but instead, a proportion of the bond is converted to the firm’s stock and the rest is called by the firm. The paper thus generalizes the special case studied in [G. Liang and H. Sun, SIAM J. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 2962–2991], where the bondholder has priority , and presents a complete solution to the callable convertible bond problem with liquidity constraint. The callable convertible bond is an example of a Dynkin game, but falls outside the standard paradigm since the payoffs do not depend in an ordered way upon which agent stops the game. We show how to deal with this nonordered situation by introducing a new technique which may be of interest in its own right, and then apply it to the bond problem.},

The utility of each agent depends on their own wealth and consumption as well as the relative wealth and consumption of the competitors. Due to the presence of a nonexponential discount factor, each agent’s optimal strategy becomes time-inconsistent. In order to resolve time-inconsistency, each agent makes a decision in a sophisticated way, choosing an open-loop equilibrium strategy in response to the strategies of all the other agents. We construct explicit solutions for the -agent games and the corresponding mean field games (MFGs) where the limit of the former yields the latter.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Herein, we investigate the optimal reinsurance problem for an insurer with different beliefs from those of the reinsurer regarding claims, from the perspective of risk control. Inspired by the exponential upper bound of the ruin probability in the Cramér–Lundberg model, we use Lundberg exponent maximization as the value function. Within the setting of general belief heterogeneity, we first show that a specific form of reinsurance with finite parameters is the optimal strategy satisfying the principle of indemnity and incentive compatibility condition, via a so-called relaxation and modification approach. With the technique of piecewise modification, we extend the method adopted in Tan et al. [European J. Oper. Res., 282 (2020), pp. 345–362] and Meng et al. [SIAM J. Financial Math., 13 (2022), pp. 903–943]. This approach has good applicability for modifying reinsurance candidates to satisfy the incentive compatibility condition based on other value functions, such as the utility maximization problem. As examples, we also present the explicit reinsurance structures under several representative belief heterogeneity environments.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a non-Markovian model for electricity markets where the spot price of electricity is driven by several Gaussian Volterra processes, which can be, e.g., fractional Brownian motions, Riemann–Liouville processes, or Gaussian Volterra driven Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. Since in energy markets the spot price is not a tradeable asset, due to the limited storage possibilities, forward contracts are considered as traded products. We ensure necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of arbitrage that, in this kind of market, reflects the fact that the prices of the forward contracts are (Gaussian) martingales under a risk-neutral measure. Moreover, we characterize the market completeness in terms of the number of forward contracts simultaneously considered and of the kernels of the Gaussian Volterra processes. We also provide a novel representation of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes driven by Gaussian Volterra processes. Also exploiting this result, we show analytically that, for some kinds of Gaussian Volterra processes driving the spot prices, under conditions ensuring the absence of arbitrage, the market is complete. Finally, we formulate a portfolio optimization problem for an agent who invests in an electricity market, and we solve it explicitly in the case of constant relative risk aversion utility functions. We also find closed formulas for the price of options written on forward contracts, together with the hedging strategy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Constant product markets with concentrated liquidity (CL) are the most popular type of automated market makers. In this paper, we characterize the continuous-time wealth dynamics of strategic liquidity providers (LPs) who dynamically adjust their range of liquidity provision in CL pools. Their wealth results from fee income, the value of their holdings in the pool, and rebalancing costs. Next, we derive a self-financing and closed-form optimal liquidity provision strategy where the width of the LP’s liquidity range is determined by the profitability of the pool (provision fees minus gas fees), the predictable loss (PL) of the LP’s position, and concentration risk. Concentration risk refers to the decrease in fee revenue if the marginal exchange rate (akin to the midprice in a limit order book) in the pool exits the LP’s range of liquidity. When the drift in the marginal rate is stochastic, we show how to optimally skew the range of liquidity to increase fee revenue and profit from the expected changes in the marginal rate. Finally, we use Uniswap v3 data to show that, on average, LPs have traded at a significant loss, and to show that the out-of-sample performance of our strategy is superior to the historical performance of LPs in the pool we consider.},

Such proxies encode a trade-off between an exploding vol-of-vol and a fast mean-reversion speed controlled by a reversionary timescale and an unconstrained parameter . Sending to 0 yields convergence of the reversionary Heston model toward different explicit asymptotic regimes based on the value of the parameter . In particular, for , the reversionary Heston model converges to a class of Lévy jump processes of normal inverse Gaussian type.

We cover a general class of stochastic volatility models of Markovian nature as well as the rough Bergomi model. In particular, under suitable assumptions we show that option prices can be learned by DNNs up to an arbitrary small error while the network size grows only subpolynomially in the asset vector dimension and the reciprocal of the accuracy. Hence, the approximation does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. As quantitative approximation results for DNNs applicable in our setting are formulated for functions on compact domains, we first consider the case of the asset price restricted to a compact set, and then we extend these results to the general case by using convergence arguments for the option prices.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Systemic risk measures were introduced to capture the global risk and the corresponding contagion effects that are generated by an interconnected system of financial institutions. To this purpose, two approaches were suggested. In the first one, systemic risk measures can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash needed to secure a system after aggregating individual risks. In the second approach, systemic risk measures can be interpreted as the minimal amount of cash that secures a system by allocating capital to each single institution before aggregating individual risks. Although the theory behind these risk measures has been well investigated by several authors, the numerical part has been neglected so far. In this paper, we use stochastic algorithms schemes in estimating multivariate shortfall risk measure and prove that the resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. We also test numerically the performance of these algorithms on several examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A novel high-frequency market making approach in discrete time is proposed that admits closed-form solutions. By taking advantage of demand functions that are linear in the quoted bid and ask spreads with random coefficients, we model the variability of the partial filling of limit orders posted in a limit order book (LOB). As a result, we uncover new patterns as to how the demand’s randomness affects the optimal placement strategy. We also allow the price process to follow general dynamics without any Brownian or martingale assumption as is commonly adopted in the literature. The most important feature of our optimal placement strategy is that it can react or adapt to the behavior of market orders online. Using LOB data, we train our model and reproduce the anticipated final profit and loss of the optimal strategy on a given testing date using the actual flow of orders in the LOB. Our adaptive optimal strategies outperform the nonadaptive strategy and those that quote limit orders at a fixed distance from the midprice.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies the problem of partial hedging within the framework of rough volatility models in an incomplete market setting. We employ a stochastic control problem formulation to minimize the discrepancy between a stochastic target and the terminal value of a hedging portfolio. As rough volatility models are neither Markovian nor semimartingales, stochastic control problems associated with rough models are quite complex to solve. Therefore, we propose a multifactor approximation of the rough volatility model and introduce the associated Markov stochastic control problem. We establish the convergence of the optimal solution for the Markov partial hedging problem to the optimal solution of the original problem as the number of factors tends to infinity. Furthermore, the optimal solution of the Markov problem can be derived by solving a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and more precisely a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Due to the inherent complexity of this nonlinear PDE, an explicit formula for the optimal solution is generally unattainable. By introducing the dual solution of the Markov problem and expressing the primal solution as a function of the dual solution, we derive approximate solutions to the Markov problem using a dual control method. This method allows for suboptimal choices of dual control to deduce lower and upper bounds on the optimal solution as well as suboptimal hedging ratios. In particular, explicit formulas for partial hedging strategies in a rough Heston model are derived.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is devoted to a study of robust fundamental theorems of asset pricing in discrete time and finite horizon settings. Uncertainty is modeled by a (possibly uncountable) family of price processes on the same probability space. Our technical assumption is the continuity of the price processes with respect to uncertain parameters. In this setting, we introduce a new topological framework which allows us to use the classical arguments in arbitrage pricing theory involving Lp spaces, the Hahn–Banach separation theorem, and other tools from functional analysis. The first result is the equivalence of a “no robust arbitrage” condition and the existence of a new “robust pricing system.” The second result shows superhedging dualities and the existence of superhedging strategies without restrictive conditions on payoff functions, in contrast to other related studies. The third result discusses completeness in the present robust setting. When other options are available for static trading, we could reduce the set of robust pricing systems and hence the superhedging prices.},

We develop a general theory of risk measures to determine the optimal amount of capital to raise and invest in a portfolio of reference traded securities in order to meet a prespecified regulatory requirement. The distinguishing feature of our approach is that we embed portfolio constraints and transaction costs into the securities market. As a consequence, the property of translation invariance, which plays a key role in the classical theory, ceases to hold. We provide a comprehensive analysis of relevant properties, such as star shapedness, positive homogeneity, convexity, quasiconvexity, subadditivity, and lower semicontinuity. In addition, we establish dual representations for convex and quasiconvex risk measures. In the convex case, the absence of a special kind of arbitrage opportunity allows one to obtain dual representations in terms of pricing rules that respect market bid-ask spreads and assign a strictly positive price to each nonzero position in the regulator’s acceptance set.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Financial networks are characterized by complex structures of mutual obligations. These obligations are fulfilled entirely or in part (when defaults occur) via a mechanism called clearing, which determines a set of payments that settle the claims by respecting rules such as limited liability, absolute priority, and proportionality (pro-rated payments). In the presence of shocks on the financial system, however, the clearing mechanism may lead to cascaded defaults and eventually to financial disaster. In this paper, we first study the clearing model under pro-rated payments of Eisenberg and Noe, and we derive novel necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the clearing payments, valid for an arbitrary topology of the financial network. Next, we observe that the proportionality rule is a factor that potentially concurs to the cascaded defaults effect, and that the aggregated systemic loss can be reduced if this rule is lifted. We thus shift the focus from the individual interest to the overall systemic interest to contain the adverse effects of cascaded failures, and we show that pro-rate-free clearing payments can be computed uniquely by solving suitable convex optimization problems.},

Robust statistical arbitrage strategies refer to trading strategies that enable profitable trading under model ambiguity. The presented novel methodology allows one to consider a large amount of underlying securities simultaneously and does not depend on the identification of cointegrated pairs of assets; hence it is applicable on high-dimensional financial markets or in markets where classical pairs trading approaches fail. Moreover, we provide a method to build an ambiguity set of admissible probability measures that can be derived from observed market data. Thus, the approach can be considered as being model free and entirely data driven. We showcase the applicability of our method by providing empirical investigations with highly profitable trading performances even in 50 dimensions, during financial crises, and when the cointegration relationship between asset pairs stops to persist.},

In a dynamic framework, we identify a new concept associated with the risk of assessing the financial exposure by a measure that is not adequate to the actual time horizon of the position. This will be called horizon risk. We clarify that dynamic risk measures are subject to horizon risk, so we propose to use the fully dynamic version. To quantify horizon risk, we introduce h-longevity as an indicator. We investigate these notions together with other properties of risk measures, such as normalization, restriction property, and different formulations of time-consistency. We also consider these concepts for fully dynamic risk measures generated by backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), and families of these. Within this study, we provide new results for BSVIEs, such as a converse comparison theorem and the dual representation of the associated risk measures.},

We show contracts that automatically reduce the outstanding balance in the event of house price decline do eliminate selective default, but they may induce prepayment in low price states. However, low state prepayments vanish if the benefit from home ownership is sufficiently high. We also show that capital gain sharing features, such as prepayment penalties in high house price states, are ineffective as they virtually eliminate prepayment. For observed foreclosure costs, we find that contracts with automatic balance adjustments become preferable to the traditional fixed-rate contracts at mortgage rate spreads between 20–50 basis points. We obtain these results for perpetual versions of the contracts using an American options pricing methodology, in a continuous-time model with diffusive home prices. The contracts’ values and decision rules are associated with free boundary problems, which admit semiexplicit solutions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The classic optimized certainty equivalent (OCE), proposed by Ben-Tal and Teboulle [Manag. Sci., 11 (1986), pp. 1445–1466], employs the classical expected utility model to evaluate the random risk, in which model each decision maker is characterized by a unique probability measure and only outcome uncertainty is assumed. Due to the lack of information, the distribution ambiguity or Knightian uncertainty prevails in reality. We employ the variational preference of Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Rustichini [Econometrica, 74 (2006), pp. 1447–1498] to address the issue and generalize the concept of OCE. In this paper, we introduce a class of optimized certainty equivalent based on the variational preference, give its dual representation based on -divergence, and study its equivalent characterization of positive homogeneity and coherence. As applications, we investigate the properties of optimized certainty equivalent based on the rank-dependent utility (RDU) model. The dual representation of the RDU-based shortfall risk measure proposed by Mao and Cai [Finance Stoch., 2 (2018), pp. 367–393] is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We extend the valuation of contingent claims in the presence of default, collateral, and funding to a random functional setting and characterize pre-default value processes by martingales. Pre-default value semimartingales can also be described by BSDEs with random path-dependent coefficients and martingales as drivers. En route, we relax conditions on the available market information and construct a broad class of default times. Moreover, under stochastic volatility, we characterize pre-default value processes via mild solutions to parabolic semilinear PDEs and give sufficient conditions for mild solutions to exist uniquely and to be classical.},

Our algorithm applies to both European and American type option pricing problems, while the payoff function depends on the whole paths of the underlying forward stock process. We prove the convergence analysis of our numerical algorithm with explicit dependence on the truncation order of the signature and the neural network approximation errors. Numerical examples for the algorithm are provided, including Amerasian option under the Black–Scholes model, American option with a path-dependent geometric mean payoff function, and Shiryaev’s optimal stopping problem.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove the existence of a continuous-time Radner equilibrium with multiple agents and transaction costs. The agents are incentivized to trade towards a targeted number of shares throughout the trading period and seek to maximize their expected wealth minus a penalty for deviating from their targets. Their wealth is further reduced by transaction costs that are proportional to the number of stock shares traded. The agents’ targeted number of shares are publicly known. In equilibrium, each agent optimally chooses to trade for an initial time interval before stopping trade. Our equilibrium construction and analysis involves identifying the order in which the agents stop trade. The transaction cost level impacts the equilibrium stock price drift. We analyze the equilibrium outcomes and provide numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies an optimal consumption problem for a loss-averse agent with reference to past consumption maximum. To account for loss aversion on relative consumption, an S-shaped utility is adopted that measures the difference between the nonnegative consumption rate and a fraction of the historical spending peak. We consider the concave envelope of the utility with respect to consumption, allowing us to focus on an auxiliary HJB variational inequality on the strength of concavification principle and dynamic programming arguments. By applying the dual-transform and smooth-fit conditions, the auxiliary HJB variational inequality is solved in piecewise closed form, and some thresholds of the wealth variable are obtained. The optimal consumption and investment control can be derived in the piecewise feedback form. The rigorous verification proofs on optimality and concavification principle are provided. Some numerical sensitivity analysis and financial implications are also presented.},

A risk measure that is consistent with the second-order stochastic dominance and additive for sums of independent random variables can be represented as a weighted entropic risk measure (WERM). The expected utility maximization problem with risk controlled by WERM and a related risk minimization problem are investigated in this paper. The latter is equivalent to a problem of maximizing a weighted average of constant-absolute-risk-aversion certainty equivalents. The solutions of all the optimization problems are explicitly characterized, and an iterative method is provided to obtain the solutions numerically.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study optimal control in models with latent factors where the agent controls the distribution over actions, rather than actions themselves, in both discrete and continuous time. To encourage exploration of the state space, we reward exploration with Tsallis entropy and derive the optimal distribution over states—which we prove is -Gaussian distributed with location characterized through the solution of an BSE and BSDE in discrete and continuous time, respectively. We discuss the relation between the solutions of the optimal exploration problems and the standard dynamic optimal control solution. Finally, we develop the optimal policy in a model-agnostic setting along the lines of soft -learning. The approach may be applied in, e.g., developing more robust statistical arbitrage trading strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This article presents a Hawkes process model with Markovian baseline intensities for high-frequency order book data modeling. We classified intraday order book trading events into a range of categories based on their order types and the price change after their arrivals. In order to capture the stimulating effects between multiple types of order book events, we use a multivariate Hawkes process to model the self-exciting and mutually exciting event arrivals. We also integrate Markovian baseline intensities into the event arrival dynamic, by including the impacts of order book liquidity state and time factor on the baseline intensity. A regression-based nonparametric estimation procedure is adopted to estimate the model parameters in our Hawkes+Markovian model. To eliminate redundant model parameters, LASSO regularization is incorporated into the estimation procedure. Besides, a model selection method based on Akaike information criteria is applied to evaluate the effect of each part of the proposed model. An implementation example based on real limit order book data is provided. Through the example we studied the empirical shapes of Hawkes excitement functions, the effects of liquidity as well as time factors, the LASSO variable selection, and the explanation power of Hawkes and Markovian elements to the dynamics of order book.},
