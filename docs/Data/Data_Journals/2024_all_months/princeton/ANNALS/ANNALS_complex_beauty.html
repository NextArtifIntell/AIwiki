  abstract     = {Let $W$ be a smooth test function with compact support in $(0,\infty )$. Conditional on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for Hecke $L$-functions over $\mathbb {Q}(\omega )$, we prove that $$ \begin{matrix} \displaystyle \sum_{p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}} \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{p}} \cdot \Big ( \sum_{x \pmod{p}} e^{2\pi i x^3 / p} \Big ) W \Big ( \frac{p}{X} \Big ) \ \displaystyle \qquad\qquad\sim \frac{(2\pi)^{2/3}}{3 \Gamma(\tfrac 23)} \int_{0}^{\infty} W(x) x^{-1/6} dx \cdot \frac{X^{5/6}}{\log X}, \end{matrix}$$ as $X \rightarrow \infty $ and $p$ runs over primes. This explains a well-known numerical bias in the distribution of cubic Gauss sums first observed by Kummer in 1846 and confirms (conditionally on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) a conjecture of Patterson from 1978. There are two important byproducts of our proof. The first is an explicit level aspect Voronoi summation formula for cubic Gauss sums, extending computations of Patterson and Yoshimoto. Secondly, we show that Heath-Brown’s cubic large sieve is sharp up to factors of $X^{o(1)}$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. This disproves the popular belief that the cubic large sieve can be improved. \par An important ingredient in our proof is a dispersion estimate for cubic Gauss sums. It can be interpreted as a cubic large sieve with correction by a non-trivial asymptotic main term. This estimate relies on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, and is one of the fundamental reasons why our result is conditional.},

Such an $\mathfrak {sl}_2$-triple canonically defines a real form and various decompositions of $\mathfrak {g}$. Using this decomposition data, we explicitly parametrize special connected components of the moduli space of Higgs bundles on a compact Riemann surface $X$ for an associated real Lie group, hence also of the corresponding character variety of representations of $\pi _1X$ in the associated real Lie group. This recovers known components when the real group is split, Hermitian of tube type, or $\mathrm {SO}_{p,q}$ with $1\lt p\leqslant q$, and also constructs previously unknown components for the quaternionic real forms of $\mathrm {E}_6$, $\mathrm {E}_7$, $\mathrm {E}_8$ and $\mathrm {F}_4$. The classification of magical $\mathfrak {sl}_2$-triples is shown to be in bijection with the set of $\Theta $-positive structures in the sense of Guichard–Wienhard, thus the mentioned parametrization conjecturally detects all examples of higher rank Teichmüller spaces. Indeed, we discuss properties of the surface group representations obtained from these Higgs bundle components and their relation to $\Theta $-positive Anosov representations, which indicate that this conjecture holds.},

The method applies not just to compact Hermitian manifolds, but also to the Dirichlet problem, to open manifolds with a positive lower bound on their injectivity radii, to $(n-1)$ form equations, and even to non-integrable almost-complex or symplectic manifolds.

In fact, we also obtain a counterexample in a group of the form $\mathbb{Z}^2 \times G_0$ for some finite abelian $2$-group $G_0$. Our methods rely on encoding a “Sudoku puzzle” whose rows and other non-horizontal lines are constrained to lie in a certain class of “$2$-adically structured functions,” in terms of certain functional equations that can be encoded in turn as a single tiling equation, and then demonstrating that solutions to this Sudoku puzzle exist, but are all non-periodic.},

For the Poincaré constant, we give an improved estimate of $O(\sqrt{n})$ for any isotropic logconcave density. For the Log-Sobolev constant, we prove a bound of $\Omega (1/D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the support of the density, and show that this is asymptotically the best possible bound, resolving a question posed by Frieze and Kannan in 1997. These bounds have several interesting consequences. Improved bounds on the thin-shell and Cheeger/KLS constants are immediate. The ball walk to sample an isotropic logconcave density in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ converges in $O^{*}(n^{2.5})$ steps from a warm start, and the speedy version of the ball walk, studied by Kannan, Lovász and Simonovits mixes in $O^{*}(n^{2}D)$ proper steps from any start, also a tight bound. As another consequence, we obtain a unified and improved large deviation inequality for the concentration of any $L$-Lipshitz function over an isotropic logconcave density (studied by many), generalizing bounds of Paouris and Guedon-E. Milman. Our proof technique is a development of stochastic localization, first introduced by Eldan.},

We generalize this correspondence to incorporate the infinite-dimensional spaces of morphisms “at infinity,” given on the Floer side by Reeb trajectories (also known as “wrapping”) and on the sheaf side by allowing unbounded infinite rank sheaves which are categorically compact. When combined with existing sheaf theoretic computations, our results confirm many new instances of homological mirror symmetry. \par More precisely, given a real analytic manifold $M$ and a subanalytic isotropic subset $\Lambda$ of its co-sphere bundle $S^*M$, we show that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of $T^*M$ stopped at $\Lambda$ is equivalent to the category of compact objects in the unbounded derived category of sheaves on $M$ with microsupport inside $\Lambda$.

Our main geometric result is a computation of the fibers of the Hodge–Tate period map on compactified Shimura varieties, in terms of similarly compactified Igusa varieties.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we establish a congruence on the degree of the map from a component of a Hurwitz space of covers of elliptic curves to the moduli stack of elliptic curves. Combinatorially, this can be expressed as a congruence on the cardinalities of Nielsen equivalence classes of generating pairs of finite groups. Building on the work of Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak, we apply this congruence to show that for all but finitely many primes $p$, the group of Markoff automorphisms acts transitively on the non-zero $\mathbb {F}_p$-points of the Markoff equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 – 3xyz = 0$. This yields a strong approximation property for the Markoff equation, the finiteness of congruence conditions satisfied by Markoff numbers, and the connectivity of a certain infinite family of Hurwitz spaces of $\mathrm {SL}_2(\mathbb {F}_p)$-covers of elliptic curves. With possibly finitely many exceptions, this resolves a conjecture of Bourgain, Gamburd, and Sarnak, first posed by Baragar in 1991, and a question of Frobenius, posed in 1913. Since their methods are effective, this reduces the conjecture to a finite computation.},

Consequently, we can sample random spanning forests in a graph and estimate the reliability polynomial of any matroid. We also prove the thirty year old conjecture of Mihail and Vazirani that the bases exchange graph of any matroid has edge expansion at least 1. Our algorithm and proof build on the recent results of Dinur, Kaufman, Mass and Oppenheim who show that a high-dimensional walk on a weighted simplicial complex mixes rapidly if for every link of the complex, the corresponding localized random walk on the 1-skeleton is a strong spectral expander. One of our key observations is that a weighted simplicial complex $X$ is a $0$-local spectral expander if and only if a naturally associated generating polynomial $p_{X}$ is strongly log-concave. More generally, to every pure simplicial complex $X$ with positive weights on its maximal faces, we can associate a multiaffine homogeneous polynomial $p_{X}$ such that the eigenvalues of the localized random walks on $X$ correspond to the eigenvalues of the Hessian of derivatives of $p_{X}$.},

  abstract     = {In the 1970s, Fathi, having proven that the group of compactly supported volume-preserving homeomorphisms of the $n$-ball is simple for \hbox $n \ge 3$, asked if the same statement holds in dimension two. We show that the group of compactly supported area-preserving homeomorphisms of the two-disc is not simple. This settles what is known as the “simplicity conjecture” in the affirmative. In fact, we prove the a priori stronger statement that this group is not perfect. Our general strategy is partially inspired by suggestions of Fathi and the approach of Oh towards the simplicity question. In particular, we show that infinite twist maps, studied by Oh, are not finite energy homeomorphisms, which resolves the “infinite twist conjecture” in the affirmative; these twist maps are now the first examples of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms that can be said to have infinite energy. Another consequence of our work is that various forms of fragmentation for volume-preserving homeomorphisms that hold for higher dimensional balls fail in dimension two. A central role in our arguments is played by spectral invariants defined via periodic Floer homology. We establish many new properties of these invariants that are of independent interest. For example, we prove that these spectral invariants extend continuously to area-preserving homeomorphisms of the disc, and we also verify for certain smooth twist maps a conjecture of Hutchings concerning recovering the Calabi invariant from the asymptotics of these invariants.},

For small $i$, this settles conjectures of Gabber that extend the Grothendieck–Lefschetz theorem and give purity for the Brauer group for schemes with complete intersection singularities. For the proof, we reduce to a flat purity statement for perfectoid rings, establish $p$-complete arc descent for flat cohomology of perfectoids, and then relate to coherent cohomology of $\mathbb {A}_{\mathrm {Inf}}$ via prismatic Dieudonné theory. We also present an algebraic version of tilting for étale cohomology, use it to reprove the Gabber–Thomason purity, and exhibit general properties of fppf cohomology of (animated) rings with finite, locally free group scheme coefficients, such as excision, agreement with fpqc cohomology, and continuity.},
