  abstract     = {For securing the network, intrusion detection systems are frequently used in wireless sensor networks to fight against insider attacks by adopting the appropriate trust-based methods. Still, the sensors could create an enormous amount of data that reduces the efficacy of trust computation in the big data era. This paper aims to introduce a new attack detection system under the big data perspective. Originally, the input data is fed the preprocessing phase, in which the normalization process takes place. Further, the MapReduce framework is used to handle the bulk data by reducing it. The preprocessed data is subjected to extract the features, where it extracts the raw features, statistical features, and higher-order statistical features. Here, the feature selection is done by chi-square ranking and info-gain ranking. Further, these features are provided as the input to the classification phase, where multilayer perception (MLP) is used for detecting the presence of an attack. For making the classification more precise, weights of MLP are optimally tuned by proposed slap swarm updated sparrow optimized algorithm which integrated the concept of sparrow search algorithm and salp swarm algorithm. Finally, the performance of presented scheme is calculated to existing approaches under different metrics.},

In security constraint, trust evaluation and risk probability was determined. Black Widow Combined Seagull Optimization (BWCSO) algorithm was proposed for obtaining the best optimization result by combining Black Widow Optimization (BWO) and Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA). Cycle crossover (CX) was introduced to produce an offspring from its parents in which each slot is filled by an element from a different parent. Finally, the suggested algorithm’s performance was assessed, and the best outcome was found with respect to makespan.},

  abstract     = {Cancer is a disease affecting humans around the world. Exploring a deep understanding of the state/parameter estimation based on the drug prescription provides an awareness of the patient’s experience during the treatment. Applying controllers to such systems with the primary aim of reducing cancer cells with the fewest side effects is a very interesting field in the past decade. The usual assumptions followed when designing a controller are that all system parameters are constant and all states are measurable. However, this is not the case in reality. In this article, based on a five-states differential equation model, which models a combined therapy of chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic, the state and/or parameters are estimated using an unscented Kalman filter while a nonlinear adaptive controller produces drug injection rate as the control signals utilizing the estimated state/parameter. The advantage of this estimation method is that, unlike in the traditional extended Kalman filter, nonlinear dynamics can be used without any linearization. The results show that the state and parameter estimation with UKF was successful. This idea can be used to assign a mathematical cancer dynamic for any individual, and state/parameter estimation can be studied and verified throughout a patient’s treatment.},

  abstract     = {For high-quality picture transmission through smart devices in Mobile Multimedia Sensor Networks (MWMSN), high transmission rates, throughput, and a low Bit Error Rate are necessary. At the same time, energy efficiency is always a big problem for battery-powered smart devices like smartphones and tablets. MWMSN makes extensive use of cooperative communication to realize the benefits of the Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output technology. Energy consumption and routing are major challenges for Cooperative Mobile Multimedia Sensor Networks since each node in the network have mobility. The dynamic nature of MWSNs increases with mobility and the consequence is reflected in the control traffic overhead. To address these challenges, a Cluster-based Cooperative Multi-Hop Optimal Relay Selection (CCORS) strategy was proposed by using velocity, distance, and link quality parameters. The proposed technique determines the link quality for every pair of nodes based on values of signal strength and distance parameters. The relay nodes are chosen based on the highest possible Quality of Service (QoS) value, which is calculated to assure route stability, reliability, and durability. Further, we obtained an optimal number of cooperative nodes in every hop with the objective to minimize end-to-end energy consumption. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to other state of art algorithms.},

Here, the network attack is one of the significant consequences of VANET, which may affect network security. The high mobility of the nodes may become difficult to transfer the data through the vehicle. In this article, a novel method of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is proposed. The key is generated by Key Generation Unit (KGU), and also the key is fed into the Road Side Unit (RSU). The keys in Enhanced ECC (EECC) are optimized using the Adaptive Horse herd Optimization Algorithm (AHOA). During decryption, the key of source node K1 is to be taken from RSU, where the key is processed by the Digital Signature method to obtain EECC key K2. With the generated K2, the destination node can retrieve the data by the proposed model. Thus, the simulation analysis of the proposed AHOA-EECC method has attained less time complexity which was compared against the high value of 5%, 12.4%, 50%, and 13.7% for GWO-EECC, PSO-EECC, AOA-EECC, and HOA-EECC.

  abstract     = {The development of several popular social networks and the publication of social networks’ data have led to the risk of leakage of sensitive and confidential information of individuals. This requires the preservation of privacy before the publication of a user’s data available from his Online Social Network (OSN) presence. Numerous algorithms have been proposed in the area of preserving the privacy of social network users’ information such as K-anonymity and L-diversity. Previous work has shown good results based on the concept of adding edges and noise nodes for achieving K-anonymity and L-diversity. K-anonymization techniques are able to prevent identity disclosure of users but are not sufficient to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information of users. In this direction, a number of techniques for preserving the sensitive information of social network users have been proposed. Although these techniques have shown reasonably good results to achieve anonymity, but they also lead to a substantial change in the original structure of the OSNs. In this article, the problems of preventing sensitive attribute disclosure and reducing the noisy nodes have been addressed by perturbing the sensitive attributes. Existing research uses L-diversity for preventing sensitive attribute disclosure resulting in skewness and similarity attacks. We have addressed the skewness attacks by removing the duplicate noisy nodes from the final dataset to be published for stakeholders by the OSN service providers. All the information of duplicate nodes has been stored in a table named Reference Attribute Table (RAT). This table will be accessible only to the service providers for the purpose of de-anonymizing the data of users. The proposed technique has been extensively evaluated using five metrics viz. APL, ACSPL, RRTI, number of noisy nodes, and information loss using four real-time datasets collected for OSNs namely CORA, ARNET, DBLP, and Twitter. Results of evaluation parameters viz. APL and RRTI show that there is less change in the structure of datasets after anonymization. Results of ACSPL show that our proposed technique is able to preserve sensitive attributes in the datasets. The maximum number of noisy nodes amongst all four datasets is 5.4% and the maximum information loss is 2.2%. Evaluation results make it evident that our proposed technique ensures privacy preservation with less loss of information and thus preserving the utility of published data.},

By calculating the load value based on CPU utilization, controller maximum capacity, and input packet volume, load imbalance issues are identified. Switch migration is carried out using FPO based on fitness measure, which takes into account migration factors, such as migration cost, projected load, controller capacity, and load balancing rate (LBR). To complete the switch migration procedure, the load on the controller is assessed using the data packets and a threshold value. For the NSFNet topology, the proposed FPO-based switch migration approach achieved the following results: 17.286 kbps, 0.1191 s, 48.797, −0.238, 0.1231 s, and 5.0391 kbps, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction methods can help to reconstruct systems from incomplete datasets, to understand the structure dynamic complex networks, and to predict future interactions in evolving networks. Link prediction in multiplex networks is the problem of finding missing links between users based on information from other layers. Although the link prediction problem has been widely studied in multiplex networks, most methods do not consider both interlayer and intralayer features at the same time. Similarity metrics are one of the most common approaches to solving the link prediction problem. However, the development of similarity metrics over multiple layers with the definition of multiplex networks has become an important challenge that has caught the attention of many researchers. In this article, a novel similarity metric is introduced by considering reliable paths between users for link prediction in multiplex networks. The proposed method maps the network to a weighted network by extracting different interlayer and intralayer features from multiplex networks. Finally, the proposed similarity metric develops the FriendLink metric by considering the weight of links and reliable paths. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison with classical similarity metrics and equivalence algorithms such as SEM-Path, LPIS, and SOIDP. Two real datasets based on multiplex networks including Twitter–Foursquare and Twitter–Instagram have been used to evaluate. Experiments prove the superiority of link prediction in the proposed method over other algorithms.},

DR is an issue of diabetes and the main source of visual deficiency. Since there are trained doctors to diagnose the disease, but to make their work easier, ensemble architectures were proposed for the prediction of grading of DR using modern technology known as deep learning. Deep neural network results in a better diagnostic system in comparison to machine learning networks. ResNET 101 and Ensemble CNN architectures were proposed using Adam Optimization for the detection of DR. From the results, it has been observed that for any constant size Network architecture, the loss cannot be further reduced after a certain number known as Bayes error. With the help of a learning curve, it can easily understand that the proposed architecture costs are decreasing after every iteration.

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the rapid growth of the internet of things (IoT), the number of devices connected to the network has increased significantly. The rising trend of mass data that objects send to the network has become a big challenge for cloud networks. The next generation IoT applications require low delay and real-time responses. Hence, IoT applications need a new processing paradigm to be able to access distributed cloud services at the network edge. In recent years, fog computing has emerged as a distributed computing model compatible with heterogeneous environments that can provide cloud services with low delay at the network edge. Meanwhile, services provided by the IoT suffer from varying workload changes over time, and approaches are needed to automatically provision resources and satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements. With this motivation, this study presents an improved political optimizer-based resource management scheme for fog-enabled cloud environments, which is named IPORM. IPORM seeks to efficiently allocate resources to IoT requests with the purpose of maximizing resource utilization. In addition, other objectives such as energy, bandwidth, and delay are also included in IPORM. Simulation results show that our scheme significantly improves network performance in terms of various metrics compared to its counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Over 8% of women will be diagnosed with breast tumors (BT) in their lifetime. Tumors are formed by the uncontrollable development of tissues in a specific area of the body. They can be benign or malignant. The best survival rate can be expected with earlier screening and diagnosis of the tumor. To distinguish between benign and malignant tumors in x-ray images of the breast, segmentation of the tumor is a crucial first step. Screening mammography is an efficient method of detecting BT. As a result, the research presented two distinct deep learning models, termed SegNet and UNet architectures, to segment BT from mammograms. Datasets accessible to the public were utilized in the proposed system, specifically INbreast. Histogram equalization is used on datasets during preprocessing to improve the compressed areas and normalize the pixel dispersion. To avoid overfitting and boost the quantity of training data, augmentation techniques are employed. The metrics like the dice coefficient (DC) and the Intersection of Union (IoU) score are considered to evaluate the model. The metrics of the SegNets model are greater than the U-Net, as demonstrated by the experimental results. For the INbreast dataset, the SegNets achieve a maximum DC of 92.75% and an IoU score of 86.49%.},

A new model is constructed for high-speed railway accident analysis with interval type-2 fuzzy DEMATEL method based on the 24Model. Specifically, the 24Model is introduced to identify the accident factors from four stages at the individual and organizational levels. The DEMATEL method is combined with interval type-2 fuzzy sets to analyze the key causations of the accident considering the interrelationships between factors under an uncertain environment. A specific case of the “7.23” Yong-Tai-Wen railway accident is employed to validate the proposed model. The analysis results show that poor management of the ministry of railways, imperfect rules and standards and little supervision or inspection are core organizational factors that lead to accidents. Besides, unsafe material conditions and unsafe human conditions are the direct causes of the accident which are easily influenced by other accident factors. The relevant managers need to strengthen the inspection to ensure the safe operation of the high-speed railway.},

These data must be transferred from one node to another node without any fault or delay in their nodes. To resolve this problem, an algorithm named SAOA is proposed to communicate the messages from various services without any delay in their nodes. IoT with mobile sink node is simulated in the network based on the MoO4RPL objective and the phases involved in this strategy are topology, route discovery, communication, and route maintenance phase. The topology network is generated for network topology and the rank is computed based on the energy, trust, delay, fault tolerance, and link quality in the multi-objective route discovery phase. In the communication phase, the optimal route is selected using proposed SAOA with fitness function factors. At last, the route maintenance phase is performed, and the proposed SAOA has achieved a minimum distance of 53.807 m, maximum energy of 0.415 J, maximum link quality of 2.163, and maximum trust of 0.701, respectively.

One solution is key pre-distribute that the keys generation and distribution between nodes are before the network establishment. This article presents an algorithm for key pre-distribution in fog networks that focuses on the relationship between end devices and the fog layer. The proposed scheme is a hybrid scheme that uses the K-MEANS algorithm for nodes hierarchical clustering. Then the residual design is used to generate the key chain and BIBD design is used for key pre-distribution in headers. The proposed method is completely independent of the mobility model of and its communication and computation overheads are of the order of O(q). Also, the network connectivity is above 0.8 and close to the BIBD design, which is a fully connected KPS, and the probability of capturing the entire network in case of capturing the nodes is almost equal to 0. In the proposed method for a network with size N, the size of the key chain is N 4 .},

To predict the optimal path the E-waste images are conversed through the energy-aware FHGO routing algorithm. The feature extraction procedure is performed to cut out the features for example the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature, local Gabor binary pattern (LGBP) and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and the pre-processing phase is concluded with a median filter. To supplement the extracted feature size the data augmentation is fulfilled. Moreover, the E-waste classification is done based on deep CNN, which is trained using a FHGO algorithm. FHGO is exhibited by the merging of Henry gas solubility optimization (HGSO) algorithm, fractional calculus (FC).

  abstract     = {The task of monitoring the plant leaves is considered to be error-prone, inconsistent, and unreliable. Thus, certain deep learning algorithms are developed to detect plant leaf diseases, but most deep learning techniques were designed with restricted-resolution images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Hence, this article decides to develop an optimized nine-layer (ONL)-CNN-based plant leaf disease classification (PLDC) model for ensuring accurate results. The leaf segmented images are given into the abnormality segmentation with the “Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means” (A-FCM) technique for getting the abnormality segmented images. The segmented images are inserted into the classification stage, in which the optimized nine layer-CNN is utilized for leaf disease classification. Here, the parameter optimization takes place in FCM and ONL-CNN for enhancing the performance of the developed PLDC model using the developed hybrid heuristic optimization algorithm with hybrid leader cat swarm optimization (HLCSO). The experimental analysis is conducted with the developed PLDC model with different baseline methods to put forward the effectiveness of the developed model. Throughout the analysis, the given designed method achieved a 96% accuracy rate. Therefore, the proposed model ensures its effective performance regarding accuracy metric and also helps to detect early diagnosis of leaf diseases.},

Finally, OED is performed by a set of classifiers like Convolutional Neural Networks, Adaboost, XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory, and Deep Neural Networks, where the parameters of ensemble learning classifiers are optimized by A-BIO algorithm.

The wireless channel transports the sanitized data from the transmitter to the receiver. The dual-sanitized input has been recovered at the other end. More significantly, the exact key generation, which has been found by a novel hybrid optimization model, is essential to both operations (dual-data cleaning and dual-data restoring). Electric fish customized dolphin swarm optimization (ECDO) is a suggested hybrid optimization model that is a conceptual merger of the electric fish optimization (EFO) and the dolphin swarm method. Ultimately, to confirm the effectiveness of the anticipated strategy, a study has been made. The present architecture has been contrasted against the previous models, including the DSOA, EFO, SMO, WOA, and J-SSO, respectively. The restoration effectiveness of the projected model is 57.84%, 26.3%, 5.26%, 31.5%, and 15.7% improved over DSOA, EFO, SMO, WOA, and J-SSO, respectively.

To date, MOINLP problem has not been exactly solved. Although traditional ε -constraint method can be used to solve MOINLP problem, the obtained solution may not be Pareto-optimal. To overcome this shortcoming, a basic ε -constraint method (BEM) is proposed to solve MOINLP problem exactly. However, the time complexity of BEM is as high as O ( ( p − 1 ) M 2 N ) , where p , M , and N are the numbers of objectives, Pareto-optimal solutions, and feasible solutions, respectively. For this reason, an improved BEM (IBEM) is developed whose time complexity is O ( M 2 N ) . That is, the time complexity of IBEM for solving MOINLP problem is equal to solving the single-objective one. Finally, to avoid using all the feasible solutions ( N ) in obtaining each Pareto-optimal solution, three methods to eliminate dominated solutions effectively are used before performing IBEM. The test results illustrate that our method can not only solve MOINLP problem exactly but also has high efficiency.},

Fog computing is a suitable platform for processing Internet of Things applications. However, fog computing devices are distributed, dynamic, and have limited resources, so the allocation of fog computing resources to execute heterogeneous and delay-sensitive tasks in the Internet of Things is a significant challenge. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the resource allocation problem to minimize the makespan while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of IoT tasks. Next, we propose two learning automata, namely an automaton for select tasks (A T F) and an automaton for select virtual machine (A v f) to efficiently map IoT tasks to FNs. In this approach, a task is selected from the set of A T F actions and then, a Fog node is selected from the set of A v f actions. If the requirements for executing the tasks on the fog nodes are met, then the resource is allocated to the task. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through conducting several simulation experiments under different fog configurations. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a simulation environment by extending the iFogsim to simulate a realistic fog environment. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better compared with existing algorithms in terms of MK, response time, delay, Processing time, and cost with the increasing number of task submissions.},

  abstract     = {One of the common techniques to reduce the scalability problem in collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommender systems is the clustering technique, which accelerates finding the nearest neighbor users in the recommendation process. Different clustering algorithms lead to improved accuracy and diversity in recommender systems. It is challenging to develop recommender systems based on clustering with decreasing scalability and simultaneously increasing accuracy. This article proposes a new clustering-based recommender system that takes into account the theoretical properties of the Learning Automata (LA) technique. The presented clustering novelty lies in the fact that employing LA technique for the user clustering in a CF-based recommender system has not been set forth so far in a way that addresses the scalability while improving accuracy. In addition, a novel similarity metric is embedded in the proposed algorithm to measure the similarity value between users. This metric is developed as like/dislike (LD) which can significantly improve the accuracy by reducing the computational cost. Extensive simulations have been performed on real-world datasets such as MovieLens and FilmTrust, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In this regard, the proposed algorithm has improved the precision between 5 and 16% on average compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods such as GA-GELS, NUSCCF, NNMF, and KL-KM.},

It is different from the traditional T-S fuzzy method, the interval type-2 fuzzy set is introduced to model the system, and the nonlinearity with parameter uncertainty is captured using the interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. During the implementation of the control process, the possible actuator failures are fully considered when designing a controller, and a fault-tolerant control strategy is employed to enhance the elasticity of the designed controller. It is worth noting that, in order to better adapt to the characteristics of interval type-2 fuzzy system, the designed controller follows non-parallel distribution compensation rules, that is, the designed controller does not have the same premise structure and fuzzy rules as the system model, which further improves the flexibility of controller design. Some sufficient conditions ensuring the stability with the extended dissipative performance of the systems are established. In the meanwhile, the obtained results with less conservatism are ensured owing to the boundary information of membership functions considered in the stability analysis. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The main contribution of the proposed work is to minimize the capacity of the canal region and functional step for the head gate of the supply canal depending on the canal constraint. Due to the communication and interconnection over the sensors in IoT, the required decision variables are obtained for the operation of water supply scheduling. Then, the proposed model utilizes several decision variables such as start time, and discharge rate. In various sections, the decision variables change from the head of the canal to the tail, which is also to be gradually decreased as well. To overcome this constraint, the Modified Exploration-based Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (ME-AGTO) algorithm is proposed in this article, where the start time, and discharge rate is efficiently optimized. The newly developed ME-AGTO algorithm is applied for the two-way water supply and acquires the optimal scheduling of the water supply. Hence, the canal capacity is considered with optimized variables at different sections throughout the head and tail parts of the canal. Thus, the schedules are created for the inflow of water with the aid of the rotation period and head gate. The performance is estimated to obtain the desired results of less conveyance loss.},

Hence, the optimal feature selection and the hybrid learning-based classifier are developed for evading the normal function disruption in the cloud server. After pre-processing, the resultant data is subjected to the ensemble feature selection. The first feature is selected optimally by the Probability of Fitness-based Billiards-Inspired Optimization (PF-BIO) algorithm, the second feature selection is acquired through the Fisher discriminant, and the last feature selection is carried out by feature correlation with class. Consequently, the resultant of these feature selections is concatenated with the weight parameter to provide weighted fused features, where the weight is getting optimized by the PF-BIO algorithm. Finally, a newly developed hybrid-based learning model, where the Deep Belief Network with the Gated Recurrent Unit (DBN-GRU), in which the hyper parameters are tuned and optimized by the PF-BIO algorithm. Thus, the performance is compared with the existing approaches. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy of the designed method is 97.05%.

Here, segmentation is done using bounding box segmentation. The ships on the ocean surface are effectively detected using deep convolutional neural network, where the network is trained utilizing devised exponential mayfly optimization algorithm (EMO). The newly designed EMO is derived by the combination of the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) and mayfly optimization algorithm (MA).

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection and state prediction research using multivariate data is being actively conducted in various industrial fields. However, since most dynamically operating industrial machines perform different operating conditions, they contain different types of abnormal conditions, making it difficult to detect anomalies and predict the remaining life. This white paper proposes a condition diagnosis model based on multi-sensor data prediction for estimating the remaining lifespan of equipment while solving two complex problems of detecting four typical abnormal conditions and sensor omissions of industrial machines. First, we use a multi-sensor data generation model to learn relationships between sensors, and second, we use a sensor data prediction model to learn sensor-specific feature information. In order to extract the temporal and spatial characteristics of sensing information and to derive the relationship between the sensors, we propose an attention model with three types of cases. Finally, the state of the device is diagnosed through the difference between the model predicted value and the actual value, and future state information of the device is predicted through the accumulation of error information. In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, extensive experiments were conducted focusing on the case where sensor omission occurred due to data from equipment with more than 4 types and conditions. Our model produces missing sensor data with about 92% accuracy and detects anomalies with about 88% accuracy, even if parts of the sensor are missing or the operating environments have been changed. The proposed model has improved anomaly detection accuracy compared to the comparative model, and has been proven to be applicable to real industrial problems.},

The existence of traffic congestion severely impacts travellers’ travel time. In this paper, we investigate the use of congestion prediction in velocity forecasting models. Using a data-driven approach, we classify traffic observations into classes with and without congestion. We find that this classification improves velocity forecasting, showing that using congestion as an attribute reduces the MAE by at least 6.15% for different machine and deep learning models including random forests, multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks. We propose a random forest model that identifies the future congestion state from past traffic velocity and volume data and then use it to build new short-term velocity forecasting models. These models reduce the MAE prediction error up to 3.37% over the best models that do not consider congestion. This improvement represents overcoming a 53.75% of the error due to not precisely knowing the future congestion state.},

Several previous studies have shown that one of the predominant factors in landslides is intensive rainfall. The present work proposes the use of data generated by weather stations to predict landslides. We give special treatment to precipitation information as the most influential factor and whose data are accumulated in time windows (3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days) looking for the persistence of meteorological conditions. To optimize the dataset composed of geological, geomorphological, and climatological data, a feature selection process is applied to the meteorological variables. We use filter-based feature ranking and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with Clustering as supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, respectively. This contribution was successfully verified by experimenting with different classification models, improving the test accuracy of the prediction, and obtaining 99.29% for Multilayer Perceptron, 96.80% for Random Forest, and 88.79% for Support Vector Machine. To validate the proposal, a geographical area sensitive to this phenomenon was selected, which is monitored by several meteorological stations. Practical use is a valuable tool for risk management decision making, can help save lives and reduce economic losses.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned vehicles are gaining the attention of professional operators and the general public. The implementation of unmanned vehicles is evident in, among other fields, emergency management, agriculture, traffic monitoring, post-disaster operations, and delivery of goods. Naturally, a group of unmanned vehicles can cooperatively complete operations more proficiently than a single vehicle. However, several issues must be resolved before a stable and reliable group of unmanned vehicles can be generally deployed to solve tasks in civil infrastructures and in industrial facilities. Here, a framework for the guidance of a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles is proposed. The framework utilizes several levels of control, namely Global Planning Level, Local Planning Level, and Low-Level Control. While the individual vehicles are completely autonomous in their operational locomotion and obstacle avoidance (low-level control and local planning), the task assignment for each vehicle (or group of them) is provided by a global planning process, based on the genetic algorithm. The framework provides a concept to solve complex tasks for the fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, a dynamically changing environment, different types of USVs with special abilities, multiple types of areal restrictions and obstacles, different restrictions for individual USVs, cooperation of multiple USVs to solve their subtasks, energy consumption optimization, etc. The framework can be advantageously applied to tasks such as warehouse logistics, surface maintenance, area exploration, etc. At the end of the study, the application of the framework is presented using a simulated example of cooperative problem solving using six vehicles.},

To do so, 12 indicators are classified in four basic perspectives applying the Delphi method. The importance weights of perspectives and their related indicators are calculated performing FPP. Accordingly, the weighted performance values that are inputs of FIS are calculated and finally, the weighted fuzzy system will be applied to obtain the total environmental performance of the suppliers. Moreover, we implemented our model within a home appliances manufacturing company in Iran to examine its efficiency. Results approve that the proposed approach can apply efficiently in real situations and are reliable-enough.

  abstract     = {Due to the nonlinearity and high volatility of financial time series, hybrid forecasting systems combining linear and nonlinear models can provide more precise performance than a single model. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid stock price forecasting model with error correction based on secondary decomposition. The modules of data decomposition, a prediction module and an error correction module constitute the overall framework of the model proposed in this paper. First, variational mode decomposition (VMD) decomposes the original stock closing price data and the initial prediction error sequence. Second, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network model is selected to predict the original subseries. Finally, a new hybrid model consisting of the VMD method combined with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is established to correct the error subseries. The proposed model is verified through four financial time series. The results show that (a) The combination of the VMD method and GRU network has a better prediction effect than a single model. (b) The combination of the VMD method and ARIMA method can effectively amend the error sequence and improve the prediction accuracy. (c) Error correction to the hybrid model has a great effect on improving the prediction performance of the model. The empirical results have illustrated that the proposed model indeed displays a good performance in forecasting stock market fluctuations compared with other baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Smart detached houses, contingent on renewable energy (RE), are subjected to an unstable power supply of the intermitted nature. The power quality (PQ) norms define allowable variances in the characteristics of electrical systems to ensure their functioning without malfunction. The estimation and optimization of PQ parameters on day bases are inevitable in the regulation of systems to comply with the specified standards and allow the fault-free operation of electrical equipment. Measurements of all PQ states are impossible for dozens of eventual grid-attached power consumers defined by their binary load patterns. Specific demands and uncertain RE can lead to system instability and unacceptable PQ. Self-optimizing models based on artificial intelligence (AI) can estimate the next PQ states in real off-grids where power is induced only by chaotic RE sources. A new proposed multistage prediction scheme allows incremental improvements in the accuracy of AI models beginning their development with binary coded data only. The number of selected PQ inputs gradually increased in the next estimate for the initial equipment in demand. Historical records include complete training PQ data for all parameters, but only “1/0” switch-on load sequences are available at prediction times. The most valuable PQ outputs are modeled in the previous stages to process their supplementary series in the next prediction. More capable models, applied to previously approximated PQ data, are able to better compute the PQ output in the secondary steps. Complementary PQ inputs are supplied with the new processing data, which were unknown in the previous stage. The growing number of input features enables a more complex representation of the target quantity in each iteration. Advanced input selection and data reevaluation can additionally improve model discriminability for unseen active load patterns. It can be applied in modeling unknown states of various dynamical systems, initially defined only by series of binary or inadequate input data, to improve the results.},

The nodes are placed randomly to explore, and the determination of accurate nodes’ positions is required. Fixed cost and energy are the main challenges with the sensor, as the location of all nodes that are not maintained. The main aim of this research work is to plan for a new localization method in WSN using a new meta-heuristic concept. The proposed model focuses on two phases: (a) localizing the target nodes and (b) localizing the rest nodes. The optimal selection of target nodes is initially determined by the proposed meta-heuristic model by considering the displacement among the nodes. For performing the optimal localization of rest nodes regarding anchor nodes, the weight of each anchor node is determined, which is done by recurrent neural network (RNN). Furthermore, an objective function concerning the distance and the weight is derived for localizing the rest nodes. The new algorithm called Self Adaptive-Barnacles Mating Optimization (SA-BMO) is used for performing the optimal node localization. The desired outcome proves the developed method is attaining an increase in efficiency.},

The complexity involved has overflowed the traditional institutional framework – centered around the Westphalian state. Many strategies have been proposed and there is a growing supra-state institutionality. All this requires a deeper understanding so that humanity can better face global threats. The observation of nation-states is subject to the paradox of observing them diminished, on the one hand, while pointing them out as obstacles to coordinated global action. Institutions of an international or global character also endure the paradoxical gaze of wishing them to be more effective while fearing for their lack of democratic roots. These paradoxes are also dilemmas between trusting the politics to centralized global institutions or to nation-states. Proposing to examine the absorption of the complexity of the current world, in terms of Ashby&#39;s law, looking at the roles of institutions and organizational systems in times when networks make the edges of organizations less solid, in general, opens a vast field of study to look at the current way humanity is handling complexity and possible alternatives. This work, just the beginning of research on the subject that demands greater efforts and resources to achieve its purpose of influencing the formulation of policies, is a journey through institutional aspects that aims to contribute with further reflections beyond the institutions.},

Our proposed work uses BERT for textual representations while preserving the semantic relationships in news articles. The image features are represented using VGG-19. The propagation structure of the circulating fake news is captured using Graph Neural Networks. All the features computed are fused together for a better classification. For classification, we have used LSTM which is optimized using Chimp Optimization. The FakeMine model was able to achieve an accuracy of 97.65 which exceeded all other baseline models for multiple modalities. It performed better than other models when tested on individual modalities as well. The proposed optimized LSTM classifier was also able to perform better than all other baseline classifiers.},

  abstract     = {One of the necessities of mobile networks is uninterrupted access to wireless services, taking into account the requirements of quality of service. With the development of the fifth-generation (5G), high improvements will be achieved in several aspects such as seamless communications, flexibility, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and energy efficiency. For this purpose, in 5G architecture, a large amount of Small cell Base Stations (SBS) will be considered to cover all of the users and their equipment devices. Due to the possibility of rapid user mobility, the high traffic load on SBS, or any service failure, the handover process will be inevitable. However, there will be several challenges that must be noticed, such as selecting an appropriate SBS for handover in order to improve the quality of service and reduce unnecessary handovers. In this paper, a profile-based predictive handover strategy (PBPHS) is presented to select the best alternative for handover and hence to reduce handovers handovers, according to a predictive model that is based on the previous user’s utilization of resources and mobility tracking. The simulation results depicted the performance of the proposed handover strategy in the handover reduction rate, which on average outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 13% to 26%.},

  abstract     = {Recently, in various information areas including image processing and social networks, data clustering has been vastly utilized. Thus, the clustering task is taken as successful while imputing the quality of uncertain values, whereas the traditional methods observe only poor performance. To enhance the performance, the hybrid intelligent-based clustering model is proposed by the adaptive concept. Initially, the data is collected from benchmark datasets that are composed of incomplete mixed data. The first level of clustering is processed by optimized K-Means Clustering (KMC) to acquire the optimal centroid, in which the centroid is optimized by the Adaptive Probability-assisted Water Strider Algorithm (AP-WSA). Similarly, the second clustering is done through K-Correlation-based Clustering (KCC) to obtain the clustered output. Thus, the final clustering process is named as Hybrid K-Means K-Correlation (HKMKC) clustering algorithm. Finally, the experimental results are validated with the performance measures and estimated with the traditional methods. Through the result analysis, the Average Silhouette Coefficient (AS) of the designed AP-WSA-HKMKC is 50%, 28%, 16%, and 5.45% progressed than KMC, FCM, KCC, and K-median clustering methods for dataset 2 at 15% miss rate. Thus, the designed hybrid clustering ensures the efficiency of handling incomplete data regarding accurate clustered outputs.},

The mathematical expression of intermittent positive feedback is formulated in terms of dead-zone functions with the beginning and ending thresholds in the positive and negative directions. Then a dynamic surrogate based on the intermittent positive feedback multi-dimensional Taylor network is established, and a method for identifying its parameters is proposed. Multi-dimensional Taylor network module simulates the long-term trends of time series. Subsequently, an optimization model based on the alternating iteration of the parameters is developed to enhance the forecast accuracy of the intermittent positive feedback part. Simulation results demonstrate that the forecasting effect of the proposed modeling method is superior to that of conventional non-mechanism data-based surrogates for herding behavior.},

Then in the proposed simulation model, each node in the network is described with not only its edges but also its position and distance. Accordingly, two mechanisms called “growth with position” and “degree and distance based preferential attachment” are introduced in the proposed model that it establishes one connection with likelihood proportional to node’s degree and inversely proportional to the distance between two nodes. Beside the traditional node-growth mode, one called link-growth mode is also introduced. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it is one concise data-driven modeling based on complex networks. Simulation results utilizing the proposed link-growth mode and the traditional node-growth mode show that the two modes are equivalent to each other but from different perspectives. Moreover, compared to the traditional node-growth mode, the proposed link-growth mode is clear and concise.},

  abstract     = {To reduce air pollution and global warming, renewable energy technologies may generate power. Wind, solar PV, and fuel cell energy are the primary sources. Solar PV system-powered brushless direct current motor (BLDC) drives are used in the automobile industry due to their importance. In this study, Sheppard–Taylor (S-T) converter and Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) Inverter-fed BLDC provide steady voltage across the BLDC motor drive independent of solar PV system power output. When renewable energy is scarce, the proposed battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (BS-HESS) provides electricity. S-T converters may be used for load matching and power processing to create energy-efficient systems and stabilize PV panel output voltage. The variable step size open circuit voltage-Maximum Power Point Tracking (VSSOCV-MPPT) technique in S-T converter switching pulses extracts maximum power from the solar PV system. This study considers the PVSWPS control function as a Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system to continue rural growth and reduce the greatest demand and load. MATLAB/Simulink software simulates the system’s performance, and FPGA controllers validate the controller’s real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {The users of social networks get ruined by fake news, which brings a vast effect on the offline community. A very significant aim is to improve the trust of data in online social networks by discovering fake news in an appropriately timed manner. A novel technique for identifying fake news on social media has been developed as a result. The feature extraction module receives the preprocessed output after the initial preprocessing stage on the news story. The extracted features are then analyzed using the generative adversarial network (GAN) and neural network (NN) to discover fake scores. Here, the rider shuffled shepherd optimization (RSSO), which was developed by integrating the rider optimization algorithm and the shuffled shepherd optimization algorithm, is used to train the NN classifier. Data labeling is considered an expensive task. GANs are unsupervised, so labeling of data is not required to train them. The score obtained from GAN and NN are utilized for computing the final score, which is evaluated using the weighted average model for detecting fake news. With the highest accuracy of 91.2%, the highest sensitivity of 92.1%, and the highest specificity of 88.8%, the proposed RSSO-based NN + GAN provided improved performance.},

  abstract     = {VANET performs analysis of patient records and sends security warnings to the carer through VANET so that they may provide urgent assistance while keeping patient data safe. Threat actors might potentially access data packets that go between biological sensors and smart ambulances in the vehicular network. When healthcare professionals use a VANET, they run the risk of receiving inaccurate or delayed data as a result of assaults like the Sybil attack, denial of service attacks, and impersonation attacks. As a result, protecting people’s personal information and data has become an important task for academics. In this research, we propose the use of an Urbanized Block Chain Key Agreement Protocol (UB-KAP) based on a one-way hash chain model to increase protections for individual privacy and data integrity in VANET-based healthcare networks. The messages include timestamps in case the messages that have already expired cause excessive delays. The beacons’ packet classification mechanism separates them into benign and harmful emergency signals to speed up response times. The suggested model is tested by road traffic simulation using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). Data collection per user, message delivery ratio, total data gathered, delay, and energy usage are all included in the model’s overall evaluation.},

This paper designs secure authentication model for IoT in the healthcare. Several entities, such as gateway node, sensor node and medical professional are included for performing the secure authentication. The proposed protocol is devised by providing a mathematical model that makes usage of hashing function, encryption algorithm, XOR, Chebyshev polynomial, passwords, secret keys, and other security operations.

  abstract     = {Leukemia is one of the deadliest diseases that occur in white blood cells which is identified in microscopic images from blood samples. Researchers have developed various techniques to diagnose leukemia using a machine learning approach by analyzing micro imaging blood samples. During image screening, the Damaged cells be identified based on manually counting on similar structure lymphocytes and monocytes structures, but the variant difference of both cells aren’t identified accurately. So the identification failures that occur lead to failed accurate cancer detection because feature variants project equal cell structure. To resolve this problem, we propose an Invariant Structural Cascade Segmentation (ISCS) based on Deep Vectorized Scaling Neural Network (DVSNN) is implemented to detect the Leukemia Cancer automatically from bio-blood samples micro image for early diagnosis. First, the Leukemia Cancer micro-image dataset (LCMID) was collected and preprocessed into a noise-free dataset based on adaptive median filters. Then the segmentation was carried to partition the microcells using Invariant structural cascade segmentation (ISCS) optimized with watershed to identify the features such as texture, pixel color, pixel intensity. For identifying the structural components of cells variation difference using Angular Vector Projection (AVP) was applied to find the structural variance. Then the histogram color equalizer (HCE) was applied to select the damaged cells using K-counts and their feature weight. Then the selected feature weights are trained into Deep vectorized scaling the neural network to classify the risk of the Leukemia cancer cells. This identifies the cancer cells effectively from micro image cells for detecting the risk of the patients. This improves the sensitivity, specificity rate as well in classification accuracy compared to the other methods.},

  abstract     = {Modern cloud computing strategies greatly reduce investment in infrastructure and data maintenance costs across startup companies and large organizations. This is mainly because of the emergence of the cloud-based IoT paradigm, which allows IoT-based devices to directly upload the data acquired from the environments to the remote cloud and allows the owner of those resources to manage their data through cloud-based applications. However, there are many challenges associated with this kind of data being outsourced, and the cloud server is entirely responsible for securing that data. Since these cloud servers cannot always be fully trusted, securing the deletion of unwanted sensitive data stored in the cloud to prevent data leaking is another challenging issue. As a result, most of the existing technology allows coarse-grained deletion of data on cloud servers. Consequently, cloud data security is jeopardized and new technological development in the cloud environment is hampered. This work implements a Cloud-based, Scalable, Secure unique data Deletion and Verification policy (CSSDV) that uses Ciphertext-Attribute-based encryption to enable fine-grained secure data deletion and data verification. We confirm the CSSDV scheme’s security under the standard model and demonstrate its accuracy and efficacy through theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiment data. The experimental results for eleven attribute each with different sizes demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in accessing and deleting the files in a secure and scalable manner.},

Each CPD keeps information on a particular feature of chromosomes, while the PTM provides causal reasoning capability taking CPDs as nodes and dependencies between CPDs and types as edges.

However, the problem of mining association rules or links from frequent subgraphs has not had many contributions. In this article, we state the problem of direct mining association rules from frequent subgraphs. Existing approaches on this topic perform the task in two phases. First, they traverse the search space to directly discover parent-child relationships from the discovered frequent subgraphs, then association rules are generated. We propose a one-phase algorithm, named So-GPARs, to generate rules as soon as frequent supergraphs are constructed from already existing frequent subgraphs. Our experiments on three single graph datasets show that the one-phase algorithm is more efficient than the two-phase algorithm in terms runtime of the rules generating phase.},

Research on information graphs in this aspect should be developed, especially in identifying “dangerous graph structures” such as the Hamiltonian graphs or cliques. Information graphs containing such a structure as a Hamilton cycle can be analyzed using results from the theory of finding and existence of Hamilton cycles, an essential branch of graph theory. The paper also describes a graph of potential security conflicts, a thematic graph, i.e. a specific information graph. Two theorems concerning the properties of information graphs are also proved.},

  abstract     = {Karyotyping requires chromosome instances to be segmented and classified from the metaphase images. One of the difficulties in chromosome segmentation is that the chromosomes are randomly positioned in the image, and there is a great chance for chromosomes to be touched or overlap with others. It is always much easier for operators and automatic programs to tackle images without overlapping chromosomes than ones with largely overlapped chromosomes. In order to reduce the processing difficulty, adding a smart image selection procedure ahead of segmentation is practical and necessary. In this paper, we introduce the Smart Karyotyping Image Selection (SKIS) based on Commonsense Knowledge Reasoning. The initial experiment demonstrates that the proposed approach can select the expected images based on reasoning and benefit following karyotyping processes.},

The diagnosis process is a team effort involving many people: patients, their families, healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers. Computer technology plays a crucial role in supporting this effort by providing a number of essential services to all of these groups. In the early stages of many diseases, a diagnosis can be made automatically using a computer-aided system, with some degree of certainty. This paper presents a hybrid optimal deep learning-based model for tuberculosis disease recognition using MRI images. Several deep learning models are combined to extract the most relevant features from MRI images. In particular, we establish a combination between vision transformer (ViTs) and Efficient-Net models in order to maximize classification accuracy. We conducted experiments to investigate the accuracy of the proposed model using the Shenzhen and Montgomery data set, and found that it yielded substantially more accurate and better results than the state of-the-art works.},

The underlying mechanism behind this notion is a group of individuals as a whole can display abilities not shown by individuals. In addition, the main aim of Collective Intelligence is to maximize groups’ potential. Many studies have investigated analyzing the roles of collective characteristics in fostering collective intelligence. Independence is an important principle of collective intelligence beside diversity, decentralization, and aggregation. By independence, one can have in mind the phenomenon in which collective members are freely in providing individual solutions to a given problem. This paper presents an analysis of the impact of independence on collective performance. For such a task, we propose an independence measure by taking into account individual reputations and graph theory. Then computational experiments have been conducted to determine the impact of independence on collective performance.

In the second stage, the selected units are clustered based on the inputs of the units using the fuzzy C-means algorithm. For each unit to be estimated, the corresponding cluster is found and the closest unit to the target unit is determined.

Currently, multiple deep structured architectures have been employed in biometric recognition with various features like robust generalization ability, high accuracy, and automatic learning. It is also considered as a more emerging area in biometrics along with machine learning approaches. Deep CNN is a conventional approach of image processing broadly utilized in several fields, however, it is simply influenced by slight disturbances and also includes bad anti-noise capacity in image classification. The major scope of this work is to implement adaptive deep learning-aided iris recognition. The key contribution of this paper relies on enhancing iris segmentation and iris recognition. Initially, the iris images are pre-processed, which are subjected to segmentation. The segmentation approach focuses on a Hough transform with K-Means Clustering (HT-KMC). Once the segmentation of the iris is done, the “Enhanced Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (E-Faster-RCNN)” is developed for the recognition purpose. The number of suitably hidden neurons of the conventional Faster-RCNN is optimized by the Adaptive-Sail Fish Optimization (ASFO) algorithm to obtain the highest efficiency. The simulation findings of the recommended approach proved that the method is effective in iris recognition by experimenting on a benchmark dataset.},

However, up to this time, there are still several limitations of existing deep learning-based temperature predictive methods related to the capability of efficiently integrating extra information resources into the temperature data learning process. Moreover, the high-noised/chaotic fluctuations within daily temperature data also lead to downgrades in the accuracy performance of recent deep learning-based techniques. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we proposed a novel integrated dual attention mechanism with the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), called as: DAttConvLSTM. Our proposed DAttCovLSTM supports to effectively capture the chaotic and dynamic temporal information from daily temperature data, thus significantly improve the prediction results.

Further, the detected images are fed into the model of “Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),” in which the deep features are fetched and finally given as input to the classifier model of “Convolution Neural Long Short-Term Memory (CNLSTM),” in turn some hyper parameters are optimally tuned by “Adaptive Honey Badger Algorithm (AHBA).” Hence, the experimental results prove that the recommended method achieves the better performance in terms of diverse metrics.},

  abstract     = {One of the most significant subfields in “Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)” research is considered to be target detection. Numerous studies have been conducted on target identification, with the majority of them favoring filter-oriented methods. The fundamental goal of radar systems is to “detect moving targets on the ground.” Decomposing a complex matrix into a structured sparse matrix and a low-rank matrix is a fundamental mathematics issue. Surveillance and reconnaissance rely heavily on “Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI),” but it&#39;s not a simple task. The SAR ATI was first developed for calculating the radial velocity of ground-moving objects. Yet, overlapping stationary clutter can corrupt the recorded differential phase, resulting in mistakes in position and velocity calculations. The main concept of this paper is to propose a novel “Adaptive Simplified Fractional Fourier Transform (A-SFrFT)” using the intelligent meta-heuristic improvement. This adaptive SFrFT efficiently estimates the “Doppler parameters of the moving targets.” The improved “Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)” termed Trio Updating HHO (TU-HHO) is used as the meta-heuristic algorithm that enhances the performance of the SFrFT-based target estimation. The mathematical analysis and simulation findings show that the suggested methods recommended strategy is successful.},

The ability of distributed IDS solutions makes it viable to combine and handle various kinds of sensors and generate alerts to different hosts positioned in distributed platforms. However, to offer secure and feasible services in a cloud platform is an imperative issue due to the impacts of attacks. This paper devises a novel IDS framework using cloud data to counter the influence of attacks. Here, the spark architecture is employed for discovering the intrusions. The pre-processing is applied to the input data for removing artifacts and noise considering input data. Thereafter, the feature extraction and feature fusion are performed in slave nodes. The feature fusion is carried out with the proposed Exponential Squirrel Search Algorithm (ExpSSA) algorithm. The fused features are considered in a deep-stacked autoencoder (Deep SAE) for performing effective intrusion detection. The proposed ExpSSA is adapted to train Deep SAE for tuning optimum weights. The exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) and squirrel search algorithm (SSA) are combined to create the proposed ExpSSA. The proposed ExpSSA-based Deep SAE offered improved performance compared to other techniques with the highest accuracy, detection rate of 0.846, and minimal FPR.},

The present study proposes a deep learning-based named entity recognition system using hybrid embedding which is the combination of fasttext and bidirectional LSTM based character embedding. These embeddings capture the contextual, syntactic and semantic properties of the text which improves the cognitive power of deep learning methods. We have performed different experiments with important variants of recurrent neural network (RNN) namely long short-term memory network (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM as well as gated recurrent unit (GRU) and bidirectional GRU on manually annotated Punjabi dataset and annotated Hindi dataset collected from international joint conference on natural language processing (IJCNLP-08) website. We have also explored different word embeddings and character embeddings for named entity recognition task. Out of all the experiments, the bidirectional GRU model using hybrid embedding has outperformed with precision, recall, and f-score values of 84%, 83%, and 83.50% respectively for Punjabi named entity recognition and 75%, 77%, 75.99% respectively for Hindi named entity recognition.},

After collecting the raw images, it is fed for image enhancement, performed through the Retinex approach. Further, the segmentation process is carried out by Modified DeepLabV3, where the significant Regions of Interest (ROI) are extracted by enhanced images and segmented the abnormalities. To meet the optimal value, the parameters in DeepLabV3 are tuned optimally by the Improved Rain Optimization Algorithm (IROA). Once the image is segmented, it is subjected to the detection or classification task, where the glaucoma is effectively classified by the hybrid learning method called Optimized DenseNet and MobileNet Transfer Learning (ODMNet) that is constructed with Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet) and MobileNet, where the layers are optimized by IROA approach. Finally, the performance is assessed with the assistance of diverse metrics. In experimental analysis, the accuracy and F1-score of the designed method attain 96% and 93%.

This study has provided a hybrid clustering method. This study has used the basic k-means clustering method as a basic cluster. Also, this study has increased the diversity of consensus by adopting some measures. Here, the aggregation process of the basic clusters is done by the meta-clustering technique, where the primary clusters are re-clustered to form the final clusters. The proposed hybrid clustering method has the advantages of k-means, its high speed, as well as it does not have its major weaknesses, the inability to detect non-spherical and non-uniform clusters. In the empirical studies, we have evaluated the proposed hybrid clustering method with other up-to-date and robust clustering methods on the different datasets and compared them.

Previous works focus on low spatial resolution prediction, e.g., county-level, and preprocess data to the same geographic level, which loses some useful information. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained population mobility data-based model (FGC-COVID) utilizing data of two geographic levels for community-level COVID-19 prediction. We use the population mobility data between Census Block Groups (CBGs), which is a finer-grained geographic level than community, to build the graph and capture the dependencies between CBGs using graph neural networks (GNNs). To mine as finer-grained patterns as possible for prediction, a spatial weighted aggregation module is introduced to aggregate the embeddings of CBGs to community level based on their geographic affiliation and spatial autocorrelation. Extensive experiments on 300 days LA city COVID-19 data indicate our model outperforms existing forecasting models on community-level COVID-19 prediction.},

The main intention of this paper is to design and develop an optimization model for selecting the minimum number of multi-hops between the source and destination for the cooperative VANET networks. The first phase has a first-time slot, where a signal is transmitted by the source to the cooperative nodes (its relays) and their equivalent destination. The main problem considered here is to optimally select the number of hops or relays that are adaptable for communication, to solve the multi-objective functions concerning the target throughput and outage probability. The adoption of new Dimension-based Cat Swarm Optimization (D-CSO) is the main contribution here to optimally select the multi-hops among source and destination. Through the performance evaluation, it is observed that the designed model has achieved networks-wide fairness performance and a good convergence rate.},

However, the traditional intrusion detection techniques have security challenges due to their poor detection performance. Hence, an effective intrusion detection model, namely spider monkey social optimization algorithm (SMSOA)-based Deep Q network is introduced for the detection of intrusion in the network. Here, the intrusion is detected based on the following three steps, such as pre-processing, feature fusion step, and detection. Estimated value replaced the missed value using missing value imputation in the pre-processing phase. Jaccard index by means of deep belief network (DBN) is performed in feature fusion. Deep Q network is used for intrusion detection process, where SMSOA method is used for training. The developed SMSOA scheme is performed by the integration of the social optimization algorithm (SOA) and spider monkey optimization (SMO). In addition, the attack mitigation process prevents the intruder enter into the network. Moreover, the developed model attained a better performance with respect to f -measure, recall values, and precision of 0.9455, 0.9585, and 0.9590, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a generalization of a mathematical model, called the “bridge model” in Literature, to study the co-evolution or dynamical relationship between the General Factor of Personality (GFP) and the Big Five Factors (B5F) as a consequence of a stimulus. This generalization permits its application here to study such co-evolution after a dose intake of methylphenidate. On the one hand, a stimulus-response model, an integro-differential equation called the “response model,” predicts the short-term effects of a stimulus on the GFP and on the B5F. The fact that both the GFP and the B5F dynamics can be described by the response model is here referred as the “invariance principle.” On the other hand, the invariance principle leads to the derivation of the bridge model: a second order partial differential equation that relates every B5F to the GFP and time. The outcomes of both experimental designs permit the validation of the response model and of the new bridge model.},

  abstract     = {Advanced and autonomous defence systems are needed to detect and mitigate new cyber attacks that target emerging technologies. This research defines cybersecurity preliminaries and stimulates questions to expose the complexities of automation and autonomous cybersecurity. A concept of autonomous anomaly management is introduced, where anomalies are defined not just as anomalous human readable strings, but as “unknown changes” and the need to better manage changes that can not be easily explained. Cybernetic principles are explored, and experiments are undertaken for quantitative analysis. Biodiversity Indices that compare relationships between species and communities in ecology are applied to cybernetic environments, to compare dynamic relationships between business applications. The proposed Cyber Diversity Index applies to all software-driven systems and environments. Changes of application&#39;s system calls are measured in real-time and monitored for unknown diversity changes, or “the anomaly,” when the system is placed under a zero-day attack. Experimental data is collected from continuous sampling of applications&#39; activity states, which contributes to both the behavioral change profiles and the dynamic normal baselines for the autonomous anomaly management. The findings in this research show that it is possible to define unique system entropic behaviors from applications&#39; activity that is triggered from internal or external stimulus.},

  abstract     = {Visual cryptography is a cryptographic method that encrypts visual facts and the information decrypted appears as an original visual image. Here, the confidential data is shared by dividing the visual details into multiple shares such that the encryption and the decryption are performed for reconstructing the original image back by stacking the splitted shares. However, the data sharing process lacks adequate security protection. To overcome the issues, this paper presents a robust visual cryptography-based data sharing scheme, named Competitive Swarm Improved Invasive Weed Optimization (CSIIWO) for sharing multiple data. Initially, the grayscale input image is shared between several parties, such that the shared image is encrypted and decrypted for retrieving the original image back. However, the cryptographic key generation is done using the devised CSIIWO algorithm such that the cryptographic keys are generated for the data sharing process to maintain confidentiality among multiple parties. Moreover, the devised method achieved the maximum Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 40.749 dB, minimum conditional privacy loss of 0.508, and maximum entropy of 7.987, respectively using Lena image. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can protect the multiple data sharing information and has numerous advantages compared with the previous mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to communicate and interact with various devices. In this regard, IoT data has tremendous volume, veracity, variety and velocity known as big data. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of this data, classical data analysis approaches to compatibility with IoT applications are not valid at all levels. Although the cloud can temporarily store big data to reduce the complexity of the analysis process, but problems such as security and latency persist. Machine learning techniques have shown promising results in previous studies for IoT data processing. Big data analytics methods can also be used to improve the performance of IoT applications and related challenges. Therefore, the use of machine learning techniques and big data technologies can achieve better performance and management of IoT applications. The purpose of this paper is to review machine learning techniques and recent advances in big data analytics that can be used to develop IoT applications. This study seeks to achieve this purpose by reviewing published articles on IoT-based machine learning and IoT-based big data between 2010 and 2021. There are several challenges and solutions in the literature for these fields, so that 32 articles have been reviewed to address these issues. These articles are reviewed in four general categories: platform, framework, applications and model to be the starting point for future research.},
