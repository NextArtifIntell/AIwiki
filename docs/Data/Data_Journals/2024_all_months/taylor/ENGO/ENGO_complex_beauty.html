  abstract     = {The article presents two distributed motion planning methods for dynamically coordinating multiple automated guide vehicles (AGVs) in an industrial setting, aiming to enhance their flexibility, robustness and scalability. A predictive motion model is utilized to describe the transport process mathematically as a dynamical system. Subsequently, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based decomposition techniques, both serial and parallel, are developed to coordinate the AGVs and mitigate the computational burden. The efficacy of the distributed methods is verified through testing in industrial scenarios, demonstrating that they can significantly improve multi-AGV system transport productivity with minimal computational effort. Notably, the parallel scheme exhibits superior performance in coordinating the AGVs compared to the serial scheme.},

  abstract     = {In various machine learning applications, classification plays an important role in categorizing and predicting data. To improve the classification performance, it is crucial to identify and remove the anomalies. Also, class imbalance in many machine learning applications is a very common problem since most classifiers tend to be biased toward the majority class by ignoring the minority class instances. Thus, in this research, we propose a new under-sampling technique based on anomaly detection and removal to enhance the performance of imbalanced classification problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments are conducted on forty imbalanced data sets and two non-parametric hypothesis tests are employed to show the statistical difference in classification performances between the proposed method and other traditional resampling methods. From the experiment, it is shown that the proposed method improves the classification performance by effectively detecting and eliminating the anomalies among true-majority or pseudo-majority class instances.},

However, the model updating problem is usually ill-posed owing to limited and noisy measurement data, and the predominant sensitivity-based optimization approaches may suffer from large linearization errors. To address these challenges, this article proposes using the unscented Kalman inversion with l 1 -norm regularization (UKI- l 1 ) to solve the damage identification problem in a derivative-free manner. UKI- l 1 implements an explicit transformation converting the l 1 -norm regularized least-squares problem into the l 2 -norm regularized problem, which can be readily solved by the UKI with measurement augmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through identifying damage of a continuous beam structure and a reinforced concrete frame structure. Numerical investigation confirms the robustness of UKI- l 1 to measurement noise, and experimental study demonstrates that the damage identification results obtained by UKI- l 1 match well with expectations.},

This article proposes a topology optimization framework specifically designed for optimizing the frequency of nodal diameter modes in cyclic periodic structures. The framework enables the specific frequency of nodal diameter modes, as well as the gaps between multiple specific frequencies, to be adjusted. Furthermore, a universal optimization strategy is introduced for the frequency optimization design of cyclic periodic structures. This optimization strategy is applied to the maximization optimization process of the fundamental frequency and frequency gaps to control multiple frequencies across various nodal diameters. The effectiveness of the frequency topology optimization framework for cyclic periodic structures is demonstrated through case studies involving different sector angles and frequencies.},

Then, robust optimization methods are applied to construct robust models under three situations of uncertainty. For the computational complexity of large-scale problems, an enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm (EBDA) is designed. A numerical case analysis is conducted using five different scale instances. First, compared to other algorithms, EBDA accelerates the solution efficiency while ensuring convergence. Secondly, the sensitivity of the objective weights and the trade-offs of multiple objectives are analysed. Finally, the impact is analysed of the uncertain environment, CSR, an FRS, an FSS and a VSS on the CLSC network. Decision makers need to balance three objectives to manage CLSC and use these strategies appropriately to address the negative impact of an uncertain environment.},

In conclusion, the performance function descends more quickly and with less dependence on parameter settings than when using the OC method.

By maximizing the MFEI function, a new sample of arbitrary fidelity level is determined to ameliorate the accuracy of the MHK model, and convergence to the high-fidelity optimum is ensured. The proposed optimization method based on MFEI and MHK is demonstrated by two analytical function cases and verified by two aerodynamic design optimizations: drag minimizations of an RAE2822 aerofoil and an ONERA M6 wing in transonic flows. It is shown that the MFEI method tends to infill more gainful samples of lower fidelities during optimization, so fewer highest-fidelity samples are required.

In this method, a surrogate model is dynamically constructed and updated between the lower dimensional principal components and the response, instead of between the high-dimensional design variables and the response as in traditional methods. The key point of DK is that the principal components analysis (PCA) is integrated with the active learning kriging surrogate model (AK). Since PCA can reduce the dimension effectively, DK makes surrogate model construction possible for complex high-dimensional optimization problems. Numerical examples and four classical engineering problems are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {The real-world problem of unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (UPMSPSST) is investigated and focuses on two key aspects: fast solution and many-objective optimization. While dispatching rules (DRs) are effective in meeting demand, the manual design of many-objective DRs (MaODRs) is challenging. An alternative approach, based on the automatic evolution of MaODRs using hyper-heuristics, shows promise. However, limited literature exists on the automatic evolution of MaODRs specifically for UPMSPSST. In this study, a many-objective genetic programming (MaOGP) algorithm is formed by combining many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) with genetic programming (GP) algorithms. This enables the automatic evolution of MaODRs, leveraging the respective advantages of each approach. The exploration results demonstrate that the evolved MaODRs outperform manually designed DRs reported in prior literature. Furthermore, when considering combinations of objectives with different correlations, the MaODRs exhibit outstanding performance across multiple objectives simultaneously, surpassing even the performance of DRs trained separately for individual objectives. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed MaOGP approach in efficiently and effectively solving the UPMSPSST problem, opening avenues for further research and practical applications in related industries.},

  abstract     = {Quality management plays a crucial role in manufacturing industry as it directly impacts product quality and customer satisfaction. Traditional manufacturing industries have begun incorporating deep learning models to manage production quality. However, existing studies often focus on algorithmic models that require high computing power, while practical industrial applications often suffer from a lack of labelled data. This article proposes a novel and lightweight machine-learning-based quality detection model to address this issue. The proposed model tackles quality detection by efficiently detecting the local maxima of the scale space in input images using a Hessian matrix detection method, eliminating the need for continuous computation of multilayer Gaussian difference images. Additionally, image processing techniques are employed to augment the training data, enabling the model to achieve high accuracy even with limited datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms alternative methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

The method uses a nonlinear optimization task to solve the inverse damage identification problem. The damage magnitudes of the plate elements are taken as design variables, and the objective function to be minimized uses the variations in the plate flexibility matrix and includes a penalization term to avoid false alarm detection. EJaya is developed by incorporating three modifications in the traditional Jaya algorithm: generating an initial population of candidate solutions using prior knowledge of the damage scenario, integrating a component that takes into account the individual distribution through the search space, and implementing a new local search technique. The simulation results show that EJaya is efficient in both solution quality and computational effort and can detect and evaluate damage even in large-sized problems and under noisy data conditions.},

First, updated unit cell problems, with an emphasis on rotational degrees of freedom, are proposed to evaluate shell-structured microstructures, so that a pointwise effective stiffness calculation can be efficiently conducted with shell elements, which is otherwise computationally prohibitive with solid elements. Then, a two-scale optimization framework seeking minimum compliance is established, where the design variables controlling both in-plane parallelogram shape and out-of-plane stiffener height are introduced to enlarge the design space. In addition, mapping functions are integrated into the optimization formulation and concurrently optimized, enabling the production of well-defined dehomogenized plates. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method by comparing the deflections of the graded plates with those of the homogenized plates.},

Finally, a distributed simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (DSPSA) method is designed to solve the bilevel non-convex programming.

In the first stage, a bilevel optimization technique is proposed that can plan the motion from a global perspective and search the optimal workpiece layout. In the second step, based on a novel smoothness index, a modified whale optimization algorithm combined with the differential evolution algorithm (DE-WOA) is proposed to resolve redundancy under robot and machining error constraints.

  abstract     = {G-Lattices—a novel family of periodic lattice structures introduced by Arash Armanfar and Erkan Gunpinar—demonstrate diverse mechanical properties owing to their generatively designed shapes. To assess the properties of lattice structures effectively, experimental tests and finite element analysis (FEA) are commonly used. However, the complex nature of these structures poses challenges, leading to high computation time and costs. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to predict the mechanical properties of G-Lattices quickly under defined loading conditions. G-Lattice training data is generated through a sampling technique, and voxelized data is employed as ML feature vectors for predicting properties determined by FEA. To address the uneven distribution of target values, samples are clustered and utilized to train a classification model. This two-step process involves the classification of G-Lattices, followed by the application of specific regression models trained for each cluster for precise predictions. According to experiments, the ML model obtained, which predicts stiffness-over-volume ratios for G-Lattices, achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 6.5% for 1600 G-Lattices in a few seconds. Furthermore, approximately 70% of the 40,000 G-Lattices exhibited errors within 5%. The ML model&#39;s rapid predictions and acceptable accuracy make it useful for quick decision-making and seamless integration into optimization processes.},

The shape-morphing technique, hybrid surrogate-based modelling approach, multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, and a novel identification approach combining the modified technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and modified comprehensive objective weighting method are used separately to parameterize a model of the wheel, construct approximation models, solve the optimization process and determine the optimal trade-off design. The robustness and effectiveness of the identification method are demonstrated by analysing the effects of different optimization strategies on the optimal trade-off solutions. According to the optimized results, the impact resistance of the wheel is evidently enhanced while its total mass remains almost unchanged and other mechanical performance metrics are improved to varying degrees.},

First, the vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction features are analysed through a dynamic model. Then, an MOO method is developed based on an effective surrogate model. In this method, the accuracy and stability of the radial basis function are enhanced by proposing an innovative improvement strategy and adopting the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The proposed method is validated by a few numerical tests. Based on this verification, the MOO model between key parameters and several optimization objectives is formulated, and the optimization solution set of the vehicle key parameters is obtained using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Finally, the optimization effects are revealed by comparing the dynamic performance of the vehicle obtained from the original values and the optimal solution set.},

The results of numerical problems and the in-situ dataset from a combine harvester show that the proposed model can provide accurate detection results for outliers and accurate prediction results for new points.

Dissimilar AA6061-T6 and AA7075-T6 plates were welded using an automated tungsten inert gas (TIG) process. Mathematical models were developed to predict the mechanical properties. High welding current or low travel speed enhanced the joint quality but raised residual stresses. At a welding current of 145 A, travel speed of 1.28 mm/s and gas flow rate of 18 l/min, the optimized UTS, PE, MH and RS were predicted to be 167.28 MPa, 10.25%, 69.61 HV and 65.49 MPa, respectively.

Previous studies have struggled to accurately calculate the celestial model in short-arc horizon scenes, greatly reducing navigation accuracy. To address this issue, this article proposes a high-precision short-arc fitting optimization algorithm based on prior shape information. The suggested technique is a two-step estimation process that uses minimal horizon features to solve the optimal model parameters iteratively. First, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is applied to compute the prior shape information of celestial bodies and suppress the interference of outliers. Then, an improved ellipse optimization equation is designed to integrate the shape information while ensuring efficiency. Finally, to perform precise short-arc fitting, the model parameters are iteratively optimized using an adaptive trust region. Numerous comparison tests demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves rapid convergence in three steps and requires approximately 15–20% less minimum arc length than Christian’s method.},

Besides, the crew sit time is reduced considering the maximum legal working hours and the minimum essential rest time. Moreover, maintenance operations can be done during the ground time, not necessarily at the end of duty day. The model is never infeasible because flight cancelation is an alternative solution for recovering a schedule. A modified Tabu Search (TS) approach has been developed to solve the model. The performance of the model and solution approach is examined by several test problems in small, medium, and large scales. The results indicate that TS reaches optimal and close-optimal in a short computational time, especially in large scale problems.},

Weight adaptation via WS-transformation has shown promising results, but its performance is dependent on the choice of the start of the adaptation process. In order to overcome this limitation, in this article an efficient entropy-based trigger is proposed with fast calculation of the entropy that scales favourably with the number of dimensions. The novel entropy-based method is complemented by a dual-archiving mechanism that preserves extreme solutions. The dual-archiving strategy mitigates the possibility to discard those critical individuals whose loss affects the whole evolutionary process.

In order to achieve adaptive movement of the ankle–foot mechanism, a three-degrees-of-freedom spatial ankle–foot mechanism is designed by tensegrity, which is a spatial grid structure composed of springs and struts. Dynamic analysis is the basis of control algorithm research, and the dynamic model of the mechanism can be established by a Lagrangian equation. Then, a controller is proposed for tracking the trajectory of the ankle–foot mechanism under external disturbances. Combining rolling optimization and feedback correction, the controller can be defined as an optimization problem, by solving which the ankle–foot mechanism can be controlled to track the desired trajectory quickly.

Despite progress in developing mathematical models, few studies comprehensively address project and supply-chain management aspects in an integrated framework. This article presents an integrated approach for multi-project resource investment, material ordering and production planning in a project-driven supply chain. A mixed-integer programming model is developed to optimize the total cost of renewable resource investment, production, transportation, and material ordering and holding, with an opportunity to share mobile renewable resources across multiple projects. A Lagrangian relaxation heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine the upper and lower bounds for the objective function, with an additional set of valid cuts to reduce the distance between bounds. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate the favourable performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the GAMS solver. This article provides insights into supply-chain participant expenses and activity scheduling based on these findings.},

  abstract     = {The bin packing problem is a classical problem widely existing in practical applications, such as shipping, warehousing and manufacturing industries. Whereas current research mainly focuses on reducing packing costs by optimizing the packing scheme, this study explores a novel approach by redesigning the bin sizes to fit the items ready to be packed. Specifically, this study considers a general three-dimensional open dimension problem (3D-ODP) where all dimensions, i.e. length, width and height, of a number of heterogeneous bin types are unknown and need to be decided. Based on the designed bin types, the corresponding packing scheme with minimal total costs  is optimized, which is referred to as a three-dimensional multiple-bin-size bin packing problem (3D-MBSBPP).  The combination of 3D-ODP and 3D-MBSBPP is redefined as a three-dimensional bin design and packing problem (3D-BDPP), for which a two-layer heuristic is developed. It consists of an outer heuristic framework ( i.e. genetic algorithm or differential evolution algorithm) to design bin types, and an inner deterministic constructive heuristic ( i.e. placement algorithm) to generate an effective solution for the 3D-MBSBPP. Extensive simulation tests on the classical benchmark and a case study derived from an e-commerce company are conducted to verify the algorithms and deduce managerial insights.},

Hence, a mixed integer programming model catering for the dual-command transaction process is formulated to optimize system performance. Furthermore, an adaptive neighbourhood search with an ε -greedy algorithm is proposed to solve the problem.

First, the path planning model is constructed, and strict movement rules are designed. Secondly, the EACA with global search, balancing the contradiction between metrics, is designed. The dynamic regulation of pheromone concentration and the mechanism of fluctuating pheromone distribution are explored, heuristic information is optimized and the path planning effect is enhanced. Finally, a new mechanism of away-from-obstacles is proposed as the obstacle avoidance strategy, which ensures a reasonable safe distance.

This method integrates the Taguchi method, grey relational analysis and a hybrid multi-objective decision-making approach, and iteratively updates the orthogonal array to perform optimization for handling design variables with multiple levels. Compared to the conventional non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), the developed DMO is capable of achieving the Pareto frontier with fewer evaluations of the objective function.

To tackle this intricate challenge, a novel hybrid algorithm (HDE-Jaya) has been developed, combining the differential evolution (DE) and Jaya methods. The Jaya model is integrated into DE as a mutation operator to boost exploration and exploitation. In addition, the crossover probability is generated randomly at each iteration to preserve diversity. This makes HDE-Jaya a parameter-free algorithm. The performance of HDE-Jaya was validated by optimizing six common mechanical engineering design problems and further evaluated on an automotive turbocharger design, aiming to reduce vibrations, minimize binding stress and improve dynamic stability. The results indicate that HDE-Jaya is superior to other algorithms, including DE and the Jaya algorithm, in terms of solution accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the IEEE 69-bus distribution network with three wind turbines (WTs) connected at the same buses of three battery energy storage systems (BESSs), with three 20- or 30-outlet electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) for charging electric vehicles (EVs). The honey badger algorithm (HBA) is adopted to minimize daily energy loss. The HBA determines the best size and position for three WT-BESS buses and three EVCS buses. The HBA calculates BESS size and operation mode to minimize daily energy loss. The demand of EVCSs varies throughout the day depending on the random choice of the number and state of charge of EVs entering the station. This results in the active and reactive energy losses and utility input energy decreasing by 63.5%, 60.6% and 59.6%, respectively, and the minimum voltage increasing from 0.9256 to 0.9839 pu. The network voltage profile and stability are also improved.},

It has multiple conflicting objective functions based on computationally very expensive (16–20 hours) numerical simulations, and simulation failures, meaning that simulation calls can be unsuccessful. In this article, a surrogate-assisted evolutionary interactive multiobjective optimization method is applied to designing a pump stator. A decision maker&#39;s preferences are iteratively incorporated into the solution process and the advantages of an interactive method are demonstrated in two areas: (1) reducing the computation time; and (2) finding a preferred solution that reflects the decision maker&#39;s preferences with a low cognitive load. The decision maker was satisfied with the interactive solution process and the final solution reflected his preferences well. Additionally, because he was familiar with the domain of the problem, the preferences he provided guided the search in directions where no failed simulations were encountered. Importantly, the applied method could save days of computation time.},

Here, the performance of the harmony search algorithm (HSA) is improved by incorporating opposition-based learning that utilizes opposite, quasi-opposite and quasi-reflected numbers. Moreover, a local search heuristic is used to improve the performance of the HSA further. The proposed IHSA is employed to solve 83 real-world MCLP instances. The performance of the IHSA is compared with a Lagrangean/surrogate relaxation-based heuristic, a customized genetic algorithm with local refinement, and an improved chemical reaction optimization-based algorithm.

  abstract     = {Post-disaster humanitarian relief logistics focuses on managing the supply and shipment of relief items. Owing to the complexity arising from the hierarchical decision relationship and the uncertainties of demand and transportation, it is challenging to develop an effective humanitarian relief logistics network (HRLN). A globalized robust bi-level multi-objective HRLN model involving uncertainties in transportation time, transportation cost and demand is developed to address this problem, in which an upper-level decision-maker focuses on the allocation problem and a lower-level decision-maker considers the supply problem. For tractability, the goal programming approach is employed to trade off conflicting timeliness, satisfaction and operational cost objectives. The proposed globalized robust bi-level HRLN model is reformulated as its globalized robust counterpart formulations under two different perturbation structures. The primal–dual approach is adopted to transform the bi-level models into equivalent mixed-integer conic programs. A case study concerning an Iranian earthquake is conducted to prove the performance of the proposed model. Globalized robust models are more flexible and able to immunize against uncertainty by comparison with traditional robust optimization and deterministic solutions. The managerial insights of using the globalized robust bi-level optimization approach are reported for disaster response management. The design of an emergency aviation network to circumvent the effects of COVID-19 could be considered in future research.},

Firstly, a genetic algorithm (GA) with three crossover operators and seven mutation operators is devised to find a set of solutions. In each generation, a randomly selected crossover (mutation) operator is used to update the individuals. The solutions found by the GA are further improved by a trip-adjustment strategy (TAS) to obtain the final solution. The GA-TAS is compared with an adaptive large neighbourhood search method, a heuristic procedure, and experience-based scheduling schemes on seven problem instances. Experiments show that the GA-TAS outperforms comparative approaches on a number of vehicle and balancing vehicle driving tasks.},

MinDA is N P -hard and is related to applications such as manufacturing systems design and VLSI layout. A mixed-integer linear programming formulation of MinDA is presented. The capabilities of the proposed formulation are assessed on 63 problem instances with varying densities and sizes up to 25 vertices. Additionally, an examination of the structure of an optimal MinDA solution is conducted. Based on this analysis, an iterated local search (ILS) algorithm is established, and novel strategies are developed to enhance its effectiveness. In contrast to traditional ILS approaches, where the local search phase invariably reaches a local optimum, the local search phase in the proposed algorithm may converge to a point in the vicinity of a local optimum, thereby reducing the computational burden for large-scale instances. Extensive computational experiments employing the ILS algorithm are conducted on instances with sizes n up to 10,240 vertices.},

A ‘one-at-a-time’ method is first examined to solve the optimization problem and it is noted that this method is effectively what is currently used in practice. Two academic test problems are used to demonstrate that this method is not optimal. This leads to the development of three novel methods to solve the optimization problem: no-flow, with-flow and divide-and-conquer. It is noted that the with-flow method guarantees global optimality. All methods are compared on two real-world case studies. On small road networks, the with-flow method decreases costs by 7.4%, and achieves a 20 times speedup over the one-at-a-time method. On long road networks, the divide-and-conquer method is faster than all other methods without any notable cost difference. However, the divide-and-conquer method is an heuristic and cannot guarantee that it returns a global minimum.},

To handle this problem, neural architecture search (NAS) has been developed by simultaneously optimizing the network architecture and hyperparameters, the main disadvantage of which is the requirement for extremely high computational resources. To accelerate the NAS of CNNs, a two-stage adaptive lightweight convolutional neural architecture search (AL-CNAS) method is proposed in this article based on an evolutionary algorithm. In this method, the original search space is divided into two parts based on feature grouping, and only one part is optimized at each stage to achieve an exponential decrease in the number of genotype combinations, which helps to improve search efficiency and reduce computational resource requirements. The proposed AL-CNAS is validated on the real-world segmentation of steel microstructure and two benchmark segmentation problems, and the computational results show that the proposed AL-CNAS has good segmentation performance and generality.},

In each iteration, MOPLS incorporates a tabu mechanism to determine new points for expensive evaluations via a series of independent surrogate-assisted local searches. A master–worker architecture in MOPLS allows the algorithm to conduct either synchronous or asynchronous parallel processing. On a number of benchmark problems, MOPLS outperforms recent surrogate-assisted algorithms within a limited computational budget. Empirical results from parallel experiments indicate that MOPLS can significantly improve its efficiency through parallelism, and the asynchronous MOPLS shows advantages in handling objectives with non-constant evaluation times. Finally, the better performance of MOPLS over alternatives in calibrating a complex watershed simulation model demonstrates its competitiveness in solving real-world engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Medical imaging is crucial in examinations and for providing appropriate patient care. Medical images are used to diagnose and identify specific conditions. However, the diagnostic procedures are confounded by the complexity of these images, which have several overlapping characteristics. Various techniques have enhanced biomedical image segmentation, and strategies to improve the contrast and accuracy of medical images have been presented in the literature. This article presents a recurrent grasshopper herd-based optimized histogram-based contrast enhancement technique, in which sharp-edge morphological characteristics can be enhanced using inclusive Laplacian fractional order Savitzky–Golay differentiation. An adaptive-sized residual fusion network approach is used to isolate the target tissue in the biomedical image. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified using different medical data sets and a high level of accuracy is achieved. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of the scale, shape and morphological attributes of the medical image.},

These scenarios include linear, bar and block activities, with the direction and velocity of linear activities varying, as well as the number of construction teams involved. Resource constraints further complicate scheduling. To address these challenges, a two-stage dynamic scheduling model was developed in this study. The first stage involved selecting a scheduling strategy based on available resources to meet the project deadline, while the second involved developing two cost-effective models to determine the best plan. To optimize the model, a hybrid algorithm incorporating an elite strategy, an adaptive operator and a catastrophe operator was established. The capabilities of the proposed model were demonstrated through several application examples, highlighting the benefits of improved consideration of construction scenarios in linear engineering. Overall, the model’s ability to identify a reasonable range of resource allocations highlights its effectiveness in optimizing linear engineering project schedules.},

To improve the efficiency of disturbance management, this article investigates the integrated rescheduling problem of train timetable and rolling stock circulation. To balance service quality and operational cost, the considered problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model by capturing train operation processes as running arcs, dwell arcs and coming-out/back arcs based on the classical space–time network. For the purpose of improving computational efficiency, a Q-learning-based solution approach is proposed to derive a hierarchical policy for integrated rescheduling. The decisions on train timetable follow a lower-level policy that can be learned in the pre-training process, and the decisions on rolling stock circulation follow a higher-level policy that can be generated in the real-time planning process. Finally, two sets of numerical examples are carried out to evaluate the proposed method.},

It is generally recognized that shapes with a high aspect ratio have a higher lift–drag ratio (LDR) and superior fluid performance. However, the pursuit of higher LDR cannot achieve the optimal overall performance, and there are complex design factors. It is necessary but difficult to conduct a thorough examination of shape layout, energy-carrying and other issues. In this article, the layout and energy models are established, and the causal graph is used as a multidisciplinary analysis method to show the interaction between system variables. A shape design method based on surrogate models and causal graphs is proposed that incorporates knowledge into optimization by combing the information flow and finding the relationship between variables. The results show that causal-assisted optimization can mine the characteristics of variables and discover more valuable shape designs.},

A solution approach that combines the mixed-integer linear programming and genetic algorithm is designed for solving the resulting MINLP problem. In addition, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed to increase the computational efficiency and to update the control inputs only when needed.

By combining the concept of regret from robust optimization with that of design space reduction from set-based design, a new complementary view on uncertainty referred to as Design Space Covering for Uncertainty (DSC-U) is introduced. This method develops a trade-space between reducing the design space and locking in sub-optimal performance while considering interval uncertainty that impacts the problem. A double-loop algorithm and a more efficient set covering algorithm are presented along with the structure of the method. These are demonstrated on three sample problems, a previously-studied cantilever tube optimization, the Rosenbrock function with different levels of coupling between the uncertain parameters, and a ship midship section design problem with thirty-six design variables and four uncertain terms. The DSC-U approach is shown to be practical in providing a complementary insight into the impact of uncertainty for a wide range of design techniques.},

  abstract     = {A method is presented for obtaining topology optimized designs for internally cooled high temperature applications, using a flexible geometry description, by means of a voxelization methodology and a novel boundary detection algorithm. A conjugate heat transfer approach is taken; the physics is described by a Stokes–Brinkman model for the flow, weakly coupled with a convection–diffusion model for the heat transfer. A practically relevant optimization formulation, consisting of a maximum temperature objective with a mass flow constraint, is used, and applied to an industrial-relevant non-trivial geometry resembling a guide vane in a gas turbine. Temperatures and velocities from the optimized design are compared with the response from a Stokes flow model with body-fitted mesh and a high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model. A comparison of the performance from a mixed and a penalty approach for solving the flow problem is included. The voxelization approach shows good promise for handling complex design domains.},

Through adjusting the cable force of an actual bridge, it can be found that this method is highly efficient in calculation, and the efficiency and accuracy of control of the cable forces are high, ensuring that the cable forces and alignment of the bridge structure after completion are in line with the design expectations.},

In this study, a group purchasing structure is proposed in which each purchaser needs a portion of the items in a bundle and has his or her preferences. However, when the buyers of a bundle are scattered across different locations, the shipper must travel long distances between buyers, which increases shipping costs. Therefore, besides bundle prices, shipping costs are an inseparable expenditure for group purchasing. It is assumed that shipping costs increase on certain days, e.g. around Christmas. A tailored mathematical formulation is formulated to maximize the total group saving. Considering the complexity of the model, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed as a solution algorithm, and compared with the CPLEX solver. The results confirm the performance of the GA, which provides up to 24% better solutions than CPLEX.},

Type I and IV DGs were considered. The load flow solutions were obtained using a branch matrix formulation. IEEE 33 and 69 buses were used for performance analysis and the results were compared with previously published results to validate the method in providing solutions even in complex system configurations.

Secondly, a practical evaluation method of topology rationality is proposed based on graph theory in order to avoid invalid structural analysis and improve optimization efficiency. The finite element model corresponding to the binary point-line relation in graph theory and judgements of force nodes, lump masses, structural integrity, etc. are unified.

Then, a collaborative optimization design method was proposed that was based on the neural network and the genetic algorithm for secondary design of the rib thickness. Through optimizing the neural network model by NSGA-II, Pareto optimal results were obtained.

On this basis, crows are divided into multiple competing groups, and are assigned different roles and statuses. Then, the group strategy including different search modes is implemented to increase the solution diversity and search efficiency. Moreover, benefiting from the adaptive mechanism, the search range of crows changes in different stages to balance exploration and exploitation capabilities. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, 35 benchmark test functions (including 10 CEC2020 functions) and three engineering design problems are solved by GCSA and 11 other algorithms. The results prove that GCSA generally provides more competitive results than other metaheuristic algorithms.},

Owing to this, revised expectation improvement (REI) criteria are proposed by introducing a balance factor to adjust the exploitation and exploration of EI criteria, and the corresponding algorithm is called the revised efficient global optimization (REGO) algorithm. In order to motivate exploration, and ensure that the computational cost is acceptable, a Latin hypercube based indicator is proposed to denote a balance factor from the viewpoint of sample distribution. Several test functions and an airfoil optimization problem are applied to verify the performance of the REGO algorithm.

In this approach, the buckling-resistant non-uniform shapes of single struts with different slenderness and inclination are first identified, and then they are directly used to replace uniform struts in LCSSs. This method can save considerable design time compared to conventional methods, which require conducting optimizations on entire LCSSs. Numerical results demonstrate that four designed representative non-uniform LCSSs can gain over 15% improvement in buckling strength compared to their counterpart uniform LCSSs. This improvement is even comparable to the solutions from optimizations on entire LCSSs. Two LCSSs with non-uniform struts are 3D printed, and the test results validate at least 10% improvement in compressive strength. Based on the proposed method, various LCSSs with superior buckling strength could be designed for different loadings.},

  abstract     = {This work evaluates the performance of the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) for truss system optimization problems and presents a novel method called the modified salp swarm algorithm (MSSA). Five truss structures, previously optimized by metaheuristics and containing discrete and continuous variables, were used for the evaluations. Size and size–shape optimization types were considered. Although the SSA performs poorly and has convergence issues in initial random solutions, it reaches comparable solutions to previously published results, particularly in continuous problems. In contrast, the MSSA achieves the best solutions for discrete problems and is relatively close to the best results in the reference literature on continuous problems. Moreover, the MSSA convergence curves exhibit a modest increase in convergence rates, especially for discrete problems. It is envisaged that the findings will contribute to improving solution performance, convergence speed and security for future real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {For a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) powered by a fuel cell (FC), a battery (BAT) and an ultracapacitor (UC), an improved convex-optimization-based energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed in this article. To protect the fuel cell and the battery from peak power, an adaptive fuzzy filter is used to complete the frequency decoupling of the power demand. Subsequently, an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS) is introduced to improve fuel economy. To improve the optimality of the EMS obtained, an improved convex optimization method is utilized by introducing a slack variable and a barrier function. Finally, based on experimental data and an improved convex optimization algorithm, the optimal EMS is calculated and verified by a series of simulations under different driving cycles. Simulation results confirm that, compared with the traditional ECMS-based EMS, the proposed EMS can improve fuel economy and achieve lower power fluctuation and optimal FC efficiency for the FCHEV.},

In the node clustering phase, the hybrid algorithm based on the improved modularity index enables the fast formation of sufficient partition solutions with a more balanced water demand distribution and reduced diameters of boundary pipes. Then, in the partition dividing phase, a three-step optimization method, comprising preliminary hydraulic analysis, search for a suboptimal solution and multi-objective optimization, is presented to find a fast and optimal solution for the location of flow meters and isolation valves in WDNs.

A new layout optimization design scheme for grid-stiffened structures is proposed in this study, based on the continuous representation of discrete variables and a dimensionality reduction method. In this method, first, a discrete stiffener layout is described by a bounded field with space correlation and transformed into continuous design variables using material interpolation. Then, to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the design space, a series expansion approach is adopted. Finally, a sequential optimization strategy combined with the kriging surrogate model is used to successfully solve optimization problems. Layout optimization designs, including a stiffened plate and a space-borne antenna reflector, are proposed to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.},

The innovative ASS is defined using inequality to effectively perform reliability analysis and obtain the feasible most probable failure point in the inner loop. Meanwhile, a defined update factor is applied to eliminate the unnecessary probability constraints and renew the active constraints in the outer loop. The inner loop and outer loop are synchronized to enhance computational efficiency during the whole optimization process.

Another contribution of the proposed N-FMS is that it simultaneously optimizes the utilization of the shovel fleet and truck fleet. The proposed FMS makes decisions using two nested multiple-objective mixed-integer linear goal programming models.

This article proposes a new approach, where the search space dimension is reduced through substructuring. The high-dimensional high-rise building optimization problem is converted to a set of low-rise building optimization subproblems of lower dimensions. The subproblems are iteratively solved instead of the original problem. The substructures are analysed and optimally designed, one after another, until convergence, taking into account the effects of other parts of the building to maintain the building’s integrity. Thus, the analysis of a high-rise building is accomplished by analysing a set of low-rise building substructures. Concurrently, the high-dimensional optimization problem is solved through some low-dimensional subproblems. Therefore, building analysis, design and optimization are conducted simultaneously.

Given the uncertain nature of the electrical and thermal load, a novel scenario-based robust optimization framework is developed to overcome the problem uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed scenario-based robust scheme against conventional deterministic and stochastic scheduling methods is verified through numerical simulation on a prototype MG.

The computational approach creates a tube that connects the inlet and outlet using von Mises probability distribution. The created geometries are checked for static and dynamic properties using FEA. The algorithm continues until a candidate design passes the imposed thresholds. The candidate designs perform similarly to benchmark in evaluated aspects, demonstrating promising results.

Structural properties allow the reformulation of the problem as a binary linear program. Constraint relaxation and cardinality-constrained parameters control the degree of solution conservatism. An optimization problem permits the selection of solutions from the obtained set of robust solutions.

  abstract     = {The reasonable location of treatment plants can improve the recovery rate of construction and demolition waste (C&amp;DW). However, most studies ignore the impact of uncertainty or are based on known probability information. This study establishes an optimization site selection model using a robust method, which takes into account the uncertainty of the recycling amount of C&amp;DW and the demand for recycled products. The immune genetic algorithm is applied to solve and analyse the model. Chongqing, the only municipality in south-west China, is taken as a case study. The results show that: (1) transportation costs affect the behaviour of construction contractors in recycling C&amp;DW; (2) site selection schemes and total costs vary with changes in the disturbance ratio and uncertainty level, and the uncertainty of supply has a greater impact on the costs; and (3) when the uncertainty level and disturbance rate reach a certain value, the site selection scheme changes.},

  abstract     = {Latin hypercube design (LHD) is one of the most frequently used sampling methods. However, most LHDs generate data samples in a manner that hinders computational efficiency and space-filling performance when high dimensions and large samples are involved. Therefore, a sequential recursive evolution Latin hypercube design (RELHD) is proposed in this article, which adopts a permutation inheritance algorithm to update and optimize the LHD. A recursive split algorithm is also proposed and used to enhance the computational efficiency by dividing the sample set into smaller subsets. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the space-filling quality of the RELHD compares well with the enhanced stochastic evolutionary algorithm (ESE) in complex problems with large samples and high dimensions, with RELHD having a significantly higher computational efficiency than ESE. Finally, the sequential approach of RELHD proves to be a more efficient strategy when dealing with sampling-based analysis problems.},

In this article, the pre-tightening and connection process are analysed sequentially through an implicit–explicit calculation method. Because of the time-consuming nonlinear analysis, a constrained sequential approximate optimization (CSAO) method in the irregular design domain is proposed for the lightweight optimization design of CBJs. A novel constrained space-filling and non-collapsing sequential sampling method is adopted to address the sampling inefficiency of conventional experimental designs in the irregular domain, while the sequential sampling of exploration and exploitation strategies is balanced for the global and local approximation accuracy. Finally, comparison with the traditional sequential approximate optimization method shows that the proposed method can search the optimum in the feasible region more efficiently. Besides, compared to the initial design, the optimized structure improved the connection stiffness by 56.7% and reduced the weight by 8.3%.},

However, owing to the trade-off between smoothness of the robot&#39;s motion and other important aspects of performance, the optimization problem is too nonlinear to be solved in robotic milling processes. In this article, a derivation is shown that the robot&#39;s motion will be approximately smooth when the functional redundancies for each cutter location are smoothing variables. On this basis, a Legendre surrogate model is constructed to plan the overall optimal functional redundancy by remarkably reduced computation. Moreover, a trimmed sequential linear programming method is proposed to improve the solution further. From the outcomes of a 3D S-shaped grooves real milling experiment, the robot motion paths planned by the proposed methods achieve more stable tool-tip milling performance than that of comparable methods, while being several times or even 10 times faster in computational efficiency.},

Modified repair-based CHT is proposed here for a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). This CHT is: (1) adaptive to the share of infeasible solutions in a population; (2) free of problem-specific heuristics that users typically need to provide for repair; and (3) without control parameters. Infeasible solutions with superior decomposition function value are repaired using information contained in the neighbourhoods of the current population. The approach is tested on four multi-objective problems: a common mathematical optimization benchmark problem, two truss optimization problems and a real-world structural design of a tanker ship. A few prominent CHTs and metaheuristic algorithms are used for comparison. With the proposed CHT, MOEA/D shows improved convergence speed and spread of the Pareto front, providing competitive results in comparison to the other algorithms.},

Then, the geometrically nonlinear TO model is approached in a piecewise manner by a linear TO model using the equivalent factor. Accordingly, the sensitivities of geometrically nonlinear TO are transformed into the sensitivities of linear TO to capture the layouts of the geometrically nonlinear TO model. Moreover, computational accuracy is demonstrated. The validity and feasibility of the proposed FECM are verified through five numerical examples, and the results demonstrate that the FECM can provide sufficient accuracy for solving the TO problem of geometrically nonlinear structures with a relatively small computational cost.},

The most synergetic design approach to AM is Topology Optimization (TO), which finds an optimal free-form given mechanical constraints. However, it is hard for TO to integrate these layout geometry-related constraints and it seldom proposes printable shapes. Therefore, this work leverages the Deep Learning (DL) capability to handle spatial correlations within the mechanical design process by integrating the layout and mechanical constraints at the conceptual level. It proposes a DL-layout-driven solution (DL-TO) trained via a triple-discriminator Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The DL-TO&#39;s performance is demonstrated by generating mechanically valid 2D designs conforming with layout constraints in a fraction of a second. DL-TO&#39;s creativity is illustrated by its capability to generate designs with unseen input constraints (passive/active elements) and to propose several shapes for the same input mechanical constraints, a task that is hard for a traditional TO to achieve.},

Response planning for sudden-onset disasters must take into account the inherent uncertainties associated with the catastrophe and potential ensuing disasters.

A two-stage stochastic optimization model is proposed to simulate the scenario of random occurrence and severity of multiple natural hazards to optimize the resource allocation of rescue teams, warehousing items and medical resources when multiple natural hazards occur in combination. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed and compared with a commercial solver (CPLEX) and lower bound at various scales. The results show that PSO performs optimally for large-scale cases. A case study, undertaken in Beijing, demonstrates that this method can improve the estimated casualty rescue success rate to 90.6%.},
