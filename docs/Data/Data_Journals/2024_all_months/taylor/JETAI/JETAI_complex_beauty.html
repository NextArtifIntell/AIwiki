  abstract     = {The conjunctive model of skill map reflects a way to solve the items in a knowledge domain. Currently, a skill map has been transformed into a formal context to construct a knowledge structure. In fact, the conjunctive model of skill map can be regarded as a special case of skill function. In this paper, we consider a way to solve the items in a knowledge domain as a scale. As a result, a skill function can be decomposed into multiple formal contexts, which correspond to a multi-scale context. Based on this, a method for constructing a knowledge structure delineated via competency model by skill function is proposed. In addition, a method for finding minimal skill function is proposed to reduce the complexity. Last but not least, the experimental analysis of five data sets on the UCI Repository shows that the improved method of constructing knowledge structure is effective and feasible and that it is necessary to perform skill reduction on skill function.},

  abstract     = {As a significant part of modern decision science, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) has attracted the interests of more and more researchers. In the process of decision analysis, decision-makers or experts usually give decision information in the forms of preference order, utility values or preference relation. Utility values, i.e. attribute values, generally include real-values, interval-values and linguistic-values. This article studies ternary hybrid decision matrices (THDMs), which contain the above three types of attributes. Firstly, we give a calculation method for attribute weight vectors in THDMs, and transform THDMs into fuzzy preference relations (FPRs). Secondly, we consider additive consistency of induced FPRs and introduce an inconsistency repairing method. Thirdly, we propose an MADM method for THDMs in view of ( T, S )-fuzzy rough sets (FRSs) with FPRs. Finally, we give an example to explain the raised method in detail and conduct comparative analysis to illustrate the rationality and practicability of our raised method.},

The aim of this study was to ascertain the sentiments of endoscopists and understand the benefits and barriers towards adoption of AI systems into healthcare. An anonymous online 18-question survey was disseminated to gastroenterology and surgical departments across UK. A total of 75 endoscopists completed the questionnaire. The majority felt that AI would increase adenoma detection rate (ADR) (72.8%) and aid lesion characterisation (78.6%). However, only a quarter of respondents were either moderately or very familiar with AI, and there was no consensus on necessity of AI in endoscopy. The key barriers identified were cost, accessibility and lack of guidelines. Endoscopists believe AI systems will have a positive impact on endoscopy; however, these systems must provide quality assurance through large clinical trials before adoption.},

COVID-19 is ongoing, with the emergence of many new strains. Deep learning (DL) techniques have proven helpful in efficiently analysing and delineating infectious regions in radiological images. This survey paper draws a taxonomy of deep learning techniques for detecting COVID-19 infection in radiographic imaging modalities Chest X-Ray, and Computer Tomography. DL techniques are broadly categorised into classification, segmentation, and multi-stage approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis at the image and region-level analysis. These techniques are further classified as pre-trained and custom-made Convolutional Neural Network architectures. Furthermore, a discussion is drawn on radiographic datasets, evaluation metrics, and commercial platforms provided for detection. In the end, a brief look is paid to emerging ideas, gaps in existing research, and challenges in developing diagnostic techniques. This survey provides insight into the promising areas of research in DL and is likely to guide the research community on the upcoming development of deep learning techniques for COVID-19. This will pave the way to accelerate the research in designing customised DL-based diagnostic tools for effectively dealing with new variants of COVID-19 and emerging challenges.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ship classification in multi-spectral images (RGB, IR, etc.) is proposed in this paper. Recent developments in deep learning have significantly advanced the field of ship recognition. However, since maritime light intensity is frequently disturbed, multispectral imaging is considered a more robust substitute for RGB imaging. The proposed architectures were fine-tuned after being trained from scratch on the publicly available dataset VAIS (RGB-IR pairs). Unfortunately, the classification results plateaued at 59.74% accuracy, which is unsatisfactory for most real-life applications. Such an accuracy wall was due to the small number of training images. In order to overcome the scarcity of IR ship images, we proposed a novel image data augmentation strategy that translates RGB images to IR. A Pix2Pix model and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) network were modified to carry out the generation process as an RGB to IR translator. The KAIST general-purpose RGB-IR image pairs dataset was used to train our RGB-to-IR image translator, whereas the VAIS dataset was held aside for validation purposes. Our proposed network improved the accuracy of the native network by 8% (from 59.74% to 67.74%), which is fairly satisfactory in the field of ship recognition.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is extremely contagious with a very high mortality rate. Effective and early diagnosis of COVID-19 is therefore crucial when treating patients and limiting its spread. The currently available methods for reliably identifying COVID are time-consuming. Infected people display various symptoms, some of which can be manifested by radiographic imaging such as chest X-rays and CT scans. Recently, many advanced machine learning and deep learning models have been proposed for predicting COVID using chest X-rays and CT scans that have paved the way for computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis (CACD) systems. Unfortunately, most of these studies employ specific model(s) using a specific dataset making comparison difficult and inconclusive. We still lack a clear picture on which technique is best for a reliable CACD system. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis to determine if a CACD system can be developed that can reliably and automatically predict COVID-19 with zero human intervention using currently available tools and techniques? For this purpose, we explore and implement five machine learning models (SVM, LR, RF, KNN and ANN) and three pre-trained deep learning classifiers (VGG-16, Xception and ResNet-50) to compare their performance using 17 benchmark chest X-rays and CT-scans datasets to predict normal and infected samples. Using different classifiers and different datasets, we show that VGG16 with a superior average accuracy (99.10%) is the most suited classifier for CACD when chest X-rays are used. For CT scans, RF can also be used in addition to VGG16 as both records an average accuracy of 93% overall CT scan datasets. Based on the number of experiments, and an average accuracy of 99.10% for the chest X-rays datasets, we conclude that a reliable CACD system is possible.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EV) are moderately defeating more roads and replacing pollutants of classical vehicles. Due to rising EV, it is imperative to provide charging stations. However, unscheduled EVs are left because of the unavailability of adequate energy or charging slots. This paper develops an optimisation aware technique for charge scheduling in EV. The first step is the simulation of EV in the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) model. Here, the discovery of the changing request from EVs and accessible charging stations is performed. Then, the charge scheduling algorithm is called for scheduling the EV, wherein the charge scheduling algorithm is newly modelled using Jaya-based Multi-Verse Optimizer (JMVO). The proposed JMVO is devised by combining Multi-Verse Optimiser (MVO) and Jaya optimisation algorithm. Here, a multiobjective fitness function is newly devised with certain parameters, including charging cost, user preference, remaining power and distance parameter.

In particular, when the influence of delay disappears and the addressed model is autonomous, the adopted assumption in the obtained result is a sharp condition ensuring the global exponential stability of positive equilibrium points.

  abstract     = {Recently, the increasing rapid number of cars on the roads and the great demand for traffic prediction, because of the increase in traffic congestion, has posed a great challenge to governments’ economic development and social stability of most countries in the world. While many challenges are facing governments to solve traffic congestion and reduce car accidents and pollution, the objective of this study is to apply a dynamic approach for the Jordanian community to lessen traffic congestion on the roads in Amman by utilising social media, artificial intelligence efficiency methods, and decision support to lessen traffic issues in the capital city of Jordan. It also aims to communicate directly with social media users to cut down on the time and effort needed to make traffic predictions, which will help to relieve the congestion of areas and roads in Amman. To obtain the research aims, we handled a TRF2021JOR dataset related to traffic records in Amman city, collected from Amman Municipality for several years. Then, we applied the Netnography model, which was built using the data science concepts, to create an efficient model in Amman city for traffic prediction and time series based on selective features of previous congestion in city roads. The experiment results showed the accuracy preference for the proposed method in Amman city. Furthermore, the experiment tested the accuracy of results based on the machine learning methods using the KNIME Analytics Platform tool, one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods used; the experiment results showed that the classifier SVM gives a low accuracy reached (89.9%). However, the accuracy using the decision tree classifier reached (90.59%), while the classifier random forest gives a high accuracy reached (93.16%).},

  abstract     = {Many real world domain problem datasets are class imbalanced where the number of data in a given class is much less than in the other classes. In related literatures, under- and over-sampling techniques are widely used techniques to re-balance the class imbalanced datasets. However, their limitations include the risk of removing representative majority class data samples and the overfitting problem because of generating a large number of synthetic minority class data samples. Therefore, a novel approach, namely Majority Re-sampling visa Sub-class Clustering (MRSC) is introduced. It uses a clustering algorithm to group the majority class data into several clusters, i.e. sub-classes. Then, a new training set containing multiple sub-classes and a minority class is produced, after which the classifier is trained using this new multi-class dataset which has a lower imbalance ratio than the original dataset. The experimental results obtained using 44 two-class imbalanced datasets show that MRSC combined with the k-NN classifiers, including single and ensemble classifiers, significantly outperforms the other classifiers as well as seven state-of-the-art re-sampling approaches. Moreover, for the clustering algorithms based on affinity propagation and k-means, very similar results can be produced, without significant differences in performance, which indicate the stability of MRSC.},

To increase efficiency, there is a need to increase flexibility in these systems. The researchers proposed Various methods such as static and dynamic management of virtual machines and automatic processor frequency change systems to reduce energy consumption.

  abstract     = {Most research on movie recommender systems has been conducted with Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods. The lack of sufficient information about users’ interests in bootstrapping is one of the most critical problems of the CF method. Using a content-based filtering method can mitigate some of these problems. On the other hand, recent research has proven that utilising contextual information about the movie, such as genre, actors, and cast, can increase the efficiency of the recommender system. This paper uses a combined Genetic Algorithm (GA) and content-based filtering to find the best combination of genre, cast, and crew weights. We first convert each movie’s contextual information into a descriptive vector, including cast, crew, and genre. Then, we calculate the distance between each pair of sentence vectors using two separate approaches, fully connected and metadata-based. Finally, with GA, we tune the weight of each of the contextual information of movies to maximise the recommender system’s efficiency. Performance evaluation on the well-known MovieLens dataset shows that GA can improve the Precision@k criterion by producing fewer, more accurate recommendations. Weight adjustment by GA improves the F-Measure metric by approximately 58%. This, in turn, can improve Precision and Recall metrics. Also, the GA offers a higher correct recommendation rate than other methods.},

Moreover, since each feature value ranges differently, such as total liability/equity ratio and earnings per share, the effect of feature normalisation on the imputation results is also examined to see whether normalising the feature values after missing value imputation can improve the prediction model performance. The experimental results show that the deep neural network technique does not necessarily perform better than the traditional machine learning technique for missing value imputation. In particular, the random forest imputation model performs the best, whereas the k-nearest neighbour method is the second best imputation model in terms of the AUC rates and type II errors. The performance in improvement of prediction models after performing feature normalisation is heavily dependent on the chosen classification technique. There is thus no need to consider the normalisation step when the random forest classifier is used. It is found that the deep neural network and support vector machine classifiers can significantly outperform those without feature normalisation.},

Nonetheless, most studies adopted standard machine learning and few incremental learning, which are inadequate for addressing credit card challenges, such as rapid data arrival, unlimited data, data sensitivity, and performance decline over time. For this purpose, we propose a chunk-based incremental feature learning approach that optimises the fraud model topology for each new chunk and keeps track of one chunk each time. The model consists of several connected sub-models, where a new sub-model is optimally created for each new chunk. To avoid the network growing indefinitely, we limit the number of sub-models. To this end, we retain the most relevant sub-models to the current chunk’s data distribution and re-combine them to create the optimal model. We evaluate our approach using two credit card datasets: the first of medium scale contains 2-day payments in 2013, and the second of considerable scale possesses 6-month payments in 2019. We split these datasets into multiple chunks to learn and test incrementally. We compare our approach with static learning methods trained with different scenarios. Moreover, we vary the number of historical sub-models to check their impact on the predictive performance.},

Due to its capacity to emulate human intelligence and its ability to uncover hidden patterns, Artiﬁcial Intelligence has captured the attention of the academic and business sectors, for this reason, several ap- proaches from tourism research take advantage of such techniques. However, to date, there is neither sufficient information about what speciﬁc methods are being employed nor an eval- uation of their usefulness for the task. In this work, we identify the main techniques, as well as the representations, measurements, and results derived from the computational science perspective related to destination image in tourism studies. As a result, two taxonomies emerged: one related to the group of methods and techniques, and the other pertaining to the results obtained through these particular methodological designs. From our analysis, we found that electronic information is gaining strength as a primary information source, how- ever, our results showed that surveys are still on the top. On the other hand, the preferred techniques for information analysis are based on word frequencies but with a growing trend in the use of neural networks and deep learning techniques.},

Defective ceramics lead to loss of income and waste of resources in enterprises. However, it is generally unknown that which factors and production stages cause what kinds of defects. On the other hand, in the literature, the existing modelling studies usually consider the defects seen on industrial ceramics. The defect types of industrial ceramics and those of ceramic tiles are different. This article investigates the reasons behind the defect occurrences on ceramic tiles, along with a comparison between a logistic regression model and a Bayesian network model. The study shows that the Bayesian network model is more successful in estimating the defect types. The constructed Bayesian network model indicates that, in general, the high levels of the production band speed significantly increase the probabilities of all kinds of defects except the deformation defect. Additionally, the high densities of the glaze also increase the occurrence levels of the defects except the deformation defect. Similarly, the high levels of the engobe weight and the engobe density are also among the factors increasing the defect occurrences.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the computation issue of portfolio optimisation with scenario-based mean-Average Value at Risk (AVaR) in credibilistic environment. The portfolio optimisation problem is designed in two cases: risk taker model and risk-averse model. The main idea is to replace the portfolio selection models with linear programming (LP) problems. Since the computing time required for solving LP greatly depends on the dimension and the structure of the problem, the conventional numerical methods are usually less effective in real-time applications. One promising approach to handle online applications is to employ recurrent neural networks based on circuit implementation. Hence, according to the convex optimisation theory and some concepts of ordinary differential equations, a neural network model for solving the LP problems related to portfolio selection problems is presented. The equilibrium point of the proposed model is proved to be equivalent to the optimal solution of the original problem. It is also shown that the proposed neural network model is stable in the sense of Lyapunov and it is globally convergent to an exact optimal solution of the portfolio selection problem with fuzzy returns. Some illustrative examples are provided to show the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed method in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Attributed network embedding (ANE) maps nodes in a network into a low-dimensional space while preserving the intrinsic essence of node attribute and network topology. Incorporating node attribute and network topology with more deeply and more harmoniously is a critical and challenging issue in the ANE, because node attribute and network topology are two kinds of heterogeneous information. Existing approaches fuse two kinds of heterogeneous information at different stages: i.e. before, during or after the learning process. In fact, fusions at different stages have their own advantages and disadvantages. To maximise the profit of utilising the attributed and networked information in ANE, we propose an Attributed Network Embedding model with Dual Fusion strategies (abbr. ANEDF), which consists of both mutually beneficial components: early fusion component for capturing the latent complementarity and late fusion component for extracting the unique and distinctive information from node attribute and network topology. The two components are co-trained during the learning process, which promotes information interaction and captures the consensus of heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments with the tasks of node classification, node clustering, link prediction and visualisation on eight publicly available networks have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that ANEDF obtains the best classification, clustering and link prediction performance on 6–7 of 8 datasets, respectively.},

Nationally representative household budget survey data were gathered from Turkish Statistical Institute for the year 2012. A total of 9987 households responded to the survey. The original dataset was highly unbalanced and a total of 0.14% of households faced catastrophic health expenses. SMOTE was used to perform balanced oversampling, and 10 artificial datasets with sizes from 10% to 100% of the majority group of original training data were generated. To predict OOP catastrophic health expenditures, the SMOTEBoosting was embedded with learning algorithms, such as C5.0, random forest (RF), naïve Bayes, and support vector machine. Study results confirm the outstanding prediction performance of the blended strategy of SMOTEBoosting with RF (area under the curve ˃ 0.85) for prediction. A variable importance plot and decision tree visualise that at least 65 years of age is the most important predictor of the catastrophic cases. The findings of this study highlight that multistrategy ensemble learning techniques are useful to model highly unbalanced datasets.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have become interested in security games in recent decades as a result of its successful application in real-world security issues. The security model is based on the Stackelberg Security Game (SSG), in which defenders (leaders) select a defensive strategy based on the optimal reaction of attackers (followers), who, at equilibrium, select the predicted assaulting strategy as a response. These applications, on the other hand, do not account for the time constraints posed by the game’s players’ journey time. Furthermore, players should be able to cope with dynamic settings in which their knowledge of the environment changes on a regular basis, allowing them to perform more effectively. This research proposes a security model based on a continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach implemented using a temporal difference method that takes prior information into account to address these issues. We use a controlled, ergodic continuous-time Markov game to model the SSG. The game framework model assumes that all information is available. We calculate the number of transitions over a time interval divided by the entire value of the holding time to estimate the transition rates. The arithmetic mean of the observed cost of the individual players is used to estimate the cost for defenders and attackers. An iterated proximal/gradient approach is used to calculate the SSG equilibrium point. We offer a continuous-time random walk method for game implementation. In a numerical case relevant to rain-forest hazards, we analyze the performance of the suggested RL security solution and discuss the problems that should be considered in future.},

  abstract     = {The Wang-Mendel Approach (WMA) focuses on combining the numerical as well as linguistic information for achieving greater explainability for inference models. The standard WMA models the linguistic information using type-1 (T1) fuzzy sets (FSs), which have a reduced capability to model the semantics of linguistic information. Therefore, we propose a novel Enhanced WMA, which models the linguistic information using the type-2 (T2) FSs. Further, our Enhanced T2 FS-based WMA can be modified to reflect the use of interval type-2 (IT2) FSs, for modelling linguistic uncertainty. IT2 FSs are suitable when better uncertainty handling capabilities are required compared to T1 FSs, however, at a computational cost lesser than the T2 FSs. Performance of Enhanced WMA is demonstrated through a real-world crop-yield prediction problem in smart agriculture and an additional exemplar application on users’ satisfaction ratings. Further, we have compared our approach with the performance obtained from the T1 FS-based WMA and the original estimations given in the original data. We found that our Enhanced WMA provides more precise estimates than the other two with 95% confidence level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a T2 FSs method for enhancing the modeling of linguistic uncertainty in the WMA.},

Cascade hyper-chaotic systems have more parameters than the above-mentioned systems, and in most cases, they show more complex behaviour. On the other hand, due to the complexity of these systems and their high parameters, the identification of this kind of systems is difficult. For this reason, a new Adaptive Chaotic Grey Wolf Optimisation algorithm is presented in this article in order to estimate the parameters of these systems. Numerical simulations have been performed on the above-mentioned systems of Lu-Chen, Chen-Lorenz and Lu-Lorenz cascading. The results show that the systems have more complex behaviour than the seed systems and the proposed grey wolf algorithm is also an effective tool for estimating the parameter of the above-mentioned cascade Hyper-Chaotic System.},

There is a different learning method to connect the source language to the target language in which unsupervised learning is a blessing for low-resource languages. The unsupervised machine translation is always problematic to those languages which are morphologically rich and low resources languages. Morphologically rich and low-resource language does not provide good results in machine translation if the translation is from morphologically less complex language to morphologically more complex languages. In this paper, we have improved the unsupervised neural machine translation by tackling the ambiguity problem and the quality of pseudo-parallel sentence pairs generated through back-translation for morphologically rich languages. The ambiguity problem is solved by taking the cross-lingual sense embedding at the source side instead of cross-lingual word embedding. By giving more weight to better pseudo-parallel sentence pairs in the back-translation step, the quality of pseudo-parallel sentences is increased. Different evaluation metrics have been used to check the robustness of the model and compared with different baseline models. The experiment is performed on different morphologically rich languages English-Hindi, English-Tamil, English-Telegu, and one low-resource endangered kangri language.},

This study focuses on the prediction of semantic categories of Arabic hadith texts by combining the Knowledge-Graph (KG) with the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) method. Knowledge-Graph is constructed based on the correlation between features and categories. The links’ weights depend on how frequently the features and the categories occur together, either directly or indirectly. Knowledge-Graph also directly gauges the weights of the links among features. Finally, the ants traverse the graph to select features the most prominent. Features are important whenever they are mentioned frequently in Hadith texts, and they belong to one or fewer categories. It is worth considering that the more relationships between one feature and multiple categories, the less likely it is to be selected. In our analytical experiments, six famous books of the Prophetic Sunnah were used, including more than thirty thousand hadiths with a number of categories slightly under 120. On the experimental side, we found promising results when the ACO-KG model has combined with machine learning classifiers, namely an increase of 3% in the classification task.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and early diagnosis of COVID-19 can reduce the mortality rate caused by the disease across the globe. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) helps radiologists efficiently extract and diagnose the abnormal portions. The healthcare market is currently experiencing rapid development owing to the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper proposes a framework that integrates machine learning and intelligence-based e-Health service systems that can be used as an application of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. This framework consists of a classification approach for diagnosing the abnormalities in lung CT images using a whale optimisation algorithm (WOA) optimised wavelet neural network (WNN). WOA optimises the input features, initial weights, hidden nodes, momentum constant, and learning parameters of a WNN in the proposed system. The proposed approach extracts the Laws 16 Texture Energy Measures (LTEM) from the preprocessed CT lung images and classifies the abnormal regions with the help of a WNN classifier. The proposed framework is evaluated using a publicly available COVID-19 dataset that contains both theCOVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. The result shows that theproposed approach has a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 73.3%, and an accuracy of 84.8%.},

  abstract     = {Neural networks play a central role in the construction of learning models for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This is because neural networks are highly flexible and can approximate a wide variety of maps with high accuracy. The flexibility of neural networks is theoretically guaranteed by using universal approximation theorems. When the input and output spaces have finite dimensions, the universal approximation property of neural networks has been intensively investigated under various conditions of width, depth, and activation functions. However, these finite-dimensional results cannot be directly applied to settings in which an input or output space has infinite dimensions, such as functional data analysis and neural processes. This study provides a universal approximation theorem with neural networks for uniformly continuous maps between function spaces, whose dimensions can be infinite.},

  abstract     = {Propositional model counting is the problem of computing the satisfying assignments count of a given CNF formula. Due to the weak solving ability of the existing exact model counters in large-scale problems, approximate model counting has been proposed as a practical alternative to exact model counting. Most of the best current approaches are based on XOR constraints for approximate model counting, also known as the hashing-based method. In this paper, a new approximate model counter using short XOR constraints is proposed, which integrates bounded solving and controllable randomisation. By constantly adding short XOR constants, the solution space has been reduced to a smaller one. However, a smaller scale of solution space may result in worse result accuracy. Therefore, by limiting the scale of solution space that applies XOR constraints, bounded solving effectively increases the accuracy of a model counter. Controllable randomisation makes use of backbone variables and the constraint level among variables, such that the short XOR constraints can reach the same reduction effect on solution space as the long ones. It improves the quality of XOR constraints as well as the SAT solving efficiency. Experimentally, we demonstrate that in almost every benchmark used in well-known ApproxMC2 and STAC_CNF, our approach outperforms the existing approximate model counters in both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Panic disorder (PD) is considered one of the destructive ailments, with various individuals experiencing a critical functional disorder. As the range of remission for PD is achieved only between 20% and 50% with the help of regular pharmacotherapy, modern solutions are expected to deal with this issue. By taking the advantage of Internet of Things (IoT), a novel IoT-inspired behaviour monitoring framework is proposed for the analysis of panic disorder in a particular context. A quantum probability-inspired quantification measure is calculated to determine the scale of health irregularity. In addition, Temporal Data Mining (TDM) is performed for the formulation of temporal data granules to measure Individual Health Index (IHI) by utilising the Multi-scaled Gated Recurrent Unit ( M -GRU) technique of deep learning. Moreover, a two-phased alert generation approach is proposed for notifying the current health condition of an individual to the concerned caretaker or medical specialist for assistive or medical services. In the comparative analysis, the proposed framework has outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by achieving a considerable classification accuracy of 96.89% for event determination and 94.14% accuracy for health severity determination. Similarly, a considerable improvement with respect to Specificity, Sensitivity, and F-measure has been observed for the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world problems have an uneven distribution of data over different classes. The imbalanced nature of data impacts the performance of classifiers. The higher counts of majority class samples influence the learning abilities of well-known classifiers. Genetic programming (GP) algorithm based on natural evolution also impacts if the data’s nature is imbalanced. The fitness function plays a pivotal role and impacts almost each building block of the GP framework. GP with the standard fitness function produces under-fitted and biased classifiers. Therefore, this paper has proposed a new fitness function in GP to classify the imbalanced data. The proposed method is used to classify nine imbalanced problems: ABL-18, ABL-9-18, BAL, YEAST2, YEAST1, ABL-9, ION, WDBC, and SPECT. The imbalanced factor of benchmark problems varies from 99:1 to 59:41. The proposed method’s performance is compared with K-Nearest-Neighbourhood (KNN) and the standard fitness function-based GP methods. The GP with newly proposed fitness function gives average AUC values for ABL-18(99:1), ABL-9-18(94:6), BAL(92:8), YEAST2(89:11), YEAST1(84:16), ABL-9(83:17), ION(64:36), WDBC(63:37), and SPECT(59:41) as 0.714, 0.812, 0.975, 0.916, 0.768, 0.654, 0.872, 0.939, and 0.704, respectively, which are higher than KNN and the standard fitness function-based GP methods. The result outcomes prove the superiority of the proposed method.},

For this Iowa gambling Task (IGT) has been used as a data collection tool, data of 57 subjects were collected. It is a well-known experience-based task that helps to identify the DM behaviour of participants. An AHP method has been also used to decide the criteria weight to different human factors in the HDM model. Four learning models are developed that are the combination of different utility functions, learning rules, and choice rules. The AHP method decides the preference of various factors incorporated in the developed models. From the results, it is observed that the model based on prospect utility, decay RL, and trial dependency (PU-DRI-TDC Model) performs better when the emotion factor was given the highest preference than others.

Due to the adaption of cloud services, the count of the application running on repositories increases, resulting in overload. However, the application migration in the cloud with optimal resource allocation is still a challenging task. The application migration is employed to reduce the dilemma of resource allocation. Hence, this paper proposes a technique for portability and interoperability-based application migration in the cloud platform. The cloud simulation is done with the Physical Machine (PM), Virtual Machine (VM), and container. The interoperable application migration is provided using the newly devised Lion-based shuffled shepherd (Lion-SS) optimisation algorithm. The Lion-SS algorithm combines the shuffled shepherd optimisation algorithm (SSOA) and the Lion optimisation algorithm (LOA). The new objective function is devised based on predicted load, demand, transmission cost, and resource capacity. Besides, the prediction of the load is performed using Deep long short-term memory (Deep LSTM). The proposed technique obtained the minimal load of 0.007 and resource capacity of 0.342.},

The mobile application was developed for video classification by using MediaPipe Library in the study. While doing this, considering the problems that deaf and hearing loss individuals face in Turkey and abroad modelling and training stages were carried out with the English language option. With the real-time translation feature added to the study individuals were provided with instant communication. In this way, communication problems experienced by hearing-impaired individuals will be greatly reduced. Machine learning and Deep learning concepts were investigated in the study. Model creation and training stages were carried out using VGG16, OpenCV, Pandas, Keras, and Os libraries. Due to the low success rate in the model created using VGG16, the MediaPipe library was used in the formation and training stages of the model. The reason for this is that, thanks to the solutions available in the MediaPipe library, it can normalise the coordinates in 3D by marking the regions to be detected in the human body. Being able to extract the coordinates independently of the background and body type in the videos in the dataset increases the success rate of the model in the formation and training stages. As a result of an experiment, the accuracy rate of the deep learning model is 85% and the application can be easily integrated with different languages. It is concluded that deep learning model is more accure than machine learning one and the communication problem faced by hearing-impaired individuals in many countries can be reduced easily.},

  abstract     = {When a circuit exhibits abnormal behaviour, a diagnosis of the circuit is a set of gates whose failure explains the abnormality. The cardinality of a diagnosis is the number of gates assumed to be failing. A diagnosis is of minimum cardinality if no other diagnosis of the circuit exists that has a smaller cardinality. In general, the number of diagnoses can be exponentially large, and often only a preferred set of minimum-cardinality diagnoses is computed. In propositional satisfiability (SAT) , given a propositional circuit, the task is to check whether all gates of the circuit can be assigned values in a consistent manner. In SAT-based diagnosis approach, the given circuit is injected with additional circuitry modelling the health of gates as well as the cardinality constraint. Under an abnormal observation the SAT solver repeatedly computes consistent assignments to all gates in the augmented circuit where each such assignment corresponds to a minimum-cardinality diagnosis. However, diagnosis of large size circuits as well as diagnostic cases with large minimum cardinalities pose a challenge for SAT solvers. To scale diagnosis to larger and harder cases, we propose a novel encoding that captures the hierarchical structure of the circuit in terms of single-output self-contained sub-circuits called cones . Cones have been exploited in diagnostic reasoning in the past; however, our encoding is the first of its kind in a SAT-based approach. Previously, cones were used to take the abstraction of a circuit and simplify it, while we exploit cones to improve the speed and efficiency of the SAT solver. Experiments on 1800 diagnostic cases of ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits show that the new encoding allows faster and more scalable diagnosis solving 1700 cases which is 163 more than the number of cases solved by the baseline approach.},

When the reactive power optimisation problem is solved by Harris Hawk optimisation (HHO) algorithm, there are slow convergence and falling into local optima. This is caused by the multiple random parameters in HHO’s exploration phase. To solve this problem, the Improved Logistic Chaotic mapping, Sine and Cosine Algorithm (SCA), the dynamic adaptive inertia weights and greedy strategy are introduced; the aim is to speed up convergence, reduce blind spots and improve the search capability. The improved algorithm was tested on the classical 23 benchmark functions; Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test and Friedman test were tested, the results show that the improved algorithm can obtain better performance. The improved algorithm is applied to the reactive power optimisation problem in distribution networks with distributed generators (DG). When the reactive power optimisation problem is solved by the improved algorithms HHO, WOA, CSO, CS and PSO, respectively, the improved algorithm can obtain the lowest active power loss. Compared with no optimisation, active power loss is reduced by 33.19%. Finally, the node voltage quality ensures the safe operation of the system.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaption has attracted quite a lot of interest in object detection. It is hoped that domain adaption can mitigate the discrepancy between the source domain with label-rich and the target domain with no label or label-scarce. In this paper, we address the domain transfer issue from three aspects: (1) We design a synthetic image generator with automatically labelled based on 3d scenes. (2) A structured domain adaptation framework was designed and two domain adapters on global-local levels, respectively, were constructed to mitigate the cross-domain gap. (3) By the virtue of synthetic data, different strategies are adopted to deal with sample transferability in the global and local levels, respectively, to eliminate the performance bottleneck. Recently, adversarial-based methods were used to make alignment with distributions for source and target objects that have been proven effective when adapting object classifiers. We reinforce the two domain adapters to learn a domain classifier with synthetic data and a consistency regularisation is applied to boost the performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed model achieves large performance margins, which show significant advances over the other state-of-the-art models, performing a promotion of 10% −15% mAP on various domain adaptation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The rapid globalisation in language technology and the Internet’s fast expansion have brought nations and their cultures close together, and the demand for inter-language interactions has risen enormously. However, in many low-resource languages (LRL) pairings and areas, Machine Translation (MT) is still not viable because of a lack of parallel data. The challenge of MT is still unsolved. Recent studies employing monolingual datasets have shown excellent outcomes in Phrase-based Statistical MT (PBSMT) and Neural MT (NMT) systems. However, earlier researchers have demonstrated that unsupervised Statistical MT surpasses unsupervised NMT, especially for different language pairings. The study unveils the compendium of ten unsupervised SMT systems translation tasks utilizing a monolingual dataset from the Dravidian and Indo-Aryan language families; and a low-resource endangered language. The machine-translated experimental outcomes examined the system using different tokenizers and investigated them for various language pairs using different evaluation metrics for various iterations. The statistical significance of test results has been computed for each evaluation metric to check the true system quality of the translation tasks.},

The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is then used to detect cache pollution attacks (also known as content poisoning attacks), which include interest flooding for existing data, interest flooding for non-existing data, hijacking incoming interest packets, and signing data with the incorrect key. Similar to the first phase, the second phase involves extracting the aforementioned attributes and feeding them into a fuzzy decision tree (FDT) in order to identify an interest flooding attack. For accurate attack detection, this paper aims to optimise both DCNN and FDT classifiers. This work provided a fresh Decision Oriented Rider Optimisation Algorithm (DO-ROA), an enhancement of the traditional ROA, to address the optimisation problem. With regard to specific Type I and Type II performance measures, the suggested DO-ROA algorithm’s performance is compared to that of other traditional models, demonstrating the superiority of the presented work.},

This study proposes a new mask based on Atangana-Beleanu fractional operator. This operator has the same complexity as the state-of-the-art integer-order derivative mask known as the Canny edge detector but has the added advantage to characterise more efficiently nonlocal and nonsingular edge maps. Performance evaluation of the proposed mask reveals an enhanced performance in the context of robustness to noise and quality edge extraction, a significant contribution to literature. The metric for the study is the signal-to-noise ratio, and the structural similarity index and appropriate mask observed is a mask of dimension greater than five.},

The main intention of this paper is to effectively develop a deep structured architecture for the detection of plant leaf diseases by introducing intelligent techniques, which have several processing steps. As a major contribution, Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) is adopted for the abnormality segmentation. Moreover, the Improved Deep Neural Network (I-DNN) has achieved the greatest strength in enhancing the performance of plant leaf disease recognition. Here, Newly Updated Moth-Flame Optimization (NU-MFO) is utilised for enhancing the classification efficiency through a valuable objective function. The recommended method achieves higher accuracy rate in the recognition of diseases when compared to the baseline approaches. The precision of the NU-MFO-I-DNN at 85% learning rate is 0.01%, 0.26%, 0.07%, and 0.28% higher than MFO-I-DNN, GWO-I-DNN, SSO-I-DNN, and PSO-I-DNN, respectively.},

TSCOPF is a nonlinear optimisation problem, making its solution difficult, especially for small power systems. This paper presents a new optimisation method that incorporates Fitness-Distance Balance (FDB) with the Artificial Ecosystem Optimisation (AEO) algorithm to improve the solution quality in multi-dimensional and nonlinear optimisation problems. The proposed method, named the Fitness-Distance Balance Artificial Ecosystem Optimisation (FDBAEO), also has the capacity to solve the TSCOPF problem efficiently. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, it was tested on IEEE CEC benchmarks and on an IEEE 30-bus test system for the TSCOPF problem. Simulation results were compared with the basic AEO algorithm and other current meta-heuristic methods reported in the literature. The results showed that the proposed method was more effective in converging at the global optimum point in solving the TSCOPF problem compared to the other algorithms. This situation indicates that the design changes made in the decomposition phase of the AEO were more suitable for simulating the operation of the algorithm in the real world. The FDBAEO has exhibited a promising performance in solving both single-objective optimisation and constrained real-world engineering design problems.},

However, because of its high-speed mobility, wireless connectivity, and extensive node coverage, security is a more difficult procedure. The Sybil security threat on VANET is a growing problem today. The Road Side Unit (RSU) failed to synchronise its clock with the legal vehicle, then unplanned vehicles are predicted, thereby incorrect messages are transferred to them. In this paper, Competitive Dolphin Echolocation Optimisation (CDEO)-based Deep Residual Network is proposed for Sybil attack and RSU misbehaviour detection. Here, the effective routing process is performed using Fractional Glow-Worm Swarm Optimisation (FGWSO)-based traffic-aware routing protocol. In the base station, the Sybil attack detection is done. The Sybil attack detection process is done using a Deep residual network, which is trained by the proposed CDEO algorithm. The CDEO algorithm is devised by incorporating Dolphin Echolocation Optimisation (DEO) technique and Competitive Swarm Optimiser (CSO). Additionally, using the Deep residual network, the RSU misbehaviour detection is done. The performance of the developed method is compared with certain performance metrics, like precision, F1-measure, and recall of 0.9197, 0.9121, and 0.9046.},

Studies have shown that in a multi-modal environment (images + attribute labels), embedding items into specific attribute spaces can support more fine-grained similarity measures, which is especially suitable for fashion retrieval tasks. In this paper, we propose an attention-based attribute-guided similarity learning network (AttnFashion) for fashion image retrieval. The core of this network is an attribute-guided spatial attention module and an attribute-guided channel attention module, which correspond to the mapping between attributes and image regions, and the mapping between attributes and high-level image semantics, respectively. To make these two modules interact deeply, we design a parallel structure that allows them to share attribute embeddings and guide each other to extract specific features, which also helps to reduce the network parameters of the attention modules. An adaptive feature fusion strategy is proposed to synthesise the features extracted by the two modules. Extensive experiments show that the proposed AttnFashion performs better than current competitive networks in the field of fine-grained attribute-based fashion retrieval.},

First, the data grouping strategy based on integrated learning alleviates the extreme data imbalance and avoids the negative impact on imbalanced learning. Meanwhile, to avoid the possible negative impact brought by unbalanced data on the learning procedures of convolutional neural networks, the strategy of assigning weight to the loss function is adopted. Besides, a method for determining the weight value is designed to make the model supervise the learning of attack samples during the training process. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset show that the method in this paper can effectively improve the detection of attack classes, and the overall detection accuracy reaches 81.48%. ID-UL has the same significant effect on other imbalanced datasets.},

Event selection is also influenced by the context of the situation faced by the characters. Each event is associated with a description in grammatically-correct natural language that can be narrated orally via text-to-speech. We describe the evolution of fAIble, its architecture and the results of our independent evaluation of each of the four progressively developed fAIble prototypes (fAIble 0, I, II and III), as tested with human test subjects. On a continuous scale where 0 means unacceptable, 1 means acceptable and 2 means optimal, the composite human test subject rating average from the independent tests of the prototypes was 0.933. The paper also describes a summative assessment where test subjects were asked to review stories from all four prototypes and rank them comparatively. These comparative results indicate an improvement from the original (fAIble 0) to the last one (fAIble III).},

  abstract     = {In this COVID-19 pandemic era, where people are losing their lives, there are several species and plants available on our Mother Earth that are beneficial to boosting the human immune system and sustaining their life. These plant leaves and trunks can also be used to effectively treat a variety of diseases in humans. The images of plants, as well as the identification of the leaf through artificial intelligence, are critical for obtaining such benefits. The proposed system automatically grades the various species and classify images of plant leaves into different families. The leaf image parameter is used to extract these properties such as colour, texture, shape, and so on. The proposed system makes use of colour and texture to form characteristics. The colour pattern for the texture uses GLCM and Shape extraction forms to extract colour information such as HSV (hue, saturation, value). The ANN (artificial neural network) algorithm is used to classify leaf images. Colour extraction, texture, and shape features, both alone and in combination, are used for classification. Using combined features yields better results than using single features. In the proposed system data set, 285 images are captured, 210 images with ANN are trained, and 75 images are used for the test set. With ANN, the system achieves an approximate 93.33% accuracy. The results were also validated with SVM (support vector machine), which provides an approximate 48% accuracy, indicating that ANN outperforms SVM.},

  abstract     = {A computed tomography (CT) scan is an important radiological imaging method in diagnosing pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. Within the scope of the study, three classes of automatic classification – COVID-19 pneumonia, healthy, and other pneumonia – were carried out. Using deep learning as a classifier, a total of 6,377 CT images were used, including 3,364 COVID-19 pneumonia, 1,766 healthy, and 1,247 other pneumonia images. A total of seven architectures, including the most recent convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, MobileNetV2, ResNet-101, Xception, Inceptionv3, GoogLeNet, EfficientNetB0, and DenseNet201, were used in the study. The classification results were obtained using the CT images, and they were calculated using the feature images obtained by applying local binary patterns on the CT images. The results were then combined with the help of a pipeline algorithm. The results revealed that the best overall accuracy result obtained by using CNN architectures could be improved by 4.87% with a two-step pipeline algorithm. In addition, significant improvements were achieved in all other measurement parameters within the scope of the study. At the end of the study, the highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) values obtained for the COVID-19 pneumonia class were 0.9004, 0.8901, 0.8956, 0.9010, and 0.9600, respectively. The highest overall accuracy value was 0.8332. The most important output of the work carried out is the demonstration that the results obtained with the most successful CNN architectures used in previous studies can be significantly improved thanks to pipeline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The Ant Lion Optimiser (ALO) algorithm is one of the recent nature-inspired algorithms developed by Mirjalili in 2015. This article presents a comprehensive survey on the ALO algorithm that mimics the hunting mechanism of antlions in nature, besides the overview of ALO applications to solve optimisation problems in different fields. The ALO algorithm is simple to use, flexible and scalable and has an adequate balance of exploration and exploitation, making it suitable to find best solution and attaining good convergence. Therefore, the ALO algorithm has gained significant interest among researchers across various domains in a short span. Thus, an updated review of research of the ALO algorithm has been recapitulated involving recent variants, modification and hybridisation that further improved ALO algorithm performance. Initially, introduction of the ALO algorithm is presented covering inspiration and mathematical formulations based on the conceptual framework of antlion behaviour. Furthermore, the optimisation procedure is discussed including the use of all operators involved in five main steps of the algorithm. Finally, various application domains are examined for the ALO algorithm and statistical analysis is performed using Friedman and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Based on the analysis and investigations performed on this algorithm, it has not only realised a great success in solving numerical optimisation problems but also been implemented in various application areas such as global optimisation, renewable energy, feature selection, power load balancing and image segmentation. Finally, this article ends with conclusion summary and providing several future directions and applications of the ALO algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Document clustering and topic modelling methods are useful in determining groups of semantically similar documents. In literature, various studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of lexical and semantic features on a clustering task. However, the focus of such studies was on the English language which is considered a high resource language. This paper analyses the effect of various feature extraction techniques combined with clustering and topic modelling algorithms on grouping news headlines written in Urdu, a low-resource language. Various features were first extracted using different approaches such as term-frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), word embeddings learned using Word2vec and fastText models, deep contextualised word embeddings from BERT, and document embeddings extracted from the Doc2Vec model. Three different clustering algorithms: K-Means, Affinity Propagation and Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) were then used to produce clusters for a given set of news headlines. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model was also assessed for comparison with clustering algorithms. The evaluation based on extrinsic measures revealed that higher-quality clusters were produced when the K-Means algorithm was applied on a frequent unigrams-based TF-IDF feature matrix. In addition, several word embedding models have been trained on the domain of Urdu News headlines using state-of-the-art techniques such as Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, and fastText.},

  abstract     = {Energy generation and pollutant emissions are two faces of the same coin, as the current energy sources i.e., fossil energy, are still considered to be major sources of greenhouse gases (GHG). Therefore, shifting to cleaner energy sources imposes itself as an inevitable solution to reduce this environmental cost. In this paper, a hybrid system based on the multi-agent approach and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast the energy production and its carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and simulate the potential emission reduction in case of switching to renewable energy sources is presented. The proposed system’s architecture consists of combining LSTM models with the agent-based technology, where multiple LSTM forecasting models were trained to forecast the production of each type of the studied energies and then estimate the equivalent emitted CO 2 and calculate the influence of the renewable energy inputs on the carbon emissions and the fossil fuels consumption. The simulation process consists of two phases: firstly, each forecasting agent uses a specific LSTM model to forecast short-term energy production. Secondly, these agents send the forecasted values to the coordination agent who is responsible for calculating the total CO 2 emissions and the benefits of the renewable energy inputs.},

Proper identification and separation of different languages text, topic-based classification of text and classification of active users based on their published comments and posts are major challenges. In this research, our primary focus is to deal with English text collected through different IoT applications to analyse posts/comments to categorise people’s opinion in politics. We have developed an IoT framework model for collecting data from social media especially Facebook, preprocessed and clean data to be used for analysis, and separation of data based on different languages.

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, Evolutionary Gravitational Neocognitron Neural-Network-based Block chain Technology is proposed for a Secured Dynamic Optimal Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (BT-SDOR-WSN-EGNNN). The purpose of block chain (BC) technology is to distribute the distributed routing information management depending on secure BC token transactions. The Proof-of-Authority (PoA)-based consensus process is selected for effectual transaction in BC wireless sensor networks. The Evolutionary Gravitational Neocognitron Neural Network (EGNNN) is considered to select salient nodes denote the features of node-based validators. The Evolutionary Gravitational Neocognitron Neural Network model enhances the collection of validators by the attributes corresponding to every node. Then, Trust-Based Secure Intelligent Opportunistic Routing Protocol (TBSIOP) is employed to assist routing nodes and makes more informed routing decisions and choose the dependable routing links. The proposed approach is simulated in Network Simulator (NS-2) tool. The performance metrics, such as average latency, average energy consumption, and throughput of blockchain token transactions, is examined. From the simulation, the proposed BT-SDOR-WSN-EGNNN method attains 76.26%, 65.57%, 48.99%, 42.9% lesser delay during 25% malicious routing environment, 73.06%, 63.82%, 59.25%, 38.84% lesser delay during 50% malicious routing environment analysed to the existing BT-SDOR-WSN-DCNN, BT-SDOR-WSN-MDP, BT-SDOR-WSN-RL and BT-SDOR-WSN-WL-DCNN methods.},

  abstract     = {Real world problems in various domains demonstrate different characteristics of changes over time. This is why several researchers have been interested in dynamic optimisation for the last two decades. Since changes occur over time in a dynamic optimisation problem, the goal of a related algorithm becomes tracking the changing optima over time. Evolutionary algorithms and various swarm intelligence techniques have been adapted in the literature to solve dynamic optimisation problems. The Fireworks Algorithm (FWA) is a recently proposed swarm intelligence algorithm for global optimisation of complex static functions that simulates the explosion process of fireworks. Although a set of improvements over the conventional FWA are presented in the literature for the static optimisation problems, the most evident extension is the Enhanced Fireworks Algorithm (EFWA). In this paper, cost effective extensions of the EFWA are proposed for solving dynamic optimisation problems in continuous space. The performance evaluation of our EFWA-based algorithms is validated with the Moving Peaks Benchmark. Empirical studies on different benchmark instances clearly show the applicability of our extensions. Our EFWA-based extensions outperform the related work in terms of both quality of solution and computational cost for a large set of test instances of the benchmark.},

The method applied for the study is a revised procedure of Blind Source component separation utilising a solo sensor method. With this technique, doctors are not compelled to prevent patients from articulating their pain or discomfort while diagnosing heart sounds. Doctors can offer a consoling word to patients while the auscultation is in progress without worrying about how the speech sounds affect the diagnosis. For babies, timely detection of heart-related issues can be life-saving. With Dhoulath’s method, the distressing sounds of a baby’s cries can be effectively separated, thereby offering doctors clear audio of heartbeats. The study was conducted to ascertain if heartbeats can be segregated from the signals of speech or cries. This segregation procedure has succeeded in arriving at an enhanced level of clarity.},

High-redshift radio galaxies are powerful radio sources that are the ideal targets to discuss the evolution of Hi; thus, they are one of the key points to understand the universe evolution and formation. The cloud computing systems are applicable with IoT considering the processing time over training data using ANN. Machine learning is a subfield of AI and it is used by scientists for prediction or classification purposes considering the input data. Machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers and are now used for a wide range of astrophysical calculations and fields. This paper proposes five types of machine learning algorithms, namely back-propagation neural networks (BPNN), decision tree algorithm (DT), gradient boosting classifier algorithm (GBA), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM). The machine learning models are implemented to classify and compare the results of high-redshift radio galaxies by their location in the sky in ELAIS-N1, ELAIS-N2, the Lockman hole, VIMOS fields, in order to increase the performance efficiency, accuracy and improve our confidence considering the critical nature of the calculations in redshift galaxies. When 100 instances were considered, back-propagation neural networks achieved an accuracy rate of 70%; however, when 200 instances were considered, radial basis function neural networks achieved an accuracy rate of 88.2%.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence is quickly emerging as a technological solution for the agriculture industry to surmount its classical challenges. Artificial Intelligence is facilitating farmers to refine their products and alleviate unfavourable impacts due to the environment. The central concern of this paper is predictive analytics to develop a machine learning model to identify and predict crop yield based on multiple environmental factors. In this paper, a hybrid learner ‘RaNN’ is proposed that combines the feature sampling and majority voting technique of Random Forest in-combination with the multilayer Feedforward Neural Network to predict the crop yield. Research has also ascertained the essential features responsible for accurate yield prediction. The proposed model works for rice yield prediction, one of the chief grains of India. The region chosen for the work is Punjab, which is among the largest producer states of India for rice. The dataset consists of 15 attributes comprising the weather and agriculture data collected from the Indian Meteorological Department Pune, and Punjab Environment Information System (ENVIS) Center, Government of India. The study has also made a comparative assessment of ‘RaNN’ with machine learning methods like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, Ensemble Learner, and Artificial Neural Network. Our model RaNN has listed a better prediction accuracy with minimal error among the other techniques providing a 98% correlation between the actual and the predicted yield.

  abstract     = {The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had social and clinical effects over the healthcare system. Globally, over 314.019.135 confirmed cases and 5.507.370 deaths have been recorded at 12 January 2022, based on the Dashboard updated by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The continuous rise in the number of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic patients has developed efficient and accessible models for prediction using Open Source Libraries and Cloud Services. This paper proposes different machine-learning algorithms to analyse the COVID-19 OpenData Resources from Mexico and Brazil, which represent the two major populations, economics and affected by disease countries in Latin America. This model uses only the COVID-19 patient’s geographical, social conditions, economics conditions, clinical risk factors, symptom reports, and demographic data to predict recovery and death. The model of Mexico has an accuracy of 93% and the perceived mean of recall and the precision (F1 Score) of 0.79 on the dataset used. On the other hand, the model of Brazil has an accuracy of 69% and F1 score of 0.75 on the dataset studied. The result considers data from patients under the age of 0 and 120 years. The contribution of the work is the application of Big Data technologies and Machine Learning algorithms using Open Resource Libraries and Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the vision to improve the clinical diagnosis, even infectious disease with mathematical approaches.},

Initially, the input Twitter data are pre-processed using tokenisation, stemming, stop word removal and lemmatisation. The text features are extracted from the pre-processed data using Improved Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (ITF-IDF), Unigrams, Bigrams, Enhanced Bag of Words (EBoW) and Advanced Word2vec (Word2 Vector). To minimise the large feature dimensionality, the proposed work uses the Horse Herd Optimisation algorithm (HOA) for the feature selection. Finally, the selected features are subjected to the proposed classifier, in which the fake news from Twitter data is detected and classifies the given input data as real or fake. The proposed DSDC-AE model uses three datasets for the analysis: fake news detection on Twitter EDA, ISOT dataset and FakeNewsNet dataset. The mentioned dataset obtains the accuracy of 99.52%, 99.51% and 99.47%.},

  abstract     = {Speaker recognition is the task of identifying the spokesman automatically using speaker-specific features. It has been a popular and most involved topic in the field of speech technology. This field opens a wide opportunity for research and finds its application in the areas such as forensics, authentication, security, etc. In this work, a modified deep-convolutional neural network structure has been proposed for speaker identification that has improved convolution, activation, and pooling layers along with Adam’s optimiser. The proposed architecture yielded the increase of prediction accuracy and reduction of Loss function when compared to the generic Convolutional Neural Network scheme. The execution of the proposed architecture is validated by various datasets and the outcomes show that the modified CNN performs better than the other state-of-the-art models regarding both accuracy (avg 99%) and loss function (avg 1%). From the analysis, it is found that the Modified-CNN suits the best for real-time speaker identification applications as the efficacy of the model does not degrade due to the effects of noise and interferences that are caused in the recording environment. Relevance of the work: Speaker Recognition is an area of interest in which ML and DL schemes, when combined, have the potential to make history in the areas of Automation and Authentication. Using a modified CNN can enhance the process by ignoring many issues such as false positives, background noise, and so on. This process can be expanded to create a Raga Identification and Therapy mechanism that can be used to treat diseases.},

We consider the relationship between philosophical analysis of wisdom and psychological research into the development of wisdom. We adopt a practical orientation that suggests a conceptual engineering approach is needed, where philosophical work involves refinement of the concept in response to contributions by engineers and behavioural scientists. The former are tasked with encoding as much wise design as possible into machines themselves, as well as providing sandboxes or workspaces to help various stakeholders build practical wisdom in systems that are sufficiently realistic to aid transferring skills learned to real-world use. The latter are needed for the design of exercises and methods of evaluation within these workspaces, as well as ways of empirically assessing the transfer of wisdom from workspace to world. Systematic interaction between these three disciplines (and others) is the best approach to engineering wisdom for the machine age.},

In this paper, we built a new framework that generates a network of models to improve the accuracy. First, our framework built a strategy to increase the number of models to well capture the increased features. We then utilise our recursive Bayesian methods on the selected outputs of trained models, which is to reduce the similarity among these outputs for higher accuracy.

Operation indicators are pivotal parameters used to measure operating status and reflect the quality of molten iron of the BF. In this study, a data-driven method for the prediction of production indicators is proposed by a novel fuzzy neural network of Takagi-Sugeno with bat algorithm (BA-TS-FNN). In practice, a BF usually works under varying operating conditions due to internal or external factors, redundant features with high dimensionally lead to poor computation time and prediction performance. To solve this problem, mutual information is applied to enhance understanding of the data. Considering that the standard TS-FNN cannot commendably cope with rapid convergence, local optimal, and sensitivity to initial weight problems during learning the prediction model, a bat optimisation algorithm is proposed to search global optimal parameters and improve the convergence rate. Finally, the probability density function (PDF) of modelling error is estimated by the kernel density estimation (KDE) as a criterion to measure the performance of the method. Experiments with industrial data from BF have demonstrated that the proposed method produces higher estimating accuracy than other modelling methods.},

It tackles the insufficiencies of possibility intuitionistic fuzzy set and soft set for the entitlement of degree of indeterminacy and multi-argument approximate function, respectively. This kind of function maps the sub-parametric tuples to the power set of universe. It emphasises the partitioning of each attribute into its attribute-valued set that is missing in the existing fuzzy soft set-like structures. These features make it a completely new mathematical tool for solving problems dealing with uncertainties. This makes the decision-making process more flexible and reliable. This research aims to initiate a novel structure that hybridises the possibility neutrosophic set with the hypersoft set for dealing with uncertainties efficiently. Therefore, the possibility neutrosophic hypersoft set is developed by employing theoretic, axiomatic, graphical and algorithmic approaches. After conceptual characterisation of its essential elementary notions, decision-support systems are presented based on AND and OR operations with the proposal of algorithms to assist the decision-making process. Similarity measures between possibility neutrosophic hypersoft sets are elaborated with the support of daily life applications.

This sophisticated paradigm allows for minimal operational costs, significant flexibility, and the use of electronic health records (EHRs). However, for e-health systems, this new paradigm poses concerns regarding data privacy and network security. It’s a challenging problem to exchange EHRs consistently among mobile users while maintaining high-security levels in the mobile cloud. It’s a challenging problem to exchange EHRs consistently among mobile users while maintaining high-security levels in the mobile cloud. Here, this paper intends to introduce a novel blockchain technology for secure health data in the cloud, which aids in ensuring authentication and offers integrity to medical records. Here, blockchain with optimal encryption is deployed via an improved blowfish model that also guarantees authentication features. Further, the optimal key generation is carried out by a new approach termed as Elephant Herding Optimization with Opposition-based Learning (EHO-OBL). Thus, the data integrity is maintained by the developed approach, and at last, the supremacy of the presented approach is proved concerning various measures. Accordingly, the key generation time of the proposed method has attained less value, and it was 51.04%, 91.48%, 92.64%, 91.48%, 89.99%, 91.06% and 91.48% better than traditional Blowfish, Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO), Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) and Whale Optimization (WOA) models, for file size of 10 kb.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning enables a large number of clients (such as edge computing devices) to learn a model jointly without data sharing. However, the high amount of communication of the federated learning aggregation algorithm hinders the realisation of artificial intelligence in the last mile. Although FederatedAveraging (FedAvg) is the leading algorithm, its communication cost is still high. The method of communication delay and gradient sparse can reduce the communication cost, but there is no previous work to analyse the relationship and common effects of these two dimensions. Aiming at the problems that federated learning communication is expensive and it has become a training bottleneck, we improve the FedAvg algorithm and propose an adaptive communication frequency FederatedAveraging algorithm (AFedAvg). The gradient sparse operation in the algorithm reduces the quantity of parameters for a single communication, while the communication delay operation allows training to converge faster and obtain smaller losses. The number of sparse parameters is used to select the communication frequency of next round dynamically. Experimental results prove that, the AFedAvg algorithm is superior to the FedAvg and its variants in terms of communication cost. It achieves 2.4X–23.1X communication compression in different data distributions with minimal communication rounds required by the algorithm to converge.},

  abstract     = {The Pythagorean fuzzy soft set is an instrument to overcome the uncertainty in the data by adding a parametrisation element. Group decision‐making is a continuum in which multiple individuals interact at the same time, resolve problems, appraise the probable existing alternatives, characterised by multiple contradictory criteria, and select an appropriate alternative solution to the problem. In this study, the generalised Pythagorean fuzzy soft set and the group-based generalised Pythagorean fuzzy soft set are defined. A group-based generalised Pythagorean fuzzy soft set is to be used in the evaluation of the object by a group of experts rather than a single expert. According to new definitions, weighted averaging and geometric aggregation operators have been given. To solve the problems in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment, the decision-making process established by considering the new soft sets and the aggregation operators obtained with these sets were presented with an algorithm. A medical example of the choice of the optimal alternative has been designed to indicate the developed decision-making process. Finally, a comparison has been made between the new method and the existing method. It is seen from the results obtained that an expert opinion does not give appropriate results at the desired rate without the generalisation parameter.},

  abstract     = {Morphological generation is a task where given a lemma and a morphosyntactic description of the target form, we are asked to generate the target form. Knowing that the syntactic and semantic relations to other forms are reflected by the word form itself, we show how to exploit these relations between word forms, holistically, that is, as a whole, to derive the target form without even breaking them into morphemes. Experimental results show that by organising the lexica into analogical grids we are able to improve the accuracy of morphological generation by up to 8% in low data scenarios. Our holistic approach always performs better than a morpheme-based baseline. We also enquire possible improvements by using data augmentation for neural approaches, especially in low data scenarios. However, our system seems not to gain any advantage from having more data after some point in time.},
