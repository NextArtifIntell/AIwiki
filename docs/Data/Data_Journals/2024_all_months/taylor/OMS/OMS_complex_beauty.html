  abstract     = {Approximations to noisy data are constructed to obtain unimodality of successively updated data. Precisely, a method is developed that calculates least squares monotonic increasing - decreasing approximations to n data, for successive values of n . Having fixed n , the statement of the increasing-–decreasing constraints in terms of first differences of the data subject to one sign change gives rise to a discrete search calculation, because the position of the sign change is also an unknown of the optimization problem. Although this problem may have many local minima for each value of n , the method is made quite efficient by taking advantage of two properties of the optimization calculation. The first property, for fixed n , provides necessary and sufficient conditions that reduce the optimal selection of the position to solving two sequences of monotonic approximation problems to subranges of data in the least complexity O ( n ) . The sufficiency conditions is a new result. The second property shows that the optimal position increases as n increases. Hence, if this position of a fit to the first n −1 data is available, then in order to calculate the required position of a fit to the first n data there is no need to consider data that are before the current position. A Fortran program has been written and some timings of numerical results are given for up to n = 30,000 data and various levels of noise. They seem to be proportional to n . The method is applied to data of daily Covid-19 deaths of the United Kingdom for a period that exhibits a major outbreak, and obtains insights of the evolution of the process as new data enter the calculation. The results reveal certain features of the calculation that may be helpful to supporting policy making, when used in modelling epidemic processes. Further, a procedure is proposed where our method initializes the nonlinear least squares calculation of Richards epidemiological model, and the numerical results confirm some useful advantages over the plain use of this model. One benefit of our method for unimodal smoothing of successive data and estimation of the associated turning points is that it provides a property that appears in a wide range of processes from biology, economics, finance and social sciences, for instance.},

In this work, we introduce a composite hybrid CG parameter which is a convex combination of two new adaptive hybrid CG parameters. To derive the optimal choice of the combination coefficient in our proposed composite CG parameter, two approaches to calculating it are introduced. One is to minimize the distance between the hybrid CG direction and the self-scaling memoryless BFGS direction and the other is to apply the Dai–Liao conjugacy condition. Further, to make the search direction have better theoretical performance, two effective spectral hybrid CG methods are generated. Our proposed methods ensure the sufficient descent property regardless of the line search. And the global convergence results for general non-convex functions are established under some fundamental assumptions and Wolfe line search. Numerical experiments on solving unconstrained optimization problems illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {The Double Row Layout Problem (DRLP) asks for an arrangement of machines on both sides of a straight line corridor so as to minimize the total cost for transferring materials among machines. The DRLP is NP-Hard and has practical relevance, specially in manufacturing systems design. In this paper, we drastically reduce the time required to solve the problem by constructing a new and effective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of the DRLP. The new model was obtained by reformulating an existing MILP model. This includes tightening some constraints, introducing new variables, implementing constraints to link the new and original variables; and adding valid inequalities and a valid system of equations. To reduce the size of the reformulated model, we eliminate several of the new introduced variables by a substitution using the system of equations. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed model requires considerably smaller computational times compared to the ones in the literature. As a consequence, optimal solutions can now be efficiently found for larger instances of the problem. Previous studies have been able to optimally solve, within reasonable time, instances with size up to 16 machines, while with the new model four instances with 20 machines could be optimally solved.},

Moreover, it is assumed that the costs of reducing edge lengths are not exactly determined, but they are estimated within intervals and their total deviation is limited within a given bound. This problem is called the robust reverse 1-center problem on trees with interval costs. We first reformulate the problem as a Stackelberg game and translate it into a univariate optimization problem. Based on the special properties of the feasible set, we can state the corresponding problem as a parameterized minimum cost flow problem. Then we develop an algorithm that solves the problem in O ( n 2 log ⁡ n ) time due to the convexity of the univariate objective function.

  abstract     = {Using quasi-Newton methods in stochastic optimization is not a trivial task given the difficulty of extracting curvature information from the noisy gradients. Moreover, pre-conditioning noisy gradient observations tend to amplify the noise. We propose a Bayesian approach to obtain a Hessian matrix approximation for stochastic optimization that minimizes the secant equations residue while retaining the extreme eigenvalues between a specified range. Thus, the proposed approach assists stochastic gradient descent to converge to local minima without augmenting gradient noise. We propose maximizing the log posterior using the Newton-CG method. Numerical results on a stochastic quadratic function and an ℓ 2 -regularized logistic regression problem are presented. In all the cases tested, our approach improves the convergence of stochastic gradient descent, compensating for the overhead of solving the log posterior maximization. In particular, pre-conditioning the stochastic gradient with the inverse of our Hessian approximation becomes more advantageous the larger the condition number of the problem is.},

We argue that this assumption is reasonable in practice. These subgradients are computed as the unique solution of an auxiliary parametric affine ODE, analogous to classical forward/tangent sensitivity evaluation methods for smooth dynamic systems. Unlike established subgradient evaluation approaches for nonsmooth dynamic systems, this new method does not require smoothness or transversality assumptions, and is compatible with existing subgradient evaluation methods for closed-form convex functions, as implemented in subgradient evaluation software such as EAGO.jl and MC ++ . Moreover, we show that a subgradient for a lower-bounding problem in global dynamic optimization can be directly evaluated using reverse/adjoint sensitivity analysis, which may reduce the overall computational effort for an overarching global optimization method.

For example, though many authors have studied matrix and free extreme points, it has until now been unknown if these two types of extreme points are actually different. This paper settles that issue. We also present and analyze several algorithms. Namely, we perfect an algorithm for computing an expansion of an element of a free spectrahedron in terms of free extreme points.

By definition, the derivative expresses how the optimal value can worsen when the data are subject to variations. In addition, it also gives a certain sensitivity measure or condition number of an LP problem. If the LP problem is nondegenerate, the derivatives are easy to calculate from the computed primal and dual optimal solutions. For degenerate problems, the computation is more difficult. We propose an upper bound and some kind of characterization, but there are many open problems remaining. We carried out numerical experiments with specific LP problems and with real LP data from Netlib repository. They show that the derivatives give a suitable sensitivity measure of LP problems.

  abstract     = {We consider convex optimization problems with a possibly nonsmooth objective function in the form of a mathematical expectation. The proposed framework (AN-SPS) employs Sample Average Approximations (SAA) to approximate the objective function, which is either unavailable or too costly to compute. The sample size is chosen in an adaptive manner, which eventually pushes the SAA error to zero almost surely (a.s.). The search direction is based on a scaled subgradient and a spectral coefficient, both related to the SAA function. The step size is obtained via a nonmonotone line search over a predefined interval, which yields a theoretically sound and practically efficient algorithm. The method retains feasibility by projecting the resulting points onto a feasible set. The a.s. convergence of AN-SPS method is proved without the assumption of a bounded feasible set or bounded iterates. Preliminary numerical results on Hinge loss problems reveal the advantages of the proposed adaptive scheme. In addition, a study of different nonmonotone line search strategies in combination with different spectral coefficients within AN-SPS framework is also conducted, yielding some hints for future work.},

  abstract     = {We present a sequential hierarchical least-squares programming solver with trust-region and hierarchical step-filter with application to prioritized discrete non-linear optimal control. It is based on a hierarchical step-filter which resolves each priority level of a non-linear hierarchical least-squares programming via a globally convergent sequential quadratic programming step-filter. Leveraging a condition on the trust-region or the filter initialization, our hierarchical step-filter maintains this global convergence property. The hierarchical least-squares programming sub-problems are solved via a sparse reduced Hessian based interior point method. It leverages an efficient implementation of the turnback algorithm for the computation of nullspace bases for banded matrices. We propose a nullspace trust region adaptation method embedded within the sub-problem solver towards a comprehensive hierarchical step-filter. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the hierarchical solver on typical test functions like the Rosenbrock and Himmelblau&#39;s functions, inverse kinematics problems and prioritized discrete non-linear optimal control.},

  abstract     = {Motivated, in particular, by the entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, we consider convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints, where the dual objective has Lipschitz p th order derivatives, and develop two approaches for solving such problems. The first approach is based on the minimization of the norm of the gradient in the dual problem and then the reconstruction of an approximate primal solution. Recently, Grapiglia and Nesterov [ Tensor methods for finding approximate stationary points of convex functions , Optim. Methods Softw. (2020), pp. 1–34] showed lower complexity bounds for the problem of minimizing the gradient norm of the function with Lipschitz p th order derivatives. Still, the question of optimal or near-optimal methods remained open as the algorithms presented in [Grapiglia and Nesterov, Tensor methods for finding approximate stationary points of convex functions , Optim. Methods Softw. (2020), pp. 1–34] achieve suboptimal bounds only. We close this gap by proposing two near-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) methods with complexity bounds O ~ ( ε − 2 ( p + 1 ) / ( 3 p + 1 ) ) and O ~ ( ε − 2 / ( 3 p + 1 ) ) with respect to the initial objective residual and the distance between the starting point and solution, respectively. We then apply these results (having independent interest) to our primal–dual setting. As the second approach, we propose a direct accelerated primal–dual tensor method for convex problems with linear equality constraints, where the dual objective has Lipschitz p th order derivatives. For this algorithm, we prove O ~ ( ε − 1 / ( p + 1 ) ) complexity in terms of the duality gap and the residual in the constraints. We illustrate the practical performance of the proposed algorithms in experiments on logistic regression, entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, and the minimal mutual information problem.},

Nevertheless, under the assumption that both P and D have singularity degree one, we show that a limiting version v a of v is a well-defined monotone decreasing continuous bijective function with domain [ 0 , π / 2 ] and image [ v ( P ) , v ( D ) ] , where v ( P ) and v ( D ) are the optimal values of P and D , respectively. The domain [ 0 , π / 2 ] corresponds to directions of perturbation defined in a certain manner. Thus, v a ‘completely fills’ the nonzero duality gap under a mild regularity condition. Our result is tight in that there exists an instance with singularity degree two for which v a is not continuous.},

They are designed to identify feasible, and hopefully also near-optimal, solutions and have proven to be highly successful in many applications. Based on a primal-dual global optimality condition for non-convex optimization problems, we develop a meta-heuristic extension of the Lagrangian heuristic framework. The optimality condition characterizes (near-)optimal solutions in terms of near-optimality and near-complementarity measures for Lagrangian relaxed solutions. The meta-heuristic extension amounts to constructing a weighted combination of these measures, thus creating a parametric auxiliary objective function, which is a close relative to a Lagrangian function, and embedding a Lagrangian heuristic in a search procedure in the space of the weight parameters. We illustrate and make a first assessment of this meta-heuristic extension by applying it to the generalized assignment and set covering problems. Our computational experience show that the meta-heuristic extension of a standard Lagrangian heuristic can significantly improve upon solution quality.},

Shape-changing norms and dense initializations have been successfully used in the context of traditional quasi-Newton methods, but have yet to be explored in the case of MSS methods.

Our method accelerates both operations using two levels of parallelism. First, we distribute the computations on multiple processes using coarse parallelism. Second, each process uses SIMD/GPU accelerators locally to accelerate the operations using fine-grained parallelism. The KKT system is reduced by eliminating the inequalities and the state variables from the corresponding equations. We demonstrate our method&#39;s capability on the supercomputer Polaris, a testbed for the future exascale Aurora system. Each node is equipped with four GPUs, a setup amenable to our two-level approach.

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose different formulations and gradient-based algorithms for deterministic and stochastic bilevel problems with conflicting objectives in the lower level. Such problems have received little attention in the deterministic case and have never been studied from a stochastic approximation viewpoint despite the recent advances in stochastic methods for single-level, bilevel, and multi-objective optimization. To solve bilevel problems with a multi-objective lower level, different approaches can be considered depending on the interpretation of the lower-level optimality. An optimistic formulation that was previously introduced for the deterministic case consists of minimizing the upper-level function over all non-dominated lower-level solutions. In this paper, we develop new risk-neutral and risk-averse formulations, address their main computational challenges, and develop the corresponding deterministic and stochastic gradient-based algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Under mild assumptions stochastic gradient methods asymptotically achieve an optimal rate of convergence if the arithmetic mean of all iterates is returned as an approximate optimal solution. However, in the absence of stochastic noise, the arithmetic mean of all iterates converges considerably slower to the optimal solution than the iterates themselves. And also in the presence of noise, when a termination of the stochastic gradient method after a finite number of steps is considered, the arithmetic mean is not necessarily the best possible approximation to the unknown optimal solution. This paper aims at identifying optimal strategies in a particularly simple case, the minimization of a strongly convex function with i. i. d. noise terms and termination after a finite number of steps. Explicit formulas for the stochastic error and the optimality error are derived in dependence of certain parameters of the SGD method. The aim was to choose parameters such that both stochastic error and optimality error are reduced compared to arithmetic averaging. This aim could not be achieved; however, by allowing a slight increase of the stochastic error it was possible to select the parameters such that a significant reduction of the optimality error could be achieved. This reduction of the optimality error has a strong effect on the approximate solution generated by the stochastic gradient method in case that only a moderate number of iterations is used or when the initial error is large. The numerical examples confirm the theoretical results and suggest that a generalization to non-quadratic objective functions may be possible.},

In this paper, we consider situations where the oracle&#39;s inexactness can be chosen upon demand, more precision coming at a computational price counterpart. Our main motivations arise from oracles requiring the solving of auxiliary subproblems or the inexact computation of involved quantities, e.g. a mini-batch stochastic gradient as a full-gradient estimate. We propose optimal inexactness schedules according to presumed oracle cost models and patterns of worst-case guarantees, covering among others convergence results of the aforementioned methods under the presence of inexactness. Specifically, we detail how to choose the level of inexactness at each iteration to obtain the best trade-off between convergence and computational investments. Furthermore, we highlight the benefits one can expect by tuning those oracles&#39; accuracy instead of keeping it constant throughout. Finally, we provide extensive numerical experiments that support the practical interest of our approach, both in offline and online settings, applied to the Fast Gradient algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We report experiments of an implementation of a primal–dual interior point algorithm for solving mechanical models of one-sided contact problems with Coulomb friction. The objective is to recover an optimal solution with high accuracy and as quickly as possible. These developments are part of the design of Siconos, an open-source software for modelling and simulating non-smooth dynamical systems. Currently, Siconos uses mainly first-order methods for the numerical solution of these systems. These methods are very robust, but suffer from a linear rate of convergence and are therefore too slow to find accurate solutions in a reasonable time. Our main objective is to apply second-order methods to speed up convergence. In this paper, we focus on solving a relaxed formulation of the initial mechanical model, corresponding to the optimality conditions of a convex quadratic minimization problem with second-order cone constraints. We will present in detail a primal–dual interior point algorithm for solving this type of problem. The main difficulty in implementing this algorithm arises from the fact that at each iteration of the algorithm, a change of variable, called a scaling, has to be performed in order to guarantee the non-singularity of the linear system to be solved, as well as to recover a symmetric system. Although this scaling strategy is very nice from a theoretical point of view, it leads to an enormous deterioration of the conditioning of the linear system when approaching the optimal solution and therefore to all the numerical difficulties that result from it. We will describe in detail the numerical algebra that we have developed in our implementation, in order to overcome these problems of numerical instability. We will also present the solution of the models resulting from the problems of rolling friction, for which the cone of constraints is no longer self-dual like the Lorentz cone.},

We analyse the spectral properties of the Barzilai–Borwein-like steplength when the differentiable part is quadratic, showing that its reciprocal lies in the spectrum of the submatrix of the Hessian that depends on both the nonzero and the nonoptimal zero components of the current iterate, allowing for acceleration effects when the optimal zero components start to be identified. Furthermore, we insert the modified rule into a proximal gradient method with a nonmonotone line search, for which we prove global convergence towards a stationary point. Numerical experiments show the ability of the proposed rule to sweep the spectrum of the reduced Hessian on a series of quadratic ℓ 1 -regularized problems, as well as its effectiveness in recovering the ground truth in a least squares regularized problem arising in image restoration.},

Therefore, we apply an efficient semismooth Newton method to subproblems of the proximal DCA. Numerical experiments on various synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the non-convex penalty MCP in promoting sparsity.

Our iterative approach alternates between steps that use Directional Direct Search (DDS), considering adequate poll directions, and a Spectral Projected Gradient (SPG) method, replacing the real gradient by a simplex gradient, under a DFO approach. In the SPG steps, if the convex feasible set is simple, then a direct projection is computed. If the feasible set is the intersection of finitely many convex simple sets, then Dykstra&#39;s alternating projection method is applied. Convergence properties are established under standard assumptions usually associated to DFO methods.

  abstract     = {Projected-search methods for bound-constrained optimization are based on performing a search along a piecewise-linear continuous path obtained by projecting a search direction onto the feasible region. A potential benefit of a projected-search method is that many changes to the active set can be made at the cost of computing a single search direction. As the objective function is not differentiable along the search path, it is not possible to use a projected-search method with a step that satisfies the Wolfe conditions, which require the directional derivative of the objective function at a point on the path. For this reason, methods based in full or in part on a simple backtracking procedure must be used to give a step that satisfies an ‘Armijo-like’ sufficient decrease condition. As a consequence, conventional projected-search methods are unable to exploit sophisticated safeguarded polynomial interpolation techniques that have been shown to be effective for the unconstrained case. This paper describes a new framework for the development of a general class of projected-search methods for bound-constrained optimization. At each iteration, a descent direction is computed with respect to a certain extended active set. This direction is used to specify a search direction that is used in conjunction with a step length computed by a quasi- Wolfe search. The quasi-Wolfe search is designed specifically for use with a piecewise-linear search path and is similar to a conventional Wolfe line search, except that a step is accepted under a wider range of conditions. These conditions take into consideration steps at which the restriction of the objective function on the search path is not differentiable. Standard existence and convergence results associated with a conventional Wolfe line search are extended to the quasi-Wolfe case. In addition, it is shown that under a standard nondegeneracy assumption, any method within the framework will identify the optimal active set in a finite number of iterations. Computational results are given for a specific projected-search method that uses a limited-memory quasi-Newton approximation of the Hessian. The results show that, in this context, a quasi-Wolfe search is substantially more efficient and reliable than an Armijo-like search based on simple backtracking. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art bound-constrained optimization package are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Majorization–minimization schemes are a broad class of iterative methods targeting general optimization problems, including nonconvex, nonsmooth and stochastic. These algorithms minimize successively a sequence of upper bounds of the objective function so that along the iterations the objective value decreases. We present a stochastic higher-order algorithmic framework for minimizing the average of a very large number of sufficiently smooth functions. Our stochastic framework is based on the notion of stochastic higher-order upper bound approximations of the finite-sum objective function and minibatching. We derive convergence results for nonconvex and convex optimization problems when the higher-order approximation of the objective function yields an error that is p times differentiable and has Lipschitz continuous p derivative. More precisely, for general nonconvex problems we present asymptotic stationary point guarantees and under Kurdyka–Lojasiewicz property we derive local convergence rates ranging from sublinear to linear. For convex problems with uniformly convex objective function, we derive local (super)linear convergence results for our algorithm. Compared to existing stochastic (first-order) methods, our algorithm adapts to the problem&#39;s curvature and allows using any batch size. Preliminary numerical tests support the effectiveness of our algorithmic framework.},

We designed PathWyse with the final user in mind, developing easy-to-use interfaces without compromising performance. We provide computational experiments on three classes of instances of the RCSPP, namely RCSPP on cyclic networks, RCSPP on large acyclic networks, and RCSPP on ad-hoc cyclic networks. We show that PathWyse is packed off-the-shelf with algorithms capable of tackling generic problems, and can exploit dedicated algorithms for specific classes. This paper represents the first step along the journey of devising and implementing a comprehensive open-source library for a large variety of RCSPPs. The current version of the library carries exact algorithms for the RCSPP but new algorithms, both heuristic and exact, will be added thanks to the flexible design.

In this paper, we propose new splitting methods to solve SIVI problems by employing the idea of the classical Douglas-Rachford splitting method (DRSM). In particular, the proposed methods can be regarded as a novel application of the DRSM to SIVI problems by decoupling the linear equality constraint, leading to smaller and easier subproblems. The main computational tasks per iteration are the evaluations of certain resolvent operators, which are much cheaper than those methods without taking advantage of the problem structures. To make the methods more implementable in the general cases where the resolvent operator is evaluated in an iterative scheme, we further propose to solve the subproblems in an approximate manner. Under quite mild conditions, global convergence, sublinear rate of convergence, and linear rate of convergence results are established for both the exact and the inexact methods. Finally, we present preliminary numerical results to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) have many practical applications. Most modelling tools for MILPs fall in two broad categories. Indeed, tools such as algebraic modelling languages allow practitioners to compactly encode models using syntax close to mathematical notation but usually lack support for special structures, while other tools instead provide predefined components that can be easily assembled but modifying or adding new components is difficult. In this work, we present the inner workings of the Graph-Based Optimization Modelling Language (GBOML), an open-source modelling tool implemented in Python combining the strengths of both worlds. GBOML natively supports special structures that can be encoded by a hierarchical hypergraph, offers syntax close to mathematical notation and facilitates the modular construction and reuse of time-indexed models. We detail design choices enabling these features and show that they simplify problem encoding, lead to faster instance generation times and sometimes faster solve times. We benchmark the times taken by GBOML, JuMP, Plasmo, Pyomo and AMPL to generate instances of a structured MILP. We find that GBOML outperforms Plasmo and Pyomo, is tied with JuMP but is slower than AMPL. With parallel model generation, GBOML outperforms JuMP and closes the gap with AMPL. GBOML has the smallest memory footprint.},

We first obtain weak convergence result for the projected reflected gradient method with an inertial extrapolation step for solving variational inequalities under standard assumptions with self-adaptive step sizes.

We explain how these methods can be implemented efficiently and discuss possible improvements.

It is known that robust chance constraints can be conservatively approximated by worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints. It is shown that the proposed worst-case CVaR approximation model can be reformulated as an optimization problem involving biconvex constraints for joint DRCCP. This approximation is essentially exact under certain conditions. We derive a convex relaxation of this approximation model by constructing new decision variables which allows us to eliminate biconvex terms. Specifically, when the constraint function is affine in both the decision variable and the uncertainty, the resulting approximation model is equivalent to a tractable mixed-integer convex reformulation for joint binary DRCCP. Numerical results illustrate the computational effectiveness and superiority of the proposed formulations.},

The advantage of the approach is that it does not require the solution of difference-of-convex programmes, unlike other k -norm based methods available in the literature. In fact, our block coordinate approach requires, at each iteration, the solution of two convex programmes, one of which can be solved in O ( nlog ⁡ n ) time.

Further, we provide conditions for the inexactness in each derivative that is sufficient for each algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy. As a corollary, we propose stochastic tensor methods for convex optimization and obtain sufficient mini-batch sizes for each derivative.},

  abstract     = {Sparse optimization–fitting data with a low-cardinality linear model–is addressed through the minimization of a cardinality-penalized least-squares function, for which dedicated branch-and-bound algorithms clearly outperform generic mixed-integer-programming solvers. Three acceleration techniques are proposed for such algorithms. Convex relaxation problems at each node are addressed with dual approaches, which can early prune suboptimal nodes. Screening methods are implemented, which fix variables to their optimal value during the node evaluation, reducing the subproblem size. Numerical experiments show that the efficiency of such techniques depends on the node cardinality and on the structure of the problem matrix. Last, different exploration strategies are proposed to schedule the nodes. Best-first search is shown to outperform the standard depth-first search used in the related literature. A new strategy is proposed which first explores the nodes with the lowest least-squares value, which is shown to be the best at finding the optimal solution–without proving its optimality. A C++ solver with compiling and usage instructions is made available.},
