  abstract     = {If chafing behaviours on the bottom or rocks are common, interspecific events are rare and usually involve smaller ray-finned fishes rubbing on larger sharks or manta rays. Reports on interspecific chafing between fishes and reptiles are even less common, with just one report of great barracudas ( Sphyraena barracuda ) using swimming hawksbill ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) and green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ) as chafing surfaces in the Southwestern Atlantic. Here, we describe a chafing interaction between a great barracuda and a hawksbill turtle in the Red Sea. Our observation provides evidence that this interaction is probably not localised but may represent a more widespread behavioural pattern than previously thought. This chafing behaviour is suggested to remove external parasites, and our observation documents the behaviour of the scraper and the scraped animal, as well as the reaction of the parasites during the same event, clearly demonstrating that chafing behaviour aims at the removal of parasitic copepods (Caligidae). We also report the evasive behaviour of the copepods during the event, providing novel information on parasite removal in reef fishes.},

  abstract     = {Polysphinctine ichneumonid wasps comprise a group of koinobiont ectoparasitoids, in which all species complete their life cycle by developing the larval stage on an active host spider. Although the larvae of most species are known to manipulate the web-building behavior of the host spider during the pre-pupal stage, there is still a lack of biological understanding and host identity for six out of the 25 genera that form the group, including Aravenator, Chablisea, Dreisbachia, Lamnatibia, Pterinopus , and Ticapimpla . In this study, we offer the first insights into the biology of Ticapimpla wasps. We described the web modifications induced by T. carinata in their host spider Spilasma duodecimguttata , comparing webs built by parasitized and non-parasitized individuals of S. duodecimguttata , collected in a continuous old-growth forest in the Central Amazon. In addition, we provide the placement of Ticapimpla carinata in the molecular phylogeny of the Polysphincta group of genera. We observed a distinct difference between the webs of unparasitized S. duodecimguttata and those of individuals parasitized by T. carinata . Modified webs were characterized by a reduced number of radii and the absence of sticky spirals, resembling patterns seen in other Araneidae species parasitized by polysphinctine wasps. Furthermore, we provide robust support that Ticapimpla carinata forms a monophyletic clade with species of the genus Acrotaphus and discuss host specificity in polysphinctine group.},

  abstract     = {In Mediterranean wetlands, Phragmites australis reed beds are often intensively managed through mowing. These practices may improve wetland heterogeneity with contrasting effects on many reed-bed related birds. Here, we analyzed the habitat selection of a guild of six water-related breeding birds in a patchy managed wetland, where reed-bed mowing was periodically carried out. We reported data about the habitat use and selection of species on five different habitat patches (non-managed mature and managed by mowing reed-beds, rush-beds, open waters, and ecotones), both considering species abundance and biomass. Moreover, we focused on differences between non-managed/mature reed-beds and managed (mowed) ones. As expected, all the species showed a significant difference in frequency of habitat use, both considering abundance and biomass. As expected, rails (Eurasian coot, Moorhen), Mallard and Little grebe selected open waters, Reed warbler selected reed beds and Cetti’s warbler selected ecotones. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) performed on abundance values confirmed the link among habitats and species. However, when performing DCA on biomasses, we showed a shift of the largest species toward mowed reed-beds. The direct comparisons between mature and managed (mowed) reed-beds, using the Abundance/Biomass comparisons, highlighted the difference in abundance and biomass when comparing these habitat patches: in mature reed-beds the biomass curve was located below the abundance one (high frequency in abundance of low biomass birds, as warblers), whilst in mowed reed-beds the biomass curve was located above the abundance one (comparable high frequency of large biomass species, such as ducks, rails and grebe). Although our data suggest reed-bed mowing may disadvantage small passerines, we observed this type of management may favor large body species, providing them a higher availability of shelters and breeding sites.},

  abstract     = {Migration is an integral part of the annual cycle of many bird species that have evolved to take advantage of spatially segregated, seasonally abundant food resources while avoiding harsh winter conditions. Increasing evidence suggests that long-distance migrants are shortening their migration routes and wintering at higher latitudes closer to their breeding grounds. One potential example of this process are the observations of Egyptian vultures during the winter on the island of Crete. In this study we provide an overview of wintering Egyptian vulture occurrences on the island of Crete, seeking to shed additional light on the species’ wintering ecology. To this aim we collated extensive field observations spanning 28 winters from 1995 to 2023 and analysed telemetry data from three tracked vultures. Our results revealed a change in the wintering frequency of Egyptian vultures in the island with an increasing trend since 2015, especially regarding the presence of subadult and adult birds. We found an increased habitat use intensity for open landscapes and agricultural areas compared to other habitat types within Crete, emphasizing the influence of food availability on space utilization. We suggest that the interplay between climate changes, lack of experienced conspecifics and local food availability could have triggered the increasing number of wintering Egyptian vultures in Crete. The implications of this short-stopping behaviour extend to conservation strategies, highlighting the need for the consideration of new wintering sites and the potential threats faced by vultures during this period. We recommend the operation of supplementary feeding stations and actions to reduce the risk of electrocution to be considered as valuable conservation actions in the species’ wintering sites in Crete. Monitoring and further research are recommended to assess the long-term impact and viability of this new migration tactic, providing insights into adaptive responses to environmental change.},

Here, we collected dietary data of François’ langurs ( Trachypithecus francoisi ) to identify the environmental determinants of these langurs’ diets. Our results showed that the diets of François’ langurs were mainly dominated by leaves (69.9% ± 12.9%), followed by fruits (15.3% ± 6.6%), seeds (5.6% ± 4.7%), flowers (4.1% ± 2.8%), stems (1.2% ± 1.3%) and others (3.4% ± 3.2%). The model averaging results suggested that human interference and habitat fragmentation do not significantly affect the langurs’ dietary composition across geographical populations, which could be associated with the extreme habitat fragmentation and the intense anthropogenic disturbance within habitats. In addition, the results showed a significant negative effect of rainfall on the fruit consumption by langurs (β = - 0.45, W ip = 0.48), which may be related to the low fruit production in fragmented limestone forests. In addition, there was no significant geographical difference in the dietary composition of the langurs. Our results reveal the significant effects of habitat fragmentation on the diets of langurs and, as a response, the high flexibility in dietary composition in these langurs, providing insights into their adaptation to the fragmented limestone forest. Habitat fragmentation has significant effects on the diets of François’ langurs, and they show high flexibility in diets as a response.},

  abstract     = {In anurans communities, vocalizations play a fundamental role in social interactions, being the most important behavioral modality of communication. Therefore, the description of acoustic signals is indispensable for understanding aspects of their evolutionary history. The Cycloramphus genus consists of 30 species allocated into five groups, of which only 19 have the vocalization described. Cycloramphus lithomimeticus is a small-sized frog belonging to the C. granulosus group. This poorly known species is associated with rock surfaces near waterfalls in Atlantic montane forests, restricted to the state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Currently, it’s classified as Near Threatened species category of IUCN and many aspects of its natural history remain unknown. Herein, we describe the advertisement call of C. lithomimeticus extending its known geographical distribution and providing additional data on the natural history of the species. We recorded and analyzed 44 calls from 10 males of C. lithomimeticus . The advertisement call of C. lithomimeticus consists of a single pulsed note with 0.3–0.8 sec of duration, emitted sporadically, with an interval between calls of 27.5–226.3 sec, composed by 7–17 pulses emitted at a rate of 18–26/sec, with a peak frequency of 2062.5–3000 Hz. After defining the correspondence between structures for systematic purposes, we made a comparative analysis determined by establishing homology connections with other species of the genus. According to our dominant frequency evolutionary reconstruction, an evolutionary increase in frequency mainly occurred in the C. lithomimeticus species lineage from an ancestral dominant frequency of 1500 Hz of the clade with C. eleutherodactylus species group, C. granulosus species group, and C. fuliginosus species group. This study contributes to our knowledge about the biology of C. lithomimeticus , and our results provide basic data for further acoustic, taxonomic and ecological studies in the genus Cycloramphus .},

Microhabitat selection is pivotal for maximizing fitness, survival and reproduction, but how individuals process and exploit information acquired from the environment to make future microhabitat choice is yet understudied. In this study, we used outdoor mesocosms in which we introduced Strinati’s cave salamanders ( Speleomantes strinatii ), to assess their behavioral patterns of shelter site fidelity. In each mesocosm three microhabitats were available to the salamanders: the leaf litter, a log and a rock. A total of 22 salamanders were tested over an 8-day period, 11 in autumn and 11 in spring. Salamanders shelter site fidelity was driven by both microhabitat humidity and previous experience obtained in the mesocosm. In our experiment, the time spent in the mesocosm was the main factor influencing shelter site fidelity, suggesting that previous experience and familiarity are important in salamanders’ behavioral adaptation. Therefore, cave salamanders are capable of learning from experience when selecting their shelters, a behavior that could also be relevant during migration, colonization of new environments and adaptation to climate change.},

  abstract     = {Studying pigeons during homing has offered an opportunity to investigate visual–functional brain lateralization in the context of free flying and long distance navigation. In the current study we examine at a high scale of spatial resolution the flight paths of pigeons, which vary with respect to monocular and binocular treatment, as they familiarise themselves with landscape and landmark features during repeated flights home from two locations. The analysis of the flight paths of monocularly occluded pigeons revealed that pigeons using the right eye/left hemisphere visual system were more likely to display more tortuous paths over tracts of 500 m along the flight path home compared to both pigeons using the left eye/right hemisphere visual system and control birds. Accompanying this finding was the observation that pigeons using the right eye/left hemisphere system were more likely to perform flight “loops”, suggesting that, without right hemispheric visual processing, pigeons are more motivated to seek out visual input, behaviourally expanding the now monocularly reduced visual field. Taken together, the data are consistent with a more important role of the left eye/right hemisphere system in processing visual features of the landscape, which may contribute to the construction of the familiar landmark-based map used for navigation. More broadly, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the right cerebral hemisphere of the avian brain plays a more important role in memorising and using the relational properties of visual stimuli to guide performance on spatial tasks.},

We highlight significant gaps in our knowledge of reverse mounting, and how they can be addressed. These include a lack of experimental studies on reverse mounting, as well as a complete lack of any studies on the neurobiology or endocrinology of reverse mounting. We also speculate about the potential evolutionary consequences of reverse mounting, in the context of how other previously overlooked non-reproductive sexual behaviours have been found to have significant evolutionary consequences.

We have recorded cases that focus on interactions of dogs with wildlife in and around Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (RTR). Between 2017–2020, we collected data on free-ranging dogs interacting with native wildlife of RTR. We classified the interactions into two categories: resource acquisition and predation. Based on our results we propose that dogs in rural settings around wildlife reserves can cause more resource competition for the existing carnivore scavenging guild resulting in reduced biomass consumption for the native scavengers. When present in large numbers, they can have a negative interaction with native wildlife through predation and harassment. To understand how dogs can pose threats to the native wildlife, there is a need for an extensive study on the ecology of dogs around wildlife reserves, pertaining to their feeding ecology and their raging behaviour.},

Significant differences were observed in morphometric traits and in body mass between sexes and populations, but not in the interaction between these two factors. In general, females were heavier than males, while males had larger head structures, jaws, and hind limbs than females. In addition, differences were recorded in the volume of the abdomen, which was female-biased in the PNCH, and male-biased in Tecocomulco. Between populations, it was recorded that the organisms from the PNCH were heavier and had larger heads than those from Tecocomulco. Thermal traits showed differences among populations, but not between sexes nor in the interaction among these factors. Individuals from the locality with lower temperature and higher precipitation (PNCH) reached higher body temperatures and used warmer microhabitats than those individuals from the locality with higher temperature and lower precipitation (Tecocomulco). Females from both populations showed a greater degree of active thermoregulation compared to males. In addition, in both sexes and populations, average values of behavioral thermoregulation were different from zero. Significant differences were recorded in microhabitat use between populations. In agreement with previous studies of morphology and thermal ecology carried out in this species from this and other localities, and in different years, we suggest that its populations present a wide phenotypic plasticity.},

  abstract     = {We investigated the frequencies of sympatric small mammal species in 12 habitat-types located in the extreme south of the Italian peninsula (Calabria) using trapping techniques. Ten species were detected with Apodemus sylvaticus, the most abundant species. The assemblages of small mammal species recorded in the 12 selected habitat types revealed clear ecological and biogeographical patterns in the extreme southern tip of the Italian peninsula. Ecologically, we observed a clear dissimilarity between a guild of species linked to thermo-xerophilous habitat types and a comparable guild of mesophilous species linked to forest and sciaphilous habitat types. The differences among communities inhabiting in different habitat types also emerged in rarefaction curves, DCA analysis and Whittaker plots. Thus, all these sets of analyses were consistent in their interpretation of the variation of small mammal community structure along the gradient (β-diversity) among habitat types. From a biogeographical point of view, this is an apparent expression of a clear North–South gradient pattern that was already observed at the species level with Calabria being characterized by a strong impoverishment in species’ richness and diversity (“peninsula effect”). However, this rationale has been based so far on indirect data of small mammals preyed upon and recorded in owl’s pellets: the fact that a similar pattern was obtained also using small mammals recorded by traps indicates that the results were robust and generalizable. Ecological factors at the local scale and biogeographical factors at the peninsular scale could explain the community patterns that we observed in the present study.},

  abstract     = {Catch and release has become a very popular fish conservation strategy and fisheries management tool. The physiological and behavioral changes in individuals who experience catch and release may be adaptive. These individuals may exhibit more cautious bait use or hook avoidance behavior when faced with lures again. Here, our study was conducted on crucian carp ( Carassius auratus ) to compare energy metabolism and personality (e.g. activity) before and after angling for three bouts of repeated angling. Our study showed that the standard metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, aerobic scope and factorial aerobic scope were all lower after three bouts of repeated angling, and the metabolic rates were greater before angling than after angling in the first two bouts of angling. In addition, the total magnitude of excess postexercise oxygen consumption after repeated angling also showed a decreasing trend as the number of angled bouts increased. The percentage of time spent moving increased after three bouts of repeated angling, but there were no changes in either individual swimming speed or total distance traveled. Our results suggest that repeated angling causes a high death rate and decreases the aerobic/anaerobic metabolic capacity of crucian carp, which may reduce their metabolic potential for other physiological functions, such as locomotion, growth and digestion. Future studies should continue to focus on the effects of fishing on the physiology, behavior, and population dynamics of fish.},

  abstract     = {Caste plasticity is an essential trait in social insects, and it facilitates the allocation of individuals in different tasks according to population demands in the colony (e.g. workers can become queens upon loss or death of their “original queen”). The process of caste determination can take place in immature stages (preimaginal) or through adult stages (imaginal). Neotropical social wasp tribe Epiponini has both types of caste determination process and is thus a fascinating group to study caste plasticity. We performed queen removal tests in five Epiponini species with preimaginal and imaginal caste determination to better understand caste plasticity and queen selection processes. Queen absence stimulates the establishment of new reproductive females in Chartergellus and Metapolybia (imaginal), while females in Protopolybia (preimaginal) attempt to lay eggs even in the presence of their “original queen”. Contrary to what has been hypothesized, we found that age is not a predictive factor in the female’s potential to become a queen. Caste flexibility seems to be a crucial trait which aids Epiponini tropical colonies to survive, as it allows the colony to replace lost workers and queens promptly until a new generation of wasps can emerge. Epiponini wasps presented caste flexibility since workers of different ages could replace queens in the case of they lost.},

  abstract     = {Homing abilities of lizards after experimental dislocations have been found to be well developed in several species. Following our preliminary findings in Podarcis siculus , the present paper reports a new series of experiments on homing performances and initial orientation behaviour upon release. For this purpose, three series of releases were performed at increasing distances from the home areas in which the lizards were captured (range 85–245 m). In each series, two groups of lizards were released: the route-based visual cues during displacement were denied to one of them (NVIS), but allowed for the other (YVIS). The results of initial orientation showed that both are significantly homeward oriented at all three distances tested. Male and female YVIS and female NVIS are similarly homeward oriented, while the male NVIS are not. All 74 lizards successfully returned to their respective home areas. Eleven lizards homed on the same day they were released, while most of them homed during the 1st day after release ( n = 51) and the rest on the 2nd day ( n = 12). The different transport treatments did not influence homing success at the different distances tested. These results seem to support the use of a geocentric pilotage strategy to re-enter home from the release spot. Alternatively, the possibility that P. siculus use a sun compass and a mosaic map to find their way home is also discussed.},

We analyzed the available scientific literature on the use of telemetry in the study of the movement ecology of freshwater turtles, seeking to assess the most commonly used approaches. To this end, we carried out a systematic review of articles published until December 2022 using the PRISMA protocol. We found 104 articles published between 1980 and 2022, with a clear increase in the number of publications in later years. We found publications in 40 journals with 295 authors, 150 institutions and 261 keywords. Three countries had major contributions, and we found studies with 50 species, the most recurrent being Emydoidea blandingii and Glyptemys insculpta . The most commonly used technique to study turtle movement was radiotelemetry. The use of Minimum Convex Polygon – MCP and Kernel Density Estimation – KDE was present in 56% of the studies in the last 10 years, and the evaluation of the home range of the species was the most recurrent type of study. The studies covered 33 freshwater ecoregions, and although most studies were carried out in anthropized areas, covering only 16.2% of all endangered freshwater turtle species and 11.4% of all threatened by international trade, the conservation approach has been increasingly recurrent. Our results highlight trends and gaps in the study of the ecology of freshwater turtle movements and highlight the importance of telemetry as an essential tool for species conservation. This study reviews 104 articles on telemetry in aquatic turtles, highlighting the predominant use of radiotelemetry. It reveals a focus on anthropized areas and significant gaps, with only 16.2% of endangered species studied. The research underlines the importance of telemetry in turtle ecology conservation. Conservation efforts are growing, despite existing gaps.”},

  abstract     = {Seventeen-year periodical cicadas represent an extreme life history, with individuals spending 17 years as juveniles and less than 45 days as adults. The implications of this life history on investment in immunity are unknown. Using monofilament implants, we examined sex differences in melanization and encapsulation-based immunity in Brood X Magicicada septendecim and M. cassini periodical cicadas. In many insects, females devote more effort to immunity than males which allows females additional time to lay eggs before death. In 17-year cicadas, the functional difference in lifespan between males and females is trivial as compared to their total lifespan. However, we found that in both species, adult females had better immunity (encapsulation response) than males. In both species, male immunity (melanization and encapsulation) declined as they aged, as did female encapsulation. However, female immunity (melanization) either did not decline or improved with age. We conclude that although male immunosenescence resembles that of shorter-lived insects, for females, melanization-based immunity is preserved as they age, potentially due to their unique life history. We also examined whether being housed in mixed-sex versus single-sex enclosures affected immunity but did not find an effect of reproductive opportunity on either melanization or encapsulation in males or females of either species. This is the first study to assay melanization or encapsulation in a cicada, so our results provide a first look at sex- and age-based immunity in this group.},

  abstract     = {In a natural context, many avian species exhibit the ability to assess and balance factors such as food availability, food quality, and energy expenditure when making foraging decisions. However, avian behaviours can also diverge from the predictions, influenced by a range of variables, including social behaviours, predation pressures, and individual personalities. Chilean flamingos, popular social birds native to South America, remain relatively underexplored in terms of their foraging ecology and the interplay between environmental conditions and foraging behaviours, especially within the context of conservation. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive study, collecting monthly physical and biological data from foraging flocks of Chilean flamingos at Lagoa do Peixe National Park, a vital contra-nuptial site located in southern Brazil, spanning from October 2021 to September 2022. We employed Generalized Linear Mixed Models to establish correlations between this dataset and the relative frequency and duration of four identified foraging behaviours: Pecking up, Head-dipping, Feet-trembling, and Dredging. Our findings substantiate that the foraging patterns exhibited by Chilean flamingos in this region are intricately linked to the trade-off between energy expenditure and the rewards obtained, primarily influenced by factors such as lagoon depth and the availability of food resources. Moreover, our results unveil a parabolic pattern in the distances maintained between individual flamingos in the flock, potentially attributed to facilitate foraging dynamics within larger groups, despite the concurrent increase in aggressive interactions. In summary, our study underscores the multifaceted variables that influence the foraging strategies of Chilean flamingos in a significant contra-nuptial area in southern Brazil. It sheds light on the behavioural adaptability of these birds and underscores the potential repercussions of this dynamic on individual and population performance and fitness. • Water depth, food type and food availability are the main variables influencing the foraging behaviors of Chilean flamingo in a natural environment; • There are a trade-off between energetic reward and energetic expenditure while performing different foraging behaviors; • The intra-flock distance also influence the foraging behaviors characteristics, with a balance between intraspecific competition and foraging facilitation;},

With this study, we aim to describe the first documented breeding of Egyptian vulture in Sardinia and to understand which temporal and environmental factors affected its frequentation of a supplementary feeding station. We monitored the nest used during 2019 through direct observations, and the use of the feeding station through camera traps. We fitted a Bayesian Generalised Additive Model to model the effect of the day of the year, the hour of the day, wind direction and wind speed on the presence of Egyptian vulture in a specific hourly time slot at the supplementary feeding station. The chick hatched around 5 July 2019, and it fledged around 21 September. The Egyptian vulture had two peaks of frequentation at the supplementary feeding station: a first one in June, and a second, more important one, between late August and early September. The probability of recording Egyptian vulture peaked between 10:00 and 16:00, and was affected by wind direction, with a slightly higher chance of recording Egyptian vulture when winds came from South-West, West or even North-West, and a lower chance when winds were eastward. This study marks an important step in the conservation of the Egyptian vulture in Italy; it provides an example of spontaneous colonisation, and of the increased attractiveness of the habitat for scavenging birds linked to the actions implemented within a LIFE project. To better target future conservation efforts, it is important to continue with the monitoring and to perform genetic analyses to assess the origin of the individuals.

It is essential to evaluate the population of important wild prey species in Barda, which has conservation implications for mammalian predators and themselves. We assessed the density, biomass, and population structure of wild prey species by surveying road ( n = 10) and trail ( n = 8) transects using the distance sampling framework method. We used male-to-female sex ratios and the percent contribution of each age class to assess population structure. Mean group size (MGS), median group size (Mdgs), and mean crowding (Mc) were calculated to analyze group size. Of the species studied, Indian peafowl had the highest density (51.61 ± 7.08 individuals/km 2 ), followed by wild pig (10.77 ± 4.59), blue bull (3.50 ± 0.51), Indian hare (3.03 ± 0.73), and spotted deer (0.62 ± 0.04). The male-to-adult female sex ratio was biased towards females, except for Indian peafowl. All species had small group sizes except wild pigs. The results of this study can aid in its development as one of the important protected areas in Gujarat for the conservation of mammalian predators, along with framing conservation strategies for Barda WLS.},

  abstract     = {Although fires are common in Mediterranean ecosystems, there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding post-fire shifts in animal diets, especially for carnivores. Red fox Vulpes vulpes is a generalist medium-size carnivore known to have a positive post-fire response, probably due to increased prey availability or facility to hunt. As small mammals are often one of its primary food categories, and early successional visitors of post-fire habitats, we hypothesize a change in red fox diet composition in the warm season after a fire. Hair trapping and scat collection were used to investigate selection of small mammals in a typical Mediterranean region, 3 years after a fire. The diet composition of the fox was compared with that of the fox in the same area in 1992, and with other undisturbed Mediterranean areas. Diet selection was evaluated through the Forage ratio and single resource preference tests. Red fox diet was consistent with other Mediterranean areas, with fruits and seeds, invertebrates, and small mammals being the most consumed categories. However, small mammals were consumed significantly less than in 1992, while fruits and seeds significantly more. Resource selection analysis indicated avoidance for some ground-foraging small mammals, including Crocidura spp. house mouse Mus domesticus and voles, whereas Apodemus spp. were selected. Arboreal-foraging species, e.g. red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris and garden dormouse Eliomys quercinus were used in proportion to their availability. We concluded that this mesocarnivore had high feeding plasticity and exploited various resources according to their availability and catchability. Future studies are needed to further investigate red fox and other carnivores’ food shifts after fire disturbance, including various seasons, other successional stages and competition within predator guilds. Fox mostly consumed fruits post-fire avoidance on 3 ground-foraging species Fox feeding follows both resource availability and catchability},

  abstract     = {Eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls is common in nature, and successful eavesdropping on heterospecific call information can provide benefits to animal survival. Previous studies have shown that free-ranging flocks of domestic chickens can respond to avian heterospecific alarm calls. However, there are limited studies on whether solitary active domestic chickens ( Gallus gallus domesticus ), especially hens with chicks eavesdrop on heterospecific alarm calls to detect different types of predators and adjust their response depending on whether the predators are a threat to themselves or their young. In the present study, we evaluated the behavioral responses of hens with chick activity to two alarm calls (test playback) and territorial calls (control playback) of wild Japanese tits ( Parus minor ). The results showed that hens were more vigilant toward the alarm calls than territorial calls and that anti-predator behavior differed significantly between the two alarm calls as predicted: they engage in self-preservation behaviors when the call informs about aerial predators, and in protective behaviors of their chicks when the calls inform about ground predators. In the later case, the number of chicks also has an impact on the behavior of hens (dilution effect). This suggests that hens can eavesdrop on the alarm call of Japanese tits, identify predator information in the alarm call, and adjust the anti-predation strategy based on the type of alarm and the number of chicks.},

  abstract     = {Kin recognition has been selected by natural selection because it can enhance the chances of cooperation among close relatives, but it could also be an accidental consequence of other life-history processes. In this study, we carried out experiments by using Asiatic toad tadpoles ( Bufo gargarizans ) to evaluate the hypothesis that: (1) individuals can use waterborne chemical cues or combine other possible cues to communicate kinship identity when exposed to kin during early ontogeny; (2) unfamiliar siblings (or familiar non-siblings) should have similar growth with unfamiliar non-siblings because the former is not able to identify their relatives (or may not consider familiar non-siblings as kin); (3) the familiar siblings may obtain a more equal resource share in populations of siblings, thus size variation is weak. The first and second predictions were partially better supported: kinship had a positive effect on tadpole growth, obtained larger mass at metamorphosis, and increased survival, but development time was longer than that of unfamiliar non-siblings. Further, the growth of unfamiliar siblings and familiar non-siblings was different from that of familiar siblings, suggesting that Asiatic toad tadpoles lose kin-recognition ability when isolated across the embryonic stage or may not be considered as siblings when exposed to water from non-sibling groups during early embryonic development. Thus, besides chemical cues, Asiatic toad tadpoles need to combine other possible modalities to communicate kinship identity. The third prediction was supported weakly. Therefore, our results suggest that exposure to kin during early embryonic development is essential for altering kin-recognition ability. More importantly, familiar sibling groups can be expected to develop slower and spend more time in the water, allowing more time for feeding and growth, which is consistent with kin selection theory, suggesting that natural selection should drive the evolution of mechanisms that minimize the competitive intensity between sibling groups.},

  abstract     = {Antipredator behaviors are often crucial for animal survival. In environments impacted by humans, animals may be exposed to a wide array of chemical contaminants due to agriculture, industry, and other activities. Among other effects, these chemical contaminants may influence behaviors prey animals use to cope with predation risk, likely reducing survival by suppressing or even maladaptively reversing normal behavioral responses. Changes in behavioral responses could be the result of impaired detection of cues that indicate predator presence or altered behavioral plasticity in response to predator cues. In a laboratory experiment, we tested the effects of the commonly used herbicide metolachlor on the behavior of tadpoles of the American bullfrog ( Lithobates catesbeianus ) in both the absence and presence of water conditioned with cues (odor) of fish. We observed several behaviors in the tadpoles reflective of predator avoidance when exposed to combinations of metolachlor (0 or 80 ppb) and the presence or absence of fish cues. We found that metolachlor had size-dependent effects on tadpole activity levels, with larger tadpoles being much less active in the absence of metolachlor but similar in activity to small tadpoles when metolachlor was present. Fish cues similarly had size-dependent effects on multiple tadpole behaviors. Finally, hiding behavior and zone change (movement) behavior of tadpoles in response to fish cues varied depending on the presence of metolachlor and, in the case of zone changes, tadpole size. Our findings indicate that the presence of chemical contaminants has the potential to alter important antipredator behaviors. However, these effects are complex, and size may mediate the nature of the response to both chemical contaminants and predators.},

  abstract     = {Social aggregative behaviour may have evolved in marine isopods to aid hunting, and help the animals protect themselves from predation. This social behaviour could have assisted some isopod species to make the evolutionary transition from marine to terrestrial environments, as aggregative huddling of isopods on land reduces desiccation when out of water. To determine if the common pill-bug Armadillidium vulgare demonstrates social behaviour, groups of animals were filmed for 60 min in an arena that contained a binary choice of two shelters. This experiment was directly repeated with the same specimens three more times in the same day and this series of four experimental runs was replicated a total of 10 times with a different group of animals for each of the 10 series. In most cases, the majority of specimens chose one of the two identical shelters at random, and congregated under this winning shelter. The amount of animals that congregated under the winning shelter, however, significantly decreased over the four consecutive runs, whereas the amount of animals that congregated under the losing shelter significantly increased with prior experience. These data indicate that A. vulgare is a social animal but this social behaviour can decrease with exposure to the novel environment. This attenuation in social behaviour may serve to decrease the drive to join the larger of the two groups in an area where a danger from predation has not been encountered and allow experienced animals to explore new terrain.},

  abstract     = {Risk assessment relies on cost–benefit analysis by prey species in relation to predator behavior. The lunar cycle can have strong influences on the way that predator and prey species behave in their environment as light levels can influence activity patterns. By examining how lunar phase influences behavior, we may be able to better predict instances of human–wildlife conflict. As part of the Elephants and Sustainable Agriculture in Kenya project, over 5 years of study have been dedicated to mitigating human–elephant conflict in the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor in southern Kenya, focusing on the construction of deterrent fences and the collection of environmental data in and bordering the Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary. Elephant presence around crop fields was hypothesized to have a negative relationship with lunar light levels because of an increase in perceived risk from typically greater human activity with moonlight, and a positive relationship with increased darkness during the waning moon phases. The lunar phase data were compared to elephant presence within 12 m of experimental crop fields along the boundary of their wild habitat and human agricultural land to provide insight for potential crop raiding events. Elephants were present significantly less during the full and gibbous moon phases when compared to the new moon phase, and significantly more during the new and waning moon phases. Our findings are being shared with the farmers living in the KWC and may be useful to others living in high HEC areas by providing a form of early warning system that also may have broader applications in the mitigation of other human–wildlife interactions.

Size-assortative mating (SAM) was negative at high density, positive at intermediate density, and absent at low density. Only at intermediate density were relatively small potential mates frequently rejected. Females rejected males via resistance to attempts to mount while males rejected females by abandoning them soon after mounting. A laboratory experiment showed that mate rejection is more likely when individuals experience intermediate densities, but not low or high densities, prior to courtship. In the field, rival males displaced mounting males that were small relative to either the female or rival. Rates of rivalry increased with density. At high density, low rates of mate rejection and high rates of rivalry resulted in the formation of displacement-resistant pairs consisting of large males and small females. This left small males to vie for large females and resulted in negative SAM. At intermediate density, low rates of rivalry coupled with rejection of small individuals favored the formation of pairs consisting of similarly sized males and females, causing positive SAM. At low density, low rates of both mate rejection and rivalry resulted in random mating by size and the absence of SAM.},

However, the diet of Penelope jacucaca remains largely unknown, limiting our understanding of its natural history and potential ecosystem services. In this study, we investigated the diet of P. jacucaca in two Caatinga fragments with varying levels of preservation using fecal material analysis. The diet of the species consisted primarily of fruits, flowers, and leaves, comprising a total of 22 food items. The number of seeds found in individual fecal samples exhibited a negative correlation with individual seed masses. The species demonstrated a preference for zoocoric fruits of different sizes from the local vegetation. The diet varied between the sampled areas, suggesting that P. jacucaca exhibits dietary flexibility based on local vegetation. However, it is also possible that fragmentation affects the nutritional value of the species’ diet. Due to its large body size, the White-browed guan can ingest a wide variety of fruits, including larger ones, incorporating seeds that are rarely explored by other birds. We propose that plant species with “large” seeds (&gt; 15 mm), such as Ziziphus joazeiro , Brosimum gaudichaudii , and Ximenia americana , would be mainly negatively affected by the absence of P. jacucaca in the studied areas. The decline in the population of this important seed disperser in the region is likely to have negative implications for the viability of many zoocoric plants, thereby posing a threat to the vegetation of the studied fragments.},

We used Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) to record the acoustic activity in males of the target species in 29 water bodies distributed throughout the Cerrado, the Brazilian savanna. We investigated whether the rate of call emission by P. cuvieri males is influenced by predictor variables based on generalized linear mixed models. The call rate of P. cuvieri males was influenced only by air temperature variation throughout night. We found a peak of acoustic activity in the warmer hours in the beginning of the night followed by a decrease as the air temperature declines throughout the dawn. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find any significant influence of latitude, relative humidity or landscape metrics (number of fragments or percentage of native vegetation cover) on the acoustic activity of P. cuvieri . The impacts of landscape metrics on the acoustic activity of P. cuvieri are not significant, because it is a species with more generalist ecological requirements, which to allow the individuals to move across the landscape to be successful in colonizing water bodies situated in altered environments. Previous studies have suggested that changes in temperature may affect species phenology, since individuals alter their vocal activity, or their time spent in chorus in response to climate change. In this sense, our results are important because they allow us to predict the impact of future climate change on the acoustic activity of the target species, as well as demographic implications.

We documented a breeding pair of wolves in the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem of Minnesota, USA that appeared to periodically use cooperative ambushing to hunt beavers. The breeding pair primarily chose to wait-in-ambush close to one another (&lt; 65 m) but on different beaver feeding trails, which appears advantageous because: (1) feeding trails are where beavers are most active and vulnerable on land, (2) the probability that the pair encounters a beaver is increased, and (3) either wolf can quickly assist the other in killing a beaver. The cooperative ambush strategy these wolves used appears rare for most social Carnivora but we hypothesize this behavior is widespread in areas of wolf-beaver sympatry. This observation demonstrates that novel insights into the natural history of even well-studied predators are possible when technological advancements are combined with intensive fieldwork.},

  abstract     = {An organism’s ability to learn characteristics of its environment in the presence or absence of certain stimuli is a vital aspect of its survival. However, the level at which certain species can learn is thought to vary along the phylogenic tree. We assess free living freshwater flatworms ( Dugesia tigrina ) ability to learn via classical and operant conditioning. Flatworms’ ability to learn via classical and operant conditioning was assessed using an electric shock and red light inside an arena. A stronger curling response after training flatworms to associate a red light with a negative stimulus indicates flatworms possess the ability to learn through classical conditioning. Flatworms also actively avoided red light after it was paired with negative stimulus, indicating the capacity for operant conditioning. Despite a primitive nervous system, wild-caught freshwater flatworms exhibit two fundamental forms of learning which could facilitate adaptive foraging and predator avoidance behaviors. In addition, these results add clarity to the debate surrounding the learning capacity within Platyhelminthes and further our understanding of learning among primitive animals.},

  abstract     = {The grey heron is an extensively studied and widely distributed colonial bird species in the Old World; however, relevant information on the role played by vocalisations during the life cycle of individuals is still lacking. This research aimed to deepen the available knowledge on the repertoire and vocal behaviour of adults during the breeding season, through a bioacoustic approach and choosing as study areas two heronries in different environmental contexts. Colonies were monitored 2 days a week each, for 9 weeks, from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm (360 hr of sampling). Results showed that adults use a wide range of call types, mainly related to courtship and the reproductive phase. Vocalisations are emitted especially by males and are a key element during mate attraction, nest building, in breeding events and in strengthening bonds within pairs. Most vocalisations are expressed in the first weeks of the breeding cycle, concurrently with the maximum number of courtship males, which exhibit most of the detected sound categories and emit calls with lower frequencies than females. Moreover, these vocalisations are expressed to a greater extent in the heronry characterized by an important forest component, where an almost entirely exclusive sound category was detected. In conclusion, the results suggest a possible correlation between vocal behaviour and female choice. The wide variety of sound signals and the high rate of calls produced by males during attraction and courtship displays, together with the acoustic characteristics of the signals, could provide honest estimates of the quality of emitters.},

  abstract     = {Natural history studies are important in helping to understand the origin and evolution of social organization as well as the evolution of specialized morphological structures linked to mating behavior of animals. Here we describe the burrow use pattern, sex ratio, and sexual dimorphism of the burrowing shrimp Lepidophthalmus siriboia to test a series of evolutionary hypotheses. To this end, a total of 259 individuals of L. siriboia were collected from the northeast region of Brazil. No shrimp pairs or burrows inhabited by more than one shrimp were detected during the study period. A solitary habit is a non-random behavior in this species because single shrimps were found with a greater frequency than expected by chance. All ovigerous females were found living solitarily, which suggests that males abandon these females shortly after insemination. Contrary to the expectations of an anisogamous species, L. siriboia produced a female-biased operational sex ratio (OSR), contradicting the hypothesis that only males compete for mates. The latter was supported by the existence of sexual dimorphism in cheliped size, a condition that argues in favor of female–female competition in this species. In the same line of reasoning, heterochely was present in adult males, although it was also present to a lesser degree in adult females. Female asymmetry of chelipeds suggests the evolution of an unconventional role in female major cheliped use. The major cheliped showed a positive allometric growth pattern through the ontogeny of both sexes. However, when growth patterns of the major and minor chelipeds were compared, the fitted regression lines for each sex had different slopes, indicating that the cheliped could be an appendage sexually selected by individuals of the opposite sex during mating.},

  abstract     = {Sounds produced by human activities are often loud and may mask acoustic signals used by other species for communication. To circumvent this, some animals use various strategies, including shifting modality completely or complementing acoustic information by using additional modalities to communicate. Here we used pied tamarins ( Saguinus bicolor ) as models to explore whether shifts in communication modalities occur under increased anthropogenic noise or deploy them complementarily. We predicted that in circumstances where noise could impede acoustic communication the study animals would exhibit more scent-marking behaviour (i.e. olfactory communication) while reducing the emission of long calls (i.e. acoustic communication). We collected information on vocal and scent-marking behaviour in nine groups of wild pied tamarins in urban forests in Manaus, Amazonian Brazil. We found that scent marking occurrence increased with noise amplitude, though long call numbers did not change. Thus, our results do not suggest a complete shift between channels but complementation of information, where scent marking may compensate for the impacts of anthropogenic noise on the acoustic channel. This is an interesting result from a conservation perspective as pied tamarins may be capable of coping with city noise to communicate with conspecifics, a key tenet of species survival.},

We assessed food habits and characteristics of livestock predation in the human-dominated landscape of South Gujarat, India, using scat analysis ( n = 350) and secondary information from forest department reports ( n = 780). Leopards consumed 17 prey species, with pigs contributing the most (44%) to the leopards’ diet, while domestic horses contributed the least (1%). Leopards preyed upon four domestic species: goats (47%), cows (43%), buffaloes (6%), and horses (2%). Young individuals of livestock were most commonly targeted by leopards, and livestock species were predominantly preyed upon during the evening or night time. Livestock were most vulnerable to predation when tied in open areas and least vulnerable while grazing. Our results highlight the significant role of pigs as the main prey and their contribution to mitigating livestock predation. Additionally, improving cattle shed structures and implementing night guarding could help reduce livestock predation.

We used a 9-year time series, based on monthly captures, to test the delayed effects of endogenous (density) and exogenous (rainfall, habitat cover/heterogeneity, fire) factors on the survival and recruitment rates of two small mammals inhabiting the Brazilian Cerrado: the semelparous, scansorial marsupial Gracilinanus agilis and the iteroparous, arboreal rodent Rhipidomys macrurus . As in most short-lived small mammals, we found negative density-dependent effects on the recruitment of both species (3 months delay), which could occur through reduced immigration or fecundity, in addition to the semelparous breeding strategy of G. agilis . Reduced habitat cover following fire events had a negative delayed effect on the survival of G. agilis (3 months after) and R. macrurus (1 year after), albeit it increased the recruitment rates (1-year lagged effect) of R. macrurus . We failed to find any effect of fire on demography of either species. Our results suggest that the irregular and non-cyclical fluctuations in R. macrurus abundance were driven by the interaction between delayed density dependence and changes in habitat quality, while the marked and repeated fluctuations in G. agilis abundance were mainly shaped by the occurrence of semelparity associated with direct density dependence. We emphasize that changes in habitat quality brought by human-made activities may have severe impacts on the dynamics and persistence of forest-dependent small mammals in the Cerrado.},

Similarly, for nearly defenseless bird nestlings, using a hissing call to scare off predators can improve their survival; however, few studies have reported nestlings making hissing calls. In this study, we report on the hissing calls of nestlings of the open-nesting zitting cisticola (Cisticola juncidis) and compare their hissing calls with those of other animals, such as birds and snakes. The results showed that the hissing calls of C. juncidis nestlings closely approximate the sounds of snakes.

In this study, we examined whether the reproductive conditions of post-hibernation solitary queens of the vespine wasp Vespa analis are affected by the following four factors: (1) collection date, (2) mating status, (3) body size and (4) the presence of Xenos parasites. The results showed that ovary development of the queens was associated with collection date and mating status but not with body size or parasitism. The positive effects of the first two factors are reasonable, because they are closely related to life history, but the absence of a link between ovary development of the queens and parasitism was surprising. No association of ovary development of the queens with body size prompts the need for more comparative studies, which might reveal differences in the fecundity-body size relationship among temperate Vespa species.},

We translocated 27 males from their original calling site and chorus to sites located either between two equidistant choruses (original and alternative choruses) or within an alternative chorus. Eighteen translocated males returned to their original calling site and chorus, three males moved or stayed in alternative choruses, and six males were never recaptured. We recorded mating in males that exhibit homing as well in those that moved toward alternative choruses. Given that homing is costly and risky for individuals, and Espadarana prosoblepon males can mate whether they call from their original chorus or from an alternative chorus, our results suggest that homing motivation is in part influenced by benefits associated with a familiar environment.},

Therefore, we investigated (i) which vocalizations are emitted during their breeding season, (ii) the testosterone levels in free-ranging birds, and (iii) the effect of testosterone on these vocalizations in a semi-natural environment in both sexes of the black jacobin ( Florisuga fusca ), an early-branched hummingbird. Females and males of black jacobin produced the same set of vocalizations (high-pitched song and chirp call) at a similar rate during the breeding season, although testosterone levels in males were significantly higher. Testosterone treatment did not affect the vocal activity or acoustic parameters of their song in both sexes. However, testosterone maintained high levels of aggression in treated birds of both sexes and hyper-developed the oviduct of females. In contrast to almost all well-studied bird species studied so far, the vocal behavior of the black jacobins in their breeding season seems to be insensitive to high testosterone levels.},

The European brown hare Lepus europaeus is a game species of European conservation interest, typical of open areas, and with declining populations in Eurasia. In this work, the authors summarised the current knowledge on European brown hare feeding habits and also discussed potential management relapses of this species. The European brown hare has developed a particular digestive process called caecotrophy, which consists of a double passage of food through the alimentary canal. Hares compensate for this disadvantage by selecting foods with a high nutritional value, poor in fibre and rich in fats and proteins. The European brown hare thrives in farmland habitat as crops have a high nutritional value, even if monoculture and reduction of crop variety are considered the main causes of the decline of this species. Even in the agricultural environment, spontaneous weeds are an important part of the European brown hare diet, covering the nutritional needs when cultivated plants have a low nutritional value or have been harvested. The restoration of crop rotation and polycultures (cereals and cover crops), and the establishment of agri-environmental measures such as wildflower strips and patches, represent effective strategies to favour the European brown hare and the biodiversity of farmland habitats.},

However, in most of the cases, the foster parents derive some fitness benefits from a foster child, which seems to be the ultimate causation and hence has evolved in different species across various taxonomic classes. Adoptions are also reported among members of two different species which is an interesting scenario and calls for further research and experimentation in order to determine if any evolutionary fitness benefits accrue due to such behaviour. Similarly, “brood parasitism” a form of “forced foster care” is a live example of biological species at arms race.
