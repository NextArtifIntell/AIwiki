Under suitable assumptions, a novel fixed-time ADD feedback controller is designed to ensure all states in the underlying system are not affected by disturbances. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, it is shown that the corresponding closed-loop system is fixed-time stable which means the upper bound of the settling time depends on the control design parameters only.

The design of the observer and controller is founded on the infinite-dimensional backstepping approach. To implement the continuous-time observer-based controller in an event-triggered framework, we propose a dynamic event triggering condition. This condition specifies the instances when the control input must be updated. Between events, the control input is maintained constant in a Zero-Order-Hold manner . We demonstrate that the dwell-time between successive triggering moments is uniformly bounded from below, thereby precluding Zeno behaviour . The proposed event-triggered boundary control strategy ensures the well-posedness of the closed-loop system and the satisfaction of certain model validity conditions. Additionally, the global exponential convergence of the closed-loop system to the setpoint is established using Lyapunov approach. A simulation example is provided to validate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Real-time numerical differentiation plays a crucial role in many digital control algorithms, such as PID control, which requires numerical differentiation to implement derivative action. This paper proposes an algorithm for estimating the numerical derivative of a signal from noisy sampled data measurements. The method uses adaptive input estimation with adaptive state estimation (AIE/ASE), and thus it requires only minimal prior information about the signal and noise statistics. Furthermore, since the estimates of the derivative at step k provided by AIE/ASE depend only on data available up to step k , AIE/ASE is thus implementable in real time. The accuracy of AIE/ASE is compared numerically to several conventional numerical differentiation methods. Finally, AIE/ASE is applied to simulated vehicle position data, generated in the CarSim simulator software.},

Moreover, when the attack dwell time exceeds the tolerance range, a tracking-removed autoencoder is chosen to train to get the control signal. And it can be proved that the closed-loop system with the controller based on the tracking-removed autoencoder is asymptotically stable with H ∞ performance index.

In this paper, we investigate the co-design problem for a class of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems with frequency temporal domain specifications. Firstly, the frequency temporal domain specifications are written in a formal language called spectral temporal logic (STL). Secondly, the satisfaction conditions of the spectral temporal logic specifications have been transformed into non-linear matrices inequality forms with necessary and sufficient conditions. Thirdly, the co-design problem is transformed into a non-convex optimisation problem with mixed-integer linear matrix inequalities (MILMIs) constraints, and then an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the co-design problem with semidefinite programming (SDP). Finally, the performance of the algorithm and the expressiveness of spectral temporal logic are illustrated with the applications to micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).},

The main contribution of this work is the derivation of a scheme that is able to diagnose single or multiple actuator faults in one or multiple subsystems. Each subsystem is monitored by a local diagnosis agent which contains the actuator fault detection module and the isolation module. The detection threshold in the fault detection module is generated through the use of a novel filtering technique, while the fault isolation module is realised by applying a reasoning-based decision logic based on a fault signature matrix. Fault propagation among subsystems is investigated and the results obtained allow for the identification of the subsystems that contain the faulty actuators. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed actuator fault diagnosis method is demonstrated through a simulation example.},

Our approach extends the classical D -decomposition method to accommodate any number of parameters, whether linearly or non-linearly involved in the coefficients of a polynomial ψ . Through Hermite&#39;s stability method, we establish the existence of stability regions within the parameter space, where all roots of ψ reside exclusively in the closed left half complex plane, defining the stability boundary. To identify points within the stability region, we employ the quotient and remainder from the Euclidean division of ψ by specific polynomials. Additionally, we introduce the ‘dynamics correlator’, a polynomial expressing ψ in its assignable roots space, whose zero set generalises the Root Locus. Confluence polynomials and loci, derived from the dynamics correlator, are used to realise stabilisability strategies. Extensive numerical examples demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed methods in stabilising challenging systems and meeting additional performance criteria.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an event-triggered fault-tolerant tracking control strategy design of multiple quadrotor UAVs (MQUAVs) formation subject to the composite influence of external disturbance, tracking error constraints and actuator faults. A prescribed time prescribed performance function is employed to solve tracking error constraints and it ensures the tracking error enters into the constraint boundary in the prescribed time. A first-order filter is designed to solve the problem of computational explosion caused by reference trajectory and unknown external disturbance. The adaptive method is used to deal with the unknown parameters and the comprehensive uncertainty which contains actuator faults and external disturbance. Furthermore, the event-triggered controller is designed to achieve the formation tracking with the reduction of update number of controller to save resources. The bounded stability of the tracking error is proved via the Lyapunov theory. At last, the effectiveness of the control strategy is verified by simulation.},

An infinite-dimensional state observer is established to estimate the state based on the relative output information. On the basis of the adaptive state observer, two novel distributed event-triggered controllers are proposed to address the leaderless consensus and leader-follower consensus problem. Based on the Lyapunov method and PDE theory, it is shown that the asymptotic consensus control can be achieved. Compared to the related works, a distinctive feature of the designed event-triggered consensus protocols is fully distributed which does not demand any global information of the graph. In addition, the absence of Zeno behaviour is demonstrated. Lastly, the obtained results are demonstrated using two simulations.},

To this end, we employ the Fokas method to determine boundary controls and the controlled solutions concerning varying dispersion parameters and final times. By employing the Fokas method for the LAD equation, which provides an explicit integral representation of the solution, we enable a comprehensive analysis of null controllability. Consequently, we derive a boundary control input that effectively steers the solution from its initial state to the zero state within a given final time. The proposed approach offers a straightforward means to achieve the null controllability for the LAD equation, even as the dispersion parameter and the final time vary. Importantly, the effectiveness of this approach can be extended to various types of boundary control problems, thereby enhancing its broader applicability and potential impact.},

By using Schauder fixed point theorem, we show that a design associated with a linear system is also a solution of the problem. Based on this, we further develop surrogate design criteria in the form of the inequalities that can readily be solved in practice. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of such inequalities are given for deadzone and saturation.

  abstract     = {Control of nonlinear systems in the presence of model mismatch and system constraints is quite challenging. To address the issue, this work proposes an adaptive Gaussian process-based real-time optimisation (AGP-RTO) control framework. Specifically, the control law consists of two components, a feedforward tracking control law and an uncertainty compensation control law. Because GP has high flexibility to capture complex unknown functions by using very few parameters and it inherently handles measurement noise, this work utilises the GP as an alternative to estimate the mismatch between the real plant and the approximated model. During every RTO execution, the GPs adaptively update the predictions of the model mismatch, then the predictions are embedded into a nonlinear optimisation problem for the correction of the model cost and constraint functions, which yields the uncertainty compensation control law. The proposed AGP-RTO framework ensures that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions determined by the model match those of the plant upon convergence. Compared to many direct adaptive control methods, AGP-RTO does not rely on a high gain for fast adaptation and hence it improves the robustness of the closed-loop system. Compared to the modifier adaptation (MA) method, AGP-RTO avoids the plant-gradient estimation by using the finite difference scheme, besides it trains the GP models offline, which speeds up online evaluation and improves the applicability and efficacy of real-time control. Comparisons are carried out to illustrate the superiority of the AGP-RTO.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores a reinsurance and asset liability management problem in a factor model with dependent risks, considering economic factors as non-Markovian processes impacting the appreciation rate, volatility, and value of liabilities. It encompasses various stochastic volatility (SV) models like Hull-White, Heston, 3/2, and 4/2 models as special cases. The model addresses dependent risks through a common shock in claim number processes. The insurer&#39;s aim is to minimize variance in terminal net wealth while achieving a certain expected terminal net wealth, balancing reinsurance, new business, and asset allocation. The paper employs linear-quadratic (LQ) control and backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) theory to derive both the efficient strategy and the efficient frontier. To illustrate our results, numerical examples are provided in two special cases, the 3/2 and 4/2 SV models.},

Firstly, to avoid constraint violation, the adaptive backstepping approach and barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) are combined in a unified framework. Then, a suitable auxiliary system with the same order as the considered system is constructed to deal with the effect of input delay. In addition, MTN is used to estimate unknown nonlinear functions during the design of the controller. Furthermore, with the help of the Lyapunov stability theorem, the controller presented in this paper can guarantee that all the closed-loop signals are bounded in probability, the system states remain in the defined compact sets, the output signal can track the reference signal successfully, and the tracking error is bounded by the expected bound.

In the proposed approach, the quadrotor is driven by a second-order variable-gain sliding mode controller (VG-SMC), which includes a state-dependent variable-gain that allows enhancing the controller performance against disturbances. Besides, the proposed controller achieves finite-time convergence of the position and orientation error signals and their time derivatives. The performance of the closed-loop system is assessed by comparing it with a standard sliding mode controller whose control objective is to track two optimal smooth reference signals. The comparison between both controllers considers the undisturbed and the perturbed cases. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VG-SMC controller provides better overall closed-loop results than those obtained by a fixed-gain sliding mode controller, despite the presence of disturbances.},

This study proposes an adaptive global terminal sliding mode control scheme based on limited error (AEG-SMC) for trajectory tracking of HST. AEG-SMC is firstly proposed for the nonlinear dynamic system to improve the accuracy of tracking error and solve the problem of parameter uncertainty in the model. Then, AEG-SMC uses an adaptive method to approximate the uncertain parameters in the model to obtain real-time parameter estimation, and an error index function is given to realise fast and high-precision tracking of the system by global terminal sliding mode control (GSMC). AEG-SMC is able to design the required error indicators before conducting control, thereby ensuring the high-quality response and stability of the system. Finally, the simulation results show that the speed tracking error and control input of HST with AEG-SMC are also the smallest among the mentioned methods.},

In the control approach to confine the system output to a predefined set, the barrier Lyapunov function is utilised. To cope with the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’, a finite-time command filter is also employed. Furthermore, the values of the unknown parameters are estimated by appropriate adaptive laws.

The PFC renders motions along any smooth Jordan curve in R 3 for payload position controlled-invariant. This property has practical benefits over traditional time-based trajectory tracking. Furthermore, the PFC prescribes UAV yaw and a desired payload speed profiles along the path. The PFC adopts dynamic extension and input-output state feedback linearisation.

Moreover, the state here evolves by some anticipated backward stochastic differential equation in which the terminal instead initial condition is specified and the anticipated terms are involved. Applying a so-called anticipated person-by-person optimality principle , we construct an auxiliary control problem for each agent based on decentralised information. The decentralised social strategy is derived by a class of new consistency condition systems, which are mean-field-type anticipated forward–backward stochastic differential delay equations (AFBSDDEs).

Due to the presence of nonlinear activation functions in neural networks, we use quadratic constraints on the global sector to abstract the nonlinear activation functions in neural networks. By combining a quadratic constraint approach for the activation function with Lyapunov theory, the interval observer design problem is transformed into a series of quadratic and linear programming feasibility problems to make the interval observer operate with the ability to correctly estimate the system state with estimation errors within acceptable limits. The applicability of the proposed method is verified by simulation of the lateral vehicle control system.},

It is assumed only that the nonlinear uncertainties of the systems are some smooth functions enough to guarantee the existence of solutions to the differential equations which describe uncertain systems, and that the virtual control coefficients are unknown. Based on backstepping algorithm, by combining the barrier Lyapunov function with an integral inequality reported in the current control literature, a design method is presented whereby a simple adaptive robust output tracking control scheme can be synthesised. The presented design method can evade the repeated differentiation problem appearing in using backstepping algorithm, and need not know all the nonlinear upper bounds of uncertainties, which are repeatedly employed at each step of backstepping procedure. It is also shown that the output tracking error of the uncertain nonlinear systems with both unknown virtual control coefficients and full state constraints can converge uniformly exponentially towards a ball which can be as small as desired.

Additionally, only a small percentage of the network nodes are controlled by intermittent control. Several sufficient conditions are established by the Lyapunov method and graph theory. Especially, when the duration τ between two consecutive observations tends to zero, our control will degenerate into common periodically intermittent pinning control. Meanwhile, a corollary about the EBS-MS of SSNs is presented. Besides, theoretical results are applied to a single-link robot arm system and an oscillator system.

Due to the inherent symmetries, this yields a system of linear equations with periodically varying coefficients governing the error dynamics. It is shown that the higher-order dynamics of the Lagrange top leads to nuances in the implementation of the control. Two different control strategies are implemented in the present work. These are applicable for impulsive and short-duration disturbances, respectively. The control effort is in the form of a body-fixed torque input about the symmetry axis and a vertical space-fixed force input. In both the proposed control strategies, the iterative application of the control effort over multiple periods is shown to stabilise the error.

Moreover, this function can also characterise the upper boundary of the convergence time and steady-state error explicitly. Then a reinforcement-learning-based relative orbit-attitude control scheme is proposed to propel the formation error to the vicinity of the origin. An actor-critic neural network architecture is utilised to online compensate the system uncertainties, in which the critic neural network is introduced to improve the approximate performance of the actor neural network for the unknown uncertainties by evaluating the consensus performance of the formation system. In addition, an auxiliary system is devised to cope with the input saturation constraint. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are analysed.

A great advantage of the presented identifier is that the uncertainty of the identified system is also quantified and updated over time on a slower time scale.

Moreover, the algorithms are applied to a class of location control problems, that is, distributed nonlinear placement problems for multi-cluster systems. Finally, some simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithms.},

First, locally accurate approximations of sensor faults and unmodeled output dynamics are achieved by using a deterministic learning-based neural network observer. Second, a sensor fault pattern bank which stores the knowledge of sensor faults and unmodeled output dynamics is established. A set of observers utilising the learned knowledge are constructed to generate residuals for rapid SFDIA. The contributions are: (1) the fault detectability and isolability conditions are rigorously analysed and verified in the simulation; (2) using the proposed fault accommodation approach, compared with online parameter adaptation techniques, better tracking performance can be achieved in the presence of sensor faults. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Such variations have the potential to cause instability and misdiagnosis. This paper delves into a cutting-edge SFDC structure that surpasses conventional designs in terms of reliability. The proposed Resilient Simultaneous Fault Detection and Control (RSFDC) structure considers variations in the designed parameters and provides a more robust and fault-tolerant approach to SFDC, with important implications for the design of reliable and resilient control systems in a broad range of applications. This scheme is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem, encompassing control and diagnosis objectives. Specifically, it aims to minimise the impact of faults and disturbances on the controlled output while reducing residual sensitivity to all changes and maximising the fault effects on the residual. Through simulation comparisons, this paper showcases the merits of the RSFDC structure in two examples, highlighting its superiority over other designs.},

The robustness is achieved by using an annular event-triggered artificial time-delayed control (ET-TDC) methodology with input saturation. The ET-TDC philosophy uses the TDC strategy through a dynamic predefined triggering mechanism which overcomes the requirement to update the control periodically for every sampling instant, unlike conventional TDC and other robust control schemes. Thus the proposed methodology can tackle uncertainties with minimal a-priori knowledge while significantly reducing the over-utilisation of system resources. In addition, the adopted event-triggered mechanism facilitates further conservation of energy which might be crucial for mid-to-long range engagement scenarios. The closed-loop stability is derived analytically and the simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed guidance framework in comparison with other state-of-art robust control methodologies.},

To solve the challenging cooperative attack problem coupled with the target assignment problem simultaneously in a unified one-phase framework, a novel auxiliary index denoted as the integrated relative distance is designed and analysed from two opposite perspectives. Because of its special properties, the proposed integrated relative distance plays a crucial role in evaluating dynamic engagement situations between attackers and targets, and it further provides a criterion for whether the cooperative attack mission is completed. Then all integrated relative distances are minimised to directly derive a cooperative guidance law for attackers based on optimal control theory. The simultaneous minimisation of integrated relative distances from both forward and backward perspectives ensures that each target is destroyed by at least one attacker and all attackers are fully exploited to obtain optimal attack performance. By this means, the target assignment problem is automatically solved and the cooperative simultaneous attack is achieved. Several simulation cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated cooperative guidance strategy.},

For case (1), we use the reverse average dwell time to investigate FNTS, but for case (2), we employ the Poisson process theory to solve the stability problem. In addition, the stability criteria capture the stabilising effect of stochastic noise in the FNTS problem.

  abstract     = {The AIMD algorithm, which underpins the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for transporting data packets in communication networks, is perhaps the most successful control algorithm ever deployed. Recently, its use has been extended beyond communication networks, and successful applications of the AIMD algorithm have been reported in transportation, energy, and mathematical biology. A very recent development in the use of AIMD is its application in solving large-scale optimisation and distributed control problems without the need for inter-agent communication. In this context, an interesting problem arises when multiple AIMD networks are coupled in some sense (usually through a nonlinearity). The purpose of this note is to prove that such systems in certain settings inherit the ergodic properties of individual AIMD networks. This result has important consequences for the convergence of the aforementioned optimisation algorithms. The arguments in the paper also correct conceptual and technical errors in Alam et al. (2020, The convergence of finite-averaging of AIMD for distributed heterogeneous resource allocations. arXiv:2001.08083 [math.OC].).},

The main control objectives lie in reducing the influence of the disturbance, steering the flexible arm to the desired angular position and suppressing the vibration, simultaneously. To achieve the objectives, firstly, two different disturbance observers are designed. Secondly, we construct boundary controllers based on the two designed disturbance observers and boundary measurable signals. Then, with the two disturbance observers, the boundary disturbance compensation is achieved, and with the designed boundary controllers, the uniform boundedness of the flexible arm is guaranteed. Moreover, the well-posedness of the closed-loop system under the designed boundary controllers is discussed by means of the operator semigroup theory. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed controllers are demonstrated through simulations and physical experiments.},

Then, compute a ball in the uncertain parameter space such that for all parameter perturbations within it, the state response continues to satisfy the same transient performance bounds. The second problem is on the synthesis of a robust static state feedback control, which i) minimises the norm of the gain matrix, ii) maximises the radius of the ball in the uncertain parameter space, and iii) ensures achieving specified transient performance in the closed loop. For this, a sub-optimal linear matrix inequality optimisation is formulated. The developed results are demonstrated with numerical examples.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the trajectory behavior evaluation for generalised Persidskii systems with an essentially bounded input on a finite time interval. Also, the notions of annular settling and output annular settling for general nonlinear systems are introduced. We propose conditions for annular short-time stability, short-time boundedness with a nonzero initial state, annular settling, and output annular settling for a class of Persidskii systems. These conditions are based on the verification of linear matrix inequalities. An application to recurrent neural networks illustrates the usefulness of the proposed notions and conditions.},

For this, an auxiliary problem with a polyhedral parabolic discrete inclusion is defined. With the help of locally adjoint mappings and comparison of matrix-coefficients of discrete and discrete-approximate problems, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for polyhedral-parabolic discrete-approximate inclusions are skilfully constructed. Thus, using the discretisation method and the features of the polyhedral nature of the problem, we prove sufficient optimality conditions for a polyhedral parabolic DFI.

In consideration of observable canonical arrangement, the periodic controller not only exhibits insignificant oscillations within plant output but also ensures realistic bounded control input.

Having a suitable transient performance not only guarantees the safety of the system but also makes the response more desirable by reducing transient factors like the overshoot and the settling time. This paper is the first attempt to design a novel controller to improve the transient performance of switched singular time-delay systems. The proposed controller comprises a combination of linear and nonlinear parts. First, a linear part is designed to fulfill the stabilisation. Then a nonlinear part is added to it to improve the transient response. The admissibility of the closed-loop system is investigated through some given theorems based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach. The closed-loop system’s regularity and impulse freeness are also guaranteed in the given theorems. Computer simulation of some numerical and practical examples will endorse the theoretical achievements afterward.},

By employing a prescribed performances function, restrictions on tracking errors are removed for prescribed performances including convergence rate, maximum overshoot, and steady-state error. On this basis, a complex optimal tracking control problem can be transformed into an optimal stabilising control problem by constructing an augmented system. Subsequently, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced to reduce communication resources. Then, an adaptive critic learning algorithm is used to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, where the weights in the critic networks are tuned through the gradient descent approach and experience replay technology. Through the developed learning method, the persistence of excitation condition is released, and the data efficiency is improved. The Lyapunov stability theory is introduced to verify the stability of the close-loop system and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded.

ISS changing supply rates technique with uncertain supply pair is developed to deal with the unmodelled dynamics.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an end-user privacy and thermal comfort preserving approach for residential thermostatically controllable loads (TCLs) to provide demand response (DR) in grid services under uncertainties. Unlike the standard approach whereby a central utility-level control is used to control end-users loads, this paper splits the control effort between a central coordinating controller and local robust controllers. The Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method is applied by relaxing the power tracking constraint to obtain a hierarchical control framework with a local controller at each household level and a coordinating controller at the central utility level. Household-level local controllers are based on robust model predictive control (MPC) that relies on minimum household-specific information while accounting for thermal model parameter uncertainties and forecast errors associated with exogenous inputs. Considering inverter-type air conditioners as the TCL, the approach is validated using a practical signal corresponding to the Australian Energy Market Operator. The results demonstrate that accurate tracking of the load set-point signal can be achieved under a considerable range of uncertainties while preserving thermal comfort for end-users. Furthermore, the proposed DR scheme is computationally tractable and robust for real-world implementation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an event-triggered dual-mode predictive control strategy to deal with two-channel packet dropouts for discrete-time constrained nonlinear networked control systems. The main focus is on the construction of network compensation mechanisms and control algorithms. Firstly, two types of novel event generators are set, respectively, in sensor node and controller node to reduce resource consumption while preserving the desired system performance. In order to establish corresponding event-triggering conditions, two special states, successful transmitted states and reconstructed states, are introduced. Subsequently, a dual-mode control scheme, where the switch of modes depends on reconstructed states, is designed. The recursive feasibility of optimization problems is ensured by determining relationships between actual states and reconstructed states. By constructing actual control laws under two system modes, the stability property of closed-loop systems is guaranteed. Furthermore, effects of packet dropouts and disturbances on system performance are analyzed. At last, the efficiency of the proposed control strategy is illustrated by a cart-damper-spring simulation example.},

Different from the previous literature, the new model we studied owns the non-strongly connected topology. The actual controllers are realised by back-stepping and designing virtual controllers. In particular, a novel method for constructing global Lyapunov functions is proposed,which exploits the Lyapunov function of each stochastic strict-feedback nonlinear systems with time-varying delays (SSNSTD) to construct the global Lyapunov function of SSNSTDN. Meanwhile, combining the Lyapunov method with graph theory, several sufficient conditions to guarantee the exponential stability in mean square of SSNSTDN are obtained in the form of coefficients-type criterion. Furthermore, we apply our main results to investigating the stabilisation of stochastic coupled oscillators with time-varying delays on networks and the effectiveness of proposed theories is illustrated by some numerical examples.},

Noting that some states are difficult to measure in practice, a polynomial state observer is employed to obtain the unknown states. Then a robust observer-based tracking controller is designed to force the states of the polynomial uncertain system to follow the ones of the reference model and satisfy H ∞ performance. By using a full-state-dependent homogeneous polynomial function, the solvability condition is derived for the observer-based tracking control strategy, which reduces conservatism. Sum of squares technique is utilised to calculate the corresponding observer and controller, effectively dealing with the calculation problem in polynomial systems.

For this approach, this paper introduces two new functionals to minimise the conservatism of stability conditions. The first one is called a non-negative integral functional (NIF) that is added to the derivative of a common Lyapunov functional. The second one is a general looped-functional (GLF), whose values at sampling instants are traditionally not well-defined, and are defined here in terms of their limits. Leveraging further affine canonical Bessel-Legendre inequalities expressed by simplified polynomials, a polynomial-based NIF, a polynomial-based GLF, and a polynomial-based zero equality are tailored for obtaining hierarchical types of stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples show that: (i) the proposed functionals lead to less conservatism when compared with several state-of-the-art methods; and, (ii) the resulting stability conditions exhibit a hierarchical characteristic in the sense that the higher level of hierarchy, the less conservatism of the criteria.},

In this work, we propose a method for parsimonious linear time invariant system identification when only quantised observations, discerned from noisy data, are available. More formally, given a priori information on the system, represented by a compact set containing the poles of the system, and quantised realizations, our algorithm aims at identifying the least order system that is compatible with the available information. The proposed approach takes also into account that the available data can be subject to fragmentation. Our proposed algorithm relies on an ADMM approach to solve a ℓ p , ( 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 ) , quasi-norm objective problem. Numerical results highlight the performance of the proposed approach when compared to the ℓ 1 minimisation in terms of the sparsity of the induced solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a feedforward control method for physical systems that can be described with linear parameter-varying (LPV) models. The proposed feedforward controller structure is consequently derived from a generic LPV representation and is shown to be identifiable directly from noisy measurement data. The identified structure is advantageous for feedforward control, as using a simple least squares algorithm allows to parameterise basis functions representing the required input trajectory to follow a given output trajectory. Also, with the proposed regularisation, the input trajectory remains bounded even when the physical system exhibits non-minimum phase behaviour. Additionally, the proposed controller structure does not possess states but only considers the inputs and outputs signals and their derivatives, leading to a unique physical interpretation of each controller&#39;s parameter. Multiple feedforward controllers identified at various operating points can therefore be directly merged to create a parameter-varying controller. A nonlinear and locally non-minimum phase system is considered in this study, i.e. an engine air path, to evaluate the performances of the proposed feedforward strategy. The controller parameters are first identified from noisy measurement data, and then the proposed feedforward controller is implemented with a feedback controller to track the exhaust pressure and NO x concentration. Using a detailed physical simulation of the engine air path, the proposed feedforward strategy showed encouraging output tracking performances compared to state-of-the-art control methods. The presented feedforward method is shown to be straightforward to identify and calibrate while guaranteeing a contained computational complexity and being applicable to many physical systems thanks to its modularity.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes an efficient Newton-type method for the optimal control of switched systems under a given mode sequence. A mesh-refinement-based approach is utilised to discretise continuous-time optimal control problems (OCPs) and formulate a nonlinear program (NLP), which guarantees the local convergence of a Newton-type method. A dedicated structure-exploiting algorithm (Riccati recursion) is proposed to perform a Newton-type method for the NLP efficiently because its sparsity structure is different from a standard OCP. The proposed method computes each Newton step with linear time-complexity for the total number of discretization grids as the standard Riccati recursion algorithm. Additionally, the computation is always successful if the solution is sufficiently close to a local minimum. Conversely, general quadratic programming (QP) solvers cannot accomplish this because the Hessian matrix is inherently indefinite. Moreover, a modification on the reduced Hessian matrix is proposed using the nature of the Riccati recursion algorithm as the dynamic programming for a QP subproblem to enhance the convergence. A numerical comparison is conducted with off-the-shelf NLP solvers, which demonstrates that the proposed method is up to two orders of magnitude faster. Whole-body optimal control of quadrupedal gaits is also demonstrated and shows that the proposed method can achieve the whole-body model predictive control (MPC) of robotic systems with rigid contacts.},

The state constraints are handled by applying nonlinear transformed functions (NTFs) and the input saturation is estimated by an auxiliary hyperbolic tangent function. On the basis of adding a power integrator technique and adaptive control method, an adaptive state feedback controller is designed for the closed-loop system. With the aid of finite-time stability theory, the tracking error converges to a bounded neighbourhood of the origin in a finite time, and all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. At last, a simulation example and a practical example are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control procedure.},

  abstract     = {The focus of this paper is the design of open-loop control profiles for linear differentially flat systems whose model parameters are uncertain and are represented probabilistically. To account for the time-invariant model parameter uncertainties, polynomial chaos is used to derive a surrogate model which permits easy evaluation of the mean and variance of the uncertain states. A chance constrained optimisation problem is posed to minimise the terminal error of the stochastic states for a prescribed risk of not satisfying the terminal state bounds. To permit posing a convex optimisation problem, the cost function which is the residual energy is approximated by a hypercube circumscribing the hypersphere which bounds the terminal residual error. This relaxation permits posing a convex optimisation problem to arrive at the robust control profile. The proposed technique is illustrated on two examples including the benchmark spring-mass-dashpot system undergoing a rest-to-rest maneuver and a UAV undergoing a translation in a prescribed time. Parametric studies are conducted where the impact of varying the order of the polynomial chaos expansion and the degree of the parameterised control profiles are used to conclude that a 2–3 degree polynomial chaos expansion is sufficient to capture the time evolution of the mean and variance of the states which are required for the chance constrained optimisation problems. As expected, the design results in improved performance as the number of free variables used to parameterise the control profiles increases.},

In this proposed scheme, the droop coefficient is used to manage the DC voltage and maintain power sharing by shifting the control modes of the rectifiers and inverters in the presence of considerable power disturbances. The droop coefficient is planned based on the stability limit of DC voltage. The performance of the designed control scheme is compared to that of existing coordinated control and voltage margin droop control approaches. A ±400 kV five-terminal VSC-MTDC network is developed in PSCAD to verify the planned control method.

This allows us to design the settling time with an appropriate parameter based on the prescribed boundary.

  abstract     = {This paper aims at adaptive event-triggered output-feedback stabilisation in the presence of intractable non-parametric uncertainties. Typically, double-side (i.e. sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator) event-triggered communication is pursued for efficient resource utilisation, unlike in related works only reducing single-side communication. This renders more constrained information transmitted via network, challenging the co-design of the compensation and event-triggering mechanisms. By incorporating a switching-varying mechanism, a distinctive adaptive event-triggered output-feedback scheme is established based on a switching filter reconstructing the unmeasurable states. Crucially, a convergence-preserving event-triggering mechanism is proposed with the adaptiveness for uncertainty compensation, by suitably exploiting the switching-varying gain. As such, a desired event-triggered output-feedback control is designed with linearity (with respect to the system output and the filter states) rendered for the controller signal. Just owing to the linearity, the controller signal is subtly kept from entering the event-triggering mechanism, so as to match the double-side event-triggered architecture. Furthermore, it is achieved that the system and filter states converge to zero while a positive minimum inter-execution time is ensured.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the robustness, disturbance attenuation and performance capabilities of a Proportional-Integral-Retarded (PIR) controller when controlling a class of uncertain second-order systems with input disturbances. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the trade-offs between these conflicting requirements. This is accomplished by introducing simple delay-dependent stability conditions, expressed in linear matrix inequality form, which are used to establish the trade-offs in PIR control. In light of the obtained stability conditions, we show that improving performance comes at the cost of reduced robustness and disturbance attenuation. To our knowledge, this problem has not been addressed before and these new results provide valuable insights and systematic guidelines for designing these controllers with trade-offs in mind, thereby completing our current understanding of the tuning mechanisms in PIR control. Inspired by the application field of fuel-cell systems , experiments are carried out on a proof-of-concept switching converter prototype to demonstrate the relevance of the obtained results.},

The exploration of various kinetics behaviours of GA-ecological model has attracted the attention of many mathematicians. This paper focuses on a nonlinear periodic GA-predation ecosystem with infinite distributed lags on time scales. In the sense of time scale, our model unifies the difference model and differential model of GA-predation ecosystem. We first discuss a class of auxiliary functions with only two real roots. By using these auxiliary functions, coincidence degree and some inequality techniques, we next obtain some existence conditions of periodic solution. Furthermore, we explore the global asymptotic stability of periodic solution on account of Lyapunov stability theory. An example and its simulation are provided to inspect the correctness and availability of our main results at last.},

The learned probabilistic model is assumed to contain the true dynamics of the system with a high probability and is used to generate scenarios that ensure safety for a scenario-based MPC. Moreover, to guarantee stability and enhance the performance of the closed-loop system, a parameter-dependent terminal cost and controller, as well as a terminal robust positive invariant set are designed.

Then the reduced order system is produced by the orthogonal projection matrix that is defined by discrete Walsh coefficient matrix. Moreover, MOR method via discrete Walsh functions is investigated for discrete-time bilinear systems with nonzero initial conditions, where nonzero initial condition is also utilized to create the orthogonal projection matrix. Theoretical analyses show that the outputs of the resulting reduced order systems can match the first several outputs of the original system in finite intervals.

The traditional EMPC may lead to infeasibility and even instability of the closed-loop system when the criterion has been changed. Firstly, a generalised terminal constraint is introduced to ensure the recursive feasibility of the economic optimisation problem, which enforces the terminal states to converge to an arbitrary equilibrium state rather than a predetermined fixed one at the initial time. Then the stability constraint is constructed by solving an auxiliary optimisation problem online, which is the key to guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, sufficient conditions for feasibility and asymptotic stability are derived in the context of changing economic criteria. The main feature of the proposed strategy is that it does not need to know the changes of economic criterion in advance, and its properties and effectiveness are exemplified by simulations on a nonlinear chemical process example.},

For this problem, we propose novel state feedback and output feedback control architectures that are predicated on energy function -based and norm-free event-triggering conditions, where the embedded processor broadcasts a sampled data of its control signal value through a zero-order-hold operator to the physical system when the left side of the event-triggering condition equals to its right side. In this context, the energy function -based feature means that the right sides of the proposed event-triggering conditions involve an energy function as well as its time-derivative to make the selection of these right sides user-adjustable . Furthermore, the norm-free feature means that the left sides of the proposed event-triggering conditions do not depend on signal norms to allow for better control data transmission reduction. System-theoretical analyses of our event-triggered state feedback and output feedback control architectures are shown using the same energy functions and their time-derivatives used in the proposed event-triggering conditions, where illustrative numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our contributions.

These parameters could be utilised to tune some time domain performance measures such as settling time, per cent overshoot. etc., under certain conditions.

This also makes the PDE observer easily designed based on tracking errors only. Then, exosystem observers and their reduced-order forms are proposed in case of different geometric multiplicities and limited conditions of disturbances, references and system uncertainties. This gives observer based robust controls and reduced-order observer based controls. Robust output regulation is proved for the Timoshenko beam under observer based controls.

  abstract     = {This study investigates distributed convex optimisation that accounts for the inequality constraints over unbalanced directed graphs. In distributed optimisation, agents exchange information on a network to obtain an optimal solution when they only know their own cost function. We propose a distributed primal-dual subgradient method based on a row stochastic weight matrix that is associated with a communication network. In the proposed method, the normalised left eigenvector of the weight matrix is estimated by a consensus algorithm. Then, the subgradient of the Lagrange function is scaled by the estimated values of the left eigenvector to compensate for the imbalance of the information flow in the network. We show that the pair of estimations for the primal and dual problems converge to an optimal primal-dual solution. We also show the relation between the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm and the step-size rule. A numerical example confirms the validity of the proposed method.},

The data is quantised and transmitted through restricted communication channels from the controller to the actuator. Combining a logarithmic quantizer with an encoding and decoding mechanism to quantise the input signals reduces the influence of the quantisation error. New design algorithms are developed with conditions for convergence of the tracking error and an extension to fault-tolerant performance under actuator failures. A numerical-based case study demonstrates the application of the new designs, which includes a comparison with another ILC law and the relative merits of the encoding and decoding schemes.},

By employing G-Itô formula, Lyapunov–Razumikhin approach and stochastic analysis theory, some novel conditions for p th moment practical exponential stability and quasi-sure global practical uniform exponential stability of G-ISFDSs are established.

In this paper, we review classic methods for node ranking and compare their performance in a benchmark network that considers the community-based structure of society. The outcome of the ranking procedure is then used to decide which individuals should be tested, and possibly quarantined, first.

The proposed approach uses the low-rank factors of the cross Gramian to generate approximate balanced model for the large-scale system. Then, the reduced-order model is obtained by truncating the states corresponding to the small approximate Hankel singular values. The low-rank factors are directly constructed from the expansion coefficients of impulse responses in the space spanned by Legendre polynomials by solving block tridiagonal linear systems. In contrast to balanced truncation related approaches which require to solve Sylvester equation to compute the full cross Gramian, the proposed method needs to solve sparse linear equations, and only one singular value decomposition is applied to a low-dimensional matrix. The stability preservation of the reduced model is briefly discussed. And in combination with the dominant subspace projection method, the reduction procedure is modified to alleviate the shortcoming, which may unexpectedly lead to unstable systems even though the original one is stable. Finally, numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

In the previous framework, the specified closed-loop system language may contain physically impossible strings, i.e. strings never occur in practice. To exclude these physically impossible strings, this paper presents a new modeling framework for supervisory control of networked TDESs. Specifically, we first analyse how to model and update the observation channel and the control channel under communication delays and losses. We then construct an automaton that explicitly describes the interaction process between the plant and the supervisor over the observation channel and the control channel so that the language of the closed-loop system can be specified. Compared with the existing work, the proposed framework can model the ‘dynamics’ of the closed-loop system more accurately. Under the proposed framework, we further estimate states of the closed-loop system under communication delays and losses. The state estimation is implemented on-the-fly and bases on only the information of observations and controls in history. As an application of the proposed modeling and state estimation approaches, we finally extend the existing approaches to find all the admissible and safe supervisors of networked TDESs.},

The saturated function is converted to the combination of a linear part and a nonlinear part, thus overcomes the difficulties caused by unknown saturated bounds. By utilising the command filtered and backstepping control techniques, a two-step method is adopted to construct the controller, under which the effect of unknown input saturations can be compensated well. It is proved that the closed-loop system is practical finite-time stable, and the output of each follower can converge to the dynamic convex hull spanned by the leaders in finite time. Finally, a group of four one-link manipulator systems is used to support the feasibility of the developed control scheme.},

Firstly, to accomplish this objective, a finite-time time-varying formation-containment control strategy is proposed for satellite formation system in present of the bounded disturbances and satellites&#39; accelerations, which are known for each satellite. Then, considering the case that the information of disturbances may not be measured accurately and the accelerations of satellites may not be obtained globally in some practice application scenarios, a fully distributed adaptive control strategy is proposed by introducing the dynamic variables. The adaptive variables can compensate the unknown items and adjust with the evolution of neighbour satellites&#39; states, which makes the controller more flexible. Moreover, the proposed control strategies are able to guarantee a fast dynamic response and also a suppression of disturbance.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the attitude manoeuvre control without unwinding based on variable gain (i.e. adaptive) super-twisting algorithm (STA) and the modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs). First, a selection logic for the MRP set and its shadow set is designed in order to construct an attitude control system model for rigid spacecraft. Second, a nonlinear sliding function is presented, and on the sliding phase, finite-time convergence and anti-unwinding performance are guaranteed. As a result, a first-order sliding mode controller is created to ensure finite-time convergence and anti-unwinding performance on the reaching phase. To alleviate the chattering and improve convergence speed, an adaptive STA is presented, and the finite-time convergence and anti-unwinding performance are guaranteed on the reaching phase. Furthermore, the adaptive gains are designed based on dual-layer adaptive law, which allows the gains to be increased and decreased as appropriate. It is further demonstrated that when the controller gains are time-varying according to adaptive law, the convergence property and anti-unwinding performance are guaranteed. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the closed-loop system&#39;s performance under the proposed control scheme.},

The resulting closed-loop system for the general case is then analysed, where we prove the existence and uniqueness of solution using the semigroup theory of linear operators; furthermore, we prove the exponential decay of the solution via a frequency domain theorem.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a combination method of adaptive control algorithms of bionic arm shoulder joint based on DDPG to realise intelligent control of the shoulder joint of upper limb prosthesis. Based on using adaptive control to reduce the interference of external variables, the accuracy of the joint module system is improved through reinforcement learning.

It is worth mentioning that the event times are different from the impulse times, that is, the control signals are updated at each event time but the actuator performs the impulsive control tasks at a later time due to time delays.

Furthermore, it can ensure that all overall closed-loop system trajectories are bounded. The feasibility and effectiveness of the technique are demonstrated using a nonlinear dynamical system of an HTRS connected to a single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) power system. The simulation results demonstrate that the technique is capable of regulating the frequency and improving dynamic performance despite large disturbances. It is capable of rapidly reducing oscillations and surpasses two known nonlinear controllers, namely the synergetic control and the backstepping control techniques. Additionally, despite the fact that the HTRS&#39;s parameters vary, the proposed technique is capable of providing consistent control performance.

It is worth noting that the switches can only occur at the sampling instant. Using the techniques of Lyapunov function and average dwell time, several sufficient conditions are proposed for the global stability of SBN. Moreover, by virtue of reachable set approach, a procedure is established to design state feedback sampled-data stabilisers for constrained DBCNs.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the adaptive neural tracking control problem for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with time delays and full-state constraints in a unified framework for the first time. The time-delay terms of the controlled systems are compensated by novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals. The asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is adopted to guarantee that the full states are always restricted within prescribed constraints. RBF neural networks are utilised to approximate the lumped unknown functions in the design process. Furthermore, the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is employed to simplify the process of control design significantly. Stability analysis shows all closed-loop signals are SGUUB, and full-state constraints are not violated. Finally, simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {The Dynamic Weighting Control Allocator (DWCA) was introduced by Sadien et al. (Control Engineering Practice, 2019) to solve the allocation problem raised by the yaw control of an on-ground aircraft. It handles the classical tradeoff between virtual reference inputs realisation and control power minimisation. But it also offers three specific features. First, the actuators reach saturation almost simultaneously, which allows an efficient recovery in case of failure. Then, several industrial requirements are taken into account, such as implementation ease, low computational cost and compatibility with certification constraints. And finally, the actuators can be prioritised, the last ones being used sparingly (to avoid overheating, fatigue, maintenance cost…) only when the virtual reference inputs cannot be realised by the first ones only. But despite its attractiveness, the DWCA is limited to the 1-dimensional case, which means that only one degree of freedom can be controlled. This is not sufficient to deal with today&#39;s challenges in the aeronautical and automotive fields, for example, where certain control problems are inherently multi-dimensional. With the progressive advent of autonomous cars, new concepts of light hybrid or electric vehicles are, for example, emerging, where both hydraulic and electric actuators are mounted on each wheel to improve the combined management of speed and steering. In this context, this paper introduces a non-trivial generalisation of the DWCA, which retains the various characteristics and advantages of the initial version and can be used in the multi-dimensional case.},

The behaviour of TEGs is described using linear equations while GMCs are expressed by weighted inequalities in Min-Plus algebra. We formulate the problem in terms of control linear Min-Plus models. Hence, an algebraic method to calculate control laws ensuring the respect of GMCs is suggested. And once sufficient conditions are satisfied, we propose casual feedbacks to guarantee these marking specifications.

In this paper, two vector differential equations (VDE) are used to describe the dynamical behaviours of NS and LS, respectively, in which the dynamical behaviour of NS is considered as the VDE with the second derivative term (SDT). This paper mainly focuses on the dynamics of LS, which is represented as VDE with the intuitive topologic feature of outgoing links, and investigates the design of the tracking controller for NS and the auxiliary tracking objectives (ATO) for LS. Firstly, the dynamical models of NS and LS in CDN are proposed, and the corresponding assumptions are given. Secondly, based on Lyapunov stability theory, the controller of NS and the ATO of LS are designed so that the state of NS can asymptotically track the given reference signal. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in this paper is verified by the numerical simulation example with N two-links robots.

By applying a linear state transformation, the original system is transformed into a new one for which output feedback control becomes possible. The Nussbaum function is exploited to overcome the unknown control direction problem generated by uncertain control coefficients and adversary attacks. Based on the available compromised output signal and the states reconstructed by a new extended state observer, an output feedback adaptive resilient control scheme is proposed for such systems by combining the neural-networks-based approximation approach, backstepping technique and some special methods. The proposed controller can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded in probability and the stabilisation error variables remain in an adjustable vicinity of origin.

By using the previewable future reference signal, the consensus tracking control problem is converted into a preview control based optimal problem. The inverse optimality theory is introduced to overcome the difficulty of designing a distributed optimal controller, which is caused by the fact that the communication topology always interplays with the system dynamics and subsequently the global information is usually required in a conventional optimal controller design. First, a distributed optimal controller for tracking a reference signal with stable mode is designed. Then, an internal model based distributed optimal controller is further designed to track a time-varying reference signal. The structured quadratic performance indexes are derived for both cases, respectively, and based on which, two distributed optimal tracking control protocols are implemented to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the augmented systems only using local information. Simulation results show that an appropriate preview length can effectively improve the tracking performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the secure state estimation problem of the cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the presence of malicious attacks. Considering the destructiveness and stealthiness of the attacker, a novel stochastic transmission scheme, in which the repeater generates transmission data by randomly combining some measurement values, is proposed to ensure the effectiveness of the attack detector. A filter equipped with the χ 2 detector and the stochastic transmission scheme is proposed to conduct the secure state estimation. The attack probability condition of the estimation error being mean-square bounded is given, which indicates that stochastic transmission scheme has a limited effect on the filter. Some numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed transmission scheme.},

The main structure of the expanded system consists of multiple pair-wise subsystems. Second, the pair-wise fault-tolerant controllers are designed to stabilise the pair-wise subsystems, which can compensate for the effects of subsystem faults and major coupling faults. Third, a coordinated fault-tolerant controller with a suitable coordinated compensator for the expanded system is constructed according to the pair-wise fault-tolerant controllers of all subsystems. The coordinated compensator is used to compensate for the effects of other minor interconnections and coupling faults, and the coordinated controller is designed for the expanded system. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant controller is obtained to guarantee asymptotical stability of the faulty interconnected wave system by satisfying the contraction condition.

We give a new proof for deriving interpolation-based first-order necessary conditions for time-limited H 2 H 2 H2 optimality. Based on these optimality conditions, we propose a time-limited rational Krylov framework for time-limited rational interpolation. The interpolatory framework is used to present an iterative algorithm that yields reduced-order models satisfying the optimality conditions approximately. The distance to optimality is quantified in terms of the interpolation errors. The errors depend primarily on the interpolating model&#39;s poles and the time interval size.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a model-free super-twisting terminal sliding mode controller (MF-STTSMC) for the n-DOF upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeleton in the presence of external disturbance and backlash hysteresis. This ultra-local model -based control scheme consists of a sliding mode disturbance observer (SMDO) and a super-twisting non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (ST-NFTSMC). The ultra-local model is used to approximate the origin complex exoskeleton system in a short sliding time window, which avoids the requirement for accurate modelling and decreases the difficulty of controller design. To compensate for the lumped uncertainties, the SMDO is constructed to achieve finite-time observation and zero estimation error. Besides, to realise finite-time convergence of sliding surface and tracking error with less chattering, the ST-NFTSMC is proposed by employing a super-twisting algorithm. Furthermore, the stability of a closed-loop system with MF-STTSMC is ensured by using the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, to validate the proposed strategy, co-simulations of 7-DOF iReHave upper-limb exoskeleton are realised by using SolidWorks, SimMechanics, and Matlab/Simulink. Compared to time-delay estimation-based intelligent proportional-derivative control (TDE-iPD), α -variable adaptive model-free controller ( α -AMFC), and inclusive and enhanced time delay controller (IETDC), the higher performances of the proposed MF-STTSMC are demonstrated.},

Compared with the related works, hybrid time delays and regime-switching jump diffusion are introduced into neutral-type networks which can better simulate more complicated practical applications. The introduction of regime-switching jump diffusion increases the difficulties of synchronisation analysis in comparison with the Markovian jump diffusion. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that we firstly extend the availability of aperiodically intermittent control scheme to handle the synchronisation issue with DNMCNs. On the basis of a technique that combines the Lyapunov method and graph theory, some sufficient criteria to synchronise DNMCNs via intermittent control are obtained. Finally, an oscillator system is considered as the application, and the corresponding numerical simulations are proposed to validate the applicability of the obtained theorems and show the effectiveness.},

Compared with some existing ones, the information of time-varying delay can be fully utilised. A parameter-dependent reciprocally convex inequality (PDRCI) is proposed, which covers some existing ones as its special cases. Based on the FALKF and PDRCI, a less conservative stability condition is obtained to ensure the time-varying delay systems to be asymptotically stable. By using a matrix inequality decoupling technique, the corresponding controller for the closed-loop systems is derived.

In this paper, we propose a new distributed model predictive control algorithm that we term as instant distributed model predictive control (iDMPC). The proposed algorithm employs a realisation of the primal-dual algorithm in the controller dynamics for fast computation. We show that the closed-loop system trajectories with the proposed iDMPC algorithm converge asymptotically to a desired reference.

Firstly, integral terminal sliding surfaces are designed for rotor flux, voltage and current subsystems. Secondly, reaching control laws are added in the equivalent control law to enhance the tracking performance of the rotor flux, stator current, DC bus voltage and gridside current loops. To increase the system performance, a modified super-twisting controller is added. This suggested control scheme is aimed to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD), strong robustness and stability to voltage faults, and fast dynamic response to power step change. The stability of the proposed controller is proved using the Lyapunov theory. The numerical simulation results of the proposed control strategy are compared to others to prove its effectiveness.},

In view of the Lyapunov functions approach, we first derive the σ -error p th ( p &gt; 0 ) ( p &gt; 0 ) (p&amp;gt;0) -moment stable behaviour of interested systems. Based on semi-Markov kernel approach and the techniques of eliminating power of matrices (EPMs), we then obtain several LMI conditions for σ -error mean square stability. Subsequently, due to the time-varying singular E -matrix in DTSMJSSs, two different forms of controller gain are exploited in order to design stabilising state-feedback strategies. In particular, computational analysis and comparison of the proposed control schemes are provided, which shows the numerical complexity of the proposed control schemes is vastly lower than that of the existing literature. Finally, an example has been performed to verify the obtained analytical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the output feedback optimal consensus tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown internal dynamics and input saturation. Firstly, an adaptive observer is designed to reconstruct the unmeasurable states using neural networks (NNs) based on the augmented dynamic model. Subsequently, a novel distributed feedforward controller is proposed using the backstepping method, where an auxiliary state is introduced to deal with the input saturation problem. Unlike the traditional recursive design technique, the procedures we take can reduce the consensus tracking control problem into the optimal regulation issue, which is then solved by the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method. Therefore, the designed consensus control protocol consists of a distributed feedforward controller and a distributed optimal feedback controller. Moreover, the stability of the MASs is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulation on multi-missile guidance problem demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

This study uses a semi-tensor product to examine the nonsingularity of Trivium-like cascade FSRs over a finite field. The Trivium-like cascade FSRs are expressed algebraically using the semi-tensor product, allowing them to be viewed as logical networks and introducing a novel state transition matrix. Several necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonsingularity of FSRs and Trivium-like cascade FSRs over a finite field are established by dividing the structural matrices of feedback functions into different parts. These findings are also applicable to binary FSRs and binary Trivium-like cascade FSRs.},

Under some mild assumption conditions, we demonstrate that the HNHSDE exists a unique global solution (GS). Moreover, some criteria regarding the NSS in the q th moment of the GS are established. Furthermore, several theorems are provided for guaranteeing the p th moment asymptotic stability and the almost surely asymptotic stability of the GS with the aid of the delay-dependent Lyapunov functional and stochastic analysis theory.

We propose a novel framework into which an event-triggered mechanism (ETM), actuator saturation, system uncertainty, and deception attack are combined. In the framework, the discrete ETM is employed to determine whether the sampled signal should be transmitted to controller so as to save network bandwidth, a random occurrence deception attack model satisfying Bernoulli distribution is introduced to construct the system robust, and actuator saturation is considered due to the actual complex network environment. Based on the framework, we discussed the stochastic stability of a novel delayed neural network model in a closed-loop system. By resorting to the appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), we derive some new sufficient conditions for the stochastically stable of the system and obtain the gain of the system controller using efficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) method.

These consist of a controllability condition and a minimum phase condition. The filter and smoother are applied to an automotive example to estimate an unknown road profile.

Basically, its proof involves the use of the Lyapunov-Malkin approach to stability and multiple complete Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. The fulfilment of the equilibrium stability condition of the nonlinear system returns to the asymptotic stability condition of the linearised equations and to the so-called Lyapunov conditions for the latter. The transformation of the nonlinear system into the canonical form specific to the Lyapunov-Malkin theorem, and the verification of the two conditions mentioned above require analytical developments doubled by numerical simulations, since the mathematical models are too complex to be approached only analytically.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the integration of input move-blocking into the framework of suboptimal model predictive control. The blocked input parameterisation is explicitly considered as a source of suboptimality. A straightforward integration approach is to hold back a manually generated stabilising fallback solution in some buffer for the case that the optimiser does not find a better input move-blocked solution. An extended approach superimposes the manually generated stabilising warm-start by the move-blocked control sequence and enables a stepwise improvement of the control performance. In addition, this contribution provides a detailed review of the literature on input move-blocked model predictive control and combines important results with the findings of suboptimal model predictive control. A numerical example supports the theoretical results and shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Different from the existing literature, a dynamic term is introduced to event-triggered control (E-TC), which can reduce the number of event triggers as the interexecution times are prolonged on the whole. Moreover, a periodic sampling is adopted, from where the Zeno phenomenon is naturally avoided. Based on the Lyapunov method and graph theory, ISS for coupled systems under the DPE-TC is established. Meanwhile, a dynamic event-triggered control with dwell-time is proposed, and a corollary to ensure the ISS of MCSs is also provided. Eventually, results are applied to second-order oscillators and a numerical example is given to prove the validity of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by some landslide models, and related estimation challenges, this paper presents an optimal estimation method for state and parameter in a special class of so-called ODE–PDE system based on the adjoint method for discrete-time asynchronous measurements. This system is described by a pair of coupled Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Partial Differential Equation (PDE), with a mixed boundary condition for the PDE. The coupling appears both in the ODE and in the Neuman boundary condition of the PDE. For this system, initial conditions or state variables and some empirical parameters are assumed to be unknown and need to be estimated. The Lagrangian multiplier method is used to connect the dynamics of the system and the cost function defined as the least square error between the simulation values and the available measurements. The adjoint state method is applied to the objective functional to get the adjoint system and the gradients with respect to parameters and initial state. The cost functional is optimised, employing the steepest descent method to estimate parameters and initial state. This general approach is illustrated by two application examples corresponding to two different landslide models that validate the presented optimal estimation approach. The first one is about state and parameter estimation in an extended sliding-consolidation landslide model, and the second one is in the viscoplastic sliding-consolidation landslide model.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses the exact linearisation of flat nonlinear discrete-time systems by generalised static or dynamic feedbacks which may also depend on forward-shifts of the new input. We first investigate the question which forward-shifts of a given flat output can be chosen in principle as a new input, and subsequently how to actually introduce the new input by a suitable feedback. With respect to the choice of a feasible input, easily verifiable conditions are derived. Introducing such a new input requires a feedback which may in general depend not only on this new input itself but also on its forward-shifts. This is similar to the continuous-time case, where feedbacks which depend on time derivatives of the closed-loop input – and in particular quasi-static ones – have already been used successfully for the exact linearisation of flat systems since the nineties of the last century. For systems with a flat output that does not depend on forward-shifts of the input, it is shown how to systematically construct a new input such that the total number of the corresponding forward-shifts of the flat output is minimal. Furthermore, it is shown that in this case the calculation of a linearising feedback is particularly simple, and the subsequent design of a discrete-time flatness-based tracking control is discussed. The presented theory is illustrated by the discretised models of a wheeled mobile robot and a 3DOF helicopter.},

If the object is described by a backward polynomial model in terms of the B-shift operator ζ , it is shown that the corresponding DPE generates only causal solutions. This allows us to construct a parameterisation of the set of transfer matrices of causal stabilising controllers in a form that corresponds to the multidimensional Youla-Kučera parameterisation. For the case where the object is given as a forward polynomial model in the F-shift operator z , special techniques are developed to extract the set of all stabilising controllers from the subset of causal solutions.},

Secondly, based on the past state information, a topology-dependent consensus protocol is established, then the fault-tolerant consensus problem of leader-following multi-agent is transformed into the issue of system stability, according to the mode-dependent Lyapunov function and the finite time stochastic theorem, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the closed-loop system and the constraints of average residence time are obtained.

It is verified that uniformly bounded stability of the tracking/approximation errors can be assured if the Brenke-type polynomials are utilised as regressors. Moreover, it has been assumed that velocity signals are not available for feedback. Different trajectories, including simple and highly complicated and fast paths, have been tested in simulation results.

A new boundary controller is designed to achieve fixed time stability of DRDSs. Firstly, a boundary fixed-time controller is presented for DRDSs. Then based on the designed boundary controller, using Lyapunov functional method, fixed-time stability lemma and Poincaré&#39;s inequality, we obtain the criteria to guarantee the fixed-time stability of DRDSs. In addition, boundary fixed-time controller is proposed for uncertain DRDSs to reach robust fixed-time stability. Both the cases, the systems with or without uncertainties, are severally followed by a fixed time, which is an upper-bound of the settling time and irrelevant to the initial conditions. Finally, two simulation examples are given to illustrate the fixed-time stability of the controlled systems, which show the validity of our theoretical results.},

The control enters into the drift and diffusion terms simultaneously. By employing the first-order adjoint equation (backward stochastic differential equation, BSDE for short), we are able to announce Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle for the leader&#39;s global Stackelberg solution, within adapted open-loop structure, where the term global means that the leader&#39;s domination over the entire game duration. Due to the follower&#39;s adjoint equation develops into a BSDE, the leader will be confronted with a control problem where the state equation is a kind of infinite horizon fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE for short). We shed light on an important application in a class of infinite horizon linear-quadratic (LQ for short) Stackelberg games in which the control process of leader&#39;s is constrained in a closed convex subset Γ 1 of full space R m 1 . Whenever the control domain is postulated to be full space, we derive a new kind of infinite horizon backward stochastic Riccati equation (BSRE for short) with asymmetric coefficients.},

Unlike the periodic DoS jamming attacks strategy, the occurrence of DoS jamming attacks is irregular in this article, where attack attributes such as attack frequency and attack ratio are uncertain. Moreover, compared with some existing related results considering fixed undirected topologies, the communication topologies may change due to DoS jamming attacks in this work. In view of this, based on the piecewise Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the consensus problem of the MASs can be solved.

  abstract     = {A novel parameter-dependent anti-windup compensator is developed to improve the performance of a constrained model reference adaptive controller. The combined control structure solves the input saturation and stability problem for inertia-varying quadcopters. The control synthesis follows the conventional two-step anti-windup design paradigm where a nominal controller is designed without consideration of input saturation while the anti-windup compensator is designed to minimise deviations from nominal performance caused by saturated inputs. To account for the varying inertia of the quadcopter during package retrieval/delivery routines, inertia parameters of the vehicle/package are estimated with an online recursive identification technique. These estimates are used by the model reference adaptive controller and to schedule the parameter-dependent anti-windup compensator. Anti-windup performance and stability conditions are formulated as a set of parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities, which when solved, yield a gain-scheduled anti-windup compensator that ensures stability and minimises deviation from nominal performance when saturation occurs. The effectiveness of the combined control scheme is demonstrated by simulations of an input-constrained quadcopter lifting a payload of unknown mass.},

A design strategy based on backstepping is proposed to construct a dynamic output feedback control law, and an output feedback controller is designed using the barrier function.

To approximate the cost function and the event-triggered control law, we present event-triggered-based critic and actor networks, whose weights are updated only at triggered instants.

Nonlinear identification of self-excited systems is considered using a Lur&#39;e model structure, where a linear model is connected in feedback with a nonlinear feedback function. To facilitate identification, the nonlinear feedback function is assumed to be continuous and piecewise affine (CPA). The present paper uses least-squares optimisation to estimate the coefficients of the linear dynamics and the slope vector of the CPA nonlinearity, as well as mixed-integer optimisation to estimate the order of the linear dynamics and the breakpoints of the CPA function. The proposed identification technique requires only output data, and thus no measurement of the constant input is required.

To eliminate the effect coming from the immeasurable state variable, a new adaptive state observer method is developed for backstepping design by employing a neural network (NN) approximation strategy. As one of the highlighting contributions, the observer method can be performed with the relaxed condition because it does not require the design parameters to satisfy the Hurwitz equation, therefore it can be more easily applied and extended to serve for nonlinear system control than the existing observer methods. Finally, by integrating the observer dynamic into the backstepping design, the adaptive tracking control is achieved. Lastly, the feasibility of the method is proved by both stability theory and computer simulation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a technique for tuning PI controllers with symmetric send-on-delta (SSOD) sampling, using three measurements taken from the step response. The tuning procedure is based on a previously published experimental PI tuning method developed for standard sampling and the adaptation of this method to the SSOD sampling case. It is well known that the SSOD sampling strategy may induce permanent oscillations in the closed loop if the controller is not designed properly. The proposed approach avoids those oscillations through fixing some limitations in the tuning parameters using only the experimental step response measurements as input data. The result is an experimental PI tuning method, based on three simple measurements in the step response, that guarantees the absence of oscillations when SSOD sampling is used in the loop.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the robustness of discrete PI controllers when used with a Symmetric-Send-On-Delta (SSOD) sampling law is addressed. Hitherto, the continuous Describing Function has been employed as a suitable tool to evaluate the robustness of such systems to limit cycle oscillations induced by the SSOD. However, due to the discrete implementation of the controllers in most of the actual applications, the Sampled Describing Function technique is used in this work to provide a more realistic approach, which takes into account the effect of both the SSOD and sampling period of the discrete controller on inducing such oscillation. A simple measure has been developed to characterise the robustness of these systems and it has been tested through several examples, showing its validity in predicting the apparition or avoidance of limit cycles. This measure has been used to evaluate the robustness of some spread tuning rules applied to a wide batch of systems reflecting the dynamics of most processes in the industry.},

Normalised controlled process models and controllers are used for control system design. Optimal – robustness free – and optimal robust PID regulators parameters are found. A Near-Optimal Robust tuning rule (NORpid) for PID controllers based on high-order RPPDT models is obtained and applied to the control system of an eighth-order process.

The n -shifting approach allows the calculation of n + 1 points of G ( s ) by an asymmetric relay experiment. This set of n points is composed of G (0), G ( jω osc ), … , G ( jnω osc ), being ω osc the oscillation frequency, and where G ( jω osc ) is in most cases located in the third quadrant of the Nyquist map. By delaying the relay output and repeating a similar experiment it can be generated n additional points of G ( s ) where the first point is G ( jω’ osc ) with 0 &lt; ω’ osc &lt; ω osc . In this way, it is possible to depict the full output spectrum of G ( s ) from zero to very high frequencies by a short relay experiment. An example of identification and tuning of a PID controller with data from the n -shifting are presented to show the validity of the approach.},

In particular, a (possibly high-order) model of the process is obtained by means of a relay-feedback test. Then, the four parameters of the controller are determined by approximating the general feedback internal model controller with a truncated Maclaurin series. In this context, the user can select a parameter that determines the speed of the response of the closed-loop system and implicitly handles the trade-off between aggressiveness and robustness. It is shown that the additional acceleration action allows an improvement of the performance with respect to a traditional proportional-integral-derivative controller and represents an effective solution for the control of high-order systems.},

Parameters of the controller are obtained by solving the constrained optimisation problem. We propose two variants of the optimality criterion. The first one is defined through the max–min optimisation problem wherein objective function is the amplitude frequency response of the PIDC controller. The second one is based on an effective approximation of the minimum value of the amplitude frequency response of the PIDC controller. Consequently, we obtain a computationally less expensive problem. Both variants of optimality criterion result in efficient load disturbance and noise rejection, while robustness is ensured by constraining the value of the maximum sensitivity Ms. Good reference shaping is supported with proper constraints based on the Amplitude Optimum (AO) principle. Numerous batches of processes typically encountered in the industry are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.},

The tuning strategy is based on the concept of fixed robustness tuning line, in which the derivative filter parameter is a key point in finding the compromise between control effort due to noise and performance. The approach allows to find the controller that optimises the performance while fulfils a prescribed robustness constraint and a permitted control effort due to noise. The tuning procedure has been implemented in a software tool that can be freely downloaded from https://sites.google.com/a/uji.es/freepidtools/ . The robustness can be defined in three different ways, involving the phase margin, the gain margin and the sensitivity peak. The performance can be defined in several ways, including the IAE, ITAE, ISE and other. Some examples show the validity of the approach and the use of the tool.},

  abstract     = {Feedforward control can be considered as the most well-known control approach to deal with measurable disturbances. It started to be used almost 100 years ago, and since then it is being used in most industrial processes. It is a very simple technique that has been used typically as a complement to PID control, although it can be combined with any feedback controller. The feedforward control design has traditionally been performed assuming perfect cancellation of the disturbance signal, and when this solution was not possible because of non-realisable problems, static design solutions were usually implemented. In the last decade, this issue has been researched and analysed, and new designs for feedforward control have appeared to face these problems. As a result, a set of new simple tuning rules have been obtained providing considerable improvements in the control system performance. This paper presents a summary of these contributions and a short history of feedforward control.},
