Our algorithm builds a funnel tree by level, to compute such shortest paths. The funnel tree is built by recursively splitting funnels, which are generated as described by An [ Optimization , 2018]. Because their left borders are straightest geodesics, funnels are determined explicitly by the law of cosines. Known approaches such as the planar unfolding technique, source images, or projections of ones are avoided in our algorithm. Although these approaches also run in O ( n 2 ) time in the worst case, our algorithm outperforms the others in practice. Some numerical examples are presented.},

We present primal characterizations of the stability of these error bounds under small perturbations. These characterizations are expressed through the directional derivatives of the functions that define the systems. It is shown that ensuring stability of the error bounds is closely tied to verifying that the optimal values of several minimax problems, formulated using the directional derivatives, remain outside a certain neighbourhood of zero. Furthermore, this stability condition only requires that all component functions of the system share the same linear perturbation. When applied to the sensitivity analysis of Hoffman&#39;s constants for semi-infinite linear systems, these stability results yield primal criteria that guarantee the uniform boundedness of Hoffman&#39;s constants under perturbations in the problem data.},

Quasi-near convexity is associated with the quasi-relative interior of sets, which is investigated in the paper together with other generalized relative interior notions for sets, not necessarily convex. In this way, we obtain new results on generalized relative interiors for graphs of set-valued mappings in convexity and generalized convexity settings.},

A common application is in numerical weather prediction where a previous forecast and atmospheric observations are used to obtain the initial conditions for a numerical weather forecast. In four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var), the problem is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem, usually solved using a variant of the classical Gauss-Newton (GN) method. However, we show that GN may not converge if poorly initialized. In particular, we show that this may occur when there is greater uncertainty in the background information compared to the observations, or when a long time-window is used in 4D-Var allowing more observations. The difficulties GN encounters may lead to inaccurate initial state conditions for subsequent forecasts. To overcome this, we apply two convergent GN variants (line search and regularization) to the long time-window 4D-Var problem and investigate the cases where they locate a more accurate estimate compared to GN within a given budget of computational time and cost. We show that these methods are able to improve the estimate of the initial state, which may lead to a more accurate forecast. Highlights},

The purpose of including the pseudo-monotone map is to encompass generalized derivatives of certain nonconvex locally Lipschitz functionals as a specific instance. Consequently, the considered evolutionary quasi-variational inequalities subsume evolutionary quasi-hemi-variational inequalities as a particular case. We present an existence result wherein the key novelty lies in the variational selection that separates the monotone and pseudo-monotone components, thus eliminating the conventional assumption that their sum is monotone. While we continue to employ the Minty formulation, its necessity is limited to evolutionary monotone variational inequalities alone. Furthermore, we offer new applications to optimal control problems governed by evolutionary quasi-variational inequalities.},

Two known results are obtained as particular cases, both with proofs being easier than the original ones: The existence of solutions of bounded polyhedral convex set optimization problems and a characterization of the existence of solutions of vector linear programs.},

[Sharp estimates and saturation phenomena for a nonlocal eigenvalue problem. Adv Math (N Y). 2011;228(4):2352‚Äì2365.]. The saturation problem is formulated in terms of the first eigenvalue of the perturbation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator by the integral of the unknown function: the first eigenvalue increases with the weight affecting the integral up to a finite critical value and then remains constant, i.e. it saturates. Given a Riemannian manifold with certain curvature constraints, by using symmetrization arguments and sharp isoperimetric inequalities, we reduce the general problem to a variational one, formulated on either positively or negatively curved Riemannian model spaces; in addition, the possible scenarios for the optimal domains turn to be either geodesic balls or the union of two disjoint geodesic balls. We then explicitly compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in terms of the radii, curvature and weight. A sufficient condition (incompatibility of a system of nonlinear equations involving special functions) is given that implies similar saturation phenomena to the Euclidean case. Due to its highly nonlinear character of the reduced problem (arising from the presence of curvature and special functions), we provide only partial answers to the original problem. However, both analytical computations and numerical tests suggest that the required incompatibility always persists. In addition, in the limit cases when the curvature tends to zero (for both positive an negative curvature), our results reduce to the Euclidean version.},

A standard method to induce the sparsity of the solution is based on the use of the ‚Ñì 0 ‚Ñì 0 ‚Ñì0 norm in the objective. However, if the underlying optimization problem is nonlinear, the solution of the nonlinear (sparse) ‚Ñì 0 -optimization problem is difficult. Therefore, it is often approximated using the convex ‚Ñì 1 -norm although this can lead to suboptimal solutions for the sparsity of the solution. In this paper, we follow another direction. We present exact reformulations (with respect to the ‚Ñì 0 norm) and their relaxations leading to standard nonlinear but nonconvex programmes. We discuss and relate the relations between the different reformulations with repect to the original problem.

The Blankenship and Falk algorithm adaptively chooses a small discretization. On every iteration, a solution based on the current discretization is calculated. In a second step, the most violated constraint is determined and added to the discretization. In a previous work, the authors showed that the algorithm has a slow convergence and introduced a new method that exhibits a quadratic rate¬†[Seidel and K√ºfer, An adaptive discretization method solving semi-infinite optimization problems with quadratic rate of convergence. Optimization. 2022;71(8):2211‚Äì2239]. In this paper, we further investigate the introduced method. The method implements new constraints that can cut off parts of the feasible set. We will study the effect on local minima. We assume that in each iteration local solutions to the discretized problems are computed. We will give an example showing that in general a limit point is not necessarily a local solution of the original semi-infinite problem, but only of an approximate problem. We then study second-order conditions and show that they coincide for both problems. We use this to develop conditions under which local solutions converge to a local solution in the limit. Finally, we present quadratic convergence results for the case of local solutions.},

Their M-index and T-index, respectively, which uniquely determine the global and local structure of optimization problems under consideration in algebraic terms, are traced. As novelty, we suggest to regularize the continuous reformulation for this purpose. The main consequence of our analysis is that the number of saddle points of the regularized continuous reformulation grows exponentially as compared to that of the initial cardinality-constrained optimization problem. This growth appears to be inherent and is reproduced in other relaxation attempts.},

As a starting point, different value-function-type reformulations are suggested and their relations are discussed. Here, we focus on the situations where the lower-level problem is solved up to efficiency or weak efficiency, and an intermediate solution concept is suggested as well. We study the graph-closedness of the associated efficiency-type and frontier-type mappings. These findings are then used for two purposes. First, we investigate existence results in multiobjective bilevel optimization. Second, for the derivation of necessary optimality conditions via the value function approach, it is inherent to differentiate frontier-type mappings in a generalized way. Here, we are concerned with the computation of upper coderivative estimates for the frontier-type mapping associated with the setting where the lower-level problem is solved up to weak efficiency. We proceed in two ways, relying, on the one hand, on a weak domination property and, on the other hand, on a scalarization approach. Illustrative examples visualize our findings and some flaws in the related literature.},

The first one, closely related to simultaneous projections, deals with a finite amount of convex sets with an empty intersection and tackles the problem of finding the smallest perturbations (in the sense of translations) of these sets to reach a nonempty intersection. The second is focussed on the distance to feasibility; specifically, given an inconsistent convex inequality system, our goal is to compute/estimate the smallest right-hand side perturbations that reach feasibility.

  abstract     = {The Nelson‚ÄìSiegel and the Svensson models are two widely used models for the term structure of interest rates. These models are quite simple and intuitive, but fitting them to market data is numerically challenging and various difficulties have been reported. In this paper, we provide a novel mathematical analysis of the fitting problem based on parametric optimization. We formulate the fitting problem as a separable nonlinear least-squares problem, in which the linear parameters can be eliminated. We provide a thorough discussion on the conditioning of the inner part of the reformulated problem and show that many of the reported difficulties encountered when solving it are inherent to the problem formulation itself and cannot be tackled by choosing a particular optimization algorithm. Our stability analysis provides novel insights that we use to show that some of the ill-conditioning can be avoided, and that a suitably chosen penalty approach can be used to address the remaining ill-conditioning. Numerical results indicate that this approach has the expected impact while being independent of any choice of a particular optimization algorithm. We further establish smoothness properties of the reduced objective function, putting global optimization methods for the reduced problem on a sound mathematical basis.},

  abstract     = {As we know, the stepsize is extremely crucial to gradient method. A new type of stepsize is introduced for the gradient method in the paper, which is generated by minimizing the norm of the approximate model of the gradient along the line of negative gradient direction. Based on the retard technique, we present a new gradient method by minimizing adaptively the approximate model of the objective function and the norm of the approximate model of the gradient along the line of negative gradient direction for strictly convex quadratic minimization. The convergence of the proposed method is established. The numerical experiments on four groups of strictly convex quadratic minimization problems illustrate that the proposed method is very promising. We also extend the new gradient method for convex quadratic minimization to general unconstrained optimization by incorporating a nonmonotone line search. The convergence of the resulting method is established. The numerical experiment on the 147 test functions from the CUTEst library indicates that the resulting method is superior to some efficient gradient methods including the BBQ method (SIAM J Optim. 2021;31(4):3068‚Äì3096) and is competitive to two famous conjugate gradient software packages CGOPT (1.0) and CG _ DESCENT (5.0).},

The first proposed trust-region algorithm uses a modified maximum nonmonotone technique, which takes a convex combination of the maximum value of some preceding successful iterates and the function value in the current iterate. The second one employs the average nonmonotone technique, which takes a weighted average of the successive function values. Under some suitable assumptions, the convergence of the sequences generated by the trust-region algorithms that use the aforementioned nonmonotone techniques to a critical point is shown. Using some well-known test problems, we compare our proposed adaptive nonmonotone MO algorithms with some other MO trust-region algorithms. To conduct a thorough comparison in this regard, some performance criteria are used. These numerical results confirm a significant advantage of applying the proposed adaptive nonmonotone trust-region algorithms in solving MO problems. Finally, the proposed algorithms are implemented to optimize one of the optimization problems of the abrasive water-jet machining process.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the tensor sparse principal component analysis (TSPCA) by obtaining principal components which are linear combinations of a small subset of the original features for tensorial data. The core mathematical model can be formulated as a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem with a polynomial objective function, and with the sparsity constraint and the unit Euclidean spherical constraint. By employing the tools in tensor analysis, along with the variational properties for the involved ‚Ñì 0 -norm, the optimality condition of TSPCA is analysed in terms of stationary points. To well resolve the problem, we reformulate the stationary conditions into the Lagrange stationary equation system via the property of the projection operator onto the sparsity constraint set. With special emphasis on the Jacobian nonsingularity of the corresponding nonlinear system, we propose the Lagrange‚ÄìNewton algorithm for pursuing the stationary point, which serves as a promising approximation of the optimal solution to TSPCA. The locally quadratic convergence rate is also established under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed TSPCA approach in terms of the solution accuracy as well as the computation time.},

Since the optimal solution of distributionally robust optimization is required to be feasible for all uncertain distributions in a given ambiguity distribution set and so the conservativeness of the optimal solution is inevitable. To address this issue, we introduce the globalized distributionally robust counterpart (GDRC) which allows constraint violations controlled by functional distance of the true distribution to the inner distribution set. We obtain the deterministic equivalent forms for several GDRCs under the moment-based framework. To be specific, we show the deterministic equivalent systems of inequalities for GDRCs under second order moment information with a separable convex distance function and a special jointly convex function, respectively. We also obtain the deterministic equivalent inequality for GDRC under first order moment and support information. The computationally tractable examples are presented for these GDRCs. Numerical tests of a portfolio optimization problem are given to show the effectiveness of our method and the results demonstrate that the globalized distributionally robust solution is non-conservative and flexible compared to the distributionally robust solution.},

In the optimal control problem, we have defined the stochastic and deterministic cost functions and we have proved the problems have unique optimal controls.

We have proved the stochastic model of tumour growth and the stochastic adjoint equations have unique solutions.

Specifically, we show that the average-iterates almost sure convergence rate of the function values for Prox-SGD is arbitrarily close to the optimal rate o ( 1 / T ) in the convex setting. For strongly convex objective functions, we obtain the almost sure convergence rate of the iterative sequence, which is also arbitrarily close to the optimal rate o ( 1 / T ) .

In this paper, we develop a nonconvex optimization algorithm customized to SVD-free RPCA models. The proposed algorithm, which is built upon proximal alternating linearized minimization Bolte et¬†al. [Proximal alternating linearized minimization for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems. Math Program. 2014;146(1‚Äì2):459‚Äì494], can reduce computational efforts by partially linearizing data fidelity and increase efficiency by leveraging inertial techniques. Under the Kurdyka-≈Åojasiewicz assumption on the objective function and some mild premises on stepsizes, the sequence produced by the proposed algorithm converges globally to a critical point of SVD-free RPCA models.

  abstract     = {Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for cancer is considered to be effective when dealing with complicated tumour shapes because the dose distribution for each irradiation can be modulated. Fluence map optimization is often formulated as an optimization problem with dose volume constraints (DVCs). A linear programming (LP) method that approximated DVCs was proposed, and it was modified to the successive LP method (SLPM) to find a feasible treatment plan in a wider region. In the present paper, we propose a numerical method called SLPM-R (the SLPM with robustness) that enhances the SLPM using a robust optimization approach. We mathematically prove that the proposed method with extended LP problems has the favourable properties of the SLPM, even taking uncertainty in the influence matrix into consideration. In particular, when the optimal value of the LP problem is non-positive, the proposed SLPM-R guarantees that the output solution can satisfy all DVCs. Through numerical experiments, we observed that the proposed method found a feasible plan that the SLPM could not find. In addition, for a test case that even the SLPM-R failed, the largest deviations of 5.65 Gray in the SLPM was reduced to 3.15 Gray by the SLPM-R.},

The purpose of this paper is to study the convergences in regimes of moderate deviations for the SAA solution. Using the delta method and the exponential approximation, we establish some results on moderate deviations. We apply the results to the hypotheses testing for the SVIs, and prove that the rejection region constructed by the central limit theorem has the probability of the type II error with exponential decay speed. We also give some simulations and numerical results for the tail probabilities.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider finite sum composite optimization problems with many functional constraints. The objective function is expressed as a finite sum of two terms, one of which admits easy computation of (sub)gradients while the other is amenable to proximal evaluations. We assume a generalized bounded gradient condition on the objective which allows us to simultaneously tackle both smooth and nonsmooth problems. We also consider the cases of both with and without a quadratic functional growth property. Further, we assume that each constraint set is given as the level set of a convex but not necessarily a differentiable function. We reformulate the constrained finite sum problem into a stochastic optimization problem for which the stochastic subgradient projection method from Necoara and Singh [Stochastic subgradient projection methods for composite optimization with functional constraints; 2022 Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23, 1‚Äì35] specializes in a collection of mini-batch variants, with different mini-batch sizes for the objective function and functional constraints, respectively. More specifically, at each iteration, our algorithm takes a mini-batch stochastic proximal subgradient step aimed at minimizing the objective function and then a subsequent mini-batch subgradient projection step minimizing the feasibility violation. By specializing in different mini-batching strategies, we derive exact expressions for the stepsizes as a function of the mini-batch size and in some cases we also derive insightful stepsize-switching rules which describe when one should switch from a constant to a decreasing stepsize regime. We also prove sublinear convergence rates for the mini-batch subgradient projection algorithm which depend explicitly on the mini-batch sizes and on the properties of the objective function. Numerical results also show a better performance of our mini-batch scheme over its single-batch counterpart.},

This structure gives it some advantage over the earlier proposed methods. However, it only provides weak convergence, in general. Our aim in this paper is to improve the forward-reflected-backward splitting method in order to obtain strong convergence. To this end, we first study a regularized variational inclusion problem of finding the zero of the sum of two monotone operators. We then propose a regularized forward-reflected-backward splitting method for approximating a solution to the problem and prove the strong convergence of our iterative scheme under some suitable assumptions on the parameters. Moreover, we show that our algorithm has the bounded perturbation resilience property. Furthermore, we apply our results to convex minimization, split feasibility, split variational inclusion, and image deblurring problems, and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with several numerical examples.},

Moreover, a new initial step-size strategy is used to accelerate IPCA. The global convergence of the sequence generated by IPCA is established.

The paper attempts to fill the gap in the work of Hager and Zhang [Pac J Optim. 2006;2(1):35‚Äì58], Waziri et¬†al. [Appl Math Comput. 2019;361:645‚Äì660], Sabi&#39;u et¬†al.

The proposed schemes are also suitable for solving non-smooth nonlinear problems. Also, by employing some mild conditions, global convergence of the schemes are established, while numerical comparison with four effective HZ-type methods show that the new methods are efficient. Furthermore, to illustrate their practical application, both methods are applied to solve the ‚Ñì 1 -norm regularization problems to recover a sparse signal in compressive sensing. The experiments conducted in that regard show that the methods are promising and perform better than two other methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In robust single-objective optimization, the robustness gap is a measure of the distance between the robust optimal objective value and the optimal objective values of the scenarios. While robust multiobjective optimization is a growing field of study, no notion of a robustness gap has been proposed. A concept of a point-based robustness gap for uncertain multiobjective optimization problems is introduced. The gap is defined as the minimal distance between the robust Pareto set and the Pareto sets of the scenarios. It is shown that the gap is zero whenever the uncertainty is constraint-wise and objective-wise, supplementing a major result about the single-objective robustness gap. Because the distance between Pareto sets is hard to compute, lower and upper bounds on the gap are constructed for convex problems. Specific results about the zero gap and the bounds are presented for linear problems. Numerical examples are included.},

The presented method relies on piecewise constant iterates. In each iteration, the algorithm alternates between proposing a new point at which the iterate is allowed to be discontinuous and optimizing the magnitude of its jumps as well as the offset. A sublinear O ( 1 / k ) convergence rate for the objective function values is obtained in general settings. Under additional structural assumptions on the dual variable, this can be improved to a locally linear rate of convergence O ( Œ∂ k ) for some Œ∂ &lt; 1 . Moreover, in this case, the same rate can be expected for the iterates in L 1 ( I ; R d ) .},

  abstract     = {Static robust optimization has played an important role in radiotherapy, where the decisions aim to safeguard against all possible realizations of uncertainty. However, it may lead to overly conservative decisions or too expensive treatment plans, such as delivering significantly more dose than necessary. Motivated by the success of adjustable robust optimization in reducing highly conservative decision-making of static robust optimization in applications, in this paper, we present an affinely adjustable robust optimization (AARO) model for hypoxia-based radiation treatment planning in the face of evolving data uncertainty. We establish an exact semi-definite program reformulation of the model under a so-called affine decision rule and evaluate our model and approach on a liver cancer case as a proof-of-concept. Our AARO model incorporates uncertainties both in dose influence matrix and re-oxygenation data as well as inexactness of the revealed (re-oxygenation) data. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the adjustable model successfully handles uncertainty in both re-oxygenation and the dose matrix. They also show that, by utilizing information halfway through the treatment plan, the adjustable solutions of the AARO model outperform a static method while maintaining a similar total dose.},

This problem has drawn much attention in recent years. While existing works focuses on the case of g being monotone, we investigate the problem with a nonmonotone g . The main technique we use is to introduce a distorted objective function, which varies weights of the submodular component g and the modular component ‚Ñì during the iterations of the algorithm. By combining the weighting technique and measured continuous greedy algorithm, we present an algorithm for the matroid-constrained problem, which has a provable approximation guarantee. In the cardinality-constrained case, we utilize random greedy algorithm and sampling technique together with the weighting technique to design two efficient algorithms. Moreover, we consider the unconstrained problem and propose a much simpler and faster algorithm compared with the algorithms for solving the problem with a cardinality constraint.},

Our methods have simple and elegant structures, and they require only one Bregman projection onto the feasible set and one evaluation of the cost operator at each iteration. We prove that these methods converge weakly when the cost operator is pseudomonotone on the entire space and that they converge strongly when the cost operator is strongly pseudomonotone only on the feasible set. Extensions of our proposed methods to mixed variational inequality problems are also given. Finally, we consider some examples regarding the implementation of our methods in comparisons with known methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In developing iterative methods for approximating solutions of optimization problems, one of the major goals of researchers is to construct efficient iterative schemes. Over the years, different techniques have been devised by authors to achieve this goal. In this paper, we study a non-Lipschitz pseudomonotone variational inequality problem with common fixed points constraint of Bregman quasi-nonexpansive mappings. We introduce a new iterative method for approximating the solution of this problem in a more general framework of reflexive Banach spaces. Our method employs several techniques to achieve high level of efficiency. One of the techniques employed is the S-iteration process, a method known to be highly efficient in comparison with several of the well-known methods. Moreover, our proposed algorithm utilizes the inertial technique and a non-monotonic self-adaptive step size to guarantee high rate of convergence and easy implementation. Unlike several of the existing results on variational inequality problem with non-Lipschitz operator, the design of our method does not involve any linesearch technique. We obtain strong convergence result for the proposed algorithm without the sequentially weakly continuity condition often assumed by authors to guarantee convergence when solving pseudomonotone variational inequality problems. Furthermore, we apply our result to study utility-based bandwidth allocation problem and image restoration problem. Finally, we present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. Our result extends and improves several of the recently announced results in this direction in the literature.},

It is shown that the augmented Lagrangian method can generate limit points satisfying DCAKKT, and it is proved that such a condition is not related to previously established sequential optimality conditions. An essential characteristic of the DCAKKT is to capture the asymptotic potential increasing of the Lagrange multipliers using a single parameter. Besides that, DCAKKT points satisfy the Strong Approximate Gradient Projection¬†(SAGP) condition. Due to the intrinsic features of DCAKKT, which combine strength and generality, this novel and genuine sequential optimality condition may shed some light upon the practical performance of algorithms that are yet to be devised.},

Our aim is to present a detailed study of various theoretical properties of exact augmented Lagrangians and discuss several applications of these functions to constrained variational problems, problems with PDE constraints, and optimal control problems. The first paper is devoted to a theoretical analysis of an exact augmented Lagrangian for optimization problems in Hilbert spaces. We obtain several useful estimates of this augmented Lagrangian and its gradient, and present several types of sufficient conditions for KKT-points of a constrained problem corresponding to locally/globally optimal solutions to be local/global minimizers of the exact augmented Lagrangian.},

The reformulated optimization problem is defined over a vector space, whereby we can apply directly powerful computational arts designed for optimization over a vector space. The proposed Cayley-type transform enjoys several key properties which are useful to (i) study relations between the original problem and the proposed problem; (ii) check the conditions to guarantee the global convergence of optimization algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard algorithms designed with a retraction on the Stiefel manifold.},

They presented a closed form of the dual formulation for the problem, and showed weak duality and the equivalence to the Lagrangian dual under some conditions. In this work, we focus on a special positively homogeneous optimization problem, whose objective function and constraints consist of some gauge and linear functions. We prove not only weak duality but also strong duality. We also study necessary and sufficient optimality conditions associated to the problem. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions under which we can recover a primal solution from a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the dual formulation. Finally, we discuss how to extend the above results to general optimization problems by considering the so-called perspective functions.},

The constrained control model considers costs of discounted type with state-dependent discount factors which are subject to external disturbances. Our objective is to prove the existence of optimal control policies and characterize them according to certain optimality criteria. Specifically, by rewriting appropriately our original constrained problem as a new one on a space of occupation measures, we apply the direct method to show solvability. Next, the problem is defined as a convex program, and we prove that the existence of a saddle point of the associated Lagrangian operator is equivalent to the existence of an optimal control policy for the constrained problem. Finally, we turn our attention to multi-objective optimization problems, where the existence of Pareto optimal policies can be obtained from the existence of saddle-points of the aforementioned Lagrangian or equivalently from the existence of optimal control policies of constrained problems.},

First, we define Nicoletti-type problem with discrete inclusions, formulate optimality conditions for it and, based on the concept of infimal convolution, dual problems. Then, using the auxiliary discrete-approximate problem, we construct dual problems for Nicoletti DFIs and prove the duality theorems. Here, for the transition to the continuous problem, some results on the equivalence of locally adjoint mappings and support functions to the graph of set-valued mapping are proved. It turns out that the Euler‚ÄìLagrange type inclusions are ‚Äò duality relations‚Äô for both primal and dual problems, which means that a pair consisting of solutions to the primal and dual problems satisfies this extremal relation and vice versa. Finally, as an appication of the results obtained, we consider the first-order Nicoletti BVP with polyhedral DFIs.},

Weak and strong convergence results are obtained under some mild conditions. We also give linear convergence results under a special case of our proposed method.

Combining the pre-order principle and generalized Gerstewitz functions, we establish a general equilibrium version of set-valued Ekeland variational principle (denoted by EVP), where the objective function is a set-valued bimap defined on the product of quasi-metric spaces and taking values in a quasi-ordered linear space, and the perturbation consists of a subset of the ordering cone multiplied by the quasi-metric. From this, we obtain a number of new results which essentially improve the related results. Particularly, the earlier lower boundedness condition has been weakened.

Under suitable assumptions on the generalized C -convexity, KKT-type robust necessary optimality conditions become robust sufficient optimality conditions.

At the same time, we give a new curvilinear tensor step which guarantees the monotonic decrease on the tensor model. The modified tensor step also asymptotically approaches the modified Newton direction as the step length shrinks to zero, and the objective function of problem will be descendent. Under general assumptions, we give the global and local superlinear convergence of the algorithm.

While many works as for adaptive methods have focused on the static regret as a performance metric to achieve a good regret guarantee, the dynamic regret analyses of these methods remain unclear. As opposed to the static regret, dynamic regret is considered to be a stronger concept of performance measurement in the sense that it explicitly elucidates the non-stationarity of the environment. In this paper, we go through a variant of AdaGrad (referred to as M- AdaGrad ) in a strong convex setting via the notion of dynamic regret, which measures the performance of an online learner against a reference (optimal) solution that may change over time. We demonstrate a regret bound in terms of the path-length of the minimizer sequence that essentially reflects the non-stationarity of environments. In addition, we enhance the dynamic regret bound by exploiting the multiple accesses of the gradient to the learner in each round. Empirical results indicate that M- AdaGrad works also well in practice.},

Meanwhile, the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is established under mild conditions. To overcome the difficulty in the calculation for the resolvent of the composite operator, relying on a primal-dual idea, we expand the proposed algorithm to solve the composite inclusion problem involving a linearly composed monotone operator. As an application, we make use of the obtained inertial algorithm to deal with a composite convex optimization problem. We also show extensive numerical experiments on the total variation-based image deblurring problem to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a nonsmooth/nonconvex multiobjective optimization problem with uncertain constraints in arbitrary Asplund spaces. We first provide necessary optimality condition in a fuzzy form for approximate weakly robust efficient solutions and then establish necessary optimality theorem for approximate weakly robust quasi-efficient solutions of the problem in the sense of the limiting subdifferential by exploiting a fuzzy optimality condition in terms of the Fr√©chet subdifferential. Sufficient conditions for approximate (weakly) robust quasi-efficient solutions to such a problem are also driven under the new concept of generalized pseudo convex functions. Finally, we address an approximate Mond-Weir-type dual robust problem to the reference problem and explore weak, strong, and converse duality properties under assumptions of pseudo convexity.},

Given a set of finitely many polynomials, we show that there are only finitely many continuous selections of it and each one is semi-algebraic. Then, we establish some generic properties regarding the critical points, defined by the Clarke subdifferential, of these continuous selections. In particular, given a set of finitely many polynomials with generic coefficients, we show that the critical points of all continuous selections of it are finite and the critical values are all different, and we also derive the coercivity of those continuous selections which are bounded from below. We point out that some existing results about ≈Åojasiewicz&#39;s inequality and error bounds for the maximum function of some finitely many polynomials can be extended to all the continuous selections of them.},

Our convergence analysis of the enclosures relies on constructions from the above paper, but is self-contained and also covers the mixed-integer case. The analysis for the provisional nondominated set is based on general convergence properties of the epsilon-nondominated set, and hence it is also applicable to other algorithms which generate such points. Furthermore, we discuss post-processing steps for the terminal enclosure and provide numerical illustrations for the cases of two and three objective functions.},
