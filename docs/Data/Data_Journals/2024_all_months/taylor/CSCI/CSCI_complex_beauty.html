  abstract     = {Patent Entity and Relation Extraction (PERE) aims to extract entities and entity-relation triples from unstructured patent texts. PERE is one of the fundamental tasks in patent text mining, providing crucial technical support for patent retrieval and technology opportunity discovery. Previous works struggle to capture the implicit semantic information hidden within overlapping triples, especially a large number of overlapping triples existing in patent texts. A Patent Entity and Relation Extraction model based on Context query and Axial attention is proposed, named PERE-CA. As for entity recognition, the text segment is regarded as candidate entity span and entity types are acquired by span classification. Subsequently, the semantic context related to an entity pair is calculated by a context query method. And the semantic context is integrated into entity pair representation. For relation extraction, axial attention is implemented to get the implicit semantic information among overlapping entity pairs. And then, the model outputs all valid entity-relation triples. Experimental results on the patent dataset TFH-2020 and the public dataset SciERC demonstrate that the implementation of context query and axial attention can effectively improve extraction performance.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery (MI)-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) frequently use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this study, we proposed a novel methodology that includes an innovative preprocessing step and a new model for MI EEG classification. In the preprocessing, we use common average reference (CAR) filtering and Laplace filtering of EEG signals. The CAR filter eliminates the overall noise and Laplace filter removes the neighbouring electrode noise. Additionally, a sliding window method is used to increases the number of small-time segments which prevents overfitting. Next, the time segments are converted into spectrograms using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Further, the concatenated spectrogram images of mu and beta bands are processed using a CNN model with self-attention. The proposed model uses both local and global information to effectively extract features The EEG signals obtained from BCI competition IV dataset-2a are divided into 80:20 ratio for training and testing. Moreover, the ablation study highlights the importance of the combination of CAR and Laplace filters. The classification results obtained using proposed methodology shows advancement as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the proposed CNN model learning and feature distribution are visualized with the gradient weight class activation map.},

However, there is a need for improve the robustness of smart grid systems. Hence a novel “Secure Smart Grid Implementation with Automatic Data Integrity Attack Location Prediction and Exalted Energy Theft Detection” has been proposed. Current detection methods are not good at identifying data integrity attacks. So a novel Automatic Deterministic Attack Location Prediction Model detects data integrity attacks using a Stacked Watermarking BiGRU-based Deep Deterministic Q network, extracting system matrix and state time series variation. Moreover, Energy theft detection algorithms, which are intended to detect dishonest clients, provide erroneous findings because of linear interpolation processes and randomised near misses, which ignore important data points. Thus a novel Exalted Energy Theft Detector with Secure Encoding is introduced where Amortized Multicode GAN method secures smart grids by detecting energy theft and preventing firmware code modifications, utilising fractional multi-level quantum encoding to identify injection locations. As a result, the proposed model has an accuracy of 97.1%, recall of 96.25%, error rate is 1.36%, F1-score is 96.20%, sensitivity is 96.10%, specificity is 96.10%, MAPE is 0.48%, MSE is 0.0001 and RMSE is 0.017.},

Six models are created to handle the Electricity Price Forecast (EPF). Furthermore, an EPF methodology that consists of a LSTM univariate model, namely Single in–out (Sio) model is proposed. It builds on the Day-Ahead electricity Market (DAM) specificity and, as a novelty, it inserts the predicted value back into the sliding input vector to predict the next values until the entire vector of 24 prices is predicted. The proposed model is further enhanced by the convolutional reading of input data that is embedded into the LSTM cell or by a hybrid combination of LSTM and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that interprets sub-sequences of input data and extracts features that are provided as a sequence to the LSTM model. The methodology is validated using data sets from the Romanian Market Operator (OPCOM) and other market operators from Serbia (SEEPEX), Hungary (HUPX) and Bulgaria (IBEX).

  abstract     = {Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a progressive, debilitating neurological movement disorder that affects the person&#39;s muscle control, movement, speech, cognition and dexterity. For diagnosing PD in a clinical setting, in addition to the neurological examinations, clinicians use the unified Parkinson disease rating scale (UPDRS) to assess the motor and non-motor impairments. Such a clinical assessment highly depends on the experience and expertise of the clinicians, and it may result in biased evaluation. Hence, to assist the clinicians, we put forward a gait analysis-based deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) framework which leverages the potentials of variational mode decomposition (VMD) technique with the recurrence plots (RP) to enhance the PD severity classification performance. Specifically, transforming the VMD modes of vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) time series data into two-dimensional texture images to capture the temporal dependency, this work trains the DCNN classifier through recurrence images for its ability to extract the discriminative features among the PD severity levels. For evaluation, this study utilises the VGRF dataset of 93 PD subjects and 73 healthy controls from Physiobank for three different walking tests. Consequently, utilising VMD, RP and DCNN in a unified framework, this investigation shows that the PD severity rating can be significantly enhanced through DCNN model that is trained using RP of dominant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The novelty of the proposed framework lies in identifying the prominent gait biomarkers through dominant IMFs from power spectral analysis for reducing the computational burden of DCNN. Moreover, to handle the data over-fitting issue in the classifier, L2 regularisation technique, which penalises the weight parameters of the nodes, is used in combination with the dropout layer. Experimental results underscore that the proposed VMD-RP-DCNN architecture can address the spectral overlapping issue in VGRF decomposition and achieve an average PD severity prediction accuracy of 98.45%.},

To securely deploy image services on such devices, this work develops a framework to investigate the key issues relate the most to training robust and lightweight models. The primary issue is about safety. It is well known that the deep learning method is vulnerable to well-designed attacks. To meet the challenge of continuously evolving attacks, we develop a new defensive approach that integrates continual learning and adversarial training to improve the defensive model&#39;s corruption robustness and structure compactness. This approach adopts the structure of a progressive neural model to establish a robust model over time. The second issue is about how to train a lightweight model. Regarding this, we develop another new knowledge distillation approach that integrates both self-distillation and multi-teacher distillation techniques. With such a specially designed student-teacher learning structure and new loss functions, our approach is thus adaptable to different task situations. To verify the proposed framework, we have conducted a series of experiments to evaluate our approach. The results well confirm its functions and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The concept of the Internet of Medical Robotics Things (IoMRT) is where intelligent robots assess surrounding events, combine information from their sensors, use both local and dispersed intelligence to determine the best course of action, and move or command objects. Telesurgery is one application of IoMRT (TS). With 5G-enabled Tactile Internet (TI) enabling telesurgery (TS), there is ample opportunity to provide exceptional, accurate, ultra-responsive, and real-time virtual surgical procedures. The potential for accurate surgical diagnosis involving the exchange of patient electronic medical records (EMR) with several doctors using an assistant robot (AR) could be greatly useful in the medical field. As a part of this, permission delegation has emerged as a novel approach for data sharing in TI. Robust control of access guidelines combined with a configurable permission scheme promise secure EMR exchange. The present research proposes a multi-hop permission delegation strategy for EMR exchange based on blockchain technology and with configurable delegation depth. Furthermore, the original EMRs are stored on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). Permission delegation uses smart contracts and proxy re-encryption technology. Attribute-based encryption, which offers fine-grained management of access, is used to guarantee data security. Blockchain is also utilized to accomplish immutability and traceability. Delegators may regulate the depth of delegation by using smart contracts. The suggested approach satisfies the intended aims, according to analysis of the protocol. Lastly, the Ethereum test chain is used to assess and put the suggested method into practice. The outcomes of the conducted experiments demonstrate that the suggested protocol operates better than the competitors.},

  abstract     = {Due to technological advancements, most devices are generating a significant amount of data which needs appropriate technology to handle the data generated by IoT devices. Fog computing addresses this challenges in a decentralised manner. This paper proposes an efficient resource allocation and management strategies with energy efficiency (ERAM-EE) to effectively allocate available resources in Fog-enabled networks. The ERAM-EE algorithm utilises the channel gain matrix of the interconnected network to assign IoT devices to Fog nodes (FNs) through resource blocks (RBs) with three stages. In the initial stage, one FN is assigned to each IoT device through a single RB by calculating the maximum value of the channel gain. In the subsequent stage, the remaining RBs are assigned to unassigned FNs for future task-offloading processes. Finally, the unassigned RBs are allocated to IoT devices by calculating the maximum channel gain of the Fog–IoT networks. Simulated results indicate that the ERAM-EE scheme confirms that each IoT device is mapped with minimum one FN and RB for effective task scheduling and resource management. Analysis reveals that the ERAM-EE method achieved an increase in EE of up to 7, 8, and 18 Mbit/J compared to existing schemes for varying IoT devices, FNs and RBs respectively.},

  abstract     = {Quantum circuit simulation is a popular approach to evaluating novel quantum algorithms before a physical quantum computer is available. Unfortunately, the simulation is often done with the full-state quantum circuit simulation scheme, and a huge memory space required by a full-state simulator is a limiting factor for the simulation of a larger qubit system. In this work, in order to support the simulation of a broadened qubit system, storage devices are introduced into the full-state quantum circuit simulation. A vertical qubit simulation design is proposed for the storage-based, full-state quantum circuit simulation, including qubit representation, threading model, and parallel state manipulations over storage devices. An empirical method of simulator parameter tuning is developed to achieve higher simulation performance. Our experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art memory-only simulator (QuEST), the storage-based simulation can achieve a 61x higher cost-delay ratio and can simulate a 39-qubit system on a commodity computer. The encouraging results indicate that our proposed simulator can help scale the full-state simulation for larger quantum circuits and achieve higher performance via the performance tuning method.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are widely used in many fields of application, and especially play an essential role in recommendation systems. KGs often need to be complete, missing relationships between users and items, data sparsity, weak associations, and difficulties in knowledge inference, resulting in low credibility of recommendation results. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Graph (KG) recommendation algorithms. Due to the availability of interaction data across numerous events, KGs also exhibit dynamics over time. By taking into account the temporal variable, it is possible to organise well-structured external information to connect users and items, thereby expanding user preferences to a certain extent. The proposed algorithm employs GCNs to encode the heterogeneous graph, which includes user-item interactions and the KG. It addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data by using the inner product of users and items. The algorithm uncovers potential alignment relationships and learns the embedding of user-item and relationships by applying convolutional processing to the graph data&#39;s features and performing data fusion, the new algorithm uncovers potential alignment relationships, and learns embedding of user-item and relationships. The experimental results on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@k demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the credibility and accuracy of recommendation results.},

  abstract     = {While sharding technology helps solve performance bottlenecks in traditional blockchain networks, it also introduces new challenges. Random node allocation may lead to uneven distribution of malicious nodes, causing performance differences and security risks. Existing reputation-based sharding schemes often overlook node performance characteristics and fail to address security concerns related to leader election. In addition, full sharding reorganisation drastically reduces the performance of the entire blockchain, both in terms of overhead and time. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based sharding dynamic reorganisation network sharding scheme, which integrates node performance and behavioural characteristics into the reputation computation, and at the same time adds alternative leaders to maintain the stability of the sharding system. Based on this, through the partial reorganisation algorithm of the sharding, the nodes are reasonably allocated to balance the computing power of each shard, effectively stimulating the liveness of the sharding system and improving overall safety and performance. Simulation results show that this sharding scheme effectively reduces the consensus failure probability, solves the collusion attack problem caused by the aggregation of malicious nodes within shards, and reduces the latency of the blockchain system. This provides strong support for the reliability and performance of the blockchain sharding system.},

Medical datasets are often highly imbalanced and may contain irrelevant features that hinder predictive performance. To address these challenges in the medical data analysis, we propose a model employing Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), which also accounts for outliers that could otherwise lead to the inclusion of irrelevant features. Unlike standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is sensitive to the initial positions of cluster centers influencing the final outcome, our model integrates FPCA with K-Means clustering to improve the preprocessing stage. Additionally, we have incorporated the post-hoc explanatory method SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) alongside algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM to provide deeper insights into our model, identifying the most contributory features for the development of hyperinsulinemia. Experimental results showed that combining FPCA with K-Means clustering enhances the accuracy of the XGBoost classifier, with this model achieving an accuracy score of 0.99.},

  abstract     = {The canonical video action recognition methods usually label categories with numbers or one-hot vectors and train neural networks to classify a fixed set of predefined categories, thereby constraining their ability to recognise complex actions and transferable ability to unseen concepts. In contrast, cross-modal learning can improve the performance of individual modalities. Based on the facts that a better action recogniser can be built by reading the statements used to describe actions, we exploited the recent multimodal foundation model CLIP for action recognition. In this study, an effective Vision-Language action recognition adaptation was implemented based on few-shot examples spanning different modalities. We added semantic information to action categories by treating textual and visual label as training examples for action classifier construction rather than simply labelling them with numbers. Due to the different importance of words in text and video frames, simply averaging all sequential features may result in ignoring keywords or key video frames. To capture sequential and hierarchical representation, a weighted token-wise interaction mechanism was employed to exploit the pair-wise correlations adaptively. Extensive experiments with public datasets show that cross-modal action recognition learning helps for downstream action images classification, in other words, the proposed method can train better action classifiers by reading the sentences describing action itself. The method proposed in this study not only reaches good generalisation and zero-shot/few-shot transfer ability on Out of Distribution (OOD) test sets, but also performs lower computational complexity due to the lightweight interaction mechanism with 84.15% Top-1 accuracy on the Kinetics-400.},

Secondly, we categorise the existing SQL query schemes into three categories: software-based construction, hardware-based construction, and hybrid-based construction, that is, a combination of software and hardware components. On this basis, we analyse the framework, advantages, and limitations of classic and state-of-the-art schemes. Finally, we summarise the software-based and hardware-based approaches from dimensions of SQL functionality, security, and efficiency, thus clarifying their ideal application scenarios. Notably, SQL query schemes that exhibit minimal equality of pair leakage and support strong obliviousness can achieve higher levels of security. In addition, hardware-based solutions can achieve more complex SQL queries and superior performance without designing complex and functionally-limited cryptographic tools.},

The Fully Convolutional One-Stage (FCOS) object detection algorithm was used as baseline. First, the dynamic convolution module was designed in the backbone network to identify different object features to the maximum extent. Second, a dual attention module was designed to filter object feature information while reducing the amount of computation. Finally, in the detection part, the feature expression ability of shallow network was further enhanced by multi-scale feature fusion module, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified using Cityscapes dataset. The experimental result indicated that mAP increased by 2.3% compared with baseline.

The diffusion model can generate high-quality images for clearer and more discriminative faces, but its training and inference time is often prolonged, hampering practical application. Latent space diffusion models have shown promise in speeding up training by leveraging feature space parameters, but they require additional network structures. To address these limitations, we propose a contour wavelet diffusion model that accelerates both training and inference speeds. We use a contour wavelet transform to extract components from images and features, achieving substantial acceleration while preserving reconstruction quality. A normalised random channel attention module enhances the quality of generated images by focusing on high-frequency information. We also include a reconstruction loss function to enhance convergence speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in boosting the training and inference speeds of diffusion models without sacrificing image quality. Fast generation of facial expressions can provide a smoother and more natural user experience, which is important for real-time applications. In addition, the increase in inference speed can save the use of computational resources, reduce system cost and improve energy efficiency, which is conducive to promoting the development and application of this technology.},

One of the main reasons is that L1 loss or L1-like loss does not accurately reflect the fit between the predicted instance depth and the corresponding ground truth. Another of the main reason is that the instance depth on the RGB image hard to be directly learned in the network. In order to solve the above problems, a novel thermodynamic loss based on the principle of free energy minimisation and a novel depth decoupling method are proposed in this paper. The proposed method is called the monocular 3D object detection network with thermodynamic loss and decoupled instance depth (TDN). In TDN, the optimisation of the instance depth prediction is regarded as the thermodynamic process. Therefore, the thermodynamic loss is designed according to the principle of free energy minimisation. TDN decouples the instance depth into three different depths.

The framework designs a reputation evaluation method using quality as an indicator, and a consensus method based on reputation feedback. The trustworthiness of nodes is dynamically assessed to achieve an efficient and trustworthy model aggregation process while avoiding reputation monopolisation. Furthermore, the paper defines a tailored contribution calculation process for nodes in different roles in an untrusted environment. A reward and punishment scheme based on the joint constraints of contribution and reputation is proposed to attract highly qualified workers to actively participate in federated learning tasks.

Firstly, we utilize FasterNet as the backbone network to reduce computational redundancy, enhancing feature extraction efficiency and overall computational performance. Additionally, we employ the Feature Bi-level Routing Transformation model (FBM) to obtain global feature information and enhance focus on target regions. Secondly, the PFM module is engineered to collect multi-scale target information effectively by establishing connections across stages, thereby improving fusion of target features. Thirdly, an extra target feature fusion layer is introduced to enhance small ship detection precision and accommodate multi-scale targets. Finally, comprehensive tests on SSDD and HRSID datasets validate FastPFM&#39;s efficacy. Compared to the baseline model YOLOX, FastPFM achieves a 5.5% and 4.4% improvement in detection accuracy, respectively. Furthermore, FastPFM demonstrates comparable or superior performance to other detection algorithms, achieving 92.1% and 83.1% accuracy on AP50, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Unknown vulnerabilities, also known as zero-day vulnerabilities, are vulnerabilities in software, systems, or networks that have not yet been publicly disclosed or fixed. If these vulnerabilities are ever discovered by hackers, intentionally or unintentionally, they pose a major threat to network security. This is particularly true in the blockchain field, as smart contracts hold a lot of money, and if they are discovered and exploited by hackers, the financial losses to users will be even greater. However, the current research on smart contract vulnerabilities mainly focuses on known vulnerabilities, and the research on unknown vulnerabilities has been limited. Based on this, we introduce a machine learning-based method for detecting unknown vulnerabilities in smart contracts. First, the method obtains the opcode sequences executed by smart contract transactions in the EVM by instrumenting Geth and replaying the Ethereum transactions. Next, we employ an n-gram model and a vector weight penalty mechanism to extract the opcode sequence features. We then use machine learning algorithms to detect unknown vulnerabilities based on the similarity principle. Finally, we test the effectiveness of our method with four machine learning models: the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). The SVM model performs best at detecting unknown vulnerabilities, with an accuracy of 96%, a precision of 91%, a recall of 100%, and an F1-score of 95%. We also discuss the benefits of the method: timely detection of attacks due to unknown vulnerabilities, thus reducing user losses.},

This paper analyses different methods for the estimation of electricity consumption at the level of an urban area. A statistical model based on Trigonometric seasonality, Box-Cox transformation, Auto-Regressive Moving Average errors, Trend and Seasonal components is first presented. Then a model based on fuzzy logic is also proposed. These methods will be optimised and evaluated on a dataset collected by the electric power supply agency of Sibiu, Romania, with the goal of reducing the forecast error. The models are also compared with a Markov stochastic model and with a Long Short-Term Memory neural model. The experiments have shown that our statistical model using a history length of 200 electricity consumption values and a daily seasonality is the most efficient, with the lowest mean absolute error of 3.6 MWh, thus making it a good candidate for integration into a city-level energy management system.},

  abstract     = {The ever-growing use of digital systems has led to the accumulation of vast datasets, particularly time series, depicting the temporal evolution of variables and systems. Analysing these time series presents a tremendous challenge due to their inherent complexity and heterogeneity. Addressing an industrial need in the pharmaceutical wholesale sector, this paper introduces a new clustering method for time series: TSCAPE. The TSCAPE method uses a distance matrix calculated using dynamic time warping, followed by multidimensional scaling to project time series into a 2D Euclidean space, thus improving the last clustering stage by K-Means. Unlike conventional techniques, this approach, based on clustering of representation of distances in a Euclidean plane rather than on the curve shape, directly enhances the efficiency of the clustering process. The methodology exhibits significant potential for diverse applications, accommodating varied data types and irregular time series shapes. The research compares multiple variants and proposes metrics to assess their effectiveness on two open-access datasets. The results demonstrate the method&#39;s superiority over “only distance comparison clustering techniques”, like dynamic time warping and K-Means, with future prospects aimed at predictive applications and refining the clustering process by exploring alternative, more powerful clustering algorithms.},

The selected chaotic maps, namely Aizawa, Ricker, Sine-Circle, and Chirikov, have been well-established as effective sources of chaos in the existing literature. Within the proposed algorithm, these chaotic maps are strategically utilised in distinct layers to enhance the security of the encrypted image. The algorithm demonstrates applicability to real-world scenarios, distinguished by its simplicity, high-speed performance, and low computational complexity. The efficacy of the method is underlined by its dependence on both original images and secret keys, rendering it resilient against brute force and differential attacks. Rigorous experimentation, encompassing correlation, histogram analysis, NBCR, NPCR, UACI, PSNR, and NIST values, establishes the proposed encryption algorithm&#39;s robustness and security against diverse attack modalities, including differential and statistical approaches. These findings position the algorithm as a compelling solution for safeguarding sensitive information in various practical applications.},

It aims to improve the discriminative capacity of speech emotion utilising a certain type of features (e.g. MFCC, Spectrograms, Wav2vec2) or multi-type combination features. However, the potential of acoustic-related deep features is frequently overlooked in existing approaches that rely solely on a single type of feature or employ a basic combination of multiple feature types. To address this challenge, a multi-level acoustic feature cross-fusion approach is proposed, aiming to compensate for missing information between various features. It helps to enhance the SER performance by integrating different types of knowledge through the cross-fusion mechanism. Moreover, multi-task learning is utilised to share useful information through gender recognition, which can also obtain multiple common representations in a fine-grained space. Experimental results show that the fusion approach can capture the inner connections between multilevel acoustic features to refine the knowledge. The SOTA results were obtained under the same experimental conditions.},

Empirical asset pricing is a challenging task in financial analysis, which has attracted research attention. However, existing studies only focus on tackling the challenges of equity risk premium in the single stock market. Considering multiple economic linkages between the two countries, the transaction history of the US stock market as empirical knowledge is a powerful supplement to improve the prediction of equity risk premium in the China market. In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the prior information in two stock markets for empirical asset pricing models. Due to the rich financial domain knowledge, there may be various characteristic signals that partially overlap in different periods. To address these issues, we propose a framework based on long-short dual-mode knowledge distillation, termed as LSDM-KD, which incorporates US and China stock market models, and a shared characteristic signals model. The method effectively understands the relationships between assets and market behaviour, reducing reliance on expensive correlation databases and professional knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on US and China stock market datasets demonstrate that our LSDM-KD can significantly improve the performance of empirical asset pricing.},

Most of the prior attestation techniques disable interrupts during execution to prevent another process from interrupting the integrity check. This paper investigates the shortcomings of existing software-based attestation techniques and stresses the threat of debug exceptions to existing software-based attestation. We present Debug Register-based Self-relocating Attack (DRSA), a novel self-relocating malware against software-based attestation based on debug registers. DRSA gains control of the checksum function by raising debug exceptions and erasing itself before the next attestation. We further implement DRSA on commodity OSes and validate its effectiveness based on two existing software-based proposals. Our evaluation demonstrates that DRSA incurs low overhead, and it is extremely difficult for the verifier to detect it. can bypass the attestation with very little attack overhead.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of social networks, the harm caused by the leakage of personal sensitive information is becoming increasingly serious. In order to detect and identify personal sensitive information, existing methods build matching rules to detect specific sensitive entities and use machine learning methods to classify sensitive text. These methods face challenges in context analysis and adapting to Chinese language characteristics. This paper proposes CPSID, a method for detecting Chinese personal sensitive information. On the one hand, CPSID utilises rule matching to detect specific personal sensitive information only containing letters and numbers. More importantly, CPSID constructs a sequence labelling model named EBC (ELECTRA-BiLSTM-CRF) to detect more complex personal sensitive information that consist of Chinese characters. The EBC model uses the latest ELECTRA algorithm to implement word embedding, and uses BiLSTM and CRF models to extract personal sensitive information, which can detect Chinese sensitive entities accurately by analysing context information. The model achieves an F1 score of 94.09% on Chinese datasets, outperforming other similar models. Additionally, experiments on real data show CPSID has a better detection result than individual methods (rule matching or sequence labelling).},

  abstract     = {This paper delves into the economic policies of China during the pandemic and investigates the relationships between policy-issuing institutions. Firstly, we conduct keyword extraction and statistical analysis based on policy texts to understand policy contents and distribution. Then, we calculate the co-occurrence matrix of policy keywords and publishers from social networks and visualise the relationships with UCINET6 and Gephi software. Through a combination of semantic analysis and social network analysis, we examine the content of relevant economic policies, laws, regulations, and the relationships between their publishers. Our findings reveal three stages of China’s economic policies during the crisis, i.e. the shock, stable, and boost periods, which align with the crisis’s impact on China’s economy. Initial policies supported small-sized enterprises (SMEs), followed by a focus on industries like tourism. During the boost phase, policies underscored various support measures, including tax and fee reductions. We also identified a “local agglomeration” characteristic among policy-issuing entities, suggesting potential improvements in cooperation, especially at the provincial level. Our findings provide valuable insights for future policy design in response to public security events.},

Current approaches often rely on deep learning networks for text representation but they overlook the significance of psychological language knowledge in connecting user language expression to psychological characteristics. Consequently, the accuracy of personality detection is compromised. To address this issue, this paper presents PS-GCN, a model integrating Psychological knowledge and Sentiment semantic features through Graph Convolution Networks. Firstly, the Bi-LSTM network captures local features of preprocessed sentences to accurately represent the output of sentence sentiment features. Secondly,  GCNs map psycholinguistic knowledge, forming semantic networks of entities and relationships. P-GCN is designed to capture the dependency information between psycholinguistic features, while S-GCN utilises syntactic structure analysis to gather more abundant information features and enhance semantic understanding ability. Finally, attention calculation is employed to reinforce key features and weaken irrelevant information. Additionally, a sentence group model captures combined features of related sentences, effectively utilising the text structure to mine sentimental features. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the classification accuracy in personality detection tasks.},

  abstract     = {To further enhance the accuracy of the Chinese patent classification, this paper proposes a model, based on the patent structure and takes the patent claim as subjects, with multi-instance multi-label learning as the main method. Firstly, the patent claims are divided into multiple independent texts using the sequence number as the splitting token. For each patent, multiple claims are regarded as multiple instances, and the corresponding IPCs serve as its multiple labels. Next, the concept of secondary_label is introduced following the composition rules of IPC, and the relationships between instances and multiple secondary_labels are mined through the construction of fully-connected layers. To capture more comprehensive semantic information of instances, BIGRU and self-attention are employed to enhance semantics and reduce information loss during the training process. Finally, the max-pooling operations are utilised to obtain the predicted categories of patents based on capturing the relationships between instances and different hierarchical labels. Experimental results on the &#39;2017 Chinese patent dataset&#39; demonstrate that the multi-instance multi-label approach can effectively mine deeper relationships between patents and labels in classification tasks. As a result, our model significantly improves the accuracy of patent text classification.},

Semi-supervised network learning requires a certain amount of known samples, while sample annotation is time-consuming and laborious. In particular, when the number of known samples is only very small, the learning ability of existing semi-supervised network learning models decreases sharply. In view of this, a weakly-supervised community detection method based on graph convolutional neural network (WC-GCN). Firstly, it introduces a genetic evolution strategy to select and update the structure centres, which enables the updating structure centre process to not get stuck in the local optima, and get the structural centres that are closer to the global best, solving the problem of centre dependence. Secondly, the structural centrality index Cstruct is proposed to measure the representativeness of a subgraph, learning more accurate network structure centres. Thirdly, a self-training method to expand the pseudo-labelled nodes for GCN training to further improve the model effect.

Therefore, based on the U-net network, an adaptive automatic whole-field segmentation network (AWDS-net) for characterising diverse breast masses is proposed to assist more accurate and fast medical diagnosis in this paper. In the encoder part of AWDS-net, a small mass extraction mechanism (SMEM) is designed to better retain fine-grained small mass location information, while a spatial pyramid module (SPM) is added to capture multi-scale context and high-resolution image information. In the decoder part, an attention gate (AG) mechanism is inserted to make the model automatically focus on the useful target region information, so that the extracted feature information can be used to build a symmetric encoder-decoder structure for automatic segmentation network of multiple masses in the full field of view. The experimental results on an open-source breast cancer dataset digital database for mammography (DDSM) show that compared with U-net, Attention-Unet, R2U-Net, and SegNet, the proposed AWDS-net achieves, up to higher image segmentation metrics of 3.16% accuracy, 20.59% sensitivity, 5.23% specificity,10.27% precision, 15.08% IoU and 14.21% F1-score with acceptable training time.},

  abstract     = {Numerous mobile applications (apps) with different functions meet the various needs of users, but users have to spend a lot of time selecting suitable mobile apps. How to select relevant mobile apps for users has become an important issue. Existing studies mainly utilise context, user interest, privacy, security, version, and heterogeneous information to make mobile app recommendations. However, they have at least one of the following limitations: (1) Don&#39;t fully integrate the rich heterogeneous information; (2) Don&#39;t capture complex structural and semantic information; (3) Don&#39;t differentiate the importance of different semantic meta-graphs; (4) Don&#39;t consider the influence of different users&#39; rating criteria. Therefore, the predictive performance of these methods is relatively limited. This paper considers the influence of different users&#39; rating criteria for the same app and proposes a weighted meta-graph based mobile app recommendation approach by leveraging matrix factorisation and neural networks. Specifically, the similarity measurement between users and apps considers the difference in users&#39; rating criteria under various semantic meta-graph patterns. The matrix factorisation technology is used to acquire the user&#39;s and the app&#39;s latent feature matrices. The importance of various semantic meta-graphs is distinguished by exploiting the weight learning. The neural network technology is employed to learn interactions between users and apps, thereby predicting the user&#39;s preference for unobserved apps. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, the effectiveness of considering differences in users&#39; rating criteria, and the importance of differentiating various semantic meta-graphs.},

  abstract     = {In order to provide the reliability of transmitted data in the era of big data, it is necessary to communicate by applying signature technology to data. There are various signature schemes, among which attribute-based signatures perform signatures based on user attributes. This ensures signer anonymity by allowing users to create and verify signatures without exposing the signer&#39;s sensitive information. However, the verifier can verify normally if the attribute period expires and a user without signing authority creates and transmits a signature with the existing signing key and attributes. In addition, signers who abuse anonymity can disclose their signing keys and attributes for some purpose (Money, profit) because there is no risk of being caught. Unauthorized users can use public information to sign and send messages. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Traceable Attribute-based Signature scheme provided with anonymous credentials. The proposed scheme has the feature of verifying the validity of the signer by using the pseudonym ID included in the user list in the cloud server. In addition, the signer&#39;s identity is expressed as an Oblivious Transfer-based pseudonym ID. The signer&#39;s identity can be verified through tracing in case of a problem.},

Signifying the importance of each feature, we employ the LASSO algorithm to derive an optimal feature combination. Additionally, our methodology utilizes the Ca-LSTM (cascade long short-term memory) technique, enhancing information extraction from individual features. Experimental results, gauged by mean error, underscore the superiority of the Ca-LSTM model over other time series prediction models and conventional long short-term memory approaches.

In this paper, we discuss the impact that COVID-19 has on telehealth services and on telehealth users&#39; opinion of the service. We collected 245 Android telehealth apps, 144 iOS telehealth apps and 86 telehealth websites, and performed a systematic analysis on this dataset. In this analysis, we conducted a comparison analysis and relevant content analysis of the telehealth apps as well as their security risks. Apart from the mobile platforms, we also inspected the telehealth websites&#39; features, particularly those related to the use of metaverse to improve current telehealth solutions. To further understand people&#39;s attitude towards telehealth services, we invited users to participate in a user study aimed at revealing what impact COVID-19 has on users&#39; willingness to adopt telehealth services and revealing the gap between the telehealth service and its users. Our result shows that 27.1% new iOS apps and 27.4% new Android apps were released after the COVID-19 announcement, and a surge of updates were noted within 4 weeks after the COVID-19 announcement. We further found that COVID-19 is frequently mentioned in telehealth app reviews in the second and third quarter of 2020, and the most mentioned aspects related to COVID-19 include family , test result and vaccine . According to our user study, COVID-19 has a significant impact on the selection of telehealth services, especially for female participants, people aged 46–55, and students.
