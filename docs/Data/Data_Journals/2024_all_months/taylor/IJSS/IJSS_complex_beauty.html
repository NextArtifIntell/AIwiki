The main objective is to identify efficient feedback control strategies to achieve strong, weak and exponential stabilisdation of the fractional output. Then, we solve a minimisation fractional problem. To illustrate the practical implications of the stabilisation theorems presented, two examples of numerical simulations are provided.},

Similarly, the bipartite consensus is analysed and proved. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by simulation examples.},

The designed framework contains two levels. In the upper level, each MG determines the scheduling of manufacturing facilities and battery and the quantities of P2P2G energy transactions based on the given P2P energy transaction price and distribution locational marginal price (DLMP), in which the complex typical manufacturing assembly process is formulated as a kind of deferable load and the DLMP is updated according to the optimal power flow (OPF) of the network. In the lower level, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transaction prices are updated by non-cooperative games and the homologous Rosen-Nash equilibrium points are obtained by using Nikaido-Isoda relaxation and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The efficacy of the designed framework is demonstrated by a case study, and the results indicate the designed framework can improve the utilisation rate of renewable energy.},

The key goal is to use as few network resources as possible while retaining the desired closed-loop performance. An event-triggered control method is used to accomplish this. The Lyapunov function method, linear matrix inequality approach, and mathematical techniques are used to develop new synchronisation criteria that assure the synchronisation error system is Mittag–Leffler stable. Because fractional order differential equations have memory characteristics, which are very different from ordinary differential equations, leading to difficulties in preventing Zeno behaviour related to the event-triggered mechanism of fractional order systems, especially of delayed fractional order singular systems. To solve this issue, we propose a new theoretical framework and a new condition to preclude Zeno behaviours. This derived conditions use inequality techniques and take advantage of a number of fundamental aspects of fractional order calculus. Furthermore, the dissipative synchronous problem of delayed fractional order singular systems is also solved for the first time using the suggested stable criterion in conjunction with some auxiliary characteristics of fractional calculus. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed strategy.},

Secondly, for the purpose of improving the estimation accuracy, a filtering-based identification framework is proposed by constructing a linear filter for filtering the input data, output data and the coloured noise, and the coloured noise is transformed into a white noise. This identification scheme based on the filtering technique can effectively reduce the adverse effects caused by coloured noise and parameter estimation accuracy is enhanced compared with the direct least squares algorithm. Meanwhile, the convergence analysis of the filtering-based identification algorithm is given to provide a theoretical analysis. Finally, the simulation example is carried out by performance test and comparison analysis and simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed identification methods.},

A strategy for distributed estimation is proposed to ensure that every follower is able to estimate the state of the leader within a finite time. Then a structurally simpler integral sliding manifold is designed to eliminate the reaching phase. Furthermore, two control protocols are formulated to ensure the reachability of sliding surface according to the estimated state of the leader. The first protocol is a discontinuous one that ensures exponential convergence of the consensus tracking error to zero, but its switching gain is difficult to be adjusted. Then an adaptive protocol is developed to adjust the switching gain automatically, which is the second control protocol. This protocol not only avoids chattering but also relaxes the dependence on certain boundaries. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the efficacy of the employed strategy.},

Towards linearisation techniques for controlled nonlinear systems, operator-theoretic frameworks from functional analysis have received attentions as well. The Koopman operator is a linear, but an infinite dimensional operator. Most notably, the novelties of the paper are the following. (i) Sketching a rigorous and comprehensive proof of the Koopmanization of the controlled nonlinear system using the notion of the operator-invariant subspace and unifying the minimiser inequality formula with the Koopmanized system. The proof unfolds that the Koopmanization meets the bilinearisation in control context with the augmented state space. (ii) A formal construction of an observer encompassing the generalised Riccati equation in the Koopman setting of the original controlled nonlinear system. The Carleman version of the generalised Riccati equation is rephrased as well. (iii) Unfolding the usefulness of the Koopman observer. To achieve extensive illustrations of the theory of the paper, we construct two Koopman observers for two practical control problems, i.e. a controlled Duffing system with a cubic nonlinearity and a controlled system with a square nonlinearity. Then, we compare the Koopman observers with the Carleman observers.},

The LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) block is nonparametric and is described by its impulse response. The considered system’s nonlinearity is any memory operator having one major cycle (periodic closed loop), which is bordered by any two arbitrary functions. The nonlinearity borders are not assumed to be invertible. The proposed identification algorithm can be used in static nonlinearity, e.g. polynomial nonlinearity, dead zone function or any piecewise affine functions. Unlike several previous studies, the proposed identification method is carried out using only one stage. In this approach, an input signal of piecewise constant (staircase) is used.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an optimal control method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) for manipulators with joint limitation under input saturation. The asymmetric input saturation problem is solved by introducing a smooth function, by which the saturation and nonsmooth issues of the input caused by the actuators can be handled. Joint limitation of the manipulator is transformed through a transfer function, which is incorporated into the cost function of the whole robotic system, to guarantee the joint limitation will not be violated. Meanwhile, due to the difficulty in solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, the critic network is constructed utilising radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to approximate the cost function. This approach effectively overcomes the curse of dimensionality problem associated with dynamic programming. Subsequently, an ADP-based optimal controller is designed for the robotic system. Lyapunov synthesis is used in the stability analysis to prove all the signals are convergent and ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). Simulations are conducted on a planar 3-DOF manipulator to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate the improved performance and feasibility of the developed ADP-based optimal control strategy in handling joint limitations and input saturation challenges in robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper integrates event-triggered mechanisms and fixed-time control to address the cluster consensus problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) under the undirected communication topology. Firstly, a fractional-order-based nonlinear algorithm is proposed to obtain cluster consensus for second order MASs within a bounded settling time for any initial conditions. Secondly, to further save communication resources, double dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (DETMs), considering the dynamic parameters in the triggering conditions, are introduced, which control the communication among agents and the update of controllers asynchronously. In addition, Zeno behaviour is excluded by calculating the positive lower bound of the inter-event intervals. Finally, a simulation of Chua&#39;s circuit is given to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Recently, owing to the high penetration of renewable power generations, random access to dynamical loads and wide application of power-electronic devices, the modern power systems exhibit new features such as high dynamics, low inertia and weak voltage and frequency support. As a powerful tool in revealing the dynamical evolution of the modern power systems, the dynamic state estimation (DSE) scheme gains a surge of research enthusiasms. Note that in actual power systems, various styles of power generations and mixed measurements generated by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and the phasor measurement unit (PMU) pose higher demands on the DSE. In addition, the measurements with anomalies such as gross errors, outliers and incomplete information are often encountered due to the unreliable measurement facilities, constrained communication resources and cyber-threats. Such anomalies, if not tactfully handled, would largely impair the DSE performance. In this paper, a systematic and timely review with respect to DSE for power systems is provided. First, several typical models for power systems include quasi-steady model, synchronous-generator-based multi-machine model and renewable power generation model are introduced. Then the measurement facilities of power systems and their features as well as the measurements with anomalies are reviewed, respectively. Subsequently, the DSE schemes are recalled and discussed from the perspectives of framework, methodology, anomaly-resistant ability and application, respectively. Finally, some possible future research topics are outlined for the DSE of power systems.},

Secondly, the trigger function with adaptive parameters is designed to enhance the self-regulation of the trigger mechanism, which is relevant to the state of the agents and time, but not to the number of agents. Then, it is demonstrated that the developed consensus protocol can achieve not only the synchronisation of agents without continuous communication, but also the exclusion of Zeno behavior.

Second, a fuzzy switched system model is built, which provides a unified platform to evaluate effects of all the affecting factors such as the dynamic ETM and DoS attacks. Third, by constructing a piecewise Lyapunov functional, criteria for exponential stability with guaranteed H ∞ performance are obtained, and an event-triggered fuzzy injection current controller is further designed. Simulation results confirm that, in the presence of aperiodic DoS attacks and noises, the proposed controller can stabilise the nonlinear DC microgrids, while the dynamic ETM works well in reducing the triggering rate without dropouts. Tradeoffs can be made between control and communication resources, and the proposed fuzzy controller achieves shorter settling times and smaller overshoots than the robust controller.},

Nonlinear dynamics and nonholonomic constraints make the optimisation problem of MPC for the robot challenging. Nonlinear dynamics of the robots are expressed by a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV), and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) solves the constrained optimisation problem, providing optimal velocities. Moreover, an interpolation-based approach has been introduced to augment the region of attraction. The algorithm ensures stability in the presence of bounded disturbances through the inclusion of free control moves in the control law. The controller efficiency has been evaluated in two scenarios in a hospital setting. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method performs better than nonlinear MPC and standard LPV-based MPC in terms of computational cost, disturbance rejection, and region of attraction.},

  abstract     = {Keeping an intelligent agent under surveillance with an autonomous robot as it travels in the environment is one of the essential tasks in robotics. This work addresses a pursuit-evasion surveillance problem between two Differential Drive Robots moving on a plane without obstacles. One of them, the pursuer, is equipped with a limited field-of-view sensor and aims to maintain the other robot (evader) inside its detection region for as much time as possible. On the contrary, the evader wants to escape as soon as possible. Unlike prior studies that address the same problem, based on heuristic approaches, we frame it as a zero-sum differential game, and we use differential game theory to find a solution with theoretical guarantees. In particular, we compute the players&#39; time-optimal motion strategies to achieve their goals near the end of the game and provide analytical expressions describing them. These strategies are in Nash equilibrium, meaning that any unilateral deviation by a player from these strategies does not provide such player benefit toward its goal. Our analysis exhibits the existence of a Transition Surface in which the evader switches its controls. We also determine the game&#39;s winner based on the players&#39; initial configurations and velocities.},

However, the design methods for fractional order controller tuning suffer from a lack of direct systematic tuning strategies due to a higher number of tuneable parameters. Most of the works on such design are optimisation-based whereas the analytical solutions are achieved with assumptions and approximations leading to compromised closed-loop robustness. This paper proposes a simple analytical design of a fractional-order tilt-integral-derivative (FOTID) controller for time-delayed NIO processes with a single tuneable parameter. Explicit tuning rules in terms of plant parameters are derived with user-defined stability margins. To prove the efficiency of the proposed control law, simulation comparisons with recently developed tuning rules are included. Lastly, the proposed control law is tested through experiments in a two-tank level loop for real-time validation.},

  abstract     = {In recent research, metaheuristic strategies stand out as powerful tools for complex optimization, capturing widespread attention. This study proposes the Educational Competition Optimizer (ECO), an algorithm created for diverse optimization tasks. ECO draws inspiration from the competitive dynamics observed in real-world educational resource allocation scenarios, harnessing this principle to refine its search process. To further boost its efficiency, the algorithm divides the iterative process into three distinct phases: elementary, middle, and high school. Through this stepwise approach, ECO gradually narrows down the pool of potential solutions, mirroring the gradual competition witnessed within educational systems. This strategic approach ensures a smooth and resourceful transition between ECO&#39;s exploration and exploitation phases. The results indicate that ECO attains its peak optimization performance when configured with a population size of 40. Notably, the algorithm&#39;s optimization efficacy does not exhibit a strictly linear correlation with population size. To comprehensively evaluate ECO&#39;s effectiveness and convergence characteristics, we conducted a rigorous comparative analysis, comparing ECO against nine state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. ECO&#39;s remarkable success in efficiently addressing complex optimization problems underscores its potential applicability across diverse real-world domains.

  abstract     = {Inference using fuzzy rules enables decision-making that is supported with imprecise knowledge. Unlike conventional fuzzy reasoning approaches which directly perform pattern-matching in response to an input observation, recent techniques have integrated rule-firing-based and rule interpolating-based inference methods. This is in order to address challenging issues where observations are of different matching degrees to the rules within a given rule base, including unmatched ones. While applied generally, such a unified inference mechanism may become too complex to exploit the entire rule base for deriving a reasonable conclusion. In practice, only a small number of ‘appropriate’ rules are selected to accomplish the required inference. This paper presents an enhanced integrated fuzzy inference mechanism, which is fed with fewer rules returned by a weight-guided selection procedure. In particular, the weights of rule attributes are utilised in a dual manner: guiding the selection of appropriate rules for rule firing and determining the nearest neighbouring rules for rule interpolation. The resulting mechanism is applied to a real-world problem, empirically demonstrating its significant efficacy.},

  abstract     = {This work examines a polytope-type approach for observer-based security control of a fractional-order system that is under multiple attacks via an event-triggered scheme. A novel multiple-attack model is first proposed for fractional-order systems such as denial-of-service attacks and reply attacks, which can destroy the system&#39;s security during the signal process. In contrast to previous studies, the design of the controller is developed using an observer-based event-triggered scheme in the presence of multiple attacks. An event-triggering strategy is proposed to reduce the communication burden of the output measurement signals. An observer-based control is designed to keep the fractional-order system stable in all scenarios where one or more simultaneous attacks may occur. These findings can ensure the absence of Zeno behaviour and considerably reduce data transmissions. By employing the suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure fractional-order system stability. Controller and observer-gain matrices are obtained by using the linear matrix inequality technique. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the suggested methodology.},

The proposed algorithm could be activated by an arbitrary bounded control input and a simple initial value of the Lyapunov matrix.

In these systems, agents can freely join or leave at any time, i.e. the system sizes are changeable. To achieve formation tracking control in these systems, we propose a general theoretical analysis framework that consists of a formation adjustment strategy and a formation tracking protocol. Therein, the former is used to adjust the predefined task-oriented formation shape to the varying size of the system. This strategy is built on the existing scalable self-healing idea and then modified by a size estimation method. The latter is used to drive the present followers to form the adjusted formation and track a leader. To accommodate undirected and directed graphs, two distributed formation tracking protocols are designed respectively. Due to possible agent migration, the designed tracking protocols are endowed with self-adaptive ability, i.e. without depending on global topology information. Then, their convergence properties are analysed using the Lyapunov theory. Finally, two simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Secondly, based on structural balance theory and node relabelling theory, the consensus of enlarged DeGroot model can be further equivalently converted into the consensus of one simple DeGroot model with n nodes. Thirdly, by using the equivalent transformation and the ergodic coefficient theory, we change the sufficient condition from ‘repeatedly jointly strongly connected’ graphs to ‘repeatedly jointly scrambling’ graphs, and verify that the new condition also can lead to the bipartite consensus of the Altafini model. This novel criterion allows for determining the bipartite consensus of the Altafini model without the condition of ‘repeatedly jointly strongly connected’ graphs. Next, we provide a concise proof for the case of opinions converging to 0 with the condition of ‘repeatedly jointly strongly connected’ by the ergodic coefficient theory.

This is achieved by a control protocol with dynamic compensators, which is also capable of avoiding collision between the agent and the multiple targets during the whole operational process. The control protocol is further extended to the scenarios of multiple agents circulating a group of targets by adding a coordination mechanism into the tangential velocity term, which allows the agents to distribute evenly on each expected circular orbit with the same or different radius.

Furthermore, the estimated state and control input can be optimised by minimising the performance function. Considering that the system state is subject to denial of service (DoS) attacks in the feedback channel, the BBAA approach is used to reconstruct the estimated state, thereby reducing the impact of attacks on system performance. To improve the utilisation of network resources, a set of event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs) is used. In addition, a set of matrix inequality conditions is given to constrain the gains of controllers and observers. Then, the system H ∞ performance is demonstrated by applying the average dwell time (ADT) and the Lyapunov function method, and the complex coupling between model switching, DoS attacks and event-triggering is analysed.

  abstract     = {This research paper focuses on addressing the challenge of infinite-time linear quadratic tracking control (LQT) for linear systems with parametric uncertainty. Traditional solutions to the LQT problem often involve using a discount factor to prevent the cost function from growing unbounded over time. However, this approach can introduce instability in the closed-loop system. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes an alternative approach using an undiscounted cost function that ensures the asymptotic stability of the uncertain closed-loop system. To design a control scheme without requiring precise knowledge of the system dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are employed. However, for systems with uncertain parameters that may lead to instability, the convergence of RL algorithms to a stabilising solution is not guaranteed. To address this limitation, a robust optimal control structure is developed using on-policy and off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms, resulting in a model-free controller. The effectiveness of the proposed robust optimal controller is validated through comparative simulations on an uncertain model of a DC–DC buck converter connected to a constant power load. These simulations demonstrate the advantages and benefits of the robust optimal controller in handling parametric uncertainty and ensuring stability in the control system.},

This law is characterised by being decentralised (depending only on own signals of a robot), norm-free (independent of distances for reducing robot-to-robot data transmissions), and adaptive (estimating signals without using global information). Moreover, its system-theo- retical analysis is provided, which holds for both the sampled data exchange method and the solution-predictor curve-based data exchange method. In contrast to the well-studied sampled data exchange, the solution-predictor curve method further reduces robot-to-robot data transmissions by making each agent to store a generic form of this curve and exchange its parameters when an event occurs for approximating the solution trajectory of each robot.

The constant interaction of information flow and power flow exposes the grid to potential cyber-attack risks. In this paper, the defense strategy selection approaches are proposed based on incomplete information game against false data injection attack (FDIA) in different scenarios. Firstly, the attack-defense tree model containing economic indicators and a measure of attack is established, and the expected revenues of both attacker and defender are calculated in detail. Secondly, the static Bayesian attack-defense game model in which the defender grasps incomplete information is constructed, considering two cases of low-tech attacker and high-tech attacker. Then, the zero-sum attack-defense game model in which the attacker masters incomplete information is structured, considering the changing attack space. Finally, the simulations are carried out on the IEEE 30-bus system, and the optimal defense strategies in the case of two incomplete information are obtained by solving the equilibrium point. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in cyber security defense system, and can provide guiding ideology and theoretical basis for operators to deploy defense measures.},

  abstract     = {Integrating and unstable processes require rugged control demand by virtue of their non-self-regulation character. The occurrence of system poles located at the origin and on the right half of the complex frequency plane causes instability in an open-loop configuration. When these processes proceed with dead time, it demands more sophisticated control requirements. Therefore, binal-loop control schemes are recommended over single-loop controller schemes. For plants with prevalent unstable and integrating dynamics and dead time, a novel modified inferred internal model control-proportional derivative decoupled binal-loop control system is suggested. The inner-loop is controlled by the stabilising proportional derivative controller with Routh–Hurwitz stability constraints. The outer-loop contains an inferred internal model controller for reference-point tracking. The equilibrium optimiser is then used to minimise the integral squared error by tuning the inner and outer-loop controller settings in the confined search space. The suggested strategy delivers appreciable enhancement in the quantitative performance measures as compared to some of the contemporary control techniques. The effect of time-varying disturbance and robust stability analysis is also presented. Finally, utilising a magnetic levitation laboratory setup, the suggested method is experimentally verified using the hardware-in-loop method.},

The current method design controller is focused on attaining the desired closed-loop response for multi input multi output (MIMO) processes that involve multiple time delays. The conventional multivariable PI controller is obtained by approximating the ideal multivariable controller by the Maclaurin series expansion. This is accomplished by choosing the desired closed-loop response order as the system order plus two. Subsequent analysis investigates the proposed method’s efficacy in designing multivariable PI controllers. Servo and regulatory problems studies were conducted to find the effectiveness of the proposed method and compared it with other methods recently reported in the literature, as well as assessment of performance indices like integral absolute error (IAE) and integral square error (ISE). The proposed controller&#39;s robustness is assessed by plotting the inverse maximum singular value against frequency, both input and output multiplicative uncertainties.},

Combining the discretised linear Lyapunov function method with the average dwell time technique, the stabilisation schemes for continuous switched system with unstable modes are obtained. Secondly, compared with existing results, the event-triggered mechanism scheme adopted under the current event-triggered control strategy reduces the number of system triggers, effectively saves computational resources, avoids Zeno&#39;s behaviour, and has better performance in terms of sampling frequency. Finally, the idea of event-triggered mechanism is first extended to discrete time-varying delay switched systems where all subsystems are unstable. By solving linear matrix inequalities, sufficient conditions for global exponential stability of the system are obtained.

By dividing the time interval into equal iteration periods, iterative learning algorithm is integrated into output feedback control and is carried out under alignment condition. Using the output signal, control input and estimates of uncertain parameters, adaptive state observers are established to generate state estimates which will be employed to design the control law. Based on the backstepping technique, the output feedback controller is developed consisting of the ILC part and robust control part. Different from the traditional ILC update laws of uncertain parameters with constant gains, a novel type of parameter update law is developed where the ILC gain is variable and determined by the real-time state estimates such that system stability can be guaranteed. By virtue of the composite energy function, it is proved that all the signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and the output will uniformly converge to zero along the iteration axis, which indicates the stabilisation of the output signal over the time domain. Simulation verification is conducted to apply the proposed controller to a one-degree-of-freedom suspension system to validate the effectiveness of the control scheme.},

The problem can be alleviated by making the magnitude as small as possible while still ensuring the existence of the sliding mode. In this paper, a novel predefined-time single layer adaptive scheme based on equivalent concept with a relaxed assumption about unknown dynamics is proposed for dynamically tuning the gain associated with the control magnitude, and applying this scheme in sliding mode control algorithms enables decreasing the control action magnitude to the minimum possible value remaining the characteristic of finite-time convergence.

Centralised NCSs have numerous applications in industrial settings due to their efficiency, simplicity and cost-effective design. However, centralised NCSs are vulnerable to false data injection (FDI) attacks. Despite the fact that researchers have developed detection and mitigation defense mechanisms during past several years, most of these methods have focused on systems with linear dynamics. Furthermore, the existing literature only assumes the injection of FDI attacks on measurement signals. In this paper, we assume that an adversary has injected the FDI attack into both state measurements and control signals with nonlinear dynamics while considering communication noises and disturbances. We propose a secure nonlinear control design that mitigates FDI attacks in real time by combining learning and model-based approaches. We used Lyapunov stability analysis to design the controller, estimator and updating laws of the neural network (NN). In addition, we selected a network of two robots with Euler–Lagrange dynamics to illustrate the robustness of the proposed controller and estimator.},

In this paper, a robust sliding-mode observer approach has been successfully employed to estimate the states of nonlinear systems with unbounded and diverging dynamics. The design principles of this observer are based on applying a classifying algorithm in single-input single-output and multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear systems. It is noteworthy that this observer is highly robust against disturbance, uncertainty and measurement noise, and its conditions are less conservative compared to previous nonlinear sliding-mode observers. One novel feature of the proposed observer is that while the system&#39;s state gets unbounded and diverged in fault-occurring scenarios or critical circumstances, this observer retains accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed observer is verified in the simulation results for two nonlinear industrial systems, including a hydro-turbine power generation plant and a continuous stirred tank reactor.},

These challenges were tackled in this study within the context of multi-agent systems, addressing input constraints and nonlinear time-varying actuator failures simultaneously. Moreover, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce signal communication. A double closed-loop consensus tracking method is designed based on the multi-agent topology, enabling all flexible manipulators to track the angle and angular velocity of the leader and an adaptive control law is designed to solve actuator faults.

By using the known bounds of system membership functions and introducing two new weighting functions, the MFs of fuzzy state estimator are reconstructed. A hidden Markov model is employed to describe the asynchronous behaviour of scheduling rules between the sensor and the estimator. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the ultimate boundedness of estimation error.

  abstract     = {For switched under-actuated systems subject to bouc-wen hysteresis, an adaptive neural predefined-time control scheme is presented first time in this paper. To improve the robustness and response rate of the system under consideration, a hierarchical sliding mode control technique is introduced. Based on a predefined-time stability criterion, the stabilization time of the system can be directly preset under the designed controller. Besides, the convergence time depends only on the preset value and is independent of all other parameters. The projection algorithm is introduced to avoid the singularity problem in the controller design process. Meanwhile, it is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded after a preset time through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a simulation example and a comparison example are given to further illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of developed control approach.},

Then, synthesis conditions are proposed as LMIs for the polytopic filter parameters over several FF intervals.

Moreover, by using the neural networks technique, the unknown nonlinear functions which often exist in the dynamic of the system are handled. According to the Lyapunov stability theorem and the Lyapunov–Krasovskii function, it is proved that the consensus errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded.

In this paper, the system uncertainties are regarded as some nonlinear functions which are not required to must satisfy the matching conditions. That is, being different from traditional robust control theory, the matched structures of uncertainties are sufficient, but not necessary, for being able always to design some types of robust tracking control schemes. In addition, the external disturbances of dynamical systems are assumed to be any bounded functions which is not also required to satisfy the matching condition. By making use of the integral inequality, instead of Lyapunov function, a class of robust tracking control schemes is constructed to guarantee the uniform exponential boundedness of the model tracking errors. Moreover, the upper bounds of nonlinear uncertainties are not required to be known, and it is also unnecessary to know or estimate the characteristic parameters of dead-zone functions. Therefore, the resulting robust tracking control schemes have a simple structure. Actually, the resulting robust tracking control scheme is a linear feedback control one with a self-tuning control gain. Finally, an illustrative numerical example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the presented theoretical results.},

In particular, the event-triggered schemes without Zeno behaviour are designed, which can determine whether controllers need to be updated or not. For the purpose of investigating the synchronisation with isolated nodes, comparing to the usual 1-norm and 2-norm, generalised { ξ , 1 } -norm has been utilised to derive sufficient conditions. Furthermore, in the proof of the theorem, constant time-delays and time-varying time delays are dealt with by utilising novel Lyapunov functions, and then some valid criteria are established to achieve different types of projective synchronisation.

  abstract     = {Network inference has been extensively studied in several fields, such as systems biology and social sciences. Learning network topology and internal dynamics is essential to understand mechanisms of complex systems. In particular, sparse topologies and stable dynamics are fundamental features of many real-world continuous-time (CT) networks. Given that usually only a partial set of nodes are able to observe, we consider linear CT systems to depict networks since they can model unmeasured nodes via transfer functions. Additionally, measurements tend to be noisy and with low and varying sampling frequencies. This paper applies dynamical structure functions (DSFs) derived from linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to describe networks of measured nodes. A numerical sampling method, preconditioned Crank–Nicolson (pCN), is used to refine coarse-grained trajectories to improve inference accuracy. The proposed method can handle sparsely sampled data and unmeasurable nodes. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with various network topologies. The developed method can be applied under a wide range of contexts, such as gene regulatory networks, social networks and communication systems.},

In this sight coordinate system, a nonlinear HOFA system model is applied to establish the relative dynamics of spacecraft flying-around, such that the presented flying-around mission can be transformed into a tracking control problem of nonlinear HOFA systems. A HOFA predictive control approach is correspondingly proposed to deal with this problem. Concretely, the nonlinearities can be eliminated to construct a linear HOFA system by utilising full actuation characteristic, and then a linear incremental HOFA (LIHOFA) prediction model is constructed by applying a Diophantine equation to replace a reduced-order prediction model. Based on this LIHOFA prediction model, multi-step ahead predictions are developed to optimise the tracking control performance, so that the realisation of the presented flying-around mission can be guaranteed. A sufficient and necessary condition is derived in the in-depth discussion to maintain the stability and tracking control performance of closed-loop systems. Furthermore, numerical simulation and comparison about spacecraft flying-around in circular and elliptical orbits are provided to verify the feasibility of the HOFA predictive control approach. To highlight its practicability, an experimental verification via air-bearing spacecraft (ABS) simulator is shown for the implementation of flying-around mission.},

Leveraging this observer, a horizontal position controller that combines the fully-actuated system approach with the prescribed-time method, as well as altitude and attitude fault-tolerant controller, are proposed. In the design of control law, two distinct sets of controllers are designed: asymptotically stable controller and prescribed-time controller, each tailored to specific control objectives.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel fault tolerance strategy for a class of uncertain high-order fully actuated systems (FASs) with actuator faults. Recently, the FAS approaches have been rapidly developed in different fields. As a control-oriented approach, a great advantage of FAS approaches is the convenient design of controllers for the deterministic nonlinear systems which meet the full-actuation condition. However, the presence of uncertainties and faults brings more challenges. To cope with the fault tolerance issue in FAS framework, a class of uncertain FASs with multiplicative actuator faults is introduced. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, a fault-tolerant controller is presented to robustly stabilise the considered system. Moreover, for the systems that do not meet the full-actuation condition, previous research has indicated that they may be decomposed into a fully actuated subsystem and an extra autonomous subsystem. Leveraging the theory of input-to-state stability, the proposed fault-tolerant controller is further extended to cope with the stabilisation for such compound systems with nonlinear uncertainties and actuator faults. Both provided controllers can ensure the globally uniformly asymptotically stability of the considered systems and only rely on a few general assumptions. A numerical experiment illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the controllability of multi-agent systems over finite fields is studied based on the high-order fully actuated (HOFA) system approaches. The concept of HOFA systems over finite fields is introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability of linear systems over finite fields are established. It is proved that a leader–follower multi-agent system over finite fields is controllable if and only if it can be transformed into an HOFA system. Then the stabilisation control protocol is proposed based on the full-actuation property, and the upper bound of settling time for the system can be determined. The uncontrollable leader–follower multi-agent system over finite fields can be transformed into a controllable subsystem and an autonomous subsystem via structural decomposition, the conditions for the system to be stabilisable are provided. Finally, an illustrative example is shown to verify the validity of the main results of this paper.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the authors propose a robust adaptive dynamic surface control method by using the fully actuated system approach for high-order strict-feedback systems (SFSs) with parameter uncertainty and disturbance. Each subsystem of the SFSs is a high-order system with a full actuation structure. In contrast to the traditional first-order state space method, the proposed control method directly treats each high-order subsystem as a whole without transforming it into a first-order system, which is a concise and efficient treatment. By introducing a series of first-order low-pass filters in each step of the design, the high-order derivatives of the virtual control law are obtained, and the complex and multiple derivation operations are transformed into simple algebraic operations. Adaptive control and robust control are combined to address parameter uncertainty and external disturbances in the system. The Lyapunov stability theory is utilised to demonstrate that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. The system output can effectively track the desired reference signal under specific constraints, and the tracking error can be adjusted by tweaking the parameters to converge to a sufficiently small neighbourhood around zero. Ultimately, the efficiency of the proposed control method is validated through simulations on a flexible joint manipulator system.},

Different from the existing results, an adaptive prescribed performance control method is proposed to ensure that the HOFA system with state time-delay can achieve semi-globally practical finite-time stability. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the control method ensures both the steady-state performance of the system and the dynamic performance of the system within a finite time. In addition, the settling time of this paper is independent of design parameters and initial conditions. Hence, it can be set to any value.

  abstract     = {In this paper, four general types of time-varying underactuated systems (UASs) are proposed and investigated with the fully-actuated system (FAS) approach. The proposed UASs consist of both the first-order and the second-order ones, and cover a very wide range of UASs. FAS models for all these types of UASs are obtained under very mild assumptions, and corresponding homeomorphism or diffeomorphism transformations and sets of feasibility are also established. Governed by the FAS theory, once a FAS model of a system is obtained, a stabilising controller for the system can then be easily designed. Particularly, in the case that the set of feasibility coincides with the whole initial value space, a global FAS model is produced for which (and also the original system) global exponential stabilisation is immediately achieved. Otherwise, a sub-FAS with a feasible set is produced for which a sub-stabilising controller can be immediately designed. Meanwhile, a subset in the system initial value space, which is called the region of exponential attraction (REA), is characterised, such that all the solutions of converted sub-FAS starting from this domain are driven exponentially to the origin within the feasible set. Furthermore, in the case that the set of feasibility, or the REA, contains the origin as only a boundary point, the system possesses a ‘nonholonomic’ feature. Several examples are proposed to demonstrate the proposed approach and the power of the FAS approach.},

Firstly, the realisability of the control system is considered. It is shown that the realisability of the control system is only determined by the direct feedback matrix, which has nothing to do with the input–output coupling matrix, and the direct feedback matrix to be full-row rank is enough to guarantee the system realisable. Secondly, the convergence of output tracking errors is analysed in both the almost sure and mean square senses, respectively. By the contraction mapping method combined with matrix decomposition and transformation techniques, it is strictly proved that the output sequence can converge to any given desired trajectory in the sense of almost sure and mean square, respectively, if and only if the general spectral radius condition is satisfied.

In order to circumvent the negative effect of intermittent transmission and sensor measurement sensitivity on the output, an extended system is constructed by introducing a first-order output filter. Then, an input-driven neural switched observer is designed to estimate unmeasurable system states. To deal with the mutual interaction between the triggering and the switching mechanisms and their negative effect on the positive lower bound of inter-execution intervals, an incremental compensation is incorporated in the event-triggering mechanism (ETM) at the output sensor side. At last, a novel event-triggered control scheme built on both sides of the controller and output is proposed, which exhibits superior efficacy compared to the one-side event-triggered control scheme. By using the methods of the average dwell time (ADT) and the backstepping design, it is guaranteed that all signals of the switched closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), and the Zeno phenomenon is excluded. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is validated by using a numerical simulation and a one-link robot system.},

This paper compares a pair of functions for mapping the haptic device commands to handle a remote robot, considering non-identical workspaces and a classic P+d control scheme. As part of the theoretical analysis, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii-based stability analysis is developed in steps, allowing us for determining the boundedness of velocities and coordination errors. Subsequently, the performance of the teleoperation system is compared using two mapping functions. To achieve a fair comparison of results, a test protocol is developed, where different levels of haptic device damping, time delays, and workspace scales are used to evaluate the time to complete the task and the average coordination errors. Based on the results, the mapping function influences the calculation of force feedback, stability of the system, and performance metrics. During a pick-and-place task, a reduction in coordination error is observed when the linear function is chosen, while the time to complete the task is lower when a non-linear function is considered.},

A novel artificial potential function, which is based on a 4 times differential pseudo bump function, is constructed to achieve collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance.

The cooperative formation controller is proven to be stable and can guarantee that there is no collision between any robots and the initial connectivity of the communication network can be always maintained.

Consequently, safeguarding privacy security against the rapidly increasing risk of privacy leakages has become a top priority in modern control systems. This survey aims to offer a comprehensive review of privacy-preserving control and filtering problems in networked control system. First, we review some basic introductions to the privacy-preserving mechanisms from the perspective of control community. Then, we present recent advancements in the design of privacy-preserving strategies for various control and filtering problems. Moreover, several possible future research topics are outlined on the privacy-preserving issue of control systems.},

  abstract     = {The affine formation maneuver (AFM) control problem using the zero-sum differential game is studied for a second-order multi-agent system (MAS) against cyber-injection attacks on the actuators. First and foremost, the distributed control signals and the cyber-injected attack signals are viewed as two competing teams. Then, the leader-follower tracking error system is established where the followers aim to track the AFMs of the leaders. The leader-follower distributed optimal control policies and the cyber-attack attenuation policies are derived from the Nash equilibrium solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaac (HJI) equation. The solution of the HJI equation is estimated with the aid of the critic neural network. The weights of the critic system are learned online based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) scheme. The uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the closed-loop system under the formulated zero-sum differential game control strategy has been proven by the Lyapunov stability theorem. A simulation example illustrates that the presented control method can attenuate cyber-injection attacks on the actuators and maintain the AFMs of the agents.},

To target this problem, a class of virus propagation models with hybrid control scheme are formulated to investigate the dynamic evolution and prevention from a spatial-temporal perspective in this paper. Diffusion-induced Turing instability is detected in response to the computer virus propagation. The introduction of hybrid control scheme can effective suppress Turing instability and turn the propagation system back to a stable state. And then, the time delay is selected as the bifurcation parameter. If the time delay exceeds the bifurcation threshold, the propagation will be destabilised and a Hopf bifurcation will occur. The hybrid control tactic can not only regulate the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation well, but also optimise the properties of bifurcating period solutions. In the end, the correctness and validity of the theoretical results are verified via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear equation systems (NESs) are ubiquitous in scientific and engineering domains, necessitating efficient methods for discovering multiple roots simultaneously. Employing evolutionary algorithms to solve NESs has received significant attention. To simultaneously locate multiple roots in a single run, this paper proposes a differential evolution algorithm with adaptive niching and reinitialisation (DE-ANR). The proposed differential evolution algorithm integrates four strategies to address the challenges posed by NESs. Firstly, DE-ANR employs a dynamic niche size control mechanism to adjust the niche size during evolution, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. Secondly, a lifetime mechanism is introduced to identify stagnating individuals for reinitialisation, ensuring diversity of the population and preventing premature convergence. Thirdly, an improved archive technique is employed to conserve computational resources by eliminating redundant solutions, directing the algorithm’s efforts toward unexplored regions of the solution space. Finally, an adaptive strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust the scaling factor F based on the feedback of evolving population, simplifying parameter tuning. Extensive evaluations on 30 diverse NES problems and the comparison results with 12 state-of-the-art algorithms clearly show the superiority of proposed method.},

Existing strategies use the tracking error to adjust the parametric estimates. Our strategy uses the last component of the identification error to tune these estimates of the model parameters. We prove that this strategy results in bounded estimates of the parameters, and bounded and convergent identification and tracking errors. We emphasise that the proof does not use the Key Technical Lemma. Rather, it uses the properties of square-summable sequences. We extend this strategy to include multiple estimation models and show that all the signals are bounded, and the errors converge. It is also shown that this works whether we switch between the models at every instant and every iteration or at the end of every iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method with a faster convergence using multiple estimation models.},

The existence of time delay leads to the infinite-dimensional problem which makes the explicit solvability more challenging. The main contribution is to propose a discretisation approach which gives the explicit solution of the D-FBSDEs and consists of the following three steps: first, we transform the continuous-time D-FBSDEs into the discrete-time form with the aid of interval partition. Second, we derive the solution of the discrete-time D-FBSDEs by applying backward iterative induction. Finally the explicit solution of the continuous-time D-FBSDEs is obtained by taking the limit to the solution of discrete-time form which is also strictly proved under continuous-time framework. The proposed approach is applicable for more general FBSDEs with delay, which would provide a complete solution to the stochastic LQ control with time delay.},

Furthermore, the proposed control design is modelled with a truncated predictive approach which is also used to compensate the effects of actuator faults and attacks that also satisfy a predefined H ∞ index simultaneously. With the assistance of the Lyapunov stability theory, a novel set of adequate criteria are acquired in terms of LMIs which assure the asymptotical stability of the switched nonlinear CPS under prescribed predefined H ∞ performance levels.

This control design problem has known solutions for continuous-time systems in terms of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) region. However, a systematic solution for a discrete-time system is an open problem due to the non-convexity of the constant damping locus. This paper addresses the problem of placing the closed-loop poles of linear discrete-time uncertain polytopic systems in a constant damping region. The non-convex damping region is approximated to an elliptical segment that represents an LMI region. Criteria for designing state and output feedback (static as well as dynamic) controllers are then derived.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed event-triggered consensus tracking control problem for nonlinear multi-agent systems in the presence of intermittent attacks on both intra- and inter-agent communication channels. Intermittent attacks are characterised by their ability to manipulate the channel transmission factor to disrupt the reliability of communication. First, to address the problem that the agent model knowledge is unknown, a dynamic linearisation method is introduced to transform the nonlinear agent models into equivalent linear models that depend only on the agents&#39; input and output data. Then, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developed to reduce communication transmission, which is based on individual agent information rather than consensus errors to avoid the impact of attacks occurring in the communication between agents. Building upon the attack model and the equivalent linear data model, a distributed model-free adaptive control scheme with dynamic event-triggering is devised to ensure that the consensus errors of all agents are ultimately bounded, even when intermittent attacks occur. The proposed scheme&#39;s effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulation.},

It is worth emphasising that the system under investigation possesses function control coefficients, input matching uncertainty and the polynomial-of-output growth rate, which is essentially different from the existing related literature, and hence brings some technical difficulties to the control design. To solve this problem, an adaptive output-feedback controller with dynamic high-gain and extended state observer is proposed. Remarkably, only one dynamic gain is introduced to overcome the function control coefficients, the serious uncertainty and the polynomial-of-output in the system growth rate. Moreover, under the designed controller, the states of the original system globally converge to zero. Two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Moreover, the distributed ETM utilises only the state information at the triggering instants of neighbouring agents, which eliminates continuous communication among agents while reducing the frequency of controller updates. A general agent-dependent switching law is developed to achieve leader-following mean square consensus of SSMASs. Subsequently, it is proved that under the distributed ETM, linear SSMASs can achieve leader-following mean square consensus and no Zeno behaviour occurs with the help of stochastic analysis and the average dwell time approach.

Under the assumption that the evolution model generating the signal to be estimated is unknown and only the mean and covariance functions of the processes involved in the observation equation are available, recursive algorithms based on linear approximations of the real observations are proposed for the least-squares filtering and fixed-point smoothing problems.

To deal with the system input delay problem, a Pade approximation technique is introduced. By utilising the sampled output of the system, a fuzzy state observer is constructed to estimate the unknown state. A periodic event-triggered mechanism is designed, which can effectively reduce the usage of communication resources. Compared with the traditional event-triggered control manner, a periodic event-triggered control manner only monitors the preset threshold condition at the sampling instant to determine whether to update the current control signal, which can automatically guarantee the minimum lower bound of the execution interval, avoiding the occurrence of Zeno behaviour. Stability analysis verifies that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, and the bipartite tracking error can converge to a small neighbourhood of the origin. Finally, a practical example further verifies the effectiveness of the designed control scheme.},

Two distinct approaches are employed to establish criteria for determining FTSS in systems. The first approach leverages the state transition matrix (STM) method to acquire both necessary and sufficient stability conditions for the simplified models. Furthermore, sufficient conditions for the FTS of the original systems can be obtained. For ease of verification, our second approach integrates the Lyapunov equation with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), offering a framework to obtain control gains.

The disturbances are treated as an extended state and then estimated by introducing an extended state observer. An adaptive variable is used to handle the estimation error between the actual and estimated values of the disturbances. An auxiliary system is designed to mitigate the saturation effect.

Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed adaptive controller that drives a set of agents to user-assigned positions in the presence of the mentioned heterogeneous system anomalies. To address actuator dynamics, a hedging-based reference model is used to decouple adaptive updating from the actuator dynamics. To deal with the coupled dynamics, an observer-based estimation algorithm is proposed. Finally, the low-frequency learning method is used to deal with the high-frequency control response and, therefore, to obtain a better transient performance. The overall closed-loop system&#39;s stability is investigated using the Lyapunov Stability Theory, and the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) technique is employed to identify stability limits regarding the actuator bandwidths of each agent.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a data-driven predictive iterative learning control (DDPILC) for nonlinear nonaffine systems. First, we develop an iterative predictive model (IPM) where an iterative dynamic linearisation technique is introduced for addressing the strong nonlinearities and nonaffine structure. Then, an auto-regressive model is employed to estimate the unavailable parameter of IPM along with the iteration direction. Next, the outputs in the future iterations are predicted pointwisely over the finite operation interval that are further incorporated into the optimal objective function to obtain the optimal control input sequence. In addition, a constrained-DDPILC is extended for systems with I/O constraints which are reformulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI). The two proposed methods do not have model requirement except for I/O data. Simulation study verifies the results.},

  abstract     = {For nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with input saturation and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, an adaptive secure control strategy is investigated in this paper. To estimate the unmeasurable states, a novel switched neural network (NN) observer is designed, where two sub-observers can be freely switched from each other. Considering unnecessary packet transmissions, an improved event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is introduced to reduce the communication burden in the controller-to-actuator channel. In addition, in order to simultaneously solve the input saturation and unknown control direction problems, a Nussbaum-type function is introduced to the control design process. Finally, it is proven that all closed-loop signals are the semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded, and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the adaptive consensus with limited information for a class of uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs). The limited information, meaning the incomplete information transmitted between agents, stems from nonzero-kernel weight matrices of communication networks, which deserves concerns owing to its practical interest such as in privacy preserving and information compression. Apart from the limited/incomplete information, the paper considers nonlinear MASs with large uncertainties (without known upper bounds). This is essentially different from the existing results of linear systems and poses challenges for the design and analysis of adaptive consensus. As for fully distributed protocol design, dynamic high gains are introduced to compensate for the system uncertainties and for the unavailable global graph information. In closed-loop consensus analysis, a new Lyapunov function is constructed by utilising weight and incidence matrices instead of Laplacian matrix. It turns out that the designed protocol can guarantee the boundedness of closed-loop MASs signals and the convergent consensus. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The reference model must track a time-varying signal, and the controller employed can be regarded as one-degree-of-freedom. Then, based on the error between the outputs of the reference model and the plant, another controller is designed to ensure that this mismatch converges to zero. The reference model and the system are described as Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models with nonlinear consequents (N-TS), which allows for separating measured from unmeasured variables. An advantage of the proposed scheme is that the controller for the reference model can be carried out using several methodologies from the literature, whereas the controller that governs the output error can be static or dynamic, whose design is based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Two examples are used to illustrate the validity of the developed control methodology and to compare it to another recent approach in the literature.},

An identification algorithm of the INCTD system which combines the wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), the variance Gaussian kernel function (VGKF) and the grouped method of data handling (GMDH) network is proposed. The data collected by the sensor is decomposed into intrinsic mode function with different nonlinear characteristics using WPD. The GMDH network is applied to mine bidirectional strong nonlinear relationship between input and output data. The VGKF criterion selects the optimal complexity model to enhance the extrapolation performance, and further improves the identification accuracy. Thus, the WPD-GMDH-VGKF identification algorithm is derived. The numerical simulation result verifies that the WPD-GMDH-VGKF identification method can effectively identify the INCTD system, and it is superior to GMDH and WPD-GMDH in terms of identification accuracy. The application case verifies the feasibility of applying the WPD-GMDH-VGKF identification method to the battery management system (BMS).},

These cardinal functions have many useful features, such as cardinality, exponential accuracy and orthogonality. Notice that the exponential accuracy makes it possible to obtain an approximate solution with very high accuracy for the problem under consideration by applying only a small number of basis functions. In this regard, first, the ordinary and fractional integral matrices of the PCCFs are obtained to construct a direct method using them. Then, the constructed approach turns to solve the FOCP under consideration into deriving the solution of an algebraic system (by the aid of approximating the state and control variables based on the PCCFs).

For the considered LRSNG problem, both the open-loop and closed-loop Nash equilibrium are derived. The contributions of this paper are given as follows. Firstly, the open-loop optimal Nash equilibrium is derived, which is determined in terms of the solution to the forward and backward stochastic difference equations (FBSDEs). Furthermore, by using the orthogonal decomposition method and the completing square method, the feedback representation of the optimal Nash equilibrium is derived for the first time.

The SBPM can automatically construct two adjustable secure boundaries, so that the system output meets both the control performance prescribed by the PFTPF and the secure boundary constraint. In order to solve the problem of the excessive control input jitter caused by the sudden change of output constraint, a bidirectional filtering smoothing mechanism (BFSM) is proposed. The proposed SBPM can effectively ensure the safe tracking control of the system with unknown initial tracking condition when the actual output constraint changes suddenly, and ensure that the system has the prescribed finite-time control performance given by the PFTPF. Differently from the existing works, the system output will be strictly constrained into the actual output constraint without the prediction for the system output value.

  abstract     = {In this technical note, the problem of the extended dissipative control for interval type-2 fuzzy model with nonlinear network systems in the event-triggered framework is investigated. A novel dynamic event-triggered strategy is developed to ascertain the instants of activation. It has the advantage of reducing data transmission and optimising the utilisation of communication resources. On the basis of the proposed mechanism, the stochastic Lyapunov function including internal dynamic variables is constructed. Based on this function, coupled with the inequality scaling technique and the application of Dynkin&#39;s formula, we derive a sufficient condition for the system&#39;s stochastic asymptotic stability and extended dissipativity. The design of the dynamic event-triggered extended dissipative controller becomes challenging because the new sufficient condition is nonlinear for some matrix variables. However, utilising the Projection Lemma and the co-design approach, such a controller can be developed based on the obtained analysis result. The methodology is demonstrated through a rigorous numerical simulation case study.},

  abstract     = {Disturbance rejection has always been a major phenomenon in control theory. Disturbances that arise in control of unstable or integrating unstable processes with time delay present considerable difficulties for classical PID controllers. This paper supplies analytical tuning rules, derived from optimum disturbance rejection responses to minimise the error signal according to several integral performance criteria to identify the tuning parameters of the I-PD controller. The provided analytical rules offer the advantage of calculating controller parameters without the necessity of employing an optimisation algorithm. This simplifies the tuning process and allows for a straightforward determination of the controller&#39;s parameters, making it more convenient and efficient for practical implementation in control systems. Comprehensive simulations were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed I-PD controller in terms of disturbance rejection responses, control signals, perturbation in process parameters, measurement noises, TV values, Ms values, and integral performance indicators. Overall, the outcomes demonstrate that the introduced method for the tuning of I-PD controllers offers notable advantages when compared to other tuning methods found in the literature.},

The implementation of the first-order sliding-mode differentiator overcomes the difficulty of calculation explosion. The backstepping method is applied to design the virtual controller step by step, and the actual controller is designed successfully.

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) entails a heterogeneous decision-making problem, which poses challenges for decision-makers (DMs) in generating an optimal solution. To address this, we have proposed a heterogeneous evaluation framework. First, a novel picture fuzzy cross-entropy measure was defined with the simultaneous consideration of uncertainty and hesitancy of picture fuzzy information, overcoming the shortcomings of the existing cross-entropy measure in relation to its validity and properties. Next, an optimisation-model for determining the objective weights of criteria was constructed based on the proposed closeness measurement and the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method. This model was constituted from both objective and subjective perspectives under the circumstance of completely unknown criterion information. Additionally, the conventional Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (MARCOS) method was extended to the picture fuzzy environment, and a normalisation method was developed to transform heterogeneous judgments, including linguistic terms, interval numbers, and picture fuzzy numbers, into a unified representation form. A heterogeneous picture fuzzy SWARA-MARCOS evaluation framework was then established and used to solve a military equipment supplier selection problem. The results demonstrated the validity and feasibility of the proposed evaluation framework, while sensitivity, comparative, and complexity analyses demonstrated the robustness and superiority of it.},

The resulting controller offers numerous benefits, including high robustness, quick transient response, finite-time convergence, and robustness against uncertainties and external disturbances. However, a significant limitation of the proposed PSMC is its reliance on prior knowledge of the disturbance and uncertainty bounds. To address this drawback, a sliding mode observer (SMO) is synthesised to identify uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed controller successfully eliminates the chattering effect without compromising robustness and precision. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the closed-loop system.

Hence, this research work proposes a novel comprehensive approach to design a decentralised fractional order control strategy for higher-order systems using tree seed algorithm. The design focuses on enhancing control performance by imposing constraints on performance indices – the integral of absolute error and closed-loop amplitude ratio. Further, this work incorporates stability analysis through the singular values of the sensitivity function. The proposed decentralised fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller parameters are optimised using the tree seed algorithm. Besides, the stability is examined using the singular values of the sensitivity function. The tree seed algorithm explores the parameter space and converges to optimal controller settings that satisfy the imposed constraints by ensuring system stability. Simulation studies are conducted on various higher-order systems to analyse the proposed approach. The findings demonstrate that the decentralised control with tree seed algorithm-based FOPID controller achieves improved control performance by reducing the loop interactions among subsystems with enhanced stability. Furthermore, robustness is ensured by considering output uncertainty and parameter variations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the fixed-time adaptive event-triggered control problem for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with full-state constraints. The problem of full-state constraints is solved for multiagent systems by utilising a one-to-one nonlinear mapping. The design conditions of the controllers are more easily satisfied than the existing barrier Lyapunov functions strategy. A fixed-time adaptive control scheme is proposed for unconstrained systems that are converted from constrained systems. In contract with the existing finite-time control schemes that rely on the initial states, this restriction condition can be removed in this paper. An improved event-triggered mechanism with an adaptable switching threshold is designed to provide flexible switching between fixed threshold and variable threshold policies, resulting in reduced execution and sampling. It is proved via the Lyapunov stability method that all signals of the closed-loop systems are semi-global practical fixed-time stable. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by some simulation results.},

For computing and minimising the state bound, a numerical linear programming-based algorithm is also presented. The effectiveness of the presented method is verified via two numerical examples.},

The proposed method adopts a fuzzy set to mitigate the impact of uncertainties on state estimation. Specifically, the method derives an empirical distribution within the prediction window using a priori data and constructs a fuzzy sphere set using the Wasserstein metric with the empirical distribution as the sphere centre. This enables the estimation of the state sequence under the worst probability distribution of the fuzzy set. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simple simulation example is conducted to compare its performance with that of traditional moving horizon estimation.

Then, in view of the reachability of the proposed linear-type sliding mode surface (SMS), linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and stochastic stability theory, a novel stochastically stable criterion for the resultant DSMJSs is obtained.

The obstacle of ‘explosion of complex’ occurred in conventional backstepping design can be surmounted by adopting the command filter technique and nonlinearities are approximated by introducing an adaptive neural control approach. To handle the obstacles due to unknown directions and unknown interconnections, Nussbaum-type functions and two smooth functions are used and designed. Meanwhile, error compensation signals are introduced to deal with the problem associated with the dynamic surface method. To constraint the output tracking error within a predefined boundary in finite time, an improved performance function, i.e. finite-time performance function is introduced. Different from existing control results, the developed control methodology does not require any information on the boundedness of dead-zone parameters. It is further proved that the constructed controller not only assures the semi-global boundedness of all the controlled system signals, but also makes the output tracking errors reach within a predefined small set. Finally, both numerical and practical examples are supplied to further validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretic result.},

First, a deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) framework is presented to solve HEV EMS problems subject to a specific driving cycle. To address this limitation, an improved DDP approach, integrating the actual travelled position of the vehicle into the control law, is proposed. This way, a given DDP-based EMS can be applied to all the driving cycles, yet still measured on the same road. Stochastic dynamic programming (SDP)-based EMSs are also developed and prove to be more adaptive to driving scenarios completely different from the ones used for their computation. Real-world driving cycles are employed in all the presented cases, while a reduced HEV powertrain model is used to alleviate the typical DP computational burden.},

This task is particularly intricate when the vehicle must not only overtake its front vehicle safely but also consider the presence of potential opposing vehicles in the opposite lane that it will temporarily occupy. In order to tackle the overtaking task in such challenging scenarios, we introduce a novel integrated framework tailored for vehicle overtaking manoeuvres. Our approach integrates the theories of varying-level control barrier functions (CBF) and time-optimal model predictive control (MPC). The main feature of our proposed overtaking strategy is that it is safe-by-construction, which enables rigorous mathematical proof and validation of the safety guarantees. We show that the proposed framework is applicable when the opposing vehicle is either fully autonomous or driven by human drivers. To demonstrate our framework, we perform a set of simulations for overtaking scenarios under different settings. The simulation results show the superiority of our framework in the sense that it ensures collision-free and achieves better safety performance compared with the standard MPC-based approach without safety guarantees.},

Therefore, we are motivated to investigate a stealthy man-in-the-middle attack strategy that can be applied to switched systems. Specifically, we first investigate how to design a stealthy attack without using mode information. Then, we consider whether the attacker can infer the mode information that can be used to design a stealthy attack.

  abstract     = {Flexible-joint manipulators (FJMs) have been attracting much attention in recent decades. However, position control and vibration suppression of single-input (SI) multi-degrees-of-freedom (multi( ⩾ 3 ⩾ 3 ⩾3 )-DOF) FJM is still a high mountain to climb due to the characteristic that some states of such FJMs cannot be directly controlled by the SI. This paper aims to carry out this challenging research. We present a double-loop frame-based adaptive neural sliding-mode control method for an uncertain horizontal SI 3-DOF FJM, i.e. a two-link FJM with only one actuator at the first joint. Since only the actuator angle can be directly controlled, in the inner loop, we design a torque controller so that the actuator angle tracks a time-varying reference actuator angle, designed in real-time by the outer loop. In the outer loop, we consider the reference actuator angle as a virtual control signal and design it based on the dynamic coupling relationships, aiming to indirectly control the first link to its target position and suppress the vibration of both links. Furthermore, to enhance the transient system performance, we plan the input signal of the outer loop (i.e. the target angle) as a smooth reference-trajectory signal. The validity and superiority of this method are demonstrated in simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with integral control of a class of switched affine systems characterised by time-varying differential equations that, along with the discontinuities caused by the switching, also depend periodically on an exogenous parameter, which is an affine function of time. The goal is to design a state-dependent switching function with integral action that ensures global asymptotic tracking of a trajectory of interest. The integral action is responsible for providing robustness to the system against uncertainties and load variations, whenever the discrepancy between the model and the real system is sufficiently bounded. Due to the integrator, all the convex combinations of the dynamic matrices are non-Hurwitz. In this case, the main difficulty is to guarantee that the time derivative of the Lyapunov function is strictly negative definite, which is done by means of LMIs and conditions on the affine terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Lyapunov-based switching rule with integral action able to ensure global asymptotic tracking of a pre-specified profile. When applied to AC circuits the advantage is to design the switching rule based on the original system, without resorting to averaged models. The theory is illustrated by the control of a three-phase AC-DC converter.},

The attitude control problem has been studied in the last decades and novel solutions have been proposed. Nevertheless, most of the proposed controllers only achieve local or almost global asymptotic stability without considering external disturbances. Contrary to other works, we focus on the problem of achieving almost global exponential stability of the attitude tracking errors in the presence of external disturbances using continuous control laws. We propose an attitude trajectory tracking controller based on the exponential coordinates of rotation in combination with a disturbance observer that estimates the exogenous signals. To solve this problem, we adopt a hierarchical approach, where the proposed control law is divided into a kinematic controller (outer control loop) and a velocity tracking controller (inner control loop). To design the disturbance observer, it is assumed that exogenous signals can be generated by a linear exosystem , i.e. the magnitude and phase of the disturbance are unknown. The almost global exponential stability of the closed-loop dynamics&#39; equilibrium point was proved by a strict Lyapunov function. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed by numerical simulations and experimental tests on a low-cost quadrotor.},

These dual-rate systems, known as slow measurement fast control (SMFC) systems, are characterised by a slow sampling rate of the sensor and a fast updating rate of the controller. To facilitate high-frequency signal tracking, this paper introduces an alternating predictive generalised proportional integral observer (APGPIO). The proposed control method not only effectively restores the system state and captures disturbance changes between samples but also enhances the control bandwidth and anti-disturbance ability, enabling effective tracking of high-frequency reference outputs. By combining it with a fast updating sample-data feedback controller, APGPIO utilises predictive methods to increase the sampling rate of the system&#39;s sensors, matching the update frequency of the controller. Stability analysis demonstrates that the tracking error of this hybrid nonlinear system converges to a bounded region centred at the origin. Finally, the designed method&#39;s high control bandwidth and anti-disturbance ability are demonstrated through multiple sets of simulations using a real system.},

Based on the Hurwitz convex combination and the energy attenuation principle, an improved state-dependent switching strategy is proposed, which switches to the next modes to obey the minimum energy. This approach fully considers the system dynamic of subsystems, which is more general. Considering the complex switching and delay dynamics, a mode-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) that contains a triple integral term is constructed. The generalised free-matrix-based integral inequality (GFMBII) is used to estimate the integral terms in the derivative of the LKF, and an improved delay-dependent stability criterion is established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Further, to guarantee the stability of the STDSs with a large time-varying delay, a controller that considers the time delay and the exponential uncertainty is designed. Under this controller, a less conservative delay-dependent robust stabilisation criterion for STDSs with exponential uncertainty is established. The validity of the proposed methods is validated by two numerical examples and an application in river pollution control.},

Further, the external disturbance weakening the system performance is carefully estimated by deploying an improved equivalent-input-disturbance technique. Then, the availed disturbance estimate is blended into the control algorithm to exterminate the influence of the disturbance acting upon the proffered system. Next, a hybrid-triggered control comprised of a transition among event and time triggered paradigms are considered to reduce the network transmittance and also to simultaneously enhances the system outcomes. On top of that, the perturbations in controller gain matrix are taken into concern in order to make the controller more resilient towards redundant changes. Following that, utilising the Lyapunov theory, we obtain the mean-square asymptotic stability requirements for the developed system with the use of linear matrix inequalities and configure the gain matrices.

  abstract     = {Distributed switched large-scale systems are composed by dynamically coupled subsystems, in which interactions among subsystems vary over time according a switching signal. This paper presents a distributed robust switched model-based predictive control (DSwMPC) to control such systems. The proposed method guarantees stabilising the origin of the whole closed-loop system and ensures the constraints satisfaction in the presence of an unknown switching signal. In the distributed model-based predictive control (DMPC) used in this work, by considering the interactions among subsystems as an additive disturbance, the effect of the switch is reflected on the dynamic equation, local, and consistency constraint sets of the nominal subsystems. To compensate the effect of switching signal which creates a time-varying network topology, a robust tube-based switched model-based predictive control (RSwMPC) with switch–robust control invariant set as the target set robust to unknown mode switching is used as local controller. The scheme performance is assessed using three typical examples. The simulation results show that the input and state constraints are satisfied by the proposed DSwMPC at all times. They also validate that the closed-loop system converges to the origin. Also, a comparison of the DSwMPC with a centralised SwMPC (CSwMPC) and a decentralised SwMPC (DeSwMPC) are performed.},

  abstract     = {The control problem for the multivariable and nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators and autonomous vehicles is solved with the use of a flatness-based control approach which is implemented in successive loops. The state-space model of these robotic systems is separated into two subsystems, which are connected between them in cascading loops. Each one of these subsystems can be viewed independently as a differentially flat system and control about it can be performed with inversion of its dynamics as in the case of input–output linearised flat systems. The state variables of the second subsystem become virtual control inputs for the first subsystem. In turn, exogenous control inputs are applied to the first subsystem. The whole control method is implemented in two successive loops and its global stability properties are also proven through Lyapunov stability analysis. The validity of the control method is confirmed in two case studies: (a) control of a 3-DOF industrial rigid-link robotic manipulator and (b) control of a 3-DOF autonomous underwater vessel. The novel control method can simplify significantly the solution of the nonlinear control problem for robotic manipulators and vehicles. Unlike global linearisation-based control schemes, the proposed flatness-based method in successive loops does not need any changes in state variables of complicated state-space model transformations.},

Different from the existing relevant work, transient dynamics in short-time is focused instead of the Lyapunov stability over infinite-time horizon. Considering the immeasurable system states, output control strategy is developed subject to mismatched modes. Firstly, S-MJSs in closed-loop form are established by designing a hidden mode-dependent output feedback controller. Based on the closed-loop system (CLS), new Lyapunov function relies on both system mode and elapsed-time are created, according to which fresh analysis criteria ensuring FTB and H ∞ FTB are derived. To circumvent the non-convex difficulty arising in controller design, a separation technique is introduced such that the design prerequisites are obtained from the above performance analysis conditions. Finally, the boost converter circuit and a numerical example are borrowed to test the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

Consider deception attacks occurring randomly, a multi-modes round-robin protocol is proposed on the sensor-to-controller channel. Under this protocol, the number of transmitted nodes can be dynamically adjusted according to attack probability and system state so as to balance the relationship between system performance and communication transmission. The fuzzy sliding mode controller depending on the scheduling signal is constructed, whose membership functions (MFs) are different from the ones of the controlled system. In addition, by using the membership-function-dependent (MFD) stability analysis method, appropriate sufficient conditions are derived to ensure both the stochastic stability and the reachability.

To address this problem, a convergent matrix series, the limit of a monotonically decreasing sequence, is first presented as an upper bound of the symmetric positive definite solution of a class of continuous algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs). Compared with the existing studies on this topic, the obtained bounds are more precise. Moreover, by utilising these upper bounds in the LQR problem of adding input redundancies, a class of sufficient conditions is presented to decrease the quadratic performance index. Finally, the corresponding numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results and compare them with the existing results.

First, a mechanism–data fusion-based assessment index construction method is proposed for the key parameter selection. Second, a knowledge extraction strategy for the optimal operating states under multiple working conditions is proposed to construct a benchmark library. Third, a knowledge-enhanced assessment model is built to achieve qualitative performance evaluation and quantitative non-optimal traceability.

Novel real-time adaptive control laws are developed to cope with external perturbations, time-varying delays, and cyber-attack on actuators without requiring the identification of their upper bounds. The proposed method ensures robust performance for time-varying delayed and disturbed nonlinear CPSs, even in the face of strong cyber-attacks targeting the actuators. Moreover, the proposed method has distinct advantages: it delivers rapid response times, enhanced flexibility, exceptional accuracy, smooth and robust control devoid of transient fluctuations or chattering, and ensures finite-time convergence.

Based on such a triggering mechanism, a D-I based event-triggered robust MPC algorithm is proposed to stabilise the system and reduce the computation/communication resource consumption. In addition, sufficient conditions to ensure the feasibility and stability of the proposed MPC algorithm and avoid Zeno behaviour are obtained through rigorous theoretical analysis.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy control has become one of the most effective tools for dealing with complex engineering processes. Over the years, research on fuzzy control systems has continuously evolved, witnessing numerous theoretical contributions and successful real-world achievements. The concept of model-free or data-driven fuzzy control was initially introduced with specific heuristics incorporated into the design. Due to the lack of a systematic framework for stability analysis in model-free fuzzy control, the significance of model-based fuzzy control has grown extensively. This approach ensures systematic design based on precise fuzzy models of the process. This survey focuses on the fundamental aspects of three prominent classes of fuzzy control. First, the paper commences with a review of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy control systems. This includes discussions on stability analysis and controller design, exploring techniques to derive less conservative and/or complex results from a numerical burden perspective. Second, various aspects of data-driven fuzzy control are analysed in detail including a classification of the most popular data-driven control techniques and their combination with fuzzy control; a representative Iterative Feedback Tuning-based fuzzy controller is described. Third, this survey explores the fundamental aspects of evolving fuzzy control, with a particular emphasis on the significance of stability and control laws, which are not usually the primary focus of evolving intelligent systems research. For each discussed class of fuzzy control, the paper provides a selective list of mechatronics applications to illustrate their performance effectiveness, emphasising research papers published after 2011. Finally, drawing from recent advances in fuzzy control theory and mechatronics applications, future research directions and associated challenges are discussed.},

  abstract     = {A Markov-modulated non-homogeneous Poisson process (MMNPP), whose intensity process is designed to capture both the cyclical and nonrecurring trends, is considered for modelling the total count of cyber incidents. Extending the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm for the current MMPP literature, we derive the filters and smoothers to support the MMNPP online parameter estimation. A scaling transformation is introduced to address the numerical issue for large data sizes whilst maintaining accuracy. The filter- and smoother-based EM algorithms are then benchmarked to the maximum likelihood-based EM algorithm at the theoretical level. The differences emerge in the E-step of the EM procedure. Both the filtering and smoothing schemes, in conjunction with the change-of-measure technique, avoid the computing complication caused by the hidden regimes. In contrast to the usual EM algorithm, the said two algorithms could be implemented given only the incident counts data without the specific times of jumps. Within the data compiled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the filter-based algorithm performs better than the algorithm involving smoothers. The benchmarked algorithm may do well in calibration under the presence of extreme incident counts with an extremely low frequency; however, overfitting may occur. For most practical applications involving 2 or 3 regimes, both algorithms are superior when it comes to efficiency, real-time update, and low computational cost. The benchmarked algorithm is better when there are more regimes under relatively closer intensities. Overall, the filter-based algorithm gives better estimation, especially if there is a low-frequency regime and the flexible binning of the data set is an important consideration.},

Our model which based on a variational encoder introduces a novel channel-attention block to enhance the ability to capture dynamic objects in video frames and a Luenberger-type observer which catches the dynamic evolution of the latent features. These enable the features of moving objects more conspicuous and decomposition of videos into static features and dynamics in an unsupervised manner. By deriving the stability theory of the nonlinear Luenberger-type observer, the hidden states in the feature space become insensitive with respect to the initial values, which improves the robustness of the overall model. Furthermore, the variational lower bound on the data log-likelihood can be derived to obtain the tractable posterior prediction distribution based on the variational principle. Finally, the experiments including the Rotaton Numbers dataset and the K th dataset are provided to demonstrate the proposed model outperforms concurrent works.},

  abstract     = {This article concentrates on the finite-time nonfragile distributed dissipative filtering issue for time-varying switched stochastic systems (SSSs) with state saturations over wireless sensor networks based on FlexRay communication protocol. To effectively deal with the resource restriction problem of the public communication network and energy consumption of the sensor nodes, the FlexRay communication protocol, including the Round-Robin protocol (RRP) and weighted try-once-discard protocol (WTODP), is introduced to schedule the data transmission of each sensor node. In addition, the phenomenon of randomly occurring gain variations (ROGVs) of filter parameters, characterised by the Bernoulli distributed random variables, is taken into consideration for the implementation of desired filter. A sufficient condition under the average dwell time (ADT) restriction is presented to guarantee the mean-square exponential stability and stochastically dissipative property of the augmented filtering error system (AFES) in a finite horizon. Moreover, the gains of the dissipativity-based filters are achieved by solving recursive linear matrix inequalities (RLMIs). Finally, an illustrative example is provided to exhibit the effectiveness of the designed filter.},

Secondly, the coverage-based controller is designed for each agent by optimising the objective function concerning its respective visibility-limited Voronoi set on the manoeuvrable domain outside the collision hazard area, ensuring that the agent&#39;s trajectories remain within the target area.

The primary objective is to address the instability issue identified in existing approaches in the continuous-time domain, as formulated by Enns for frequency-weighted scenarios and Gawronski &amp; Juang for frequency-limited-interval scenarios. Despite numerous solutions proposed in the literature to mitigate this problem, a persistent challenge remains the high approximation error between the original and reduced-order systems. To overcome this limitation, the proposed improved techniques focus on ensuring stability in reduced-order models while simultaneously minimising the approximation error between the original and reduced systems. Furthermore, these enhanced techniques provide a computationally straightforward, a priori error bound formula. Numerical findings underscore the correctness and efficiency of the proposed techniques in reducing the approximation error while maintaining stability, thereby substantiating their efficacy.},

The identification of failure times in thermal systems, which are subject to partial differential equations, presents significant difficulties, especially due to their ill-posed nature, which makes them highly sensitive to measurement errors. A Bayesian inference framework was previously developed in a related study, aiming to solve inverse heat conduction problems by utilising temperature measurements from sensors to estimate failure times or potential restarts of fixed heat sources. This paper focuses on the case of mobile sources, where a set of fixed sensors is considered and the trajectories of the heating sources are known and follow a constant velocity. The main objective is to accurately identify the failing heat sources and determine the exact failure time, as well as the possibility of resuming normal operation. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to assess the impact of sensor measurements.},

Then, it proves that the proposed algorithmic framework converges to the optimal solution of the Wasserstein logistic regression problem. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted, which illustrate the efficient implementation for high-dimensional sparsity data. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithmic framework outperforms not only the off-the-shelf solvers, but also some existing first-order algorithms.},

Then, based on the theory of finite-time stability and dynamic surface control (DSC) scheme, a fuzzy adaptive formation tracking control algorithm is presented, which can solve the problem of unknown dead zones for USVs and have the advantages of avoiding collision and preserving connectivity, and also ensures that all the signals are bounded in finite-time bounded.

A sliding mode-based unknown input observer is designed to realise finite-time fault diagnosis and state estimation for the transformed descriptor system. Furthermore, based on the estimation, a distributed robust FTC protocol is developed to guarantee the consensus of MAS against the actuator and sensor faults.

To reconstruct the states of MASs and guarantee secure average consensus, a novel observer-based impulsive secure control protocol is put forward, and some sufficient conditions are derived by means of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and Lyapunov method. It should be pointed out that both the proposed state observer and control protocol adjust the state value abruptly at some discrete instants in an impulsive manner. Moreover, the considered asynchronous DoS attack model can allow jam each channel independently, under which the decay rates of different attack modes are estimated.

Building upon this method, our research expands its applicability to bipartite consensus and scale consensus. In bipartite consensus, the method can also accurately achieve consensus while guaranteeing privacy. In contrast, scale consensus effectively protects the privacy of the final consistency result.

In WNCSs, packets may be randomly lost in both control and observation channels, and non-acknowledgement (non-ACK) mechanisms (e.g. UDP-like protocols) are generally adopted to achieve real-time control and reduce energy consumption. For general non-ACK systems, it is well known that the optimal controller is not yet available, and the performance of existing suboptimal controllers is poor because they either adopt a fixed control law or rely on a poorly performing filter. By using a moment-preserving Gaussian approximation approach, an efficient filter is proposed to approximately estimate system states. Based on the approximate state estimates of the proposed filter, an approximate optimal controller with a time-varying control gain for WNCSs is further designed by using a dynamic programming approach. The proposed controller has excellent performance and becomes the optimal controller under special system parameters.

The goal of the SLAM technique is to simultaneously map the surrounding environment and obtain the ego-motion of the sensing platform. As the number of application scenarios of SLAM systems increases and related tasks become more complex, SLAM systems based on a single sensor are no longer sufficient to meet the demands, thus the trend for SLAM systems based on multi-sensor fusion has emerged. In this paper, we review the SLAM systems from the perspective of various configurations of heterogeneous sensors. These configurations include visual-inertial, lidar-inertial, lidar-visual, lidar-visual-inertial, and other multi-sensor fusion systems. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of each configuration are also given. Based on the review, several open issues for further research are discussed at the end of this paper.},

  abstract     = {To control unstable and stable plants a new series cascade control structure (SCCS) is proposed. The proposed SCCS incorporates two or three controllers (setpoint tracking controller, secondary disturbance rejection controller and stabilising controller for only unstable plants). Internal model control scheme (IMCS) augmented with integration of square error (ISE) minimisation along with robustness considerations are applied to design the secondary loop disturbance rejection controller. In contrast, relocated IMCS augmented with ISE minimisation is applied for the outer loop or setpoint tracking controller. Routh Hurwitz stability criteria and maximum sensitivity considerations are used to design the proportional-derivative (PD) controller, which stabilises the unstable plant. It is important to note that the suggested SCCS only needs four controller parameters to be tuned, which is less than the recently reported techniques. Robust stability analysis of the proposed SCCS is performed in the presence of uncertainty. The simulation results depict that the suggested approach imparts pre-eminent improvement in closed-loop performance such as faster setpoint tracking and better disturbance rejection for nominal and perturbed plants.},

Each subsystem of the SFSs is a high-order system with a full actuation structure. In contrast to the traditional first-order state space method, the proposed control method directly treats each high-order subsystem as a whole without transforming it into a first-order system, which is a concise and efficient treatment. By introducing a series of first-order low-pass filters in each step of the design, the high-order derivatives of the virtual control law are obtained, and the complex and multiple derivation operations are transformed into simple algebraic operations. The Barrier Lyapunov function is combined to ensure that the output of the system satisfies the given constraints. And the Lyapunov theory is used to prove that all signals in the closed-loop system are ultimately uniformly bounded, and its output can accurately track the desired reference signal without violating the given constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified by simulations of an actual manipulator system.},

To improve the control performance and lessen the impact of measurement noise on actuators, tuning formulas under arbitrary comprehensive robustness measures are proposed to meet more control needs, the filtered PID/PIDD 2 (PID plus second derivative) is used under the promise of acceptable performance of robustness and disturbance rejection. Many chemical production processes can be approximated to the common model with integrators, to improve the chemical production process efficiency, tuning rules of filtered PID/PIDD 2 controllers are proposed for different integrating processes in terms of relative order to make better trade-offs. Simulation results show that the proposed tuning formula can reduce the impact of noise and achieve proper compromising among robustness, disturbance rejection and measurement noise.},

Different from most existing results, the lumped uncertainty, including external disturbances and model uncertainties, is relaxed to be bounded by some nonlinear functions rather than constants in this paper. Based upon the classical design procedure of disturbance observer-based control (DOBC), a new continuous saturation-based dynamic controller is proposed to estimate the lumped uncertainty. By the delicate design of several compact sets, the qualitative robust stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed in the sense that all the signals of the closed-loop system can converge to an arbitrarily small compact set in a finite time. Furthermore, when the external disturbances are constants, the semi-global asymptotic stability can also be guaranteed by the proposed controller. Finally, the relationship between system uncertainties and observer gain is shown by a numerical simulation example.},

In order to overcome the impact of potential network attacks, we truncate the relative inputs of the proposed protocols, namely the exchange of communication information between neighbouring agents is forbidden, so that the closed-loop leader-following MAS is inherently immune to being attacked and achieves consensus. Additionally, the improved attack-free protocols not only allow arbitrarily large yet bounded delays, but also only relative output measurement can be available, which reduces the communication burden and thus are easy to implement in practice.

To this end, inspired by the idea of quantised control, a quantised data-driven adaptive iterative learning bipartite consensus (AILBC) method is proposed. Specifically, to address the problem of varying trial lengths, a distributed auxiliary output prediction system is constructed based on the agents&#39; input-output (I/O) dynamic relationship. An adaptive update protocol is developed to estimate the measurement disturbances and unknown parameters of I/O dynamic relationship. Subsequently, a quantised distributed data-driven iterative learning control (ILC) approach based on the quantised output information is proposed for MASs to achieve robust bipartite consensus tracking, with an attempt to relax the need of explicit model information. The bipartite consensus tracking errors are ultimately bounded through rigorous analysis, and this result is further extended to switching topologies. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the validity of the AILBC method.},

Hence, the coupling structure between the electromagnetic points in a levitation module calls for safe and collaborative control. To achieve this goal, this study proposes a novel collaborative levitation control scheme with physical contact prevention. Considering operational safety requirements confronted by the levitation system, a barrier function is introduced to address the physical contact problem, which strictly limits the levitation gap within an allowable range. Moreover, considering the transient response of the controlled system, the predefined-time stability is synthesised, which ensures that the tracking errors converge to a very small neighbourhood of zero within an arbitrarily settling time determined by users. This brings great convenience of tuning controller parameters and avoids non-trivial tuning with a large set of parameters by trails and errors. In addition, quadratic functions are integrated to guarantee the nonsingularity of control signals to enhance practicality. A series of numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Firstly, with the rapid popularisation of the ESG concept and the deepening of the conception of green and low-carbon development, the performance of a firm in protecting and improving the ecological environment and the level of green technology investment has gradually become the reference criteria for judging whether the firm has social value and sustainability in development. Secondly, to pursue short-term survival and long-term development, the firm will also vigorously strive for short-term profit creation and long-term capital accumulation. Thirdly, due to the existence of information asymmetry, the principal-agent parties in a firm may generate agency conflicts in the pursuit of maximising their own interests, which may lead to losses or even bankruptcy. Therefore, making rational short-term, long-term, and green technology investment decisions that consider both characteristics of firm and agency conflicts is essential for the survival and sustainable development of the firm. From the perspective of contract theory, this paper considers the design of an optimal dynamic financial contract that considers the environment&#39;s improvement and the achievement of the firm&#39;s long- and short-term financial performance while satisfying incentive compatibility. On this basis, we explore how the optimal investment strategies vary with firm characteristics. The results of the study suggest that the decisions of green technology investment, short-term investment, and long-term capital investment should be appropriately adjusted according to the level of financial slack and the effect of different market shocks to facilitate the achievement of the dual objectives of long- and short-term profitability and environmental improvement.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates the double tracking control problem for the complex dynamic network (CDN) with an unavailable link state. Firstly, from the angle of a large-scale system, the dynamical model of CDN is described by the vector differential equations, which consists of node dynamic subsystem (NDS) and link dynamic subsystem (LDS), in which the weighted-values of links are regarded as the state variables of LDS. Secondly, to realise the double tracking control (DT-Control) of CDN, the presented DT-Control scheme in this paper includes the synthesis of controller for NDS and the coupling term in LDS, which can ensure that the two subsystems track the given reference targets. The tracking of NDS contains the synchronisation of nodes as the special case, and the tracking of LDS shows that the eventual topologic structure of CDN will be determined only by the given link reference signal. Due to the economic and technological limitations of sensors in the practice applications, this paper assumes that the state variables of LDS are unavailable in the DT-Control scheme. Finally, the engineering simulation example is given to verify the validity of DT-Control scheme proposed in this paper.},

To minimise the total operating cost under various constraints, a switched distributed coordination algorithm is presented to solve the EDP over the unreliable communication network with the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this situation, the proposed algorithm integrates the normal mode and the attack mode. The attackers can make the communication network unconnected and destroy the convergence and optimality in the attack mode. In order to explore under what conditions the optimal solution can still be obtained, we model the attack modes by differential inclusions and use an average dwell-time automaton and time-ratio monitor to limit the DoS attacks. Then, the switched distributed algorithm is modelled as a hybrid dynamical system. Furthermore, some conditions are derived to guarantee the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm under DoS attacks. Finally, simulation results tested on the IEEE 30-bus power system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Subsequently, a type of smooth approximate model is introduced to settle the nondifferentiable phenomenon of output dead-zones. To reduce the computational overhead of the communication operation effectively, an improved event-triggered control strategy including a decreasing hyperbolic tangent function related to dead-zone, is applied to determine the actual control input. In addition, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is fabricated to address the issue of partial state constraint. By theoretical analysis, the reference signal can be precisely tracked by the system output and all closed-loop signals remain uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB).

All the virtual controllers and the actual controller are designed as the optimised solution of the corresponding subsystems to ensure the entire obtained controllers are optimised. To ensure that the states of the system are constrained within some given compact sets, the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is used to design the controller and perform stability analysis.

Further, the PIO strategy is employed to estimate the states of the undertaken system with high precision wherein the integral term in PIO enhances the system&#39;s design flexibility and also increases its robustness. Taking advantage of these characteristics, a PIO-based tracking control is configured with gain perturbations to track the desired reference states. Moreover, to attenuate the implications made by disturbances in considered system design, H ∞ performance is employed. Furthermore, in order to establish adequate conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities, the time-varying polynomial Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is implemented. Then, the time-varying gain matrices of the control scheme and PIO configuration are computed by solving the obtained criteria through the MATLAB platform.

A cost function is designed to optimise the state and control input of switched systems by minimising its upper bound, and the optimisation problem is further transformed into a feasibility problem. Moreover, a control barrier function is introduced to constrain the controller gains, which ensures that the initial state of switched systems converges to the steady state without entering the specified unsafe region.

  abstract     = {The predefined-time fuzzy adaptive output feedback decentralised control problem is considered for fractional-order nonlinear large-scale (FONLS) systems. Firstly, by using fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) to model unknown nonlinear dynamics, a fuzzy decentralised state observer is designed to solve the immeasurable state problem. Secondly, the predefined-time stability criterion of fractional-order nonlinear systems is proposed, and then, based on the established predefined-time stability criterion of the fractional-order nonlinear systems, a predefined-time fuzzy adaptive output feedback decentralised control method is developed by combining the backstepping design technique with the cyclic-small-gain approach, and the semi-global practically predefined-time stable (SGPPTS) of the control system is proved. Finally, the numerical simulation is given and shows the effectiveness of the presented predefined-time control method.},

Firstly, by employing adaptive control strategies and finite-time stability theory, a finite-time adaptive simultaneous stabilisation scheme for the nonlinear time-delay systems is developed. Secondly, utilising the orthogonal decomposition method, a finite-time robust adaptive simultaneous stabilisation scheme for nonlinear time-delay systems with external disturbances is proposed.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the leader-following consensus problem of Lur&#39;e multi-agent systems (MASs) under undirected topologies, in which the leader has an unknown input. First, based only on the relative outputs among neighbouring agents, a distributed unknown input observer (UIO) is introduced to estimate the relative state of each follower, and the observation errors can exponentially converge to zero. Then, we propose an observer-based discontinuous controller with adaptive gains and demonstrate that the tracking errors can converge to zero. Subsequently, we further propose an observer-based continuous controller with adaptive gains under which chattering phenomenon can be avoided. Unlike the related works, both controllers can achieve leader-following consensus in a fully distributed manner, meaning that they do not depend on the global communication topology structure and the upper bound of the leader&#39;s input. Furthermore, two tractable algorithms are devised for computing the gain matrices. Finally, some simulation examples are presented on Chua&#39;s circuit system to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the event-triggered ℒ 2 − ℒ ∞ L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ control problem for discrete-time Markov jump systems with DoS attacks and exogenous disturbance. Instead of one common event-triggering scheme, multiple triggering schemes are introduced to sample system signals and the event-triggered Markov closed-loop jump systems are further obtained under the full state feedback controller. Generally, mode information of subsystems is not completely available for the modules of trigger and controller such that asynchronous jump behaviour may occur among the modes of subsystems, triggering scheme and controller. Thus, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is developed to describe such asynchronous behaviour. Meanwhile, security issues of networks are widely studied in recent many literature. For discrete-time Markov jump systems, few works consider cyber attacks, especially periodic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Based on the HMM, the DoS attacks are taken into account and a set of sufficient conditions are further presented to guarantee the L 2 − L ∞ control performance of the resulting Markov closed-loop jump systems. Subsequently, the design of controller and event-triggering parameters are provided by using matrix inequality method. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Reference regulation of uncertain systems is investigated in the discrete-time case. Hence, including the uncertainties and constraints, through a prediction-based controller, the set-point following will be robustly fulfilled in a class of uncertain systems. A novel idea is addressed to achieve this goal optimally. Thus the control synthesis is deliberately transformed into an optimisation issue subjected to some matrix inequality. In the real-time implementation, the controller’s parameters would be obtained when a minimisation problem is solved. The applicability of the method is evaluated in some examples. The superiority and robustness of the suggested procedure are remarkably validated by comparing it with a similar one.},
