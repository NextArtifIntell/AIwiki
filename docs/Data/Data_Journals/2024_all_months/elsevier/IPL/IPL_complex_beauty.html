Whereas the problem is known to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on undirected graphs, the status of Longest ( s , t ) (s,t) -Detour on directed graphs remains highly unclear: it is not even known to be solvable in polynomial time for k = 1 k=1 . Recently, Fomin et al. made progress in this direction by showing that the problem is FPT on every class of directed graphs where the 3-Disjoint Paths problem is solvable in polynomial time. We improve upon their result by weakening this assumption: we show that only a polynomial-time algorithm for 2-Disjoint Paths is required.},

  abstract     = {The seminal work of Charikar et al. [1] called Count-Sketch suggests a sketching algorithm for real-valued vectors that has been used in frequency estimation for data streams and pairwise inner product estimation for real-valued vectors etc. One of the major advantages of Count-Sketch over other similar sketching algorithms, such as random projection, is that its running time, as well as the sparsity of sketch, depends on the sparsity of the input. Therefore, sparse datasets enjoy space-efficient (sparse sketches) and faster running time. However, on dense datasets, these advantages of Count-Sketch might be negligible over other baselines. In this work, we address this challenge by suggesting a simple and effective approach that outputs (asymptotically) a sparser sketch than that obtained via Count-Sketch , and as a by-product, we also achieve a faster running time. Simultaneously, the quality of our estimate is closely approximate to that of Count-Sketch . For frequency estimation and pairwise inner product estimation problems, our proposal Sparse-Count-Sketch provides unbiased estimates. These estimations, however, have slightly higher variances than their respective estimates obtained via Count-Sketch . To address this issue, we present improved estimators for these problems based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) that offer smaller variances even w.r.t. Count-Sketch . We suggest a rigorous theoretical analysis of our proposal for frequency estimation for data streams and pairwise inner product estimation for real-valued vectors.},

It is known that there exist sequences of formulas that require exponential-size proofs in regular resolution while admitting polynomial-size proofs in resolution. Thus, with respect to the usual notion of simulation, regular resolution is separated from resolution. An alternative, and weaker, notion for comparing proof systems is that of an “effective simulation,” which allows the translation of the formula along with the proof when moving between proof systems. We prove that regular resolution is equivalent to resolution under effective simulations. As a corollary, we recover in a black-box fashion a recent result on the hardness of automating regular resolution.},

  abstract     = {We propose a framework for speeding up maximum flow computation by using predictions. A prediction is a flow, i.e., an assignment of non-negative flow values to edges, which satisfies the flow conservation property, but does not necessarily respect the edge capacities of the actual instance (since these were unknown at the time of learning). We present an algorithm that, given an m -edge flow network and a predicted flow, computes a maximum flow in O ( m η ) O(mη) time, where η is the ℓ 1 ℓ1 error of the prediction, i.e., the sum over the edges of the absolute difference between the predicted and optimal flow values. Moreover, we prove that, given an oracle access to a distribution over flow networks, it is possible to efficiently PAC-learn a prediction minimizing the expected ℓ 1 ℓ1 error over that distribution. Our results fit into the recent line of research on learning-augmented algorithms, which aims to improve over worst-case bounds of classical algorithms by using predictions, e.g., machine-learned from previous similar instances. So far, the main focus in this area was on improving competitive ratios for online problems. Following Dinitz et al. (2021) [6] , our results are among the firsts to improve the running time of an offline problem.},

We then study the parameterized complexity of a generalization of this problem, where U U is a set of points in IR d IRd and F F is a collection of set of axis−parallel hyperplanes in IR d IRd under different parameterizations, where d is a constant. For every parameter, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable and also show the existence of a polynomial kernel.

In Lie theory, matrix exponential plays a crucial role between Lie groups and Lie algebras. Meanwhile, as finite analogues of Lie groups, finite groups of Lie type also have wide application scenarios in mathematics and physics owning to their unique mathematical structures. In this context, it is meaningful to explore the potential applications of finite groups of Lie type in cryptography. In this paper, we firstly built the relationship between matrix exponential and discrete logarithmic problem (DLP) in finite groups of Lie type. Afterwards, we proved that the complexity of solving non-abelian factorization (NAF) problem is polynomial with the rank n of the finite group of Lie type. Furthermore, combining with the Algebraic Span, we proposed an efficient algorithm for solving group factorization problem (GFP) in finite groups of Lie type. Therefore, it&#39;s still an open problem to devise secure cryptosystems based on Lie theory.},

  abstract     = {The graph searches Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) and the spanning trees constructed by them are some of the most basic concepts in algorithmic graph theory. BFS trees are first-in trees, i.e., every vertex is connected to its first visited neighbor. DFS trees are last-in trees, i.e., every vertex is connected to the last visited neighbor before it. The problem whether a given spanning tree can be the first-in tree or last-in tree of a graph search ordering was introduced in the 1980s and has been studied for several graph searches and graph classes. Here, we consider the problem of deciding whether a given spanning tree of a bipartite graph can be a first-in tree or a last-in tree of the Lexicographic Breadth First Search (LBFS), a special variant of BFS that is commonly used in graph algorithms. We show that the recognition of both first-in trees and last-in trees of LBFS is NP NP -hard even if the start vertex of the search ordering is fixed and the height of the tree is four. We prove that the bound on the height is tight (unless P = NP P=NP ) by showing that for all spanning trees of bipartite graphs with height smaller than four we can solve both search tree recognition problems of LBFS in polynomial time. Finally, we give a linear-time algorithm that solves both problems for chordal bipartite graphs and fixed start vertices.},

  abstract     = {We consider the following Markov Reachability decision problems that view Markov Chains as Linear Dynamical Systems: given a finite, rational Markov Chain, source and target states, and a rational threshold, does the probability of reaching the target from the source at the n t h nth step: (i) equal the threshold for some n ? (ii) cross the threshold for some n ? (iii) cross the threshold for infinitely many n ? These problems are respectively known to be equivalent to the Skolem, Positivity, and Ultimate Positivity problems for Linear Recurrence Sequences (LRS), number-theoretic problems whose decidability has been open for decades. We present an elementary reduction from LRS Problems to Markov Reachability Problems that improves the state of the art as follows. (a) We map LRS to ergodic (irreducible and aperiodic) Markov Chains that are ubiquitous, not least by virtue of their spectral structure, and (b) our reduction maps LRS of order k to Markov Chains of order k + 1 k+1 : a substantial improvement over the previous reduction that mapped LRS of order k to reducible and periodic Markov chains of order 4 k + 5 4k+5 . This contribution is significant in view of the fact that the number-theoretic hardness of verifying Linear Dynamical Systems can often be mitigated by spectral assumptions and restrictions on order.},

In this problem, we are given a graph G , two numbers k , p k,p and 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 0≤α≤1 , the question is whether there is a set S ⊆ V S⊆V of size k with a specified coverage function cov α ( S ) covα(S) at least p (or at most p for the minimization version). The coverage function cov α ( ⋅ ) covα(⋅) counts edges with exactly one endpoint in S with weight α and edges with both endpoints in S with weight 1 − α 1−α . α -FCGP generalizes a number of fundamental graph problems such as Densest k -Subgraph , Max k -Vertex Cover , and Max ( k , n − k ) (k,n−k) -Cut . A natural question in the study of α -FCGP is whether the algorithmic results known for its special cases, like Max k -Vertex Cover , could be extended to more general settings. One of the simple but powerful methods for obtaining parameterized approximation [Manurangsi, SOSA 2019] and subexponential algorithms [Fomin et al.

We consider the environment in four possible scenarios: rectangular, L -shaped, C -shaped or O -shaped grid polygon. An on-line strategy has been proposed for these scenarios.

In the case of treedepth computation, the enumeration of inclusion-wise minimal separators plays a crucial role. However and quite surprisingly, the complexity status of this problem has not been settled since it has been posed as an open direction by Kloks and Kratsch in 1998. Recently at the PACE 2020 competition dedicated to treedepth computation, solvers have been circumventing that by listing all minimal a - b separators and filtering out those that are not inclusion-wise minimal, at the cost of efficiency. Naturally, having an efficient algorithm for listing inclusion-wise minimal separators would drastically improve such practical algorithms. In this note, however, we show that no efficient algorithm is to be expected from an output-sensitive perspective, namely, we prove that there is no output-polynomial time algorithm for inclusion-wise minimal separators enumeration unless P = NP P=NP .},

Synthesising these two approaches yields a semantic concept of flowers, which offers a more effective way of dealing with the complexity of ω -regular languages. This letter provides a comprehensive definition of semantic flowers and shows that it captures the complexity of ω -regular languages.

  abstract     = {Treasure hunt and rendezvous are fundamental tasks performed by mobile agents in graphs. In treasure hunt, an agent has to find an inert target (called treasure) situated at an unknown node of the graph. In rendezvous, two agents, initially located at distinct nodes of the graph, traverse its edges in synchronous rounds and have to meet at some node. We assume that the graph is connected (otherwise none of these tasks is feasible) and consider deterministic treasure hunt and rendezvous algorithms. The time of a treasure hunt algorithm is the worst-case number of edge traversals performed by the agent until the treasure is found. The time of a rendezvous algorithm is the worst-case number of rounds since the wakeup of the earlier agent until the meeting. To the best of our knowledge, all known treasure hunt and rendezvous algorithms rely on the assumption that degrees of all nodes are finite, even when the graph itself may be infinite. In the present paper we remove this assumption for the first time, and consider both above tasks in arbitrary connected graphs whose nodes can have either finite or countably infinite degrees. Our main result is the first universal treasure hunt algorithm working for arbitrary connected graphs. We prove that the time of this algorithm has optimal order of magnitude among all possible treasure hunt algorithms working for arbitrary connected graphs. As a consequence of this result we obtain the first universal rendezvous algorithm working for arbitrary connected graphs. The time of this algorithm is polynomial in a lower bound holding in many graphs, in particular in the tree all of whose degrees are infinite.},

For unordered trees the problem of finding a maximum-weight Tai mapping is known to be NP-complete [2] . In this work, we define an anti Tai mapping M ⊆ V 1 × V 2 M⊆V1×V2 as a binary relation between two unordered labeled trees such that any two ( x , y ) , ( x ′ , y ′ ) ∈ M (x,y),(x′,y′)∈M violate ancestor relationship and thus cannot be part of the same Tai mapping, i.e. ( x ≤ x ′ ⇔ y ≰ y ′ ) ∨ ( x ′ ≤ x ⇔ y ′ ≰ y ) (x≤x′⇔y≰y′)∨(x′≤x⇔y′≰y) , given an ancestor order x &lt; x ′ x&amp;lt;x′ meaning that x is an ancestor of x ′ x′ . Finding a maximum-weight anti Tai mapping arises in the cutting plane method for solving the maximum-weight Tai mapping problem via integer programming . We give an efficient polynomial-time algorithm for finding a maximum-weight anti Tai mapping for the case when one of the two trees is a path and further show how to extend this result in order to provide a polynomially computable lower bound on the optimal anti Tai mapping for two unordered labeled trees. The latter result stems from the special class of anti Tai mappings defined by the more restricted condition x ∼ x ′ ⇔ y ≁ y ′ x∼x′⇔y≁y′ , where ∼ denotes that two nodes belong to the same root-to-leaf path. For this class, we give an efficient algorithm that solves the problem exactly on two unordered trees in O ( | V 1 | 2 | V 2 | 2 ) O(|V1|2|V2|2) .},

  abstract     = {Consider the following model to study adversarial effects on opinion forming. A set of initially selected experts form their binary opinion while being influenced by an adversary, who may convince some of them of the falsehood. All other participants in the network then take the opinion of the majority of their neighboring experts. Can the adversary influence the experts in such a way that the majority of the network believes the falsehood? Alon et al. [2] conjectured that in this context an iterative dissemination process will always be beneficial to the adversary. In this note we provide a counterexample to that conjecture.},

An undirected graph is semi-transitive if it admits a semi-transitive orientation. Recognizing semi-transitive orientability of a graph is an NP-complete problem. A split graph is a graph in which the vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set . Semi-transitive orientability of split graphs was recently studied in a series of papers in the literature. The main result in this paper is proving that recognition of semi-transitive orientability of split graphs can be done in a polynomial time .},

This is a fundamental computational problem arising in directed hypergraphs, and is a foundational step in tackling problems of reachability and redundancy. This problem was previously explored in the context of general directed hypergraphs (containing cycles), where it is NP-hard, and acyclic B-hypergraphs, where a linear time algorithm can be achieved. In a surprising contrast, we find that for acyclic F-hypergraphs the problem is NP-hard, which also implies the problem is hard in BF-hypergraphs. This is a striking complexity boundary given that F-hypergraphs and B-hypergraphs would at first seem to be symmetrical to one another. We provide the proof of complexity and explain why there is a fundamental asymmetry between the two classes of directed hypergraphs.},

In this paper, we show that if each update occurs locally around a single vertex, then a single execution of Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm is sufficient to preserve optimality with the aid of a dual solution. As an application of our result, we provide a faster implementation of the envy-cycle procedure for finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible items.

Woeginger [17] claimed that the problem has no APTAS for dimensions greater than or equal to 2. We note that there was a slight oversight in the original proof. In this work, we give a revised proof using some additional ideas from [3] , [8] . In fact, we show that it is NP-hard to get an asymptotic approximation ratio better than 600 599 600599 . An instance of Vector Bin Packing is called δ -skewed if every item has at most one dimension greater than δ . As a natural extension of our general d -Dimensional Vector Bin Packing result we show that for ε ∈ ( 0 , 1 2500 ) ε∈(0,12500) it is NP-hard to obtain a ( 1 + ε ) (1+ε) -approximation for δ -Skewed Vector Bin Packing if δ &gt; 20 ε δ&amp;gt;20ε .

Using ideas similar to our Vector Bin Packing result, we show that for Vector Bin Covering there is no APTAS for dimensions greater than or equal to 2.

We prove that it is NP-complete to decide, given a hypergraph H H and some S ⊆ V ( H ) S⊆V(H) , whether there is a subhypergraph of H H which is an S -Steiner hypertree. As corollaries, we give two negative results for two Steiner orientation problems in hypergraphs. Firstly, we show that it is NP-complete to decide, given a hypergraph H H , some r ∈ V ( H ) r∈V(H) and some S ⊆ V ( H ) S⊆V(H) , whether this hypergraph has an orientation in which every vertex of S is reachable from r . Secondly, we show that it is NP-complete to decide, given a hypergraph H H and some S ⊆ V ( H ) S⊆V(H) , whether this hypergraph has an orientation in which any two vertices in S are mutually reachable from each other. This answers a longstanding open question of the Egerváry Research group. We further show that it is NP-complete to decide if a given hypergraph has a well-balanced orientation. On the positive side, we show that the problem of finding a Steiner hypertree and the first orientation problem can be solved in polynomial time if the number of terminals | S | |S| is fixed.},

In the literature, it is stated that NP -hardness holds even in the case of a binary alphabet . As a standard reference for this theorem, the work of Gold from 1978 is either cited or adapted. Nevertheless, the results in Gold&#39;s work are stated in terms of Mealy machines , and not in terms of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) as most commonly defined. As Mealy machines are equipped with an output function , they can be more compact than DFAs which accept the same language.

  abstract     = {The problem of enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of a given order k from a given graph arises in many practical applications: bioinformatics, information retrieval, processor design, to name a few. The upper bound on the number of connected induced subgraphs of order k is n ⋅ ( e Δ ) k ( Δ − 1 ) k n⋅(eΔ)k(Δ−1)k , where Δ is the maximum degree in the input graph G and n is the number of vertices in G . In this short communication, we first introduce a new neighborhood operator that is the key to design reverse search algorithms for enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of order k . Based on the proposed neighborhood operator, three algorithms with delay of O ( k ⋅ m i n { ( n − k ) , k Δ } ⋅ ( k log ⁡ Δ + log ⁡ n ) ) O(k⋅min{(n−k),kΔ}⋅(klog⁡Δ+log⁡n)) , O ( k ⋅ m i n { ( n − k ) , k Δ } ⋅ n ) O(k⋅min{(n−k),kΔ}⋅n) and O ( k 2 ⋅ m i n { ( n − k ) , k Δ } ⋅ m i n { k , Δ } ) O(k2⋅min{(n−k),kΔ}⋅min{k,Δ}) respectively are proposed.

  abstract     = {Mosheiov &amp; Sidney [5] showed that the single-machine makespan minimization problem with job-dependent learning effects can be formulated as an assignment problem and solved in O( n 3 ) time. Later on, Koulamas [4] showed that the scheduling problem can be solved in O( n log n ) time by sequencing the jobs according to the shortest processing time (SPT) rule if the job-dependent learning rate are correlated with the level of sophistication of the jobs and bounded from below. The optimality of the SPT job sequence still holds when job-dependent learning rate are inversely correlated with the level of sophistication of the jobs and bounded from above. The main results in the paper are correct, however, there is an error in Corollary 1 and the proofs of Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 are not complete. In this note, a counter example for the latter case is given first and then a modified corollary is provided. Next, a lemma is provided to complete the proofs of Proposition 1 and Corollary 1 . Finally, a simple algorithm is developed to solve the latter case in O( n 2 ) time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new key recovery attack on a Hamming-metric code-based signature scheme proposed by Song, Huang, Mu, Wu, and Wang (SHMWW). Our attack extends the statistical part of the attack proposed by Aragon, Baldi, Deneuville, Khathuria, Persichetti, and Santini (ABDKPS). In addition to classifying the columns of the secret matrix, we also completely determine the entries of the identity columns of this matrix via statistical method. While we need to collect more signatures, our attack has better time complexity as it requires less than 2 32 and 2 35 operations to perform the attack for Para-1 and Para-2 respectively. This gives a tradeoff between the number of required signatures and the running time of the attack. From the simulation using a proof-of-concept Sagemath implementation, a total of no more than 1500 signatures is needed to launch the attack, which can completely recover the secret key in under 45 minutes. When performed in parallel, the attack may recover the secret key in less than 5 seconds.},

  abstract     = {An Eulerian circuit in a directed graph is one of the most fundamental Graph Theory notions. Detecting if a graph G has a unique Eulerian circuit can be done in polynomial time via the BEST theorem by de Bruijn, van Aardenne-Ehrenfest, Smith and Tutte (1941–1951) [15] , [16] (involving counting arborescences), or via a tailored characterization by Pevzner, 1989 (involving computing the intersection graph of simple cycles of G ), both of which thus rely on overly complex notions for the simpler uniqueness problem. In this paper we give a new linear-time checkable characterization of directed graphs with a unique Eulerian circuit. This is based on a simple condition of when two edges must appear consecutively in all Eulerian circuits, in terms of cut nodes of the underlying undirected graph of G . As a by-product, we can also compute in linear-time all maximal safe walks appearing in all Eulerian circuits, for which Nagarajan and Pop proposed in 2009 [12] a polynomial-time algorithm based on Pevzner characterization.},

For a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , define the interval function in the Cycle Convexity as I cc ( S ) = S ∪ { v ∈ V ( G ) | there is a cycle C in G such that V ( C ) ∖ S = { v } } Icc(S)=S∪{v∈V(G)|there is a cycle C in G such that V(C)∖S={v}} , for every S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) .

The convex hull of S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) , denoted by Hull ( S ) Hull(S) , is the inclusion-wise minimal convex set S ′ S′ such that S ⊆ S ′ S⊆S′ . A set S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) is called a hull set if Hull ( S ) = V ( G ) Hull(S)=V(G) . The hull number of G in the cycle convexity, denoted by hn cc ( G ) hncc(G) , is the cardinality of a smallest hull set of G . We first focus on the class of planar graphs , as the main motivation for the definition of hn cc ( G ) hncc(G) stems from Knot Theory and occurs when G is a 4-regular planar graph. We prove that: the hull number of a 4-regular planar graph is at most half of its number of vertices and that such bound is tight; and that deciding whether hn cc ( G ) ≤ k hncc(G)≤k , provided a positive integer k and a planar graph G , is an NP NP -complete problem. On the positive side, we present polynomial-time algorithms to compute the hull number in the cycle convexity of chordal graphs , P 4 P4 -sparse graphs, and grids.},

  abstract     = {A graph G is well-covered if every minimal vertex cover of G is minimum, and it is well-dominated if every minimal dominating set of G is minimum. Studies on well-covered graphs were initiated in [Plummer, JCT 1970], and well-dominated graphs were first introduced in [Finbow, Hartnell and Nowakow, AC 1988]. Well-dominated graphs are well-covered, and both classes have been widely studied in the literature. The recognition of well-covered graphs has been proved to be coNP -complete by [Chvátal and Slater, AODM 1993] and [Sankaranarayana and Stewart, Networks 1992], but the complexity of recognizing well-dominated graphs has been left open since their introduction. We close this complexity gap by proving that recognizing well-dominated graphs is coNP -complete. This solves a well-known open question (cf. [Levit and Tankus, DM 2017] and [Gözüpek, Hujdurovic and Milanič, DMTCS 2017]), which was first asked in [Caro, Sebő and Tarsi, JAlg 1996]. Although the problem has been open for a long time, our proof is surprisingly simple. Finally, we show that recognizing well-totally-dominated graphs is coNP -complete, answering a question of [Bahadır, Ekim, and Gözüpek, AMC 2021].},

The major advantage of HCS is that it is more space-efficient than count sketch. However, their paper didn&#39;t comment on estimating pairwise inner product from the sketch. This note demonstrates that HCS also closely approximates the pairwise inner product.

The flaw is present when OCB3 is used with short nonces. It has security implications that are worse than nonce-repetition as confidentiality and authenticity are lost until the key is changed. The flaw is due to an implicit condition in the security proof and to the way OCB3 processes nonces. Different ways to fix the mode are presented.},

  abstract     = {A linear arrangement is a mapping π from the n vertices of a graph G to n distinct consecutive integers. Linear arrangements can be represented by drawing the vertices along a horizontal line and drawing the edges as semicircles above said line. In this setting, the length of an edge is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the positions of its two vertices in the arrangement, and the cost of an arrangement as the sum of all edge lengths. Here we study two variants of the Maximum Linear Arrangement problem ( MaxLA ), which consists of finding an arrangement that maximizes the cost. In the planar variant for free trees, vertices have to be arranged in such a way that there are no edge crossings. In the projective variant for rooted trees, arrangements have to be planar and the root of the tree cannot be covered by any edge. In this paper we present algorithms that are linear in time and space to solve planar and projective MaxLA for trees. We also prove several properties of maximum projective and planar arrangements, and show that caterpillar trees maximize planar MaxLA over all trees of a fixed size thereby generalizing a previous extremal result on trees.},
