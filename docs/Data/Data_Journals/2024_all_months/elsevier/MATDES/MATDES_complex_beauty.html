  abstract     = {Efficient conversion of low-grade heat into electric power is challenging for thermoelectric materials and systems. This is because the high-aspect ratio thermoelectric elements needed for maximum conversion efficiency are difficult and costly to manufacture. In this work, friction extrusion is explored as a new method for fabricating bulk bismuth-telluride (BiTe) wires that can be sectioned into high-aspect ratio thermoelectric elements. Bismuth-telluride feedstock materials in the form of vacuum hot-pressed powder and castings are processed by friction extrusion into meters-long wires having 2.5 mm and 1.0 mm diameters. The novel deformation process gives an average grain size below 5 µm and preferential c-axis texture alignment perpendicular to the extrusion direction. Results for Seebeck coefficient, resistivity, power factor, and weighted mobility show that transport properties exceeding that of high-performance vacuum hot-pressed powders are achieved through friction extrusion of simple castings. The unique deformation conditions at the rotating die/feedstock interface enables a much higher extrusion ratio (161:1) than is possible with conventional extrusion. This is a key enabler for extruding small wire diameters from cast billets.},

  abstract     = {Thermomechanical processing as the main method of grain boundary engineering (GBE), can modulate the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) in turn affects the mechanical properties and stability of alloys at high temperature. In this study, the microstructural evolution and creep behaviour of different GBCD alloys were investigated during the creep process at 660 °C and 690 MPa, and the effect of GBCD on high temperature creep behaviour and associated damage mechanism were analyzed from the viewpoints of grain size, recrystallisation and dislocation motion. The findings indicate that the larger grain size prolongs the steady-state creep duration, which is beneficial to the increase of creep life. During the creep process, the coherent twin boundary is susceptible to transformation into non-coherent twin boundary, resulting in the loss of its difficult-to-migrate properties and increased susceptibility to becoming recrystallisation nucleation sites. Furthermore, the formation of twins is conducive to the stimulation of dynamic recrystallisation. Discontinuous dynamic recrystallisation, characterised by the nucleation and growth of grains, occurs concurrently with continuous dynamic recrystallisation with strain gradients and orientations. The combined effect of these processes is grain boundary slip and restricted dislocation migration, which in turn alter the creep properties of the alloy.},

Si addition resulted in the formation of the Al 2 CeSi 2 phase. Aging at 300 °C led to the formation of nanoscale Al 3 (Sc, Zr) precipitates with an average diameter of 3 nm. The hardness of the alloy significantly increased and remained unaffected even after ageing for 100 h which suggests the thermal stability of the Al-Ce alloy containing these precipitates.

Although some structures show both biocompatible and bacterial repulsive, the decades exposure in oral cavity cannot guarantee zero infection. Therefore, developing bioactive and rigid layer is a realistic strategy for clinical scenario. In this study, the dealloying technique was introduced to create nano-grass layer on Ti6Al4V surface by removing Al element. The average size of 30 nm surface could induce the highest and aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion in primary human gingival fibroblasts, accompanied by extensive focal adhesions formation. The epithelial layer in the gingiva-abutment interface was condenser and crosslinked, as indicated by more ECM proteins expression and resistant to HRP invasion. Mechanistically, the cdc42 upregulation and ERK activation account for actin filaments rearrangement and focal adhesions enrichment. Moreover, the grass-like surface showed slight bacteria repulsive property. Thanks to the advantages of dealloying technique, the rigid layer did not show significant damage after conventional scaling by plastic dental scaler. In conclusion, the dealloying technique may be a novel convenient and realistic strategy creating rigid nanoporous surface for both enhancing STI and resistant to physical biofilm removal.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there has been a growing anticipation for developing titanium alloys with low cost and excellent properties. Working towards this goal, a hierarchical phase structure comprising micron-scale α phase and micron-scale and nano-scale α′ phases in Ti-Al-V-Fe-Mo alloys was obtained via vacuum melting, forging, and solution treatment. The high-density hierarchical α′ martensite in Ti-Al-V-Fe-Mo alloys exhibits the high grain boundary density and the weak segregation of Fe and Mo. It promotes the formation of passivation films with low defect density and high film resistance on the alloy surface and the homogenous distribution of solutes within the matrix. This homogeneity significantly diminishes the tendency for pitting corrosion and enhances the overall corrosion resistance of the alloys. In addition, the analysed results of the valence electron theory model show the high electron density difference at α (0001) //β (110) is the primary reason for pitting in the interface of α/β. And the low strongest-bond energy of the α phase leads to its preferential corroded. The calculated results provide theoretical support for the experimental phenomena.},

Two binders and mixtures were subjected to various levels of humidity, temperatures, pressures, film thicknesses, and aging durations. By comparing these lab-aged samples to field-aged samples, the study aims to simulate real-world aging more accurately. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and frequency sweep tests were employed to analyse these samples. Multivariate techniques—Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—were used to explore chemical and rheological relationships, evaluate the interchangeability of aging factors, and quantify the equivalency between laboratory and field aging. The findings revealed that increased temperature, pressure, and duration lead to more oxidative products. The PCA distinguished between two binders and aging trends, highlighting the importance of both FTIR and rheological measurements. The SVR model demonstrated strong predictive performance for rheological properties, identifying critical FTIR region, 710–912 -1 cm. By MLR model, optimal aging conditions to simulate nine years of field aging for porous asphalt and stone mastic asphalt were back-calculated. The Euclidean distance found laboratory conditions that closely match field-aged samples. SVR models provided predictions of simulated field aging time for various laboratory aging conditions.},

Electromagnetic metasurfaces, a novel nanophotonic material, allow for versatile light manipulation by controlling phase, amplitude, and polarization. Metalenses, in particular, have emerged as a promising solution to overcome the diffraction limit, offering multifunctionality, integration, and lightweight design. These advances are paving the way for next-generation, miniaturized 3D imaging devices.

The behavior of Ar bubbles in different irradiation depths was investigated by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) via cross-section specimens. The results show that Ar-bubbles in the peak damage and ions deposition region experience an apparent dissolution. Further, we simulate the behavior of isolated Ar bubble and attached Ar bubble to oxide under primary knock-on atoms (PKA) with different energy and numbers by using molecular dynamics (MD). The results show that high energy PKA (exceeding 30 keV) and multiple cascades can contribute to the effective ejection of Ar atoms from bubbles. Meanwhile, the interface between oxide and bubble contributes less to the bubble dissolution. Besides that, the effects of thermal ejection and excess self-interstitial atoms generated from the implantation of foreign atoms on the dissolution of Ar bubbles are discussed.},

The ability of BMSC-derived exosomes (BMSC-Exos) and BMP2 to exert both bone tissue regeneration and immunomodulation is expected to resolve this clinical dilemma. In this study, we demonstrate that exosomes derived from BMP2-treated BMSCs (BMP2-Exos) in a diabetic microenvironment exhibit enhanced osteogenic effects. Additionally, compared to the blank control group, macrophages stimulated by BMP2-Exos were more polarized towards the M2 type. These results were verified in vivo by GelMA loaded exosomes in the diabetic rat skull defect model. Importantly, we found that BMP2-Exos can upregulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in diabetic BMSCs and improved osteogenic function and M2 macrophage polarization in diabetes-impaired BMSC-Exos in vitro. In conclusion, the present study revealed that BMP2 pretreatment can enhance the ability of BMSC-Exos to promote osteogenesis in diabetic bone defect areas, provides a preliminary exploration of the underlying mechanisms.

Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a promising orthopedic substitute material due to its cortical bone-like elastic modulus, biocompatibility, chemical stability, and natural radiolucency. However, PEEK is bioinert and lacks interfacial bioactivity, which limits its ability to promote bone growth and osseointegration. In this study, we fabricated porous PEEK scaffolds using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology. We employed a phase-transitioned lysozyme (PTL) nanofilm as the organic matrix template to construct a robust hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating both inside and outside the porous PEEK scaffold, generating HAp@PTL@PO-PEEK. The PTL nanofilm acted as a strong glue, enhancing the interfacial bonding strength between the HAp coating and PEEK. In vitro cell biology experiments revealed that HAp@PTL@PO-PEEK promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, the modified scaffolds exhibited excellent osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity in the in vivo repair of rabbit orbital bone defects, promoting new bone formation and guiding new bone growth into the scaffold. Therefore, HAp@PTL@PO-PEEK scaffolds hold potential for clinical craniomaxillofacial bone regeneration and repair.},

This leads to a fundamental question, what if additional alloying elements could decrease Fe-Al intermetallic formation? Many studies have approached this question experimentally and theoretically. However, there is a lack of uniform experimental testing to link experimental results with theoretical calculations. The purpose of this study is to offer extensive experimental results in order to help verify the theoretical calculations that have been done on this topic. After studying the literature, the ten elements selected were: Be, Si, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Ga, Ge, and Mo. Iron-based interlayers alloyed with these elements were fabricated and used to create dissimilar resistance spot welds between aluminum and steel. The welds were tested in the cross-tension configuration, and the intermetallics were characterized for composition, thickness, and hardness. The elements that increased weld strength the most were Ti, V, and Ga because they decreased intermetallic formation at the weld edges. This is because these elements decreased the driving force for the formation of Fe 2 Al 5 , according to thermodynamic calculations.},

  abstract     = {Laser-activated selective electroless plating (LASELP) is a promising complementary manufacturing process employed in hybrid additive manufacturing (HAM) technology for the fabrication of customized 3D electronics. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, most current LASELP technologies could only enable copper deposition on/within the polymer matrix, which largely limited the application scope of this technology. Accordingly, an advanced LASELP technology combining catalyst exchanging process is proposed to pattern diverse functional metals on the photopolymer to fabricate 3D electronics. Two kinds of catalyst systems are selected in this HAM technology: (1) Cu 2 (OH)PO 4 ; (2) antimony tin oxide (ATO) and titania (TiO 2 ). Silver and nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P) alloy are selected as the representatives of direct- and indirect-ELP metals, respectively. Silver could be directly plated on the laser-activated surface to deposit a dense and highly conductive layer, while for the Ni-P layer an inevitable catalyst exchange step is applied here to induce Pd 0 plating seeds on the laser-activated substrate. Finally, a variety of customized electronics, such as conformal circuit boards, smart structure with strain sensor, embedded structural thermometer, Internet of Things bottle cap, and gas tube integrated with 3D conformal NO 2 sensor are fabricated and fully verify this HAM technology.},

Concurrently, ultra-thin flexible strain sensors were fabricated using PDMS and carbon black to detect bending strain, and their sensing performance was assessed to identify optimal fabrication parameters. Finally, the control platform and strain sensors were integrated to validate the system’s capability to manage the catheter’s bending shape while simultaneously sensing its deformation.

  abstract     = {This study introduces an innovative dual laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/D) system, which combines two distinct laser processing methods to enhance control over microstructural outcomes. Unlike conventional PBF-LB systems that employ a single laser type, this dual-laser setup integrates a traversing Diode Area Melting (DAM) laser head with multiple 450 nm diode lasers (4 W each) and a traditional high-power (200 W) 1064 nm fiber-laser. This unique configuration allows for significantly different melt pool solidification rates within the same layer. For the first time, Ti6Al4V feedstock was processed using both laser types within a single sample. A specific scanning strategy defined separate laser processing regions, including an overlap where both lasers interacted to fuse the feedstock and bridge the two regions. The fiber-laser melted (FLM) regions experienced much higher cooling rates (∼10 7 °C/s) than the DAM regions (∼600 °C/s), resulting in acicular ά/α phases. In contrast, DAM regions exhibited larger grains, with parent β grain sizes approximately 13 times larger than those in the FLM zone. This dual laser system investigation not only demonstrates microstructural in-situ spatial tailoring but also highlights variations in the laser-induced heat-affected zone, surface roughness, and mechanical properties across different regions within the fabricated Ti6Al4V samples.},

The results showed that Ti-10Mo alloy has a high UTS of 1553 MPa and a high YS of 1497 MPa at 20 K, as well as an excellent elongation after fracture of 11 %. This is due to the simultaneous activation of {332}&lt;113&gt; twin twins and SIM α“ transformation during deformation, that is, the combination of TWIP and TRIP effects. The activation sequence of different deformation mechanisms is as follows: the primary SIM α” and {332}&lt;113&gt; twins are first activated simultaneously. With the increase of strain, multiple variants of SIM α“ and {332}&lt;113&gt; twins can be activated in a grain. Then the primary SIM α” can be further transformed into {130}&lt;310&gt; α“ twins. With the further increase of strain, some {130}&lt;310&gt; α” twins can continue to be transformed into secondary {332}&lt;113&gt; β twin and some primary {332}&lt;113&gt; twins can also produce secondary α“ to continue the deformation. When necking, a large number of {111} α” twins are activated to further coordinate the plastic deformation. In addition, the multiple necking phenomenon is due to the further activation of {332}&lt;113&gt; twins and SIM α“ during the necking of a certain area due to stress concentration during the stretching process, which causes local strengthening and resulting in the stop of necking. Finally, the serrations on the stress–strain curve may be caused by multiple necking.},

The results show that the alloy has an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 744 MPa and a high yield strength (YS) of 662 MPa, as well as an excellent elongation (El) after fracture of 38 %, outperforming Ti-15Mo alloy under the same conditions. The superior strength and plasticity of Ti-10Mo alloy at 298 K are attributed to the activation of both {332}〈113&gt; twinning and SIM α“ during deformation. The sequence of different deformation mechanisms is as follows: in the initial stage of deformation, dislocation slip can be extensively activated and continues to occur during subsequent deformation; in the middle stage of deformation, primary and secondary {332}〈113〉 twinning and SIM α” are activated simultaneously, resulting in a continuous increase in work hardening rate; in the later stage of deformation, the alloy can further deform through {1 1 1} α“ twinning. The higher YS may be due to the optimal quantity and size of athermal ω phase in Ti-10Mo alloy, which increases the YS without significantly affecting plasticity. Meanwhile, Quenching vacancies can also increase the YS of the alloy. The three stages of the work hardening rate curve correspond to the activation of the dislocation slip mechanism, the activation of the {332}〈113〉 twinning and SIM α” and the stop of the {332}〈113〉 twinning and SIM α“.},

This method utilizes the mapping relationship between conformal hexahedral element and the cubic bounding box of architected material to construct the signed distance field. To enhance strength and stiffness of the structure, this study integrates the relative density distribution obtained from topology optimization to regulate the density of conformal architected materials through density mapping. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed method not only reduces the damage of the boundary structure caused by cutting, achieving a mutual match between the architected materials and curved geometry, but also retains the ability to control the distribution of relative density. The numerical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that conformal gradient architected materials exhibit better structural strength and stiffness compared to array-generated gradient architected materials, which indicates that the proposed method has potential applications in lightweight design.},

The current design of processes relies on experience and experimentation, leading to high costs in developing processes and challenges in training practitioners. To reduce research and development costs in the industry and enable novices to reach expert levels, we propose an intelligent heat treatment process design and simulation assistant system based on large language models (LLMs), named Chat-IMSHT. Chat-IMSHT can impart knowledge and recommend processes. Additionally, Chat-IMSHT optimizes the interaction between humans and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software. To achieve knowledge impartation and process recommendation, a dialogue model based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLMs was designed. It characterizes and compresses a massive amount of heat treatment knowledge and process data. The system designs a new CAE software interaction paradigm, using LLMs to map parameters from natural language into formatted text for the CAE software COSMAP. A Steel Heat Treatment Knowledge Understanding (SHTKU) evaluation method was designed. The improved model significantly increased the accuracy of knowledge responses, with a maximum accuracy of 94.54 %. Experimental results show that Chat-IMSHT effectively imparts knowledge and generates formatted text, completing the task of process recommendation.},

Exploring the mechanisms underlying structural transformations is crucial for assessing nanostructure array types under complex irradiation environments. By quantitatively calculating the thermodynamically driven processes and analyzing the impact of intrinsic structural parameters, distinct structural transformations in response to intense electronic excitation are systematically investigated in gallium antimonide (GaSb) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) systems. In high-energy regimes, the nanofibers layer of GaSb exhibits intriguing structural discrepancy, characterized by partial nanofibers with coherent boundaries, interspersed nanopores accompanied by antisite defects and Ga precipitates, distinguishing to a series of discontinuous latent tracks that emerged within cylindrical trajectories in GaAs. Furthermore, significant diffusion behaviors of the nanohillocks are discovered in GaAs, with higher average roughness than GaSb, driven by the gradient stress distribution influenced by the free-surface effects. The deposition energy for melting phase formation, Gibbs free energy, and Ga diffusion coefficients contribute to the distinctive structural features, evidencing relatively stable morphological configurations and higher irradiation resistance in GaAs. Consequently, special optoelectronic properties associated with structural discrepancies facilitate the design and optimization of material functionalities by irradiation technologies.},

Subsequently, machine learning (ML) methods were used to predict the formation energies of the oxides in the ODS steels. Among six ML models employed, the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) model shows the highest accuracy in predicting the formation energy of the oxides, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.18 eV/atom and 0.27 eV/atom, mean absolute error (MAE) values of 0.11 eV/atom and 0.18 eV/atom, and coefficient of determination (R 2 ) values of 0.96 and 0.92 for the training and testing sets, respectively.

  abstract     = {This study explores the use of chemical descriptors derived from force field atom types to predict Fickian diffusion coefficients of rejuvenators in bitumen, utilizing machine learning models trained on data from 240 non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations cover three bitumen types (NO, TO, FO), five aging degrees, and four temperatures (60 °C, 120 °C, 160 °C, 200 °C), capturing diffusion coefficients ranging from 0.0068e-10 m 2 /s in highly aged bitumens at 60 °C to 4.35e-10 m 2 /s in fresher samples at 200 °C. The MLM, built with 18 chemical descriptors for bitumen and rejuvenator sides, achieves an R 2 of 0.97, accurately predicting diffusion across varied conditions. This approach abstracts away from the need for repeated MD simulations, enabling diffusion predictions even for systems outside the original dataset. The manuscript presents three case studies to illustrate how the model can be used for the iterative design of rejuvenators by optimizing molecular structures based on critical chemical features, such as rejuvenator oxygen content, bitumen sulfur content, and molecular weights. It also demonstrates how the model offers a practical framework for understanding the diffusion and performance of rejuvenators by linking time-dependent factors—such as concentration, depth, and rejuvenation time—with the bulk properties of bitumen-rejuvenator systems, facilitating industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Birds have evolved lightweight yet strong wing bones. Inside the wing bones, struts formed three-dimensional Voronoi structures, representing adaptations toward lightness. Inspired by this natural design, we proposed structural optimization method to optimize the mechanical properties of three-dimensional Voronoi structures using genetic algorithms(GA). The optimization process begins with the generation of three-dimensional porous Voronoi structures. Then, beam elements were extracted for finite element simulations as performance indicators. Finally, genes of structures with superior mechanical properties were retained and inherited through iterative evolution until optimal solutions were achieved. Samples were fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques, followed by compression testing to assess their mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that optimized Voronoi structures increased peak load capacity by 25.9% for Voronoi structures with eight Voronoi seeds. With regularity constraint, the peak load increased by 58.6% in lower regularity samples and the energy absorption increased by 39.3% in higher regularity ones. Normal vector projections revealed the principles behind the optimizations, and the Hausdorff distance measured structural similarity, validating the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm. Overall, we developed a novel method for optimizing 3D Voronoi structures using genetic algorithms, offering significant potential for designing porous, lightweight structures applicable across various fields.},

  abstract     = {The production of high stiffness Ti-based Metal Matrix Composites (Ti-MMCs) displaying significant ductility is extremely challenging due to the high reinforcement content required. This study outlines the production process of stiffness-driven Ti-TiC MMCs displaying a remarkable ductility. The process consists in powder Mechanical Blending, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), and a heat treatment. A TiC fraction of more than 20 vol% was formed in-situ through the reaction of titanium with carbon during the LPBF process. The as-built sub-stoichiometric TiC dendrites are converted in equiaxed TiC grains during the heat treatment. The TiC C/Ti ratio was found to be close to 0.5 in as-built conditions, and 0.7 in heat treated conditions, resulting in an effective reinforcement content nearly twice the one expected for stoichiometric TiC, leading to stronger reinforcement. The mechanical analysis revealed a Young’s modulus of up to 149 GPa and total elongations of up to 2.8 %. The former represents a 27 % improvement compared to commercially pure Titanium and the latter exceeds by 115 % reported values for LPBF Ti-MMCs with similar Young’s modulus. It is enabled by the in-situ formation of defect-free TiC reinforcements during the LPBF process combined with their globularisation through heat treatment.},

The results indicate that the ceramic can be considered a single-phase perovskite system with ferroelectric and ferromagnetic characteristics at room temperature. The ferroelectricity is evidenced by the switching of ferroelectric domains, as imaged by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). The presence of a weak ferromagnetism is manifested by a non-negligible remnant magnetization in the magnetization-magnetic field loops. The spontaneous net magnetization is mediated by the presence of Mn 4+ ions, which may introduce ferromagnetic Fe 3+ -O-Mn 4+ double-exchange interactions in the system. The PFM images taken during the application of a magnetic field of 2000 Oe revealed that the ferroelectric domain structure at room temperature can be significantly influenced by the magnetic field, reflecting the presence of a magnetoelectric effect that allows the occurrence of magnetic field-induced polarization reorientation.},

The extensive range of components presents challenges to the implementation of HEOs, rendering it difficult to predict the phase structure prior to the final synthesis. Herein, semi-empirical methods based on various parameters, including Δ X , VEC , Δ S mix , Δ H mix and δ , were utilized to determine the phase stability of rock salt, spinel, perovskite and fluorite structures. The combination of δ with Δ X , VEC , Δ S mix , and Δ H mix , in graphical form, is an effective indicator for determining the phase stability of rock salt, perovskite and fluorite structures. The spinel structure is stabilized outside the range of the other three structures. The phase formation rules were further verified with two newly designed and prepared HEOs via X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The HEOs show potential for functional applications, e.g., methyl orange degradation.},

Traditional studies often examine a limited number of process-structure–property variables, striving to elucidate mechanisms governing material response. However, this approach is time consuming and can limit exploration, as well as the discovery of process-structure–property relations in novel materials. In this paper, we combined combinatorial sputter deposition and multi-modal high-throughput materials characterization with feedforward neural networks to establish high-dimensional process-structure–property relations in Pt-Au alloys, yielding nanocrystalline alloys with high hardness and low resistivity relevant to electrical contact switch applications. We mapped three indicators of process conditions (composition and two atomic deposition characteristics) onto four indicators of material structure (X-ray diffraction, film thickness, density, and surface roughness) and two indicators of material properties (hardness and resistivity), resulting in 784 unique combinations evaluated over a 13-dimensional space. The neural networks predicted Pt-Au alloys with 18–24 at.% Au, when deposited at specific conditions, to have a nanoindentation hardness up to 7.2 GPa. This high hardness value, comparable to some steels, represents a 3-fold improvement in hardness over “hard gold”, a commonly used electrical contact alloy, while maintaining requisite electrical conductivity. The neural network models provide an avenue to identify expected process windows capable of maximizing material performance.},

While periodic homogenization of auxetic unit cells can be used to investigate these properties, it is computationally expensive and limits design space exploration and inverse analysis. In this paper, the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach is adopted to efficiently generate data for developing surrogate models, bypassing concerns about periodic mesh generation and boundary conditions typically associated with the finite element method (FEM). Surrogate models are developed for the real-time prediction of the effective elastic properties of auxetic unit cells with orthogonal voids of different shapes. The generated surrogate models accept geometric parameters and base material properties as inputs to predict the effective elastic constants in real-time. This rapid evaluation enables a practical inverse analysis framework for obtaining the optimal design parameters that yield the desired effective response. The performance of the generated surrogate models is rigorously examined through a train/test split methodology, a parametric study, and an inverse problem. Finally, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed, offering real-time prediction of the effective tangent stiffness and performing inverse analysis to determine optimal geometric parameters.},

  abstract     = {Particle-reinforced aluminum-matrix-composites (AMCs) promise enhanced mechanical properties while maintaining the lightweight potential of aluminum. Fabricating AMCs near-net-shape is desirable because it avoids the drawback of the difficult machining. Laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) has the potential to achieve this goal. An economically attractive powder blending approach was used to modify AlSi7Mg0.6 powder with TiC nanoparticles. The resulting blend was processed in a PBF-LB machine to fabricate AMCs. This paper shows how to maximize the grain refinement potential of TiC nanoparticles by using a high mixing time of 1215 min to break up agglomerates. For a better understanding of the process related microstructure, investigations of the TiC distribution in blend and composites have been conducted by SEM and EDS. The formation of TiC microparticles formed by sintering of agglomerates are an integral part of the final microstructure. Measuring the overall carbon content of the specimens reveals a loss of TiC during PBF-LB. The root causes are discussed in terms of agglomeration and smoke generation and countermeasures are proposed. The presented approach is an effective way to introduce nanoparticles and to refine the microstructure. It can also be adapted to other material systems to modify the grain size and reduce the texture.},

In this paper, a case study of TiN-Ag films was carried out to investigate the strengthening mechanism induced by adding soft metal in TiN-Ag composite/multilayered films deposited by magnetron sputtering. The results showed that dual-phases of fcc-TiN and fcc-Ag co-existed in the composite films with the Ag particles embedded in the matrix. In some areas of the Ag particles, with a size below 4 nm, epitaxial growth with the TiN template was detected, which obliged the lattice to be distorted and shrunken. Consequently, both hardness and elastic modulus were enhanced from 21 and 236 GPa, for the reference TiN film, to 26 and 323 GPa for the TiN-Ag composite film with 2.4 at.% Ag. The possibility of having the epitaxial growth of Ag within TiN were also confirmed by designing a TiN/Ag multilayered film with an Ag layer thickness of ∼3 nm.},

This novel Au-Ag-Pd-Cu-Ge-Si alloy shows good glass-forming ability and, as-targeted, its tarnish resistance is much improved compared to earlier Au-based metallic glasses.

Plate-lattices are likely to be the most promising candidates to fulfill this request. Nonetheless, unlocking full application potential of plate-lattices requires addressing many inherent drawbacks of existing additive manufacturing techniques. Hereby an alternative route is proposed to fabricate a particular plate-lattice, i.e., cubic+octet foam, based on snap-fit design concept. The proposed protocol allows for high-precision manufacturing, and is capable of scalable production with ease and offers great versatility in base material selection. Mechanical properties of plate-lattices created in this way are first numerically assessed, showing optimal stiffness and strength close to theoretical bounds for isotropic porous media, and a high degree of mechanical isotropy. Compression experiments are further conducted to exam the actual behavior of Ti-6Al-4V foam representatives, and compared with explicit simulations featuring fracture and interfacial-debonding processes, such that the dependency of foam’s performance on the degree of joint robustness is numerically quantified. Speaking of the uniqueness of this fabrication strategy, it allows for easy implementation of structural hierarchy and hybrid design; it also provides a simple way to utilize lab-scale advanced materials that are demanding even impractical to realize scalable production.},

Seven build orientations relative to the build plate have been studied. The 75° specimen demonstrates the highest fatigue life owing to the optimal surface quality and low proportions of grains near-parallel to the loading direction. When the build orientation is 30° or below, only defects on the downward-facing surface serve as the fatigue crack initiation sites as a result of the poor surface quality. Beyond 45°, cracks begin to initiate from the otherward-facing surface owing to the reduced variation in R a across the sample surface. The large variation in the size and number of pore clusters near the initiation site governs the highest fatigue scatter of the 75° specimen whereas the difference in crack initiation sites of the 45° specimen results in the large difference in fatigue life. Our results demonstrate that the orientation effect is a critical factor to consider for the design of fatigue-tolerant intricate components.},

The OCP phase is generally known to be thermodynamically unstable and rapidly hydrolyzes to apatite. However, X-ray diffraction confirmed that OCP can remain stable even in the presence of water glass. In a rabbit calvarial defect model, W-OCP increased the bone area by 22.4 %, which was significantly higher than that of defects only at week 4 (p &lt; 0.05). In clinical trials, the new bone formation rate was 49.5 %, confirming that W-OCP had an extremely high application potential as a new bone graft material. After treating MG-63 cells with a W-OCP elution medium, changes in gene expression levels that promoted bone formation were verified via microarray analysis. From the results, W-OCP can be inferred that sodium and silicate ions in water glass play an important role in the recruitment of osteoblasts, significantly increasing the bone growth rate at the early implantation stages. The obtained results suggest that W-OCP can be potentially applied as a new type of synthetic bone materials.},

  abstract     = {Though emerging novel theranostics based intelligent nanomaterials for cancers are promising ways to solve the disadvantages of traditional therapeutic methods, poor targeting of these nanomaterials and the presence of blood–brain barrier (BBB) in glioblastoma (GBM) seriously reduces the efficacy of GBM treatment. Herein, an intelligent nanoparticle consisting of macrophage membrane coated hollow manganese dioxide loading ce6 (MM-HMnO 2 @Ce6) was prepared, which could be used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided sonodynamic therapy (SDT)-immunotherapy of in situ GBM. Comparing to early reports, MM-HMnO 2 @Ce6 could target intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) receptors on endothelial cells of GBM, and cross BBB, which enhanced the efficiency of GBM treatment. What’s more, the as-prepared nanoparticle also monitored the process of targeting and crossing BBB by MRI due to its tumour microenvironment (TME) responsive feature. What’s more, the detailed therapeutic mechanisms were also determined to be by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating immature DCs and activating the cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)-STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway. Overall, this work showcases a remarkable synergistic anticancer effect of SDT-immunotherapy, and also proposes new avenues for research in utilizing MnO 2 nanomaterials for GBM treatment.},

Drug resistance hinders the effectiveness of current chemotherapies, making osteosarcoma a leading cause of mortality and an urgent requirement of new therapeutics in this population. Here, we developed a triptolide (TP)-loaded, pH-responsive and near-infrared light-activated nanoplatform (TP-TPBC-PEG) with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to target osteosarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo . Our results demonstrated that PDT and chemotherapy of TP-TPBC-PEG synergistically reduced cell viability, colony proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro , and inhibited osteosarcoma growth and pulmonary metastasis in vivo which the nano-micelles were intravenously injected to intratibia injection induced osteosarcoma mouse models, showing enhanced osteosarcoma cell killing by nanoparticle inflating in response to acidic endosomal pH and sensitized osteosarcoma cells to TP chemotherapy. Importantly, the nano-micelles did not exhibit organ toxicity in vivo . Dual-luciferase reporter gene and nuclear/ cytoplasm protein expression assays identified the involvement of HIPPO signaling pathway in mediating these effects. Overall, our study provides a promising therapeutic approach for treating primary osteosarcoma and preventing pulmonary metastases by activating the HIPPO signaling pathway.},

Electrospinning is a powerful technique allowing the fabrication of scaffolds with aligned nanofibers. However, the resulting morphology is characterized by low porosity and small pore size due to the formation of a compact structure of aligned fibers preventing cell colonization inside the scaffold. In the present work, supported by numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that when optimal electrostatic interactions occur during the simultaneous deposition of electrospun nanofibers and electrosprayed microparticles on a collector rotating at high speed, a 3D structured scaffold is obtained. Thanks to a self-organization mechanism, islands of microparticles intercalate inside a network of loosely packed and highly aligned nanofibers. In the case of poly(lactic acid) electrospinning and poly(glycerol sebacate)/cyclodextrin electrospraying, the resulting 3D biomimetic scaffold, deeply investigated by X-ray microtomography and mechanical characterization, shows an open porosity with enlarged interconnected pores with a mechanical behavior mimicking that of cardiac tissue. Finally, after functionalizing the fiber surface using laminin, it is shown an efficient 3D colonization of cardiac cells through a network of aligned nanofibers.},

In an innovative endeavor to address these limitations, we have synthesized a novel adhesive system by incorporating epoxy-functionalized polyurethane into the conventional bisphenol A-based epoxy resin. Upon subjecting the adhesive to a 24h curing period at ambient temperature, the resulting material exhibited remarkable mechanical properties. Specifically, the shear strength, tensile strength, and fracture toughness of the cured adhesive were 20.6 MPa, 36.7 MPa, and 2.87 MPa·m 1/2 , respectively, while the unmodified epoxy resin had values of only 1.9 MPa, 15.5 MPa, and 1.0 MPa·m 1/2 . Adhesive system unique crosslinked structure has been discovered to confer blue aggregation-induced emission fluorescent properties. We have successfully applied this interesting characteristic in the restoration of cultural relics and the encapsulation of light emitting diode.

The nucleation, growth and coarsening of multi-variants γ are investigated in TiAl alloys by using the three-dimensional phase-field simulation, the γ morphology, lamellar spacing (LS) and the predicted yield strength of alloy are in agreement with the experiment. It is found that the γ variants can nucleate and grow up separately to form the single-variant lamella, or through the symbiotic nucleation and growth to form multi-variant lamella, the growth of γ lamella follows the terrace-ledge-kink mechanism. The growth rate along the longitudinal direction is distinctly larger than that of the thickness direction, resulting in the lamellar structure. A three-stage growth kinetics, nucleation, growth and coarsening of γ lamella in thickness is revealed. As Al content changes, the LS is enlarged with the reduced lamella number. The influence of the LS on the mechanical properties is evaluated by using the Hall-Petch relationship. The results give an insight for the formation and evolution mechanisms of multi-variant γ lamella, and discover the internal relations of lamellar morphology and mechanical properties of TiAl alloys.},

The linear antenna microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique effectively grows thin diamond films on QCM substrates (Dia-QCM) differently oriented on the substrate holder in the deposition chamber, resulting in single-sided and double-sided coated QCMs. Each of these coated QCMs offers a distinctive advantage for sensing applications. The double-sided coated QCM sensors exhibited the most effective performance in ethanol detection, demonstrating approx. a 3-fold and 12-fold higher response than single-sided diamond-coated and bare gold QCM sensors, respectively. Furthermore, the single-sided Dia-QCM aptasensors demonstrated superior performance compared to bare gold QCM sensors, with a 2-fold higher response and a lower detection limit for S-RBD protein (LOD Dia-QCM = 0.09 pg/mL vs. LOD Au-QCM = 0.10 pg/mL). In experiments conducted in human plasma, the Dia-QCM aptasensor demonstrated the ability to detect S-RBD protein at concentrations as low as 50 pg/mL, with high percentage recoveries. These results highlight the potential of linear antenna microwave plasma CVD for the mass production of advanced diamond-coated QCM sensors with different diamond film morphologies (porous, micro- or nanocrystalline) for various applications.},

Three alloys were fabricated using cladding to validate the predict accuracy of the models. The results show that the trained support vector regression (SVR) model demonstrated the highest prediction precision for microhardness.

To focus on the effect of thermal expansion on residual warpage, we used acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, which is an amorphous polymer with a small volume change around the liquid–solid phase transition, as the matrix. Composite pellets were prepared using a kneader, and filaments were produced for fused deposition modeling (FDM) using an extruder. We fabricated a bar-like test piece using a standard FDM machine and measured the warpage deformation using 3D scanning. The experimental results were supported by the finite element method. We also compared similarly sized SiO 2 powders to discuss the advantages of NTE over conventional fillers. The warpage of a 100 mm x 5 mm x 2 mm bar-like test piece was reduced by approximately 75% by introducing Zn 1.6 Mg 0.4 P 2 O 7 at 40 vol%. The effect of Zn 1.6 Mg 0.4 P 2 O 7 at 30 vol% is similar to that of a conventional SiO 2 filler at 40 vol%.

However, its adoption in high-performance applications is limited by insufficient understanding of process-property relationships. To address this gap and advance metal MEX technology, this study methodically analyzed the effects of various process variables. The raster angle setting of −45°/45° resulted in a structure with more dispersed pore formation and enhanced interlayer bonding, leading to higher tensile strength and elongation compared to those obtained at 0°/90°. When exploring sintering temperature effects at the optimal raster angle (−45°/45°), results revealed improved specimen densification at high temperatures, leading to enhanced microstructure and mechanical properties. Heat treatment on specimens fabricated under optimal conditions (raster angle: −45°/45°; sintering temperature: 1380 °C) further enhanced mechanical properties due to various microstructural changes, including grain refinement and formation of element-rich regions, acting in combination. Through step-by-step control of process variables, this research presents a method for tailoring the physical properties of 17-4PH stainless steel to suit different application fields. These findings expand the potential of metal MEX applications in industries requiring high-performance components and advance metal additive manufacturing technology by demonstrating precise property control.},

  abstract     = {Crystal Plasticity Finite Element (CPFE), which merges crystal plasticity principles with finite element analysis, can simulate the anisotropic grain-level mechanical behaviour of polycrystalline materials. Due to the benefit of CPFE, it has been widely utilised to analyse processes such as manufacturing, damage, and deformation where the microstructure plays a prominent role. However, this method is computationally expensive and requires the robust calibration of its parameters, which can be many. In this work, we propose a framework to address difficulties in calibrating multi-parameter CPFE. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach, is utilised to optimise the CPFE parameters. Additionally, a Python-based environment is developed to fully automate the calibration process. To allow comparison with the conventional optimisation method, the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm is also used, which shows the DDPG framework yields more accurate calibration. The generalisation performance of the proposed framework is also demonstrated by calibrating each parameter set of two different CPFE models for monotonic loading of the stainless steel type, 316L. Moreover, the effectiveness of the framework in the more complex condition is also demonstrated by calibrating the CPFE parameters for a two-cycle cyclic behaviour of a 316H stainless steel material. The reliability of these calibrated parameters is also validated in the cyclic simulation after two cycles.},

  abstract     = {Nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloys featuring with amorphous-nanocrystalline dual-phase structure are critical for energy conversion and transportation at elevated frequencies. Their applications however, are refrained by limited saturation magnetic flux density ( B s ) due to unavoidable addition of a considerable quantity of non-magnetic elements for glass forming ability (GFA). Furthermore, engineering of the amorphous-nanocrystalline microstructure is critical for the coercivity ( H c ), which urges development of advanced approach. In this study, a deep supercooling solidification has been proposed, which not only promotes the formation of short-range packing and icosahedron/icosahedron-like structures for enhanced GFA, but also induces an optimized microstructure consisting of highly disordered amorphous matrix to facilitate nanograin refinement. Based on such strategy, Finemet-based nanocrystalline alloy with superior magnetic properties ( B s = 1.71 T, H c = 5.0 A/m) has been achieved without additional glass forming element. Such superior performance is correlated to the unique magnetic domain structure involving straight domain walls and smooth movement. The deep supercooling strategy not only breaks the trade-off between the B s and GFA to allow the design of nanocrystalline alloys with large ferromagnetic content, but also serves as an effective method for microstructure optimization for nanocrystalline alloys.},

  abstract     = {The use of hollow aluminum extrusions in internal combustion engine and battery electric powered vehicles has increased significantly in recent years due to lightweighting considerations. It is of interest to understand the evolution of crystallographic texture from a through-process perspective, since the microstructure and texture of the material have a strong influence on plasticity in the final part. In this research, an Al-Mg-Si alloy with Mn and Cr additions to suppress recrystallization was halted mid-extrusion, and the in-die material was extracted for study. The evolution of textures along finite element method (FEM) predicted streamlines were characterized with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Polycrystal plasticity modelling coupled with the FEM simulated deformation history was implemented to predict texture evolution. Streamlines passing near the center of the portholes exhibited axisymmetric double fiber textures, which rotated following the streamlines before shifting to plane strain textures near the die exit. Closer to the weld seam, shear textures developed. It was found that textures could be predicted for streamlines up to 1.4 mm away from the weld seam, where complex deformation modes, significant increase in strain and the possible intervention of alternative mechanisms such as recrystallization and non-octahedral slip inhibit the accuracy of texture prediction.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of safety-critical components for fatigue applications is a key requirement for metal additive manufacturing (AM) applications. Material anomalies play a relevant role in determining the fatigue resistance properties of a component. X-ray computed tomography (CT) helps collect important information on these flaws, such as their size and position within a part. In this study, we discuss how to employ anomaly data detected on an AlSi10Mg bracket manufactured by laser-powder bed fusion to describe the prospective allowable life of a component under a given operating condition. A statistical analysis was conducted on the specimens and component to derive the correlation between different resolution scans and analyze the uncertainties of the micro-CT measurements. The full-scale non-destructive evaluation (NDE) can be constrained to large voxel sizes. Eventually, the authors proposed a fully probabilistic route for assessment instead of a simple deterministic assessment based on safety factors. This assessment enables designers to consider the uncertainties of the assessment (uncertainties of micro-CT detection and the model for fatigue strength).},

  abstract     = {Polymer optical fibers (POFs) are an essential component of photonic textile sensors for the development of healthcare@home technologies. However, fabricating tailored POFs exhibiting the required properties for such applications remains challenging. Here, an innovative method to fabricate soft POFs based on polydimethylsiloxane is introduced: the hydrogel-assisted microfluidic wet spinning (HA-MWS) technology. Combined with a straightforward post-processing step, the HA-MWS enabled the production of soft POFs with tailored moduli (0.35 MPa to 5.0 MPa), low surface roughness ( R q &lt; 6 nm), and, consequently, low attenuation (&lt;0.25 dB/cm). The quasi -static and dynamic mechanical, chemical, optical, thermal, and surface properties of the soft POFs produced by HA-MWS were investigated in detail. A photonic textile sensor demonstrator was built with these soft POFs with tailored pressure sensitivity in the range of 2–300 kPa, modulus close to that of skin, and high-temperature stability between -30 C ∘ and 90 C ∘ . This methodology can potentially become a standard tool for designing POFs with tunable properties for healthcare monitoring, soft robotics, and biomedicine applications.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid externally-bonded reinforcements are considered a viable technique for strengthening existing concrete structures. They combine high-performance impregnated textiles with matrices containing dispersed microfibres to foster the ductility and toughness of the composite system. In this paper, the mechanical performance of textile-reinforced strain-hardening cement-based composites (TR-SHCC) is investigated in detail. A novel high-performance inorganic binder based on limestone calcined clay cement (LC 3 ) is reinforced with both polyethylene (PE) dispersed microfibres and carbon fibre (CF) textiles as continuous biaxial reinforcement. The CF yarns are impregnated by an automated process to improve the monolithic response under uniaxial tensile loading and to ensure high production consistency. Fully inorganic suspensions, i.e., geopolymer and cement-based, are being investigated, as they can provide superior thermal stability compared to traditional polymeric impregnating agents. Interphase adhesion is investigated by single-yarn pull-out tests, microscopy and µCT at various micro scales. On the one hand, the improved adhesion promoted by cement impregnation resulted in the finest and most diffuse crack pattern. Conversely, the strength of the overall composite is mainly governed by the tensile failure of the yarns, irrespective of the bond, and dispersed fibres consistently improve the post-cracking stage and the strength of the hybrid composites.},

  abstract     = {Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxides (NMC) are one of the most used cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries, and they will become more relevant in the following years due to their potential in electric vehicles. Unfortunately, this material experiences microcracking during the battery operation due to the volume variations, which is detrimental to the battery performance and limits the lifetime of the electrodes. Thus, understanding mechanical degradation is fundamental for the development of advanced batteries with improved capacity and limited degradation. In this work, we propose a chemo-mechanical model, including a stochastic phase-field fracture approach, to design structurally stable NMC electrodes. We include the degradation in the mechanical and chemical contributions. The heterogeneous NMC microstructure is considered by representing the material&#39;s tensile strength with a Weibull distribution function, which allows to represent complex and non-deterministic crack patterns. We use our model to provide a comprehensive analysis of mechanical degradation in NMC111 electrodes, including the effect of particle size, C-rate, and depth of charge and discharge. Then, we analyze the influence of the electrode composition (namely, Ni content) on the structural integrity. We use this information to provide design guides for functionally-graded electrodes with high capacity and limited degradation.},

In the scope of this study, we integrated MBG into CPCs and assessed the impact of varying MBG particle sizes (&lt;20 µm, &lt;38 µm, &lt;100 µm) on the setting characteristics, microstructure, mechanical strength, and preliminary cell response of CPCs. Investigations revealed that &lt; 20 µm MBG particles significantly improved the setting characteristics and compressive strength of CPCs, while &lt; 38 µm particles promoted degradation and ion release, facilitating apatite formation. MBG incorporation was found to promote microstructural homogeneity and facilitate apatite formation, with particle size directly affecting these outcomes. Biocompatibility assessments indicated no cytotoxic effects, supported by the favorable cellular responses (&gt; 92 % viability compared to control group). These findings underscore the critical impact of MBG particle size on developing advanced CPCs for biomedical applications, guiding future design and optimization strategies.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a Hybrid Intelligence approach to investigate the Process-Structure-Property-Performance (PSSP) relationship in additively manufactured (AM) materials, specifically focusing on V-notched laser powder bed fused (L-PBF) AlSi10Mg specimens. The Humen Intelligence (HI) component managed the design, manufacturing processes, post-processing, structural characterization, mechanical testing, and data collection. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI), utilizing advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, performed tasks related to prediction, sensitivity analysis, and parametric analysis. AI identified patterns and developed predictive models that provided deeper insights into how process parameters affect material properties and performance. This integration of HI and AI enabled a more thorough exploration of these relationships; data collected from our previous research were complemented with new experiments conducted to assess the effects of various heat treatments (HTs) and surface post-treatments (SPTs) on the fatigue behavior of the specimens. The techniques applied included stress relief (SR), T6 thermal treatments, sand blasting (SB), shot peening (SP), severe vibratory peening (SVP), laser shock peening (LSP), tumble finishing (TF), abrasive flow machining (AFM), chemical polishing (CP), electrochemical polishing (ECP), and chemical milling (CM), along with their combinations. A total of 54 different post-processing techniques were examined in this study. The experimental data, covering surface texture, microstructure, porosity, hardness, and residual stress, were used to develop an ML model that analyzed the fatigue behavior of the specimens. This approach represents a significant advancement toward integrated mechanistic and data-driven materials engineering, offering valuable insights for optimizing fatigue performance in practical applications.},

This makes it possible to attach extremely thin coatings of nanofibres. The sound absorption coefficient was measured using the impedance tube method. The results show that MPP absorbers with nanofibre coatings significantly widen the absorption bandwidth and increase the absorption coefficient. Because of the synergy enhancement effect, the performance of the absorber is much exceed the expect of the transfer matrix method (TMM) model. A very thin coating of nanofibres enables a significant increase in MPP performance. The effects of the nanofibre coatings were analyzed by finite element method (FEM) simulations. The coating enhances the end effect of MPP and extends along the MPP surface. In addition, different nanofibre coating thickness and impedance also have different effects on the sound absorption performance.

  abstract     = {Ultrasonic welding, known for its severe plastic deformation, faces the challenge of balancing sufficient deformation at the welding interface with minimizing damage to the substrate. This study utilizes the anisotropic deformation mechanisms and mechanical properties of nanotwinned Cu (nt-Cu). Specifically, Cu coatings featuring nanotwin layers aligned parallel to the ultrasonic vibration direction were employed as interlayers in ultrasonic welding of Cu-Cu joints. The effects of the nt-Cu interlayer on the welding quality and the deformation mechanisms under the various welding pressures are investigated. Experimental and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that at low welding pressures, the nt-Cu interlayer undergoes deformation and detwinning primarily through twin boundary migration. This mechanism effectively mitigates work hardening during the welding process, localizes deformation at the welding interface, and significantly enhances the strengths of the Cu-Cu joints. The maximum enhancement proportion occurs at a welding pressure of 8 psi, up to 26.75% compared to conventional coarse-grained copper. As the welding pressure increases, the strengthening effect gradually weakens. The deformation mechanism of nt-Cu transitions to dislocation transverse and threading. The interaction between dislocations and twin boundaries forms incoherent twin boundaries and 9R phases, resulting in work hardening of the interfacial regions and reduction of the strengthening effect.},

In this work, molecular dynamics simulation method was employed to examine in detail the influence of sintering temperature, particle size and Fe content on the melting and sintering behavior of Cu-Fe mixed nanoparticles. The results show that the melting point of Cu-Fe mixed nanoparticles exhibits a strong size dependence and gradually increases with the increase in Fe content. High sintering temperatures significantly promotes the sintering process and the degree of atomic migration, and the diffusion behavior on the surface is enhanced, providing a significant driving force for sintering. Since smaller particle sizes have higher surface energy, the relationship between the neck parameters during the sintering process of different particle sizes is 4 nm &gt; 6 nm &gt; 8 nm, and the displacement of surface atoms is always greater than that of internal atoms. As the Fe content increases, the sintering of nanoparticles and the migration of atoms decrease, leading to a lower degree of sintering.

  abstract     = {There is renewed interest in refractory alloys that possess higher service temperatures than incumbent Ni-based superalloys (⪆1100 °C). Thermophysical property data for six Nb-alloys are gathered from the literature and reviewed, and new data are provided for two Hf-containing Nb-alloys; elastic modulus, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity are presented for C103, and new thermal conductivity data are provided for a higher strength alloy, WC-3009. Comparisons with Ni-superalloys and other refractory-metal based alloys provide context. Physics-based models are provided that describe the temperature dependencies of the Young’s modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion and density, and thermal conductivity; such that fair comparisons can be made across alloys for any given condition. The results suggest a need for improved understanding of the temperature dependence of the elastic modulus. A performance index is introduced for making informed materials selection decisions in the context of lightweight, panel-shaped applications subjected to sharp thermal transients or steep thermal gradients, and the significant strain rate sensitivity of Nb-alloys is highlighted. Ultimately, the relative value of current commercial alloy, C103, as well as the promise of specific Nb-W-Zr alloys are highlighted.},

In this regard, it is essential to take into account manufacturing processes and tailor materials design approaches to support downstream process design approaches. As a major step into this direction, we present a holistic and generic optimization approach that covers the entire process-structure-property chain in materials engineering. Our approach specifically employs machine learning to address two critical identification problems: a materials design problem, which involves identifying near-optimal material microstructures that exhibit desired properties, and a process design problem that is to find an optimal processing path to manufacture these microstructures. Both identification problems are typically ill-posed, which presents a significant challenge for solution approaches. However, the non-unique nature of these problems offers an important advantage for processing: By having several target microstructures that perform similarly well, processes can be efficiently guided towards manufacturing the best reachable microstructure. The functionality of the approach is demonstrated at manufacturing crystallographic textures with desired properties in a simulated metal forming process.},

  abstract     = {Viscoelastic damping materials (VDMs) are valued for their high damping characteristics in vibration and noise control. However, they typically underperform at lower frequencies and add substantial mass to structures. This study introduces an innovative approach by embedding an acoustic black hole (ABH) structure within VDMs (ABH-VDM) to achieve lightweight and broadband vibration damping. Firstly, a finite element method-based vibration model is developed to analyse the propagation and attenuation characteristics of vibrations in a plate strip embedded with ABH-VDM. This analysis provides insights into the dynamic behaviour and damping effectiveness of the proposed structure. Secondly, the study investigates the vibration reduction capabilities and mass implications of ABH-VDM on large-scale plate structures. The influence of ABH structural parameters, including the power exponent, cut-off thickness, and array configuration, is systematically investigated to optimize damping performance. Finally, experimental validation confirms that ABH-VDM achieves an additional 1.4 dB reduction in vibration across the entire frequency spectrum, with a bandwidth extension of 900 Hz. Moreover, ABH-VDM reduces mass by 8.6 %, demonstrating its potential for lightweight vibration control in structural applications. This research contributes valuable insights into advancing lightweight and broadband damping solutions for enhanced vibration management in engineering systems.},

  abstract     = {Fusion In-vessel components, assembled and maintained using laser welding, one of the most promising techniques, exhibit complex distributions of residual stress, microstructures, and material properties. These residual stresses can compromise structural integrity and lifespan of critical components. Although using advanced experimental measurements can evaluate the residual stress for individual case, extending the measurements to massive number of components are costly and time-consuming. Traditional machine learning (ML) models struggle to account for the heterogeneity and anisotropy of these stress distributions. Here, we develop a novel ML framework based on the Eurofer97 steel, the structural material for in-vessel components. The ML framework is trained on high-resolution residual stress data derived from recently-developed evaluation techniques. Combining with microstructures, the model enables prediction of heterogenous and anisotropic residual stress distribution. It successfully predicts the compressive residual stress in fusion zone (∼−200 MPa) balanced by tensile residual stress in heat affected zone (∼300 MPa), aligning closely with experimental results with the R -squared value of 0.989 and the mean square error of 10 −4 . Unlike experiments that take hours, the ML model provides predictions within seconds. It offers valuable insights into residual stress prediction for various joints, enhancing the reliability and lifetime prediction of in-vessel components.},

The age-hardening response is generally weak, and the largest hardness increment is observed after ageing at 150 ℃ for 24 hours. Discontinuous precipitation (DP) and continuous precipitation (CP) occur competitively during ageing at 150 ℃ or 200 ℃, while only DP is observed during ageing at 25 ℃ or 100 ℃. All the precipitates formed through DP and CP are identified as ε -(Ag, Cu)Zn 4 that has a hexagonal structure. Analysis of possible strengthening mechanisms shows that grain boundary strengthening and precipitation hardening contribute to the major part of yield strength in the as-extruded condition. Ageing treatments generate a limited increment in yield strength due to the small difference between the hardness of ε -(Ag, Cu)Zn 4 and the Zn matrix and the reduced solid solution strengthening effect. Artificial ageing at 150 ℃ for 48 hours effectively improves the stability of the mechanical properties of the as-extruded Zn-1.5Cu-1.5Ag alloy. This process fully depletes the excessive solutes in the supersaturated Zn matrix, ensuring that the alloy maintains consistent mechanical properties when stored at room temperature.},

A proposed DSDM structure with a square-shaped patch layer is placed over the array to reduce mutual coupling by non-propagating evanescent waves and manipulating the polarization of propagating reflected CP waves. This decoupling mechanism relies on the DSDM’s negative electric permittivity extracted from the meta -atom. When the CP waves were incident to DSDM polarizer through the excited CP antenna of the array, the polarization states of the reflected and transmitted CP waves were changed as controlled by DSDM. In reflection mode, the negative permittivity of DSDM produce two type of the waves reflected waves generated the polarization mismatch and evanescent waves that reduce the coupling between CP antennas, while the transmission mode, controlling the radiation pattern at φ = 45° or φ = 135°. The low-profile proposed decoupling structure was fabricated and experimentally validated. The decoupling design significantly mitigated the measured mutual coupling between the CP antenna elements at 3.5 GHz by more than 15 dB and by more than 13 dB at 3.02 GHz to 3.67 GHz, compared to the reference array. The proposed design achieves less than a 3 dB axial ratio, maximum realized gain of 5.52 dBic at 3.5 GHz. An excellent agreement between the simulated and measured outcomes has been studied.},

The swing of the irregular balls and jumping of the regular small balls were observed, and the solidification time ranges from 10 ms to 20 ms.

Traditional solutions involve adding inoculants to AM feedstocks, but titanium (Ti) alloys cannot employ this approach without producing detrimental secondary phases. Ti-Cu (Ti-copper) alloys offer a solution through constitutional supercooling and/or solid state thermal cycling under AM conditions. This work analyzes a compositionally graded directed energy deposition (DED) Ti-Cu build, single-melt laser tracks, and dilatometric heat treatments to evaluate if, when, and by what mechanism(s) microstructural refinement occurs. Refinement by inoculation of unmelted powder particles was also considered. Constitutional supercooling produced no net microstructural refinement as any equiaxed dendrites which form are remelted with new deposition. This finding agreed with solidification modeling of powder bed fusion-laser beam (PBF-LB) and DED builds. Solid state thermal cycling refined microstructures only during ex-situ dilatometric heat treatments, suggesting build parameter optimization is needed to achieve refinement in-situ . Accidental heterogeneous nucleation on unmelted Ti powder, originating from the different thermophysical properties of Ti and Cu, provided the most significant microstructural refinement. This work systematically assesses the microstructural refinement mechanisms of Ti-Cu in AM builds and offers insights into microstructural control in eutectoid alloys.},

Herein through analyzing the respective effects of precipitates on yield strength and strain hardening, we proposed and quantitatively analyzed a strategy for synchronously strengthening and plasticizing Al alloys by refining and densifying the precipitates, defined as RDP effect. The precipitates were highly refined and densified in three high-Zn 7xxx alloys in order to verify the validity of the RDP effect. The tensile tests show that the high-Zn Al alloys possess ultra-high strength and good plasticity compared to the traditional Al alloys. Further analysis reveals that the densification of precipitates mainly contributes to the ultra-high strength, accounting for over 75%, while the refinement of precipitates suppresses the dislocation annihilation, thus increasing the strain-hardening capacity. Together, these two factors finally contribute to the excellent strength and plasticity matching. This finding will provide strong support for the positive impact of RDP effect on improving the balance between strength and ductility. Besides, this strategy may be considered as an effective one for simultaneously improving the strength and plasticity in high-performance Al alloys.},

Microstructural properties of three novel interactions between basal plane dislocations and threading mixed dislocations (TMDs) are described. This leads to multiplication of Shockley stacking faults (SSFs) in SiC epitaxial layers. First is a mechanism of double interaction of two SSFs with TMDs that causes the SSFs to glide on multiple basal planes, and creation of locked partial dislocation dipoles (PDD) due to the attractive force between the opposite sign partial dislocations. Second type of interaction occurs between SSFs and a tilted TMD, that results in formation of another SSF. The third type of interaction causes further SSF multiplication by unlocking previously created PDDs. This occurs when the newly formed SSF intersects with the previously locked PDD, and unlocks it, leaving behind a freely gliding partial dislocation and formation of another SSF. Multiplication of SSFs can severely degrade reliability and performance of high power SiC devices by increasing reverse leakage current and on-state resistance, and could eventually lead to device failure.},

Here, we use magnetron-sputtering to synthesize nitrides and carbides—TiC/TaN, TiN/TaC—in a nanolaminate superlattice (SL) architecture and compare their properties (hardness, fracture toughness, thermal stability) with that of their layer materials, as well as of carbide SLs, TiC/TaC. Except for the monolithically grown TaN and TiC/TaN SLs with nominal bilayer periods above 14 nm, all other coatings are purely fcc-structured and feature close-to-stoichiometric compositions, revealed by EBS-ERDA and XRF measurements. In-situ X-ray diffraction investigations indicate that the monolithically grown coatings have poor thermal stability compared to the SLs, which remain stable up until well over 1000-°C. While the TiC/TaC superlattices retain the highest hardness of all three systems, with 44.1 ± 3.4 GPa at a bilayer period ( Λ ) of 2 nm, the TiN/TaC system exhibits significantly higher fracture toughness values with up to 4.75 ± 0.33 MPa√m for the Λ = 14 nm coating. The TiC/TaN system exhibits neither hardness nor fracture toughness enhancement, as explained by the formation of a secondary hexagonal Ta 2 N phase.},

  abstract     = {The various properties and phenomena in materials significantly depend on the high-quality three-dimensional (3D) microstructure. This paper proposes a novel method for 3D reconstruction of functionally graded materials (FGMs) using transfer learning techniques to overcome the limitations of experimental 3D microscopy. The approach begins by interpolating 2D cross-sectional images of FGM microstructures through a hybrid deep learning method combining StyleGAN and Gatys techniques, generating intermediate images based on style and content. In the next step, transfer learning is applied using convolutional occupancy networks to reconstruct the 3D microstructure from the 2D image depth layers, with the model trained on point clouds obtained from 2D images. To validate the method, the reconstructed microstructures are compared to actual material images at the same depth using various metrics, including lineal path, two-point correlation, and quality of connection functions. The results show a high degree of accuracy, indicating that the reconstructed images closely match the target microstructures. Finally, to show the application of model the approach is implemented to the functionally graded lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) and 3D microstructure of this FGM has been extracted using the approach.},

Through SEM, FTIR, XRD and XPS analyses, ZnO nanorods with majority length of 1000–1500 nm and fineness of 200–600 nm have been deposited on the surface of sateen fabric surface Compared the fabric with ZnO nanorods (S-11-Nrs) with its neat counterpart, the mechanical properties of S-11-Nrs are increased, especially the inter-filament friction and fabric tensile breaking strength. However, in the impact process, the number of filaments involved in the impact is reduced and the filaments are mainly failure by the shear action of the bullets. Due to these positive and negative effects, the energy absorption of S-11-Nrs displays inferior ballistic energy absorption. Nevertheless, at lower areal density, in the non-perforation test, S-11-Nrs presents less BFS and shows better resistance to the consecutive shotting process compared with the neat fabric. The reason is that the increase of inter-filament friction limits the movement of filaments and thus results in less BFS. In addition, the flexibility, air permeability and moisture permeability are still kept. This research offers valuable insights for the design and development of comfortable soft body armor.},

  abstract     = {Materials with a final heterogeneous structure (HS) possess an excellent combination of strength and ductility. However, fine and homogeneous grains are desired in as-cast ingots to avoid defects. The evolution from an as-cast homogeneous microstructure to a pronounced HS owing to the trace addition of TiB 2 particles was studied in Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys with traditional thermomechanical treatment. It is revealed that the triple junctions and over 2 μm precipitates co-located with TiB 2 enhance the particle-stimulated nucleation of recrystallization. The dislocation density difference between the recrystallized and recovered grains is further enhanced by cold rolling. A pronounced HS with alternating soft and hard domains accompanied by multimodal precipitates is modulated, realizing a synergy of yield strength as 632.4 MPa and elongation as 8.8%. It is confirmed that the HS, rather than precipitates, is the primary source of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs), leading to the synergy of strength and ductility. Atomistic simulations on the deformation behavior of HS were used to elucidate the strain partition and role of GNDs on mechanical properties. Our results provide a convenient route to fabricate heterogeneous Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy by trace addition of ceramic particles in ingots casting instead of elaborated controlling of deformation processing.},

Traditionally, enhancing absorption involves increasing substrate thickness, which reduces transmittance. We address this by introducing a resistance-gradient metasurface (RGM) that combines broad absorption with high optical transparency. Unlike conventional methods requiring various inks for different resistances, our approach uses a single silver nanowire ink and screen-printing to create multiple resistances. This technique allows for flexible design and multiple resonances within the metasurface, achieving broad absorption even with a thin substrate. The RGM demonstrates an absorption bandwidth from 8.68 to 11.48 GHz with a substrate thickness of just 0.045 λ 0 , and optical transmittance of 66.3 % at 550 nm. This innovation promises to enhance both substrate efficiency and bandwidth in transparent metasurface absorbers, broadening their application potential in advanced devices.},

Although meta-waveguides, such as spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waveguides, can suppress crosstalk between adjacent channels, it is still urgent to seek new methods to further increase the number of channels without occupying additional space. Here, we propose a reconfigurable dual-mode meta-waveguide (RDMMW) by integrating diodes into meta-units, which supports two independent channels using two orthogonal modes. The RDMMW can be switched among dual-mode, even-mode, odd-mode and cutoff states by controlling the diodes, which provides more freedom to manipulate the channel features. The RDMMW possess two outstanding merits in highly-integrated long-range parallel transmissions, including lower coupling between two channels than conventional single-mode waveguides and constant mode coupling in longer waveguides. Thus the proposed RDMMW has advantages of multi-mode, reconfiguration, low coupling and high integration density, providing a new avenue to realize highly-integrated multi-functional systems.},

In order to capture the variation over time, each parameter is studied at six different time of deposition.

This paper presents a novel dynamic design method for coatings, viewed through the lens of stress waves. We investigate the propagation behavior of stress waves in TaN/TiN and CrN/TiN coatings with layered structures. Our findings indicate that the attenuation of stress waves is dominated by the physical properties on both sides of the interface and the stride length. For interfaces with similar physical properties, the attenuation of stress waves is insensitive to the stride length, while for interfaces with different physical properties, the attenuation is regulated by the ratio of single-layer thickness to the full width at half maximum of the stress wave. These insights offer a strategy for extending the life of coatings and improving process safety under dynamic shocks.},

The influence of the effective current density and duration of the electric pulse on the softening, hardening and residual effects in the deformation process caused by the coupling action were explored. The electric pulse suppresses the promoting effect of ultrasonic vibration on twinning and together with ultrasonic vibration promotes dislocation slip to coordinate deformation. The composite energy field can thus further reduce the deformation resistance. The softening, secondary hardening and residual softening phenomena caused by the electric pulse-ultrasonic composite energy field become more and more significant with the prolongation of duration. When the ultrasonic field with a frequency of 21 kHz and an amplitude of 10 μm is combined with a frequency of 600 Hz and the effective current density increases from 0 to 30 A/mm 2 , the influence on the softening and secondary hardening process exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease as the current density increases, while the influence on the residual softening shows the opposite trend.},

The promotion of hydrogen on the low-temperature diffusion bonding of the alloy was verified through thermohydrogen processing, and the absorption characteristics of hydrogen in the alloy at various temperatures, holding times, and pressures were investigated. Subsequently, a mathematical model for achieving standardized hydrogen content was developed. X-ray polycrystalline diffractometer (XRD) analysis was utilized to preliminarily explore phase differences in samples with varying levels of hydrogen content. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) were employed to analyze microstructure changes and hydrogen distribution in both the surface and core regions of the titanium alloy following hydrogenation, demonstrating its feasibility for surface hydrogenation treatment of titanium alloy sheets.},

  abstract     = {Laser-wire metal additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the ideal direct energy deposition (DED) processes for creating large-scale parts with a medium level of complexity. However, the DED process involves complex thermal signatures and wide length scales making the fabrication of realistic AM components and part qualification often reliant on experimental trial-and-error optimization. While experimental measurements over the full volume of a part are valuable and necessary, measuring the entire area of a part is significantly laborious and practically infeasible, particularly for large parts in terms of cost and rapid qualification. Therefore, in this work, we developed an effective thermal and microstructure modeling framework based on the Johnson–Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) and Koistinen &amp; Marburger (KM) models through a top-down approach that considers plate distortion-affected thermal profiles. A voxel-by-voxel simulation method is used to predict individual phase fractions of Ti-6Al-4 V. The predicted results were validated through detailed metallurgical measurements. A combined voxel-by-voxel approach with a sparse data reconstruction technique produced a near-perfect reconstruction of the original data. This approach anticipates a significant reduction in data points and computation time and resources. Lastly, we conclude with potential extensions of this work to other modeling efforts.},

This work investigates tungsten-copper composites fabricated from elemental powders with 80 wt.% tungsten and either copper or α -brass containing 20 wt.% zinc, respectively. Moreover, high-pressure torsion is used to compact the powders, strengthen the resulting composite by grain refinement, and tailor the grain-size in the nanocrystalline regime by varying the deformation temperature between RT, 400°C and 550°C, resulting in grain-sizes of 9 nm 14 nm and 28 nm, respectively. Hardness measurements revealed a transition from normal to inverse Hall-Petch behavior for grain-sizes below 11 nm. To examine the fracture properties, micro-cantilever bending beams with a cross-section of 10x10 µm 2 were fabricated. Evaluation of these experiments indicated a fracture toughness of 3 MPa m . The slight decrease of fracture toughness between a grain-size of 9 nm to 14 nm indicates a reduction of the grain boundary cohesion strength. The grain-size increase to 28 nm reversed the trend in fracture toughness and raised it to 3.4 MPa m , which points to activating additional deformation mechanisms, such as dislocation-accumulation and twinning. Additionally, alloying with zinc raised the composites strength and retained the composites fracture toughness, benefiting the damage tolerance.},

The wear resistance and oxidation behavior of HEA-containing cermets depends on the ceramic-binder thermodynamic compatibility, phase transformations during sintering, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Hence, much high quality research has been focused into exploring the combination of several HEAs with tungsten carbide, titanium carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides and diborides along with other ceramic compounds. As there are many HEA-ceramic combinations, this review aims to provide a landscape of the developments in this field, providing detailed information about the chemical compositions, sintering techniques, mechanical properties and wear and oxidation resistance obtained. Finally, the need for further research to fully understand the complex interactions between composition, microstructure, and wear and oxidation resistance is highlighted, aiming to tailor HEA compositions for optimized performance. The findings presented in this review contribute valuable insights into the promising applications of HEAs in cemented carbides.},

  abstract     = {Cold spray deposition of metals and alloys has gained considerable attention due to its advanced applications across various industries. This technique offers numerous advantages, including the absence of phase changes and oxidation. However, the process presents challenges due to its inherent complexities. Plastic deformation is crucial for the successful deposition of powder particles during cold spray. Therefore, achieving an optimal level of plastic deformation is essential. Fracture toughness is one of the important properties that can help understand the degree of plastic deformation in cold-sprayed coatings. Yet, measuring fracture toughness in these coatings is challenging because most evaluation methods are destructive and require large sample sizes. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting the fracture toughness of cold-sprayed coatings. Specifically, the micro-scratching method is employed to predict the fracture toughness of cold-sprayed IN625 coatings. IN625 is selected because of its high-end applications in sectors such as nuclear, marine, and aerospace component manufacturing. In addition to evaluating fracture toughness, the deposited coatings undergo rigorous testing and characterization to establish the microstructure-process-property relationship. The scaling of frictional force and fracture toughness confirms the validity of using scratch data for fracture toughness calculations. Hence, fracture toughness of the resulting coatings was successfully evaluated.},

Using computed tomography (CT) technology, internal characteristic parameters were obtained, and a representative volume cell contains pore (RVC-CP) defects was established. The homogenization method and strength estimation technique were applied to connect material properties from the microscopic to the mesoscopic scale. Progressive damage analysis of the representative volume cell (RVC) yielded tensile strength results within 2% of the average tensile test measurements, validating finite element models for strength prediction. The study found that pores create stress concentrations, leading to the failure of transverse and longitudinal fiber bundles, as well as the matrix. Additionally, it was observed that 8.9% pore content results in a 27.2% reduction in tensile strength compared to non-porous material. Based on these findings, empirical formulas for predicting tensile strength reduction due to pores are proposed. This paper presents a mesoscale computational model with pores that enhances the efficiency and accuracy of strength design for stitched C/C-SiC materials. In engineering, the model can be combined with non-destructive testing to quickly assess local strength reduction, offering valuable insights for designing C/C-SiC materials in aircraft and high-speed trains.},

This approach relies on segmenting a structural member into distinct sections; one or two segments are enlarged to be capacity protected; however, another end or middle DCE segment is optimized to emulate the conventional member’s strength and stiffness. A small-scale DCE was topologically optimized and then additively manufactured using a powder bed fusion technique through a direct metal laser sintering process of 17-4PH stainless steel and then was experimentally tested to study the buckling behavior under compression. The experimental testing of the optimized DCE shows a compressive strength of 81,000 times the specimen’s weight with stable post-peak buckling behavior. Numerical simulation confirms experimental results, showing a good correlation in fracture energy. A parametric study on four DCE specimens, scaled up by three, four, five, and six times, was performed and compared to hollow structural sections (HSS) of A500 Gr. C in tensile and compression strengths. The numerical simulation shows a linear relation between the weight ratio and HSS length.

The effects of temperature, normal force and slipping velocity were considered in testing. The results indicated the existence of three key mechanisms underlying slipping: namely the resin shear, fiber–fiber contact and fiber-resin interaction. A three-stage division of the experimental curve was proposed, and several factors were defined to establish a quantitative definition of the ply-ply friction behavior. The results showed that the influence of slipping velocity is particularly evident. Its post-yield stress (12.8 kPa), steady-state CoF (0.118) and residual stress (0.705 kPa) were the highest, exhibiting the largest changes of 957.9 %, 736.9 % and 47.2 %, respectively. This indicated the strong contribution of resin in ply-ply friction. In addition, the Stribeck analysis also suggested the dominance of hydrodynamic lubrication condition in slipping. Based on the experimental results, a simple phenomenological model was proposed based on experimental curves to accurately describe the effects of processing parameters. This work presents a comprehensive characterization of the ply-ply friction behavior of UD CF/PPS prepreg in thermoforming, providing a substantial experimental foundation for the subsequent simulation research.},

Our findings reveal that this principle does not hold for newly developed [111]-oriented SX superalloys, where &lt;001&gt; -directed dendrites experience significant resolved shear stress under [111] applied loads. This work examines the stress rupture behaviors of a [111]-oriented low-Re Ni-based SX superalloy under various CMH conditions at 1100 °C/160 MPa and 760 °C/800 MPa. In the absence of CMH, the alloy achieves rupture properties comparable to fourth-generation SX superalloys. However, the presence of CMH drastically shortens rupture life and alters multi-scale deformation behaviors. High-temperature damage involves submicroscopic dislocation shearing, microscopic crack initiation, mesoscopic inter-dendritic crack connections, and macroscopic fractures. Intermediate-temperature damage is marked by submicroscopic stacking fault shearing, microscopic shear zone deformation, mesoscopic crack propagation, and macroscopic lattice rotation. Moreover, this research investigates the degradation mechanism of stress rupture property when the CMH is combined with slow cooling and reveals unique deformation behaviors, such as high-temperature subgrain formation and intermediate-temperature isolated micro-twins. This work provides new insights into the influence mechanism of the CMH.},

The DSC results show that B 4 C nanoparticles does not affect the initial nucleation temperature of the Fe-rich phase. However, the addition of B 4 C nanoparticles to ZL108 alloy inhibits the growth of Fe-rich phase. The TEM results confirm that the addition of B 4 C nanoparticles alters the lattice parameter of Fe-rich phase due to incorporation of C atoms, thereby suppressing the growth of the Fe-rich phase and ultimately leading to its refinement. From the perspective of fracture behavior, the addition of B 4 C nanoparticles remarkably reduces the stress concentration of Fe-rich phase, and the elongation of the alloy increases by 25.3%.

Better control of these regimes is required for direct ageing (DA), to unlock superior high-temperature strength in next-generation aeroengine disks. There are gaps in the current understanding of the (post-)dynamic regime and its effect on γʹ and γʹʹ co-precipitation. Our aim is to reveal the critical parameters controlling the grain size and recrystallised fractions after thermo-mechanical processing (TMP) to model the post-dynamic microstructure evolution. Two initial microstructures with different δ-phase fractions are subjected to 1.4 strain with 0.1–10 s −1 strain rates to simulate industrial conditions. A short isothermal ost-deformation annealing is applied to assess the restoration behaviour. DRX is suppressed at strain rates &gt;1 s −1 at 950 °C due to limited time for dynamic restoration, while PDRX become predominant due to higher stored energy. At 1000 °C, a fully recrystallised microstructure is achieved in all conditions. The presence of δ-phase increases DRX and PDRX rates and promotes microstructure stability.

  abstract     = {Incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into Al-Si alloy to prepare in-situ SiC/Al-Si composites enhances thermal conductivity (TC) and reduces the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). However, challenges include CNTs aggregation and uneven SiC distribution. This study uses fluidized bed chemical vapor deposition (FBCVD) to achieve uniform CNTs coverage on Al-50Si powder. Subsequent powder hot extrusion and heat treatment above the eutectic temperature enable a gradual reaction between CNTs and Al/Si atoms, resulting in uniformly dispersed SiC within the SiC/Al-50Si composite. The formation mechanism of in-situ SiC particles and their impact on the microstructure, thermal and mechanical properties of the composite are further investigated. The formation process involves a two-step chemical reaction: lamellar Al 4 C 3 phases transform into lamellar eutectic SiC + Al phases, which then transition into polyhedral SiC particles through epitaxial growth. This in-situ formation of SiC particles also impedes Si growth during heat treatment, refining Si particles and enhancing the composite’s properties. The resulting in-situ SiC/Al-50Si composite exhibits excellent thermal and mechanical properties, including a high TC of ∼162 Wm -1 K −1 , a low CTE of ∼ 8.7 × 10 -6 /K, and a good bending strength of approximately 253 MPa at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {This research aimed to enhance the strength and ductility of spray formed (SFed) 7050 aluminum (Al) alloy through hot extrusion and subsequent heat treatment. Microstructure and mechanical properties evolution during these processes were investigated. It was found that the low densification of the SFed 7050 Al alloy due to various defects such as pores, with an average size of 7.6 μm and an area fraction of 3.7 % could be notably enhanced by hot extrusion, even achieving a level close to theoretical density. This process led to a transformation of grains from equiaxed to elongated shapes along extrusion direction and significant grain refinement, exhibiting a strong fiber texture. While the employed extrusion ratio exceeds 16 with proper heat treatment, the SFed 7050 Al alloys achieves superior strength-ductility combination compared with reported Al alloys. The achieved high performance should be attributed to the grain refinement, strong texture and high densification that suppress defect-induced plastic instability. Furthermore, the combination of hot extrusion and heat treatment, provides an effective way to enhance strength and ductility for SFed 7050 Al alloy.},

In this study, a hybrid manufacturing route for Ti-34Nb-13Ta-5Zr-0.3O (TNTZO) alloy stents was developed and assessed. The route involves using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) to manufacture thin-walled tubes, which are then laser micro-machined to directly produce customised stents, cutting short the laborious process and overcome the design limitations for stents manufacturing. Different post processing techniques were used to improve the surface finish and cell attachment properties of the tubes. Finite Element (FE) modelling was used to simulate stent crimping and deployment. The study identified the key parameters that control the performance of the final product, including the optimum laser scanning strategies during L-PBF to achieve smooth thin-walled tubes, and the use of electropolishing to improve the surface finish and cell attachment. FE simulations showed that TNTZO can achieve crimping ranges up to 74% following the optimisation of the strut diameter, which brings us one step closer to a Ni-free alternative to nitinol in manufacturing stents that require significant deformation.},

However, these NPs’ conventional surface-capped organic ligands with high fluidity are frequently shed from particles during separation and purification steps, significantly reducing their stability. Therefore, a simple method to improve the strength of perovskite NPs is essential. Here, we utilized salicylic acid (SA), which acts as a ligand and protective coating of luminescent NPs, to create CsPbBr 3 @SA crystals using a straightforward standing technique. The CsPbBr 3 NPs were perfectly encapsulated and size-limited in the SA hollow space needle-shaped crystals that retain their significant optical intensity. The fluorescence emission intensity of CsPbBr 3 @SA crystals without additional treatment can be maintained for six weeks under normal ambient conditions, demonstrating the SA ligand’s ability to protect CsPbBr 3 NPs better. Furthermore, the green emission CsPbBr 3 @SA crystals are combined with K 2 SiF 6 red phosphor and packed with a commercially available blue light emitting diode (LED) chip to fabricate a high gamut area white LED device. The highly straightforward standing method successfully enables the high-potential preparation of perovskite nanoparticles for future practical applications.},

However, CNFs are hydrophilic and generally incompatible with most polymer matrices, leading to high levels of aggregation, voids, and poor fiber–matrix interfacial strength, which reduces the final composite properties. Thus, interest in efficient CNF surface modification and hydrophobization is growing in order to improve the nanofibril-polymer interface and dispersion characteristics. We discuss current CNF hydrophobization methods, identifying promising routes and challenges of the different hydrophobization and modification methods available thus far. We demonstrate the effects of various advances in CNF modification on the complex drying and redispersion behavior of nanofibrils, including current limitations and future prospects. We also outline several shortcomings in CNF composite characterization that make it difficult to compare the hydrophobization and composite performance. Moreover, quantifying length scales and energy input of redispersion methods, evaluating the hydrophobicity-CNF crystallinity-composite property relationships, and using X-ray tomography to characterize CNF-matrix distribution are critical quantities with limited investigations to date. This review thus comprises an analysis and recommendations for future work needed to further understand the key aspects of CNF modification to enhance composite properties and processability.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) offers significant advantages in fabricating complex three-dimensional metallic components, which are traditionally difficult to fabricate using subtractive methods. However, the AM of nickel-base superalloys poses significant challenges due to their high susceptibility to various weld-cracking mechanisms, particularly in precipitation-strengthened systems with a high volume fraction (60 - 70%) of γ ′ phase. Despite progress in reducing crack formation through optimised scanning strategies, a comprehensive understanding of how distinct weld-cracking phenomena develope in the as-fabricated microstructure remains limited. Additionally, the role of microstructural heterogeneities in crack formation and their impact on mechanical performance has not been thoroughly explored. This review examines recent findings on the formation of microstructural heterogeneities during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) processing of nickel-base superalloys with high γ ′ content. It identifies key discrepancies in the literature regarding the mechanisms behind these heterogeneities and highlights the need for further research into their connection with weld-cracking phenomena. Gaining insights into these heterogeneities is crucial for enhancing mechanical performance and extending the life service of LPBF-processed superalloy components. This review also aims to provide guidance for future alloy development, as similar heterogeneities may affect a range of novel superalloy systems with high γ ′ content.},

  abstract     = {A design strategy for 3D layer-to-layer angle interlock woven composites has been established by employing a set of three key properties of the weave (KPoWs): the global fibre volume fraction, the interlocking angle and the ratio of the weft tow volume to the warp tow volume. Using analytically derived expressions of the KPoWs, their variation trends relative to the manufacturing parameters have been revealed. At the same time, via a range of systematic computational material characterisation exercises, the KPoWs were shown to be sufficient for representing the woven reinforcement as far as the elastic behaviour predictions are concerned, because the effective elastic properties were found to follow consistent variation trends with the KPoWs. As a result, through use of KPoWs, manufacturing parameters have been associated with the effective elastic properties in a systematic manner. This offer means for obtaining a desirable elastic behaviour of 3D woven composites via variation of their internal architecture. The design method developed is the alternative to trial-and-error-based selection method conventionally adopted for this type of materials. As an example of application of the proposed method, a woven composite with balanced weft and warp properties has been designed.},

The spreading ligaments above the jet thins at first along with the capillary timescale. As the surface oxidation proceeds, the neck transitionally shrinks according to the viscous-capillary timescale, which evidences the direct observation of gas atomization process superposed by the molecular diffusion across the interface.

Within this paper, the uniform fatigue damage tolerance assessment was further qualified for (miniature) bending specimens with different loaded volumes based on the concepts according to Murakami (√area) and Shiozawa for an initial defect-based model. These approaches were used to calculate defect-related fatigue life curves, in which the cyclic stress intensity factor (Δ K ) at the initiating defect (√area) was used to represent local stress concentration at the crack tip instead of nominal stress-based S-N curves. Results of S-N curves did not allow a precise lifetime prediction due to increasing effect of manufacturing-related defect distributions, while fracture mechanical approaches enable a uniform fatigue lifetime description of different testing volumes. The calculated fatigue limit and short crack threshold value suggested by Noguchi based on the extended approach of Murakami need to be compared and validated experimentally. Furthermore, the effects of miniaturization and crack propagation have been identified and considered. Uniform fatigue life predictions and efficient materials testing have been combined and show potential for future research.},

Powder atomisation can dramatically reduce the borides’ size to the nanoscale, but they typically coarsen substantially during annealing or compaction via hot isostatic pressing. This study investigated the effect of compaction parameters, namely temperature, pressure and time on the coarsening mechanism, porosity evolution and resultant mechanical properties of atomised Fe-Cr-B powder. Increasing annealing temperature and time from 950 to 1150 °C, respectively, 30 min to 8 h, resulted in a non-linear boride radius growth from 76 nm in the atomised state to 1.9 µm. Hot isostatic pressing, with additional pressures up to 140 MPa, decreased the pore size from about 5 to 0.2 µm. An optimised hot isostatic pressing processing window was defined at 1050 °C and 140 MPa, combining sufficiently reduced defects with a limited particle radius, and yielded in 730 MPa tensile strength at more than 20 % tensile elongation. Powder-metallurgical synthesis of Fe-Cr-B achieved similar properties to casted and hot-rolled material, by avoiding component size scaling effects of casting.

Due to the computational cost of evaluating crystal plasticity models multiple times within a finite element framework, a Gaussian process regression surrogate was constructed and used to conduct the sensitivity analysis. Influential parameters from the sensitivity analysis were carried forward for calibration using both a local Nelder-Mead and global differential evolution optimisation algorithm. The results show that the surrogate based global sensitivity analysis is able to efficiently identify influential crystal plasticity parameters and parameter combinations. Comparison of the Nelder-Mead and differential evolution algorithms demonstrated that only the differential evolution algorithm was able to reliably find the global optimum due to the presence of local minima in the calibration objective function. However, the performance of the differential evolution algorithm was dependent on the optimisation hyperparameters selected.},

  abstract     = {The partial removal of lignin from bamboo materials, a prevalent method to soften the material for plastic forming. It increases bending toughness and improves forming quality, albeit at the expense of load-bearing capacity. This study employs an innovative approach using deep eutectic solvent pretreatment on bamboo green strips (BGS) to establish a balance between strength and toughness, resulting in a significant enhancement of the elastic modulus. The mechanical properties of the DES-treated BGS displayed notable improvements compared to bamboo timber strips (BTS) and bamboo yellow strips (BYS), which either showed no enhancement or suffered degradation after extended treatment durations. Notably, BGS treated for one hour exhibited increases of 8.22 % in flexural toughness and 33.45 % in elastic modulus, while strength diminished by a mere 5.72 %. Concurrently, its porosity increased by 29.36 %, predominantly in the mesopore range. In addition, the crystallinity of the treated BGS increased, whereas the grain size decreased. Silicon-aluminum compounds form on the outer surface of BGS, along with an increase in silicon oxide content, contributed to the observed improvements in stiffness and toughness. These works suggest a novel method for balancing modulus and strength of bamboo structural units, with potential applications in architecture, furniture and transportation sectors.},

The monolithic sensing unit, primarily constituted by a double-permeable ionic liquids/Multi-walled nanotubes conductive network, demonstrates dual-functionality in detecting pressure and temperature. Making use of the further synergy of rational topographical architecture engineering and feasible decoupling algorithm construction, extraordinary progress in sensing performances for both pressure and temperature are attained with negligible mutual interferences. Additionally, the sensor is capable of switching to touchless mode to detect objects at distance up to 200 mm, validating its remarkable proximity sensing ability. The multifunctional nature of sensor is further substantiated through its integration with a robotic hand, highlighting its practical applicability in advanced robotic systems.},

Traditional chemotherapy has unavoidable drawbacks of nonspecific tumor targeting, high toxicity, and poor therapeutic efficiency. Nanocarriers can achieve accurate delivery and reduce adverse reactions of drugs, which have received extensive attention. In this work, hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO 2 ) nanoparticle (NP) that is highly responsive to tumor microenvironment, was simultaneously loaded with paclitaxel (PTX), a chemotherapy drug, and imiquimod (R837), a toll-like receptor 7 agonist. Those NPs were then coated with bacterial outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs-HMnO 2 @PTX + R837 NPs), whose surface proteins could act as tumor-specific antigens. The obtained nanovaccine inherited superior tumor-targeting capacity of OMVs and promoted retention in tumors. As a result, intravenous injection of the nanovaccine led to remarkable tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore, we found that the nanovaccine effectively boosted dendritic cells maturation and increased cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration. Taken together, these results demonstrated the great potential in applying OMVs-enveloped nano-activator in cancer chemo-immunotherapy.},

This study investigates the internal structural dynamics of silicon anodes during lithiation and delithiation cycles. A novel cell design for a 18,650 cylindrical cell featuring micro-sized internal speckles within the silicon anode is presented. This design improves the simulation of electrochemical conditions and allows for precise displacement tracking, mitigating impacts on capacity and cycle performance while enhancing Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) analysis. The research prioritizes reducing scan time and radiation exposure in micro-CT assessments of Li-ion cells, and improves the accuracy of internal strain mapping via DVC. Displacement fields over three charging and discharging cycles are documented. Notably, uneven volumetric changes are observed, with local displacements reaching up to 35 µm in areas smaller than 2.5 mm in radius, which contracted during charging and expanded during discharging. This protocol offers insights into the relationship between electrode mechanics and cell performance, promoting non-destructive evaluations of internal structures in commercial cells.},

This study proposed a flash-friction hybrid welding method to address the issue of the ferrite softening layer and comprehensively investigated the impact of vibration friction speed on joint performance. The results showed that increasing the vibration friction speed could effectively inhibit the formation of the ferrite softening layer in the weld center zone (WCZ) and enhance the mechanical properties of the joint. When the vibration friction speed was 3 mm/s, the tensile strength of the joint reached its maximum value of 982.9 MPa, approximately equal to 97.3 % of that of the base material (BM). The fracture occurred in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and was characterized by a ductile fracture mechanism. Moreover, the microstructural analysis revealed that dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurred in the WCZ, thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ), and fine-grained zone (FGZ)-HAZ of the joint. Compared to the BM, the grain size significantly decreased, and the thickness and spacing of lamellar cementite also reduced. These microstructural evolutions also contributed to the enhanced mechanical properties of the joints. This study provided new insights for welding in the rail transportation field.},

A strong correlation between stress and magnetic flux change was observed within the printed MPCs. Impact from the inclusion of fumed silica (FS) as a rheological filler in the matrix were identified and investigated. The tensile strengths of the MPCs were in the range of 31 MPa–34 MPa. The changes in magnetic flux density (Δ B ) of the MPCs under quasistatic loading were within the interval of 0.5 to 5.4 Gauss. A similar sensing behavior was obtained for the MPCs during cyclic loading. A similar sensing behavior was obtained for the MPCs during cyclic loading. Furthermore, it was found that incorporating the MPCs into specific layers further increased the tensile strength to over 40 MPa while still showing a significant Δ B response. Additionally, localized deposition of magnetostrictive particles at known stress concentrations emerged as a promising strategy for future stress-sensing endeavors.},

While components can endure complex in-service mechanical loading, the anisotropy in tensile properties has been the subject of limited attention. In this study, its origin was investigated focusing on the role played by millimeter scale β grains as they were recently identified as a source of heterogeneous deformation. Tensile properties of Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al processed via different thermomechanical routes were assessed using multiple sampling directions. In particular, elongation values were observed to vary significantly depending on the testing direction. A combination of SEM, EBSD, µ-CT and in-situ DIC during tensile tests was employed to clarify the underlying causes of this behavior. Substantial differences in strain heterogeneity and localization were found related to features of β grains, including their crystallographic and morphologic orientations. Furthermore, multiple fracture mechanisms were observed to derive from the differences in deformation behavior, and eventually compete to trigger specimen failure. Elongation values are then determined by both the degree of strain heterogeneity and the operating fracture mechanisms. These findings provide a new understanding of the role of the microstructure in the tensile behavior of high strength metastable β titanium alloys.},

However, this drastically increases the design complexity and time cost of metasurfaces. Here, we propose a method to design multispectral compatible function layer of camouflage which can achieve customizable wideband microwave absorption, visible transparency and selective infrared emission, simultaneously. The design of the camouflage layer is optimized and accelerated by Bayesian-neural network, which can be implemented based on a very limited amount of prior data and can greatly reduce the design complexity and time. To verify our method, an optical-transparent metasurface with digital infrared camouflage and low backward scattering was designed and fabricated. The simulation and experimental results well demonstrate the performance of multispectral compatible camouflage of the metasurface. We further explore the angular stability of the camouflage layer to the incident angle varying from 0 to 60° at microwaves. Our proposed design scheme provides a novel method to design spectrum-individual and devisable metasurfaces, which can be applied to camouflage in complex spectrum background.},

However, most existing methods to measure the d 33 were developed for ceramic or bulk materials and cannot be applied to soft materials because high force/pressure can deform and damage the material structure.

In this study, in-situ synchrotron X-radiography and numerical modeling were employed to investigate the Solute Suppressed Nucleation Zone (SSNZ) surrounding growing equiaxed grains in Al-13Cu alloys. Quantitative analysis of SSNZ and constitutional undercooling was conducted using image processing techniques. Solute concentration and SSNZ length in the &lt;110&gt; direction exceed those in the &lt;100&gt; direction, suggesting higher solute enrichment in dendrite centers. This causes greater undercooling in the dendrite growth direction (&lt;100&gt;) with faster dendrite growth rates. As equiaxed dendrites grow, SSNZ length in the &lt;100&gt; direction decreases while increasing significantly in the &lt;110&gt; direction. Utilizing data obtained from numerical simulations, we refined the analytical equation governing solute distribution preceding the solid–liquid interface under three-dimensional conditions, and the computational equation determining the SSNZ length. The SSNZ lengths derived from the optimized equation along the &lt;100&gt; and &lt;110&gt; directions demonstrate more agreement with both experimental observations and numerical simulation outcomes. Higher growth rates rapidly increase undercooling, limiting the development of nucleation-free zone.

  abstract     = {An innovative two-step approach of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) and spark plasma sintering (SPS) was developed to rapidly fabricate MoSi 2 and Mo(Al,Si) 2 ceramics for high-temperature anti-oxidation applications. The SHS process predominantly promoted the synthesis of high-purity and high-yield MoSi 2 and Mo(Si,Al) 2 phases in the alloyed powders. Subsequently, dense and crack-free MoSi 2 and Mo(Al,Si) 2 ceramics were produced using SPS. 1500 °C oxidation tests of the ceramics (100 h) revealed the formation of a protective SiO 2 oxide layer on the surface of MoSi 2 ceramics, while an Al-Si-O composite glassy oxide layer formed on Mo(Si,Al) 2 ceramics, which exhibited better thermal stability and lower oxygen permeability compared to the single SiO 2 oxide layer. However, an excessive Al content (&gt;0.05 at.%) compromised the oxidation resistance due to the emergence of a Si-depleted Mo 5 (Si,Al) 3 layer with inferior oxidation resistance, which was caused by the high-temperature diffusion of Si. Therefore, via this novel two-step SHS-SPS technique compact and crack-free Mo(Si,Al) 2 ceramics can be rapidly synthesized at high temperatures. When trace amount of Al was added (0.05 at.%), Mo(Si 0.95 Al 0.05 ) 2 showed optimum high-temperature oxidation resistance.},

  abstract     = {Searching for high-entropy alloys with functional properties that emerge from their multi-scale structure, we have investigated the (GaNi) x CoCrFe ( x = 0.4–1.6) system. We have characterized structure, microstructure, nanostructure and chemical composition of the individual phases in the multi-phase alloys and determined their magnetic, magnetostrictive and electrical properties. We found that the alloys are ferromagnetic and exhibit functional combination of magnetic softness and vanishing magnetostriction, classifying them as energy-efficient “supersilent” materials (inaudible to a human ear) for alternating-current (AC) electromagnetic applications in the audio-frequency range. The alloys develop a two-phase structure, a face-centered cubic (fcc) and a body-centered cubic (bcc), where the fcc phase fraction decreases, while the bcc fraction increases with the increasing (GaNi) x content. Ferromagnetism of the alloys originates from the highly nanostructured bcc phase, with the ferromagnetic Curie temperatures in the range T C = 750–700 K, depending on x . The fcc phase is not nanostructured and is paramagnetic at room temperature, but undergoes a spin glass transition at T f ≈ 6.4 K. The magnetic softness and vanishing magnetostriction of the alloys are both nanomagnetic phenomena. The magnetic-softness and magnetostriction parameters of the x = 1.3 and 1.6 alloys make them relevant for supersilent AC applications at low frequencies.},

Yet, first-generation BRS designs experienced a significantly higher rate of clinical failures compared to permanent implants. This prompted the development of alternative scaffolds, such as the poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) solvent-casted stent, whose mechanical performance has yet to be addressed. This study examines the mechanical behavior of this novel scaffold across a wide range of parallel and radial compression diameters. The analysis highlights the scaffold’s varying responses under different loading conditions and provides insights into interpreting simulation model parameters to accurately reflect experimental results. Stents demonstrated a parallel crush resistance of 0.11 N/mm at maximum compression, whereas the radial forces were significantly higher, reaching up to 1.80 N/mm. Additionally, the parallel test keeps the stent in the elastic regime, with almost no regions exceeding 50 MPa of stress, while the radial test causes significant structural deformation, with localized plastic strain reaching up to 30 %. Results showed that underestimating yield strain in computational models leads to discrepancies with experimental results, being 5 % the most accurate value for matching computational and experimental results for PLCL solvent-casted stents. This comprehensive approach is vital for optimizing BRS design and predicting clinical performance.},

These buried gas pipelines are at serious risk of electrochemical corrosion, which leads to safety and environmental threaten. In order to study the distribution of alternating stray current corrosion on pipeline surface on a larger spatial scale, this paper conducted numerical simulation and experimental validation of alternating stray current corrosion of buried gas pipeline. In the numerical simulation model, coupling between different physical fields are realized through the relationship between current density of pipe-to-soil interface, electrolyte, and electrodes. Proposed numerical method based on coupled multi-physics in this paper are in good agreement with experimental results under different influencing factors. A novel evaluation index was proposed to assess the corrosion risk within different zones on the pipeline surface. Results show that corrosion distribution is greatly influenced by spatial interaction between buried pipeline and rail transit system including crossing angle and parallel distance. Besides, alternating stray current corrosion on buried gas pipeline are proved to be both affected by dynamic characteristics due to AC fluctuation and operation mode of locomotive.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a new anti-irradiation mechanism relying on reversible disorder-ordering transition of coherent nanoparticles was discovered, which significantly improves the microstructural stability and void swelling resistance of metallic materials. However, the factors that govern the outstanding stability and superb radiation tolerance are still not clear. Here, two kinds of FeCrAl alloys were designed, each strengthened by a different type of coherent phase: L2 1 -ordered Fe2AlV and B2-ordered Ni (Al, Fe). It was observed that the two alloys exhibited disparate responses to high-dose ion irradiations at elevated temperatures. The L2 1 -Fe2AlV precipitates were found to be completely dissolved after 50 dpa of ion irradiation at 500–600 °C, whereas the B2-NiAl precipitates remained stability even after 200 dpa irradiation. This research challenges the conventional wisdom that the stability of nanoparticles is governed by the balance between radiation-enhanced coarsening and radiation dissolution. Instead, it demonstrates the re-nucleation and subsequent interface-controlled solute reshuffling processes govern the stability of coherent chemically-ordered nanoparticles under radiation at high temperatures. We demonstrate that the low interfacial energy, which is related to both the simply chemically-ordered lattice structure and low lattice misfit interface, is crucial for enabling such short-range elemental reshuffling process to repeatedly form nanoprecipitates that cannot be suppressed by radiation.},

The present work aims to build machine learning (ML) based surrogate models to predict retained austenite (RA) content and yield strength (YS) of isothermal transformed CFB steels and study the sliding wear performance. The input data for ML prediction were related to compositions, heat treatment process, and phases. The Random Forest regression and Gaussian process regression were respectively selected to build the predictive models for RA content and YS. Result shows that the predicted RA content agrees well with the experimentally determined ones in steel with high stability of untransformed austenite. For YS prediction, the present surrogate model can predict YS of CFB steels even without additional microstructural information such as dislocation and effective substructure size. Steels with different YS and RA content were designed to study the sliding wear performance. Result shows that the dominant wear mechanism of the tested steels is abrasive wear and the weight loss is inversely proportional to hardness when the load and wear distance are constant. Increasing YS and RA content can increase the initial hardness and work hardening ability at the worn surface, thereby enhancing wear resistance.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in additive manufacturing enable the development of artificial lattice structures with unique properties not found in natural materials. Specifically, filament-based lattices are known for having a lightweight yet strong nature, exhibiting auxetic behavior and excellent energy absorption capabilities. Recent research has focused on developing algorithms and frameworks to manipulate cell geometry and material properties to achieve unusual properties. However, the exploration of the full design space is hampered in practice primarily due to restrictions on cell tiling variation. Here, for the first time, a Tiling-Based Lattice Generation (TBLatGen) framework is presented that relies on various tiling operations and stochastic changes in internal cell geometry. By utilizing reflections, rotations, glide reflections, translations, and combinations of these operations, lattice structures are tiled to achieve an extensive range of properties. For instance, achieving Poisson&#39;s ratios ranging over at least ±20 using a minimal set of design parameters is demonstrated, a range unprecedented in prior studies. Experimental testing of a physical prototype validates the auxetic behavior of one newly proposed tiled lattice structure. Beyond this, the proposed TBLatGen framework is anticipated to be applicable to general periodic metamaterials, enabling the design and discovery of new structures exhibiting exceptional mechanical, thermal, electrical, or magnetic properties.},

However, SECs have a relatively bioinert interface hindering their application in biomaterials. Thus, surface modification is an efficient strategy to convert SECs into biocompatible materials better for biological applications. Previous approaches predominantly depend on labor-intensive, multi-stage procedures that are time-consuming. Herein, we report an ultrafast, one-step, and effective modification strategy to render SECs biocompatibility by coating them with ferric ions and tannic acids, which endow them with a better cell adhesion property. In summary, our results show that this ultrafast and one-step biocompatibility strategy enhances the functional characteristics of SECs and holds wide-ranging implications for bio-composite applications. .},

To further investigate abnormal grain growth, the quasi-in-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) experiment, including the EBSD testing and heating by thermal simulation testing machine, was proposed to observe the grain growth process in the weld. The results show that the abnormal grain growth behavior in the stir zone and the thermo-mechanically affected zone is different, and different microstructures at different positions in the weld promote the growth of abnormal grains. In the stir zone, the modified Humphreys’ model is used to analyze the abnormal grain growth behavior. The grains with an advantage size and low strain are more likely to grow abnormally. The non-uniform pinning caused by the dissolution of second-phase particles further promotes abnormal grain growth. In the thermo-mechanically affected zone, the abnormal grains are formed by unstrained equiaxed grains near the stir zone or recrystallized sub-grains. The growth of abnormal grains in the thermo-mechanically affected zone is a strain-induced grain boundary migration process.

Sequential anneals from 1000-1500 were used to determine the B2 solvus temperature ( T s , B 2 ) of each alloy and solvus lines were constructed for each system. HfRu-B2 is found to be more thermally stable than ZrRu, with HfRu-containing alloys demonstrating higher T s , B 2 at equivalent Ru concentrations. For alloys with T s , B 2 above 1200 , additional anneals at 1000 and 1200 provide insight into B2 volume fraction variations with temperature. Additional Hf- and Zr-rich tertiary phases also formed on the grain boundaries of the selected compositions at intermediate to high temperatures. Through transmission electron microscopy, the lattice misfits for the B2 precipitates were found to be ≈ 0.5% at 1000 and the grain boundary phases were identified as C14 Laves, L1 0 , β -Hf, and topologically close-packed P phases. Implications for the design of Nb-based alloys strengthened by Ru-B2 precipitates, including strategies to mitigate deleterious phase formation, are discussed throughout.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties and fracture behavior of high-carbon steel are closely related to the microstructural characteristics. This work developed the artificial representative volume element (RVE) model to explore the effects of microstructural characteristics on mechanical properties and fracture behavior of high-carbon steel containing high-density carbides under uniaxial tension. A series of RVEs with different ferrite grain sizes, particle volume fractions, and particle sizes were generated based on the RSA algorithms. The mechanism-based plasticity model and the three uncoupled damage models were implemented into the RVE modeling. The model parameters were calibrated by the corresponding simulation between in-situ μ DIC and microstructure-based RVE simulation. The predicted mechanical properties and fracture strain from the RVE simulation were in good agreement with the experimental results. Simulated results from a series of RVEs quantified the effects of ferrite grain sizes, particle volume fractions, and particle sizes on strength, elongation, and damage evolution of high-carbon steel containing high-density carbides: strength increases with increasing particle volume fraction while elongation decreases, as well as excessively large or small grain and particle size were not favored to improve elongation. These results were attributed to the damage and internal stress partition.},

  abstract     = {Iron-based shape memory alloys (Fe-SMAs) are e-merging materials with extensive application in civil structures owing to their unique properties, including the shape memory effect. However, it is crucial to understand the time dependent behavior of Fe-SMAs for their effective application as pre-stressing element. In particular, behavior at individual stress, the underlying mechanism, and the transformation kinetics have not been investigated yet. To address these important fundamental research gaps, in-situ compression creep and stress relaxation experiments with high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) of a Fe-17Mn-5Si-10Cr-4Ni-1(V,C) Fe-SMAs were conducted. The time-dependent behavior of the Fe-SMA was investigated at different stress levels with respect to the yield strength (YS) at room temperature. The experimental result showed that the material exhibits a creep strain of up to 1.84 % and 56 MPa relaxed stress at test stress of 769 MPa (1.6 σ YS ) within one hour of holding. Stacking fault probability and phase volume fraction quantification provide an understanding of the mechanisms based on different stress levels. The transformation kinetics traced from the characteristics of HEXRD peaks offer further insights on creep depending on the contribution of { hkl } families. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the existing models for predicting creep and stress relaxation of Fe-SMA.},

  abstract     = {Inverse design of metamaterial structures with customized strain-dependent Poisson’s ratio has significant potential across various applications. However, achieving precise control over these mechanical properties presents a challenge due to the complex relationship between geometry and mechanical performance. Here, we present a novel data-driven approach utilizing a constrained generative inverse design network (CGIDN) to address this challenge. The CGIDN uses backpropagation to efficiently navigate the design space and achieve target mechanical properties with high accuracy. Our method starts by generating a comprehensive dataset of Poisson’s ratio-strain curves for various geometries incorporating cuts. These curves are then compressed using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving essential features. A deep neural network (DNN) is then trained to map input geometric parameters to these principal components, with the architecture optimized using grid search. The CGIDN facilitates the inverse design process by recommending geometric parameters for unit cell designs that match specified target Poisson’s ratio-strain curves. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and experimental verification. The FEA results for the designed unit cells showed high agreement with the target and predicted curves, demonstrating the accuracy of the CGIDN model. Further, tensile tests on specimens confirmed that the inverse-designed structures reproduced the desired mechanical behavior upon scale-up. Our method, which enables efficient and accurate design of metamaterials with tailored mechanical properties, holds promise for applications in wearable devices, soft robotics, and advanced sensor systems.},

The proposed algorithm is highly efficient and excels in preserving the original fibre structures extracted from the micro-CT images. Besides, graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration is applied to further enhance the efficiency of the fibre overlap removal process. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is also modified for the generation of periodic 3D microstructures. For practical application, the proposed algorithm is implemented for both the artifactual fibre overlap removal within micro-CT images from an injection moulded part and the microstructure generation for 3D printed samples. The unidirectional elastic modulus of the resultant microstructures is computed via numerical simulations and shows a close match to the experimental measurements with relative errors less than 2%. Overall, the proposed algorithm significantly facilitates the reconstruction of micro-CT image-based numerical models and can also be easily repurposed to generate complex microstructures, which is of great value for the development of data-driven models for characterization and design of composite materials that demands large amounts of data on material microstructures.},

Conventionally, volume-weighted averaging of fiber diameters has been utilized as an appropriate microstructural descriptor to predict the static viscous permeability of 3D-RF media. However, the long wavelength acoustical properties of a 3D-RF medium are also sensitive to the smallest fibers, this is particularly true in the high-frequency regime. In our recent research, we demonstrated that an inverse volume-weighted averaging of fiber diameters can effectively serve as a complementary microstructural descriptor to capture the high-frequency behavior of polydisperse fibrous media. In the present work, we reexamine the identification of two representative volume elements (RVEs) which relies on the reconstruction of 3D-RF microstructures having volume-weighted and inverse-volume weighted averaged fiber diameters, respectively in the low-frequency and high frequency regimes. We investigate the implication of such a weighting procedure on the transport and sound absorbing properties of polydisperse fibrous media, highlighting their potential advantages. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with this research field. Finally, we provide a brief perspective of the future directions and opportunities for advancing this area of study.},

  abstract     = {High entropy alloys (HEAs) with single FCC structure exhibits unique structure and properties. However, lack of strength hinds the engineering application ability seriously. Therefore, it is urgent to propose effective methods and theories to enhance the strength while maintaining favorable plasticity. Introducing reinforced phases is one crucial research approach for improving the mechanical properties of HEAs. However, the resulting reduction in ductility has been neglected. In this work, we propose a novel multi-scale TiC coupling reinforced alloy which preserves the high plasticity while increasing the strength. The results demonstrate that TiC (μm) hinders the dislocations movement and improves strength through the second phase strengthening mechanism. Apart from acting as barriers to dislocation motion, the TiC (nm) also provides more dislocation sources in the distortion area at the junction with the matrix, which increasing the number of movable dislocations and enhancing the plastic strain capacity. Compared with the Al 0.4 alloy, the tensile yield strength of the Al 0.4 -TiC (μm + nm) alloy is increased by 145 %, the ultimate tensile strength is up to 574 MPa, while maintaining a high plastic strain by 30.1 %. The addition of multi-scale ceramic phase TiC provides a novel approach to obtain high strength and high plasticity HEAs.},

However, their rapid degradation behavior is insufficient to support the rapid growth and repair of living tissues. The new surface modification methods to slow down the degradation rate of Mg scaffolds and promote the rapid growth of living tissues is urgent. Here, we developed a chiral-enhanced composite functional coating on the surface of biomedical magnesium. Specifically, a chiral supramolecular hydrogel with graphene oxide (GO) was used to simulate the chiral environment of biological systems, enhancing the adsorption of osteogenic growth factors. Additionally, the silane layers cleverly crosslink traditional silane chains with supramolecular chiral fibers through a hydrogen bond network, which allows the bonding strength (critical loads) of the composite coating to be maintained between 245–275 mN and retains structural integrity when soaked in SBF for 7 days. It was found that both MC3T3-E1 cells growth and BMP-2 adhesion were significantly enhanced by GO-added left-handed chiral coatings, which exhibit superior bone growth-promoting effects. In summary, incorporating chiral features into functional coatings represents a transformative approach in the design and application of bone defect repair materials.},

Microneedles were fabricated by altering the drug-to-polymer weight ratios. Their mechanical properties, crystallinity, solubility, release, skin permeability and transdermal pharmacokinetics in rats were assessed. The optimal crystalline and amorphous microneedles were composed of drug/polymer at weight ratios of 1:0.03 and 1:2.5, respectively. They showed excellent insertion in rat skin with a puncture rate above 80%. Compared to drug powder or solution, they increased drug solubility, release and skin permeability. Crystalline microneedles gave sustained release and plasma concentration profiles, while amorphous microneedles provided a fast profile. Amorphous microneedles offered significantly faster T max and two-fold higher area under the concentration–time curve (AUC), indicating better transdermal bioavailability. In the safety test, microneedle-treated rat skin was recovered to normal within three days without any irritations.

Scaffolds are prepared using the porogen burn-off technique and are capable of converting NIR to green emission, used to release nitric oxide from S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine. NIR to green conversion is obtained by mixing CaWO 4 crystals (codoped with Yb 3+ and Er 3+ ) with bioactive borosilicate glass prior to the sintering process. The scaffold fabrication process has a detrimental impact on the upconversion properties of the crystals embedded in the porous scaffold due to the formation of internal/surface crystalline defects and surface chemical bonds in the crystals. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the brightness of the green emission, under 980 nm pumping, is sufficient to release nitric oxide from the scaffold covered with S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine. Addition of upconverter crystals, in the bioactive scaffold, has no impact on porosity, mechanical properties, reactivity in simulated body fluid nor cytocompatibility. The progressive dissolution of the scaffold, associated with the precipitation of a reactive layer (HA), has no noticeable influence on the green emission under 980 nm pumping, showing that the development of such biophotonic scaffolds opens the path to light actuated drug release in a spatial–temporal manner, in vivo.

  abstract     = {Coherent Al 3 X-type L1 2 -structured dispersoids have the potential of effectively stabilizing the grain structure and increasing strength. This concept has been successfully demonstrated for non-hardenable and rapidly solidified Al alloys. In precipitation-hardened Al alloys, effective dispersoid addition requires both controlling their high-temperature stability and minimizing their impact on precipitation hardening. The current study focuses on dispersoid-modified AlZn5.0Mg1.2 alloys, which exhibit MgZn precipitation upon age-hardening and include less than 1 wt% of Zr and Hf for dispersoid formation. Heat treatments between 350 °C and 500 °C for varying times were applied to evaluate dispersoid formation, thermal stability and the related strengthening potential. The microstructure was assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), and the mechanical response was evaluated by hardness testing. TEM after heating at 500 °C reveals Ostwald ripening for the dispersoids. APT results on the dispersoids reveal a core–shell structure development upon longer annealing times. The Zr–Hf-modified alloy exhibits a higher initial strength than the Zr-modified alloy but the latter displays greater strength retention even after prolonged exposure to 500 °C. This effect is attributed to a destabilization of the mixed Zr–Hf dispersoids that arises from lower enthalpic benefits of Al 3 Hf formation over Al 3 Zr.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates the anisotropic behavior of single crystalline diamonds (SCD) during ultra-short pulse (USP) laser machining. The ablation behavior of SCD synthesized by high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods is studied on their primary crystallographic planes: {100}, {110}, and {111}. The results show different ablation thresholds for each plane, with the {100} plane having the highest threshold for both SCD types. CVD diamonds exhibit higher ablation thresholds than HPHT diamonds, indicating synthesis methods influence USP laser machining. The anisotropy of material removal, breakouts, and cracks, dependent on the in-plane machining angle, is investigated by machining grooves on the {100}, {110}, and {111} planes. Each plane shows unique characteristics, with varying anisotropic behavior at different in-plane angles. The material removal rate (MRR) differs between planes and even between grooves at different in-plane angles on the same plane. Distinct cracking behaviors are also observed, emphasizing the relationship between the crystallographic plane and the in-plane angle. The ideal in-plane angle for stable and clean ablation on each plane is determined. Temporal beam shaping, with MHz burst pulses, effectively minimizes detrimental effects such as cracks during SCD processing, enhancing machining quality and expanding USP laser machining applicability.},

  abstract     = {Low-temperature sintering Ag technology is a feasible approach employed in power electron devices. In this study, the influence of the different amounts (0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.20 wt%) of silicon carbide nanowires (SiC NWs) on the properties and microstructure of micro-Ag paste sintered at 250 °C without pressure has been investigated. The results exhibit that the bonding strength of the Ag-SiC joint reaches a maximum of 43.57 MPa after doping 0.07 wt% SiC NWs, with an increase of 13 % compared with pure Ag joint. This enhancement mechanism can be owed to the Orowan mechanism and the pinning effect of SiC NWs, which nail at grain boundaries that will restrain the dislocation motion of Ag grains. Meanwhile, the electrical resistivity of Ag-0.07SiC shows a minimum value of 5.20 μΩ cm, approximately 10.65 % lower than pure Ag joint. This is attributed to the well-sintered Ag network and the bridging effect of SiC NWs distributed in Ag particles. Thus, incorporating appropriate content of SiC NWs into micro-Ag paste can strengthen the mechanical performance and electrical conductivity of sintered Ag joint. It is hoped that this research could develop a new micro-Ag paste with outstanding properties that could be employed in high-power electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Spider silk is known for its excellent strength and fracture resistance properties due to its molecular design structure, characterized by sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths. These structures have inspired reinforcements of synthetic polymer materials to enhance toughness. In this study, we mimic these natural toughening mechanisms by designing and manufacturing 3D-printed polymeric structures incorporating overlapping curls consisting of coiling fiber with sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths. Utilizing the liquid rope coiling effect, we manufactured overlapping curls using three polymers: polylactic acid (PLA), liquid crystal polymer (LCP), and polyamide 6 (PA6). Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to characterize the mechanical properties of overlapping curl as a function of geometries, post-treatments, and material constitutive parameters. Our results show that single-sided overlapping curls can fully unfold while double-sided curls are prone to premature failure. Heat-pressure post-treatment was found to significantly increase the load-capacity of the sacrificial bonds by up to due to increased contact area. However, the defects introduced in the fibre after the break of the sacrificial bonds, make the structure more susceptible to premature failure, limit the complete unfolding of the hidden length, and lead to a decrease up to of the toughness. To guarantee the complete unfolding of the hidden lengths and improve the toughness, we demonstrate that selecting a polymer material with either high fracture strength (e.g., LCP, ) or high fracture strain (e.g., PA6, &gt;2) is crucial, and increase toughness up to and , respectively.},

The primary challenge in path planning is to determine a printing turn angle that ensures uniform thermal distribution, thereby minimizing structural deformation while maintaining printing efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a composite function, which comprehensively characterizes the effects of the printing turn angle and the length of the printing path on the printing results. Combining a specific cubic porous structure, we calculate the maximum (P max ) and minimum (P min ) values of the composite function P, and compare the structural deformation and stress of the P max and P min paths with those of the typical P zigzag path. Finite element method (FEM) simulation and experimental validation show that the P max path achieves significantly lower structural deformation and residual stress compared to the P zigzag path and P min path.},

However, a significant issue with current RHEAs is that those exhibiting good mechanical properties tend to show poor oxidation resistance, and vice versa. In this paper, the oxidation kinetics of four RHEAs (20Ti-20V-20Cr-20Nb-20Ta, 25Ti-25V-5Cr-20Nb-25Ta, 20Al-20Ti-20V-20Cr-20Ta, and 14Al-24Ti-24V-14Cr-24Ta alloys) were investigated in an air atmosphere at 1000 °C. As-prepared and oxidised samples were characterised by a combination of state-of-the-art microscopy techniques. By replacing Nb with Al, the two Al-containing alloys were observed to form a less porous oxide microstructure, showing significant improvement in their oxidation resistance. As a result of oxygen/nitrogen ingress during oxidation and associated phase-segregation at high temperatures, the hardness of the underlying metal matrix of the RHEAs increased by approximately 5 GPa.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high green density is essential for ensuring the mechanical properties of powder metallurgy workpieces. However, the densification behavior of irregular ductile powders remains unclear due to oversimplification in current numerical simulations. To address this, a three-dimensional multi-particle finite element method model incorporating realistic powder morphology, size distribution, and stacking structure is constructed. It is found that a pivotal motion-deformation synergistic stage exists between the conventional particle rearrangement and elastic–plastic deformation stages. In this stage, plastic deformation is driven by the spheroidization of coarse powders, whereas the resulting vacancies in the stacking structure facilitate slight particle motion. Thereafter, plastic deformation is dominated by the flattening of fine particles, and the pore-filling capacity decreases due to the reduction in non-contact surface area. This synergistic and complementary interaction between the spheroidization of coarse powders and the flattening of fine powders enhances mechanical interlocking and promotes micropore closure. As a result, the micropores exhibit a tendency of downsizing and homogenization, substantially boosting the potential for achieving full densification during sintering. Based on these findings, a method for determining the optimal forming pressure is proposed, considering the manufacturing costs of powder compacts and the characteristics of the micropores in both green and sintered bodies.},

Subsequently, the model is utilized to investigate the dendrite morphology transition and primary dendritic arm spacing (PDAS). It is found that the velocity dependent solute partition and the resulting changes in constitutional undercooling strongly influence the estimated morphology region and PDAS. Moreover, the segregation and microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification were studied. And the results revealed that free dendrites lead to significant changes in microstructure and segregation under the influence of non-equilibrium effects. This work illustrates the great potential of the proposed model in simulating dendrites and microstructure evolution under a wide range of solidification conditions.

Additionally, the Bayesian optimization methods are employed to efficiently and accurately obtain parameters related to numerical calculations of crystal plasticity. The results indicate that at room temperature, the high activation resistance of the slip systems in the α 2 phase leads to limited slip activity, resulting in poor plasticity. However, at 750 °C and 850 °C, the strength of the slip systems decreases significantly, allowing more α 2 phase lamellae in the γ -TiAl alloy to undergo greater plastic deformation. This enhancement in the plastic deformation capacity of the α 2 phase lamellae reduce the overall deformation incompatibility in the TiAl alloy, thereby improving the overall ductile of the γ -TiAl alloy.},

  abstract     = {In light of the clinical challenges posed by bacterial infection and vascular damage in chronic diabetic wounds, this study presents a novel bioactive copper vanadate-based hydrogel (CVH) with multiple functions including the sustained release of copper and vanadium ions, photocatalytic activity under visible (VIS) light, and photothermal ability under near-infrared (NIR) light. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CVH effectively repairs high glucose-impaired human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and exhibits potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ). Furthermore, the dual biological functions are augmented by the NIR-light-induced mild photothermal effect, demonstrating a synergistic effect. The infected diabetic wound model further substantiates the therapeutic efficacy of the CVH dressing in eliminating bacteria and promoting angiogenesis under VIS/NIR light irradiation. Collectively, the CVH dressing demonstrates significant potential as a therapeutic intervention for managing chronic diabetic wounds.},

  abstract     = {Ultrashort-pulse lasers are an established technology for micromachining and have a great future. A major challenge remains the search for suitable laser parameters and a scanning strategy. To date, this has been achieved mainly by conducting experiments and measuring the resulting surfaces. The use of modeling methods for this purpose is not yet practical for industrial processing. In this work, the recently introduced geometric modeling method for pulsed laser ablation is applied to ultrashort laser ablation and extended to consider the power dependence of the process footprint and the pointing stability during ablation. This work highlights this modeling method to cover a wide range of process parameters in a time-saving manner and to simulate laser micromachining in real time. Furthermore, the influence of the processing height compared to the focal height on oxygen-free copper and steel 1.4034 was investigated. For both the ablation depth is decreased while simultaneously increasing the ablation width. For oxygen-free copper, the ablated volume is insensitive to changes in the processing height, which is not the case for steel 1.4034. The results also show the influence of the pulse repetition rate on the change in the shape of material removal and its influence on process stability.},

  abstract     = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe traumatic disease for which no satisfying treatment is available. The severe inflammatory reactions and poor endogenous regenerative capacity cause difficulty in functional recovery. Neural stem cells (NSCs) transplantation is currently a promising treatment for repairing SCI. However, there is a lack of effective ways to improve the survival rates of NSCs and promote the neuron differentiation rates of NSCs. Conductive hydrogel can mimic environment which is suitable for neurodevelopment. Low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields (LPEMFs) have the advantages of safety, non invasiveness, and tissue repair, making it a potential method of repairing SCI. In this study, an injectable, self-healing magnetic, and conductive hydrogel was synthesized to carry out NSCs with LPEMFs for repairing SCI. In vitro experiments, under the treatment of LPEMFs and conductive hydrogel, the microglia tend to polarize into M2 phenotype, rather than M1 phenotype. Meanwhile, NSCs tend to differentiate into neuronal direction. In SCI model, conductive hydrogel loaded with NSCs combined with LPEMFs can promote functional recovery, through reducing inflammation and promoting neuron differentiation of NSCs. This study provides a novel NSCs transplantation strategy combined with physical interventions for SCI treatment, which brings a new desire to repair SCI.},

The WG foams exhibit astounding mechanical properties; notably, foams with a relatively low density of ∼0.33 g/cm 3 demonstrated the highest compressive strength (5 MPa), due to their microstructure and pore morphology. In situ uniaxial compression tests combined with phase-contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography in a synchrotron revealed bending, buckling, fracture and splitting of the lamellar structures as main failure mechanisms. Our newly developed approach of continuous freeze-casting of pure WG solutions with an improved understanding of the relationship between composition, structure, and failure mechanisms provide a basis for a customized design and manufacture of a wide range of freeze-cast WG-based materials for applications ranging from biomedicine to energy generation and storage.},

Therefore, to improve their high-temperature oxidation and thermal shock resistance, the self-healing coating consisting of Al 2 O 3 -13 %TiO 2 layer, TiC layer and NiCrAlY layer was prepared for 321 steels in this work. The experimental and microstructural characterization results showed that the thermal shock resistance of such self-healing coating was remarkably improved as compared to the counterpart double-AT13 coating. This is because the volume increment resulting from the oxidation reaction between the TiC and oxygen decreased the porosity of the self-healing coating and retarded crack growth, which also led to the improved high-temperature oxidation resistance. Further, a thermal shock life model based on the crack growth model of Paris formula were developed. The modeling results not only agreed well with the experimental results but also indicated that thickening of thermal grown oxide (TGO) is the main cause of crack initiation and growth.},

  abstract     = {The development of sound-absorbing metamaterials/metastructures provides a new way to solve the problem of low-frequency and broadband sound absorption. However, designing ultra-broadband sound-absorbing metamaterials/metastructures with simple constructions is still a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a type of hybrid metastructure (HMS) consisting of slit-embedded Helmholtz resonators (HRs) covered with porous material modulation crowns (PMMCs) for ultra-broadband efficient sound absorption, with virtually no upper limit on the absorption frequency. Based on double porosity theory, an analytical prediction method for the absorption performance of HMS is developed and validated by comparison with finite element simulations and experiments. Analysis of the absorption mechanism reveals that the PMMCs facilitate impedance matching and energy dissipation within the HMS. This not only enhances low-frequency absorption but also grants excellent tunability and absorption performance at mid-to-high frequencies. It is demonstrated that a typical HMS composed of only four subunits can achieve efficient ultra-broadband absorption ( α ≥ 0.8) ranging from 100 Hz to more than 10000 Hz with a thickness of 200 mm. This work brings a new pathway for achieving low-frequency and ultra-broadband sound absorption using metastuctures with simple and lightweight constructions.},

The formation of GP T’ zone in the matrix is dramatically enhanced due to energetically favorable substitution of Al by Si and furtherly facilitates homogeneous growth of T’ phase by solute redistribution. η’ phase is transformed from T’ phase or evolved from GPII η’ zone along grain boundary due to feasible thermodynamic condition of Mg-poor and Zn-rich domain by distinct Mg and Zn exsolution on grain boundary. The present alloying design makes it possible that differential precipitation behavior of T’ phase and T’ + η’ phases can simultaneously occur in the matrix and adjacent to grain boundary, the alloy has obviously advantaged overall performance over traditional Al-Zn-Mg-(Cu) alloys, which raises a new perspective for developing new high-performance lightweight aluminum alloys.},

While rank-deficient materials such as hierarchical laminates have been shown to exhibit extreme elastic anisotropy, there is limited knowledge about the fully anisotropic elasticity tensors achievable with single-scale fabrication techniques. No established upper and lower bounds on anisotropic moduli exist. In this paper, we estimate the range of anisotropic stiffness tensors achieved by single-scale two-dimensional structured materials. We first develop a database of periodic anisotropic single-scale unit cell geometries using linear combinations of periodic cosine functions. The database covers a wide range of anisotropic elasticity tensors, which are then compared with the elasticity tensors of hierarchical laminates. We identify the regions in the property space where hierarchical design is necessary to achieve extremal properties. We demonstrate a method to construct various 2D functionally graded structures using this cosine function representation. These graded structures seamlessly interpolate between unit cells with distinct patterns, allowing for independent control of several functional gradients, such as porosity, anisotropic moduli, and symmetry. When designed with unit cells positioned at extreme parts of the property space, these graded structures exhibit unique mechanical behaviors such as selective strain energy localization, compressive strains under tension, and localized rotations.},

Size effects are commonly attributed to surface roughness, microstructure, and/or internal defects, but the relative importance of each is still not fully understood. To systematically study these effects, L-PBF specimens made of two microstructurally-distinct stainless steels (17-4PH and 316L) were manufactured and mechanically tested, in varied heat-treatment conditions and across a range of thicknesses and build angles. It was found that the size-dependent mechanical properties are efficiently predicted by the ratio of surface roughness to specimen thickness, R a / t , in a way that is relatively microstructure-agnostic. This metric is particularly useful for predicting ultimate strength and elongation, while microstructure moderates its predictive power for yield strength, especially in the more processing-sensitive 17-4PH. When considered in isolation, thickness or surface roughness had weaker correlations with mechanical properties and, importantly, tended to correlate much more strongly with one steel&#39;s properties than the other&#39;s. Comparing this comprehensive dataset with summary data from other researchers highlights the utility of R a / t , and provides semi-quantitative estimates of the relative impacts of porosity, microstructure, and R a / t on size-dependent properties.},

  abstract     = {Thermoset polymers exhibit very appealing mechanical and functional properties. Direct ink writing (DIW) could open new possibilities in the design and fabrication of intricate thermoset parts, but it often requires the use of additives such as fumed silica or nanoclays to modify the rheology of uncured epoxies. However, relatively large concentrations are usually needed what can be detrimental to properties. Graphene-derived additives are an appealing alternative, but we need to understand the key physicochemical characteristics that define an optimum graphene rheology modifier. Here we compare the effect of three different carbon fillers on the viscoelastic response of a reprocessable epoxy vitrimer with shape memory capabilities, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphene powder (GP), and assess the effect of their chemistry and morphology. The analysis shows that large (∼20 μm in size) rGO flakes enable the formation of strong, printable gels, through Van der Waals interactions and physical entanglement. The vitrimer could be successfully printed by incorporating 5 wt% of rGO. The printed parts exhibit tensile strengths (30–60 MPa), moduli (2–3 GPa), strength recovery after reprocessing (∼80 %), shape-memory properties comparable to the pure epoxy, and improved water resistance due to the introduction of hydrophobic rGO.},

  abstract     = {This study reveals the influence of crystal orientation on formation of growth twins in magnetron-sputtered coatings. A comparison between materials with low and high stacking fault energy (SFE) was made: CoCrFeMnNi (25 mJ/m 2 ) and Ni (125 mJ/m 2 ). The coatings were grown on a polycrystalline 316L stainless-steel substrate with near-random crystal texture, providing a comprehensive selection of samples on a single substrate. Electron backscatter diffraction was used to identify the film orientation, followed by transmission electron microscopy of selected regions. The presence and density of twins depended on both the material and the growth orientation. For Ni, nanotwins were observed on &lt; 5 % of the substrate grains, on growth directions closest to 〈1 1 1〉 . All other film orientations grew epitaxially with a cube-on-cube relationship. For CoCrFeMnNi, nanotwinning was observed on 50 % of the substrate grains, deviating &lt; 35° from 〈1 1 1〉 . In the nanotwinned regions, the twin spacing was 10–100 nm for Ni and 2–20 nm for CoCrFeMnNi. The presence of nanotwins increased hardness in both materials. The mechanism behind these differences is discussed, together with other parameters for controlling twin density. Our results show that control of the growth process can be used for nanotwin-engineering in magnetron-sputtered materials with low SFE.},

It is found that the precipitation phase and the corresponding phase coarsening significantly influence the ductility of alloys. Furthermore, anisotropic features in ductility are observed after phase coarsening. Generally, as the volume fraction of precipitation particles or the degree of phase coarsening increases, the ductility of alloys gradually decreases; and it initially increases and then decreases gradually with the increase of loading angle, presenting an inverted ‘V’ shape. Comparatively, for the alloys with lower volume fraction of precipitation particles and higher degree of phase coarsening, the ductility shows different variation trends with the degree of phase coarsening and loading angle compared with that in materials with other microstructure features, taking the minimum value at the loading angle of 45°. The variations of ductility are closely connected to the characteristics of precipitate shape, size and distribution. The microstructure evolution and the loading direction significantly affect the initiation and movement of dislocations within the material, and result in various macroscopic ductility characteristics in the Ni-based superalloys.},

Fabrication of nanogauges for monitoring during high temperature oxidation was presently investigated up to 1000 °C. Several materials were tested in terms of mechanical behaviour and maximum working temperature for gauges used as markers during thermal loading under air. The experimental determination of the optimized gauges material for high temperature oxidation was validated. SiO 2 offers particularly interesting features for gauges to determine the mechanical state of metal/oxide system. In this article, a special attention has also been paid to two nano-fabrication processes, as well as their limits. The standard electron beam lithography process is well suited to build gauges for oxidation applications, and can be improved by use of reactive ion etching process. The gauges can eventually reach several micrometers height such that the oxidation layer does not cover the gauges during thermal loading for relevant monitoring at short oxidation times. To illustrate, an application to a 17-4PH stainless steel oxidized at 480 °C is proposed and stress kinetics are deduced and related to an advanced thermomechano-chemical model, as well as identification of the numerical values of different thermomechano-chemical parameters associated to mechanisms of growth or relaxation.},

To achieve a DP microstructure with equiaxed and well-dispersed martensite, the concept of segregation neutralisation was utilised, where the ratio of Mn to Si elements was decreased (from 7.4 to 0.3) to neutralise the effect of Mn segregation on generating the banded martensite. A combination of micromechanical modelling simulations and in-situ notch tensile testing (within an SEM) was employed to compare the micro strain field and void formation rate between the segregation-neutralised and the benchmark grades. The benchmark grade showed extensive void coalescence along the direction of shear bands in the tensile sample after the average tensile strain of 30%. In contrast, no void coalescence was observed in the segregation-neutralised DP steel even at the average tensile strain of 80% just before failure. As a result, post-uniform elongation in the segregation-neutralised grade increased to 63.3%, compared to 30.1% in the benchmark grade.},

  abstract     = {High-entropy alloy (HEA) type energetic structural materials (ESMs) offer exceptional strength, adequate ductility and reactivity upon dynamic loading, thus demonstrating great potentials in pyrotechnic applications. However, the main factors governing their energetic performance remain elusive, primarily attributable to the intricate mechanical-thermal-chemical coupling effects and the inherent challenges of HEA design. To address this, we propose a small-data machine learning framework designed to predict the energetic performance of HEA-type ESMs, employing support vector regression, leave-one-out cross-validation, and principal component analysis (PCA) to effectively manage a small, unevenly distributed, and highly dimensional dataset. Notably, the framework achieved a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.854 while upholding robust performance, interpretability and computational efficiency. Fracture elongation ( ε t ) and compressive yield strength ( σ cys ) were identified as critical features, with σ cys positively influencing performance while both ε t and unit theoretical heat of combustion (UTHC) demonstrated negative effect. Guided by the framework, a series of novel Ti-V-Ta-Zr alloys with the comparable UTHC, velocity ( v ) and weight ( m ) but tailored ε t and σ cys were designed and tested. Ti 30 V 30 Ta 30 Zr 10 alloy exhibited a commendable balance of mechanical properties and the smallest mean particle size, aligning with the model predictions and suggesting more thorough energy release during ballistic experiments.},

The development of coatings on metallic BPPs is essential for its application in PEMFCs. However, both the design and preparation of metallic BPP coatings face great challenges of increasing requirements, low efficiency, insufficient performance, and high cost. In present work, the design, manufacture and evaluation of coatings on metallic BPPs are extensively reviewed and explored. The changing requirements including corrosion resistance, conductivity, hydrophobicity, and mechanical properties for metallic BPP coatings and corresponding evaluation methods are comprehensively discussed. Especially, improved mechanical properties are critical for the emerging precoated metallic BBPs. Numerous coatings previously developed are quantitatively compared to provide guidance for the coating material selection. For highly efficient development of high-performance and low-cost coating, the material-structure-properties relationship of coatings is thoroughly summarized as the coating design principle. Moreover, different design methods including experimental, calculation, and machine learning are respectively in depth explored and compared, suggesting that machine learning combining decreased experiments and material calculation is a high-efficiency and effective method for coating design.},

  abstract     = {Mobile microrobots have gained increasing attention in biomedical applications because they can be precisely actuated to targeted positions in a tiny space. However, their use in biomedical applications is hindered by the costly and complicated fabrication method. Herein, a facile fabrication method is proposed to produce magnetic alginate microrobots with adjustable dimensions, including teardrop and tadpole shapes, via tunable centrifugally-driven flows. The formation of these microrobots is interpreted by finite element analysis, revealing that the transition between the dripping and jetting regimes of the flow alters the microrobot&#39;s shape. The dimensions of the microrobots are quantitatively analyzed based on the flow&#39;s extrusion velocity, controlled by nozzle diameters and revolution speeds. Incorporating magnetic nanoparticles into the alginate-based hydrogel enables the microrobots to exhibit distinct motion patterns under a magnetic field. The teardrop-like microrobot can reach a maximum rolling velocity of approximately 2.7 body length s −1 at 2 Hz, while the maximum stick-slip velocity of the tadpole-like microrobot reaches about 0.42 body length s −1 at 5 Hz, comparable to the existing bioinspired magnetic microrobots. These two motion patterns allow the microrobot to overcome obstacles and navigate in vertically constrained environments, respectively. Last, an ultrasound imaging system is deployed to monitor the locomotion and degradation of the microrobots, showing their potential for targeted drug delivery applications.},

A smaller-scale TPMS lattice structure was integrated within the internal volume of the sheet-network Schwarz Primitive TPMS cell, culminating in a hybrid hierarchical architecture. Various TPMS topologies with distinct mechanical behavior and varying relative density combinations were examined. Experimental and numerical approaches were developed to reveal the structure’s deformation behaviour and quantify stiffness, anisotropy, quasi-static uniaxial compressive strength, and energy absorption capacity. The topological design of the internal lattice was found to play a key role in defining the mechanical performance of the integrated structures, leading to enhanced energy absorption up to 4 times that of the reference structure. Moreover, all the studied hierarchical topologies exhibited a lower Emax/Emin ratio in comparison to the reference topology, indicating more isotropic performance of the hybrid designs (upto 40% reduction of anisotropy). The findings underscore the significant promise of hybrid hierarchical design methodologies in attaining lattice structures with tailored properties.},

To unravel the reinforcing mechanisms of multidirectional auxetic lattices, which exhibit auxetic behavior in both planar and out-of-plane directions, X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) was utilized to analyze composite damage evolutions under different strain levels. The micro-CT characterization reveals that auxetic lattices more effectively constrain crack growth and dissipate energy by distributing stress evenly within the cement matrix. In contrast, due to lack of lateral confinement, the non-auxetic lattice reinforced composites primarily dissipate energy through extensive crack propagation and interfacial damage, leading to lower peak strength. When strain exceeding 5%, although the confinement from the auxetic behavior diminished with crack propagation, the lattice can still maintain the composite’s structural integrity, resulting in 1.7 times higher densification energy than conventional cement-based materials. These findings provide valuable insights for designing auxetic lattice-reinforced cementitious composites with enhanced load-bearing capacity and improved dissipation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The wide performance variation and inability for destructive testing make accurately determining ancient brick mechanical properties crucial for assessing structural safety in ancient masonry. This paper uses multiscale modeling with microscopic finite element analysis to quantitatively assess ancient brick macroscopic stress–strain relationship and compressive strength based on microstructural characteristics. The basic parameters such as porosity, pore size distribution, mineral composition and volume ratio, and microstructure characteristics of ancient bricks were obtained by corresponding methods. The Mori-Tanaka homogenization theory was applied to derive a three-phase equivalent brick matrix using elastic moduli and Poisson’s ratios of quartz, kaolinite, and montmorillonite at the microscale. The Representative Volume Element model with pores was created based on this matrix and pores, integrating Drucker-Prager plastic damage for finite element analysis of ancient brick mechanical behavior. The results indicate that stress–strain curves from the multi-scale micromechanics model resemble macroscopic experimental curves and maintain consistent peak strength. This shows that combining microscopic testing with finite element simulation for analyzing the mechanical properties of ancient bricks is feasible, providing a new non-destructive means of obtaining these properties.},

This study poses an approach based on computational homogenization to estimate the elastic constants of fused filament fabrication 3D-printed parts. A whole methodology for characterization and experimental validation is necessary to improve finite element numerical models. Samples are characterized both mechanically and geometrically. To improve the characterization, novel algorithms based on micro-computed tomography images and image segmentation techniques are implemented. Thereafter, elastic constants are estimated, informed by the characterization results. The method’s effectiveness is assessed through a deep comparison, based on the digital image correlation technique, between different experimental samples and finite element models. Results show that the numerical estimation provided in this work is accurate enough to develop realistic finite element models, including anisotropy of the structures. However, defects and voids developed during 3D printing are an important source of error for these numerical models.

  abstract     = {Achieving exceptional ductility in ultra-high strength steels has long been a formidable challenge, particularly when the yield strength reaches 2.0 GPa. In this study, we have designed an innovative tri-phase lamellar microstructure in medium Mn steel that successfully achieves both an ultrahigh yield strength of approximately 2.0 GPa and an impressive uniform elongation ranging from 22.5 % to 24.5 %. The ultra-high yield strength of this steel is primarily due to the ultrafine lamellar grain with high-density dislocations and HDI strengthening resulting from meticulously designed tri-phase lamellae. The remarkable ductility is attributed to the synergistic action of multiple plasticity mechanisms. The inherently excellent plasticity of the lamellar ferrite, in coordination with the lamellar martensite, generates significant HDI hardening, thereby suppressing the onset of necking in the early stages of deformation. During the mid-stage of deformation, high strain activates the transformation-induced plasticity effect in the highly stable austenite, which remains stable due to substantial HDI hardening and effectively mitigates strain localization. In the later stages of deformation, delamination cracking relieves stress accumulation at the interfaces, delaying material failure. These mechanisms elevate yield strength and uniform elongation product to 47.3 GPa·%, showcasing the tri-phase lamellar structure’s potential for ultrahigh-strength, high-ductility steels.},

  abstract     = {This study enhances the molecular analysis of bitumen by transitioning from traditional chemical descriptors, such as SARA (Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes) fractions and elemental compositions, to specific force field atom types in Molecular Dynamics (MD) models. This shift improves the precision in predicting material properties critical for bituminous material characterization. Machine Learning Models (MLMs) were developed to use these atom types as input features, inherently reflecting fundamental chemical characteristics. Trained on data from over 1,770 LAMMPS simulations of diverse bitumen types and conditions, these MLMs enable the prediction of properties like density, heat capacity, solubility parameters, and thermal expansion coefficients without the need for additional MD simulations. The models utilize 30 chemical descriptors corresponding to specific atom types in the PCFF force field, which collectively account for over 95% of the influence on these properties. By accurately predicting fundamental, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties, the use of MLMs and force field atom types allows researchers to efficiently tweak the chemical nature of organic molecules and mixtures to achieve desired properties. With near-instantaneous prediction times, these MLMs offer valuable insights for advancing bitumen research in the construction and petroleum industries, reducing the need for more intensive simulation techniques.},

The ML-yield strength model and ML-fracture strain model achieve excellent predictions (R 2 = 0.942, RMSE=0.35) and (R 2 = 0.892, RMSE=0.41) in the testing set, respectively. Based on the machine learning model, Nb 0.22 Ta 0.22 Ti 0.24 V 0.23 W 0.09 , Nb 0.24 Ta 0.22 Ti 0.26 V 0.04 W 0.24 , Nb 0.26 Ta 0.24 Ti 0.21 V 0.24 W 0.05 , and Nb 0.18 Ta 0.26 Ti 0.22 V 0.21 W 0.13 RHEAs in the Nb-Ta-Ti-V-W RHEA system were screened and synthesized.

The mixing enthalpy of RHEAs is negatively correlated with the yield strength, whereas a negative relationship exists between electronegativity difference and fracture strain through the SHAP analysis. Decreasing the mixing enthalpy and increasing the electronegativity difference promote the formation of the precipitated phase. The electron probe microanalysis reveals that the differences in mechanical properties (yield strength and fracture strain) in the NbTaTiVW RHEAs primarily stem from the fraction of the precipitated phase.},

  abstract     = {The Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy is widely used in automotive lightweighting and other applications due to its excellent mechanical properties. However, when this alloy is cast using metal molds, it exhibits high hot tearing susceptibility (HTS), increasing the risk of use. Volumetric shrinkage due to density differences during the transition from liquid to solid metal produces shrinkage stresses. At the same time, lacks feeding of the remaining liquid phase in the late solidification stage can also lead to hot tearing. The purpose of this paper is to present a device for quantitatively determining and optimizing HTS. The relationship between solidification shrinkage displacement and stress was tested in a quantitative way using a Self-designed T-tester equipped with stress and displacement sensors. The test results show that the reduction of grain size shifts the solidification shrinkage of the alloy and reduces the solidification shrinkage stress, which avoids hot tearing caused by higher solidification shrinkage stress and local stress inhomogeneity. Secondly, the grain size reduction increases the number of feeding channels in the solidification vulnerable stage, and more liquid phase is available for crack healing. In addition, the influence of casting process parameters on the HTS was studied.},

Given the critical impact of CNT dispersion, waviness, and orientation on the electrical conductivity, a theoretical model was developed to incorporate these factors. Experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the material’s conductivity and mechanical performance, and to validate the model. The results show that CNTs align with the printing direction at a 3D-printed layer’s surface, while maintaining isotropic behaviour at the core. Additionally, although the CNTs aggregate, they do not entangle with each other, instead creating conductive networks within the bundles. Moreover, the CNTs are not straight but wavy, which affects the material’s electrical conductivity. Based on the experimental results and the analytical model, a finite element model was developed to predict the conductivity of printed layers, accounting for varying CNT orientations throughout the layer. The results indicate that the model overestimates 3D-printed materials’ conductivity, suggesting that further studies are needed to account for interlayer effects on the measurements.},

Dermaseptin-PP, a cationic antimicrobial peptide, has demonstrated the ability to enhance the penetration and accumulation of drugs within solid tumors due to its unique membrane-breaking action. Based on this, we designed glutathione (GSH)-sensitive paclitaxel liposomes modified with Dermaseptin-PP. Dermaseptin-PP was modified through disulfide bonding, which could be broken at the tumor site due to high GSH levels. This cleavage resulted in the release of Dermaseptin-PP, thereby enhancing the permeability of the paclitaxel liposomes within the tumor. We found that the paclitaxel liposomes modified with Dermaseptin-PP were extensively distributed to the tumor site, and the Dermaseptin-PP modification significantly enhanced liposome penetration within the tumor. Our study significantly increased the anti-tumor efficacy of paclitaxel liposomes. Our study confirms that paclitaxel liposomes modified with Dermaseptin-PP is an effective anti-tumor therapy that enhances deep penetration into tumors.

However, the side effects of these drugs include nausea and vomiting, significant fluctuations in blood concentration, and poor patient compliance. Therefore, improving the route of administration and enhancing therapeutic efficacy are major research focuses. Here, we propose the use of hierarchically structured hydrogel-encapsulated mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSNs) to encapsulate GAH, with the goal of minimizing adverse reactions in the stomach. By enabling the slow release of the drug over an extended period, these hydrogels aim to reduce the frequency of dosing, thereby improving the efficiency of drug administration and enhancing patient compliance. Owing to these properties, drug-carrying microcapsules are capable of achieving optimal drug delivery and have emerged as excellent candidates for AD therapy.

Furthermore, high electromagnetic transmittance up to 80 % of NESC was ensured through electromagnetic design. Besides the high-efficient and electromagnetic compatible anti-icing performance, NESC also performs high resistance to acid/alkali, abrasion and impact, good heating uniformity, stable photothermal effect, and potential of large-area manufacture.

  abstract     = {Poly (p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA), is well known as a material with excellent properties, but its application is greatly limited due to the harsh methods required for its preparation. This study proposes an innovative carbodiimide-assisted polymerization (CAP) method to simplify the synthesis process of PPTA. The η inh of the prepared PPTA is 4.97 dl/g. Achieving amidation condensation at normal temperature and pressure, this method is suitable for synthesizing PPTA and allows for the recycling of the condensation reagent, offering a novel approach to green synthesis. Compared to the commercial fiber Kevlar 29, PPTA exhibits similar thermal stability, with negligible decomposition before 500°C. Using the deprotonation method to prepare aramid nanofiber (ANF) resulted in various shapes of bulk materials. The ANF bulk exhibits excellent mechanical properties, with tensile and compressive strengths of 36.9 MPa and 60.68 MPa, respectively, on par with standard engineering materials. Additionally, ANF and PPTA share similar thermal stability. Furthermore, the study prepared aramid nanofiber/partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (ANF/HPAM) composite paper, which demonstrated outstanding mechanical performance and thermal stability. The ANF/HPAM composite paper (2% concentration of HPAM) exhibited a tensile strength of 63.32 MPa. These findings offer new insights into developing high-performance fiber materials.},

  abstract     = {The equiatomic face-centred cubic (FCC) CoNiCrFeMn alloy, known as the Cantor alloy, is renowned for its high ductility under extreme conditions, such as cryogenic temperatures. Despite this, it suffers from low hardness and yield strength (YS) and includes elements with significant supply concerns. This study introduces novel non-equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn alloys, designed using machine learning (ML)-assisted-high-throughput atomistic simulations to enhance sustainability and mechanical properties such as hardness and YS while maintaining the alloy&#39;s single-phase FCC structure. We incorporated two critical sustainability indicators, end-of-life recycling rate ( E O L − R R ) and lifetime ( τ ), to guide the alloy design process. Mean-flow stress (MFS), measured from the yield point to 15% strain during tensile tests, was used to assess and predict the mechanical properties. Two alloys, with cobalt contents of 12.5% and 21.5%, were developed and analysed. The Co12.5 alloy showed better sustainability (44% improvement in τ with almost the same mechanical properties), while the Co21.5 alloy exhibited better mechanical properties (20% improvement in MFS with almost the same sustainability) as the equiatomic system. Their stable FCC microstructures were confirmed through CALPHAD modelling and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of vacuum arc melted, as-cast samples. The results highlight the potential of integrating sustainability metrics into high-performance alloy design.},

  abstract     = {Designing and manufacturing advanced structural microwave absorbers is one of the most feasible methods to address the growing electromagnetic stealth and protection challenges in both military and civilian domains. To this end, under the application context of structural–functional integration, a series of nanocomposites with varying ratios were prepared using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and inexpensive thermoplastic polypropylene as raw materials. The dispersion of nanofillers, rheological properties, thermal properties, and mechanical properties were evaluated. The research found that the impedance matching factor of the electromagnetic wave absorbers plays a more critical role in determining the material’s absorption capacity compared to the loss factor. Simple structural layering by changing the composition and design can effectively increase the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of the absorbers, with microwave attenuation primarily arising from conductive loss, interfacial polarization, dipole polarization, and multiple reflections. Finally, a multi-scale quasi-honeycomb absorber was fabricated using multi-material 3D printing with a structured design. Both simulation and experimental results showed consistent trends, demonstrating low sensitivity to the incident azimuth angle. This research features simplicity, low cost, and strong design capability, providing a new strategy for the preparation of functionally graded materials with potential applications in electromagnetic wave absorption.},

  abstract     = {Understanding plastic heating at high strain rates is essential for designing material behavior. We employ molecular dynamics to analyze plastic heating and introduce a refined Taylor-Quinney coefficient (TQC) calculating approach. Our results reveal a two-stage heating behavior in high-strength systems, a relaxation stage characterized by rapid heating, stress relaxation, and increasing TQC , followed by a steady-state stage marked by linear temperature increase, constant stress, and stable TQC . The dislocation movement may behave as a plastic heating converter. During the relaxation stage, defect/dislocation nucleation dominates, leading to an increase in TQC as defect density rises upon yielding. Despite an increasing portion of plastic work being stored in defects, the data suggest that dislocations primarily act as sources of heat. In the steady-state stage, an unusual scenario emerges where defect density decreases as plastic deformation proceeds, yet TQC continues to increase due to the release of stored energy. This phenomenon is potentially explained by the annihilation of dislocation dipoles moving towards each other on the same slip plane. Additionally, TQC remains relatively insensitive to variations in temperature and strain rate over a broad range, challenging prior assumptions and expanding the understanding of plastic heating mechanisms.},

However, challenges arise when welding Al alloys to Ti alloys due to the formation of detrimental intermetallic compounds at the interface. With the implementation of ultrasonic vibrations, the temperature and strain rate were both increased during Al/Ti friction stir welding (FSW), leading to the formation of an amorphous interlayer, instead of intermetallic compound (IMC), at the interface. The interfacial microcracks were eliminated in the ultrasonic vibrations assisted friction stir welding (UVFSW). There were Ti particles separated from the Ti substrate and dispersed in the Al alloy, thereby resulting in a more gradual and moderate evolution of the interfacial microstructure. Due to the improved interfacial microstructure with ultrasonic vibrations, the lap shear strength was almost twice that of the conventional FSW welds within same welding conditions. Meanwhile, ultrasonic vibrations also improved the fabrication efficiency with a higher optimal traversing speed. The failure mode shifted from interface separation of FSW welds to a shear dimple fracture of the UVFSW welds, demonstrating the better plasticity and reliability of the UVFSW Al/Ti dissimilar joints.},

However, improving the magnetism by nanocrystallization always brings about the sacrifice of resistivity, presenting a common trade-off in Fe-based amorphous-nanocrystalline alloys. Here, the comprehensive merits of both superior soft-magnetic properties (high saturation magnetization of 1.81 T and low coercivity of 3.8 A/m) and high resistivity of 117.2 μΩ·cm were obtained by precisely tailoring amorphous-nanocrystalline microstructure close to electrical percolation threshold for a Fe 82.5 B 12 P 2 C 1 Cu 0.5 Co 2 amorphous alloy. The soft-magnetic properties are attributed to the low magnetic anisotropy stemming from high nuclei number density and ultrafine nanocrystalline grains of 9.2 nm. The high resistivity is associated with the electrical percolation behavior with a nanocrystalline volume threshold of 14.8 % in the composite alloy. The results provide an effective strategy to overcome the trade-off in traditional amorphous-nanocrystalline alloys, significant for applications in high-frequency, high-power, and energy-saving devices.},

Then, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) models were constructed to categorize phase structures of HEAs with high accuracies. Moreover, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) algorithm was employed for data oversampling to address the data imbalance issue. It was found that imbalanced learning significantly improves the phase prediction, particularly for the minority class, without costing the overall prediction accuracy. Finally, a machine learning-base protocol was proposed to integrate established models to classify the phase formation of HEAs into seven phase labels, and its generalization ability was verified. The present work provides a practical approach in predicting phase structures of HEAs and enhances the efficiency in developing advanced HEAs.},

  abstract     = {Gas adsorption and separation/desorption are two pivotal stages in gas capture, demanding additional energy for liberating gas molecules from the adsorbent. Hence, it’s essential to engineer an adsorbent with minimal energy consumption yet effective gas adsorption–desorption characteristics. Accordingly, this research introduces a carbon nano-network (CNN) material capable of inhaling and exhaling gases via self-deformation. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the gas adsorption–desorption capabilities of CNN can be efficiently regulated by its deformation. While the size of CNN minimally affects the gas sorption rate, a larger CNN necessitates a prolonged duration to achieve saturation under identical gas conditions. Incorporating elongated appendages in CNN enhances both its stability during contraction and its efficiencies in gas adsorption and desorption. We discerned that attaining a critical gas density within a confined space is imperative to initiate self-desorption of CNN. Specifically, if the gas density dips below this critical threshold–set at 5.2 times that of CO 2 at room temperature (300 K) and atmospheric pressure (1 Bar)–CNN exhibits no self-desorption capability. Nevertheless, even a marginal elevation in gas density triggers and maintains self-desorption with a consistently surpassing desorption ratio of 98 %. This discovery offers valuable insights for designing automatic self-desorption materials or apparatuses.},

In particular, 4D-printed mechanical metamaterials exhibit extraordinary mechanical performance by integrating multiphysics stimuli with advanced structures when actuated by external factors, thereby altering their shapes, properties, and functionalities. This critical review offers readers a comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing 4D printing technology for developing novel mechanical metamaterials. It provides essential information about the multifunctionalities of 4D-printed mechanical metamaterials, including energy absorption and shape-morphing behavior in response to physical, chemical, or mechanical stimuli. These capabilities are key to developing smart and intelligent structures for multifunctional applications such as biomedical, photonics, acoustics, energy storage, and thermal insulation. The primary focus of this review is to describe the structural and functional applications of mechanical metamaterials developed through 4D printing. This technology leverages the shape-shifting functions of smart materials in applications such as micro-grippers, soft robots, biomedical devices, and self-deployable structures. Additionally, the review addresses current progress and challenges in the field of 4D-printed mechanical metamaterials. In conclusion, recent developments in 4D-printed mechanical metamaterials could establish a new paradigm for applications in engineering and science.},

  abstract     = {Multi-ceramic additive manufacturing has always been a topic of discussion, considering that implementing multiple materials in one structure can bring innovative functionalities to it. However, the realization of the fabrication system is still plagued by cross-contamination when alternating materials. Therefore, we developed a new machine and suggested a stamping cross-contamination prevention system to address this issue. The contaminant removal mechanism was understood, efficiency was improved, and the stamping process parameters were optimized. To demonstrate, a bone hierarchical structure naturally modeled with advanced functionality to withstand mechanical loads and assist metabolic reactions was replicated. The material combination chosen included chemically identical calcium phosphates and bioglass. First, specific properties such as compressive strength were measured, and in-vitro bioactivity was evaluated to assign appropriate roles. Subsequently, the functionality of the hierarchical structure was controlled and fabricated using the previously optimized parameters. Finally, cross-contamination and multi-functionality of the generated structure were confirmed again for conclusion.},

  abstract     = {The fracture toughness of oxide glasses can be improved through controlled crystallization, forming glass-ceramics. However, to fully exploit their potential, an atomic-scale understanding of the toughening mechanism is needed. In this work, we investigate the structural origin of the variation in fracture toughness of barium titanosilicate glass-ceramics with varying crystallinity by combining experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Generally, the glass-ceramics exhibit improved hardness, elastic modulus, and fracture toughness compared to the precursor glasses. The simulation results of 40BaO-20TiO 2 -40SiO 2 glass-ceramics reveal that the differences can primarily be attributed to titanium bond switching events, namely, the change of the titanium coordination number under stress to dissipate mechanical energy. We also show that by tuning the content and aspect ratio of the formed fresnoite crystals, the fracture behavior of the glass-ceramics can be modified due to the redistribution of the stress field before fracture, which in turn controls the fracture path.},

The re-entrant NPR structure, fabricated from carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), serves as the skeleton, while the aluminum foam acts as an enhancer. The impact behaviours of a representative volume element were tested in three characteristic directions (referring to the in-plane re-entrant and vertical directions 1 and 2, and the out-of-plane normal direction 3) using both experimental and numerical methods. The impact responses of the CMB sandwich structures under explosion impact were then numerically predicted. The experimental results demonstrate that the RVE exhibits superior damping performance in the 1 and 2 directions in comparison to the 3 direction. The results demonstrate that the displacement field of the CMB is sectioned into distinct zones by its skeleton during explosion impact, which is attributed to the differing properties of the aluminum foam and CFRP. Furthermore, a graded failure mode within the specified protection limit is observed, indicating that the incorporation of aluminum foam filler has the potential to improve the protective capability. These findings provide insights into the structural design of impact protection engineering.},

However, current methods face challenges such as high cost and limited sensitivity, thereby significantly hindering diagnostic efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a spectral sensing strategy by introducing terahertz biosensors for glioma subtype recognition and therapeutic efficacy monitoring. Our findings demonstrated that both the resonance frequency and amplitude of the transmission spectra varied as the cell increased. The two-dimensional fingerprint diagram could help us rapidly recognize cell subtypes. Additionally, we conducted a theoretical analysis of the sensing performance. We confirmed that the high Q -factor (∼27.8) results from toroidal dipole resonance and examined the impact of dielectric loss and the refractive index of the analyte on the resonance dip. Furthermore, we applied the biosensor in therapeutic drug screening and showed that as the concentration of tubastatin A increased, the resonance frequency shifted from 183.1 GHz to 76.2 GHz. This result indicates that the toroidal dipole constructed by the metasurface enables ultrasensitive light-matter interactions that amplify subtle cellular changes to the resonance spectrum. The proposed THz meta-biosensor demonstrates significant potential for rapid intraoperative recognition of glioma cell subtypes and therapeutic efficacy monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Constructing lunar bases is crucial as lunar missions progress towards utilization and exploitation. The challenging lunar environment, with its unique characteristics and limited resources, requires special materials, structures, and construction methods. Inflatable structures offer great potential for lunar construction due to their advantages in transportation, stowage, construction, and reliability. This paper proposes a rigidizable inflatable lunar habitat that maintains its shape even after air leakage, enhancing safety, durability, and fixability. The membrane material adapts to different requirements during transportation, construction, and service, achieved through solid-state actuation of shape memory polymer (SMP) for stiffness variation, allowing multiple moves and ground tests. This work comprises three parts: 1) system: design concept and construction processes, 2) material: design and characterization of restraint and rigidization materials, and 3) structure: numerical validation of structure properties. Finite element analysis, based on material models obtained through dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile tests, demonstrates the effectiveness of including an SMP rigidization layer in preventing collapse and enhancing dynamic properties. This paper not only proposes a new system, but also provides material design methods and requirements, along with structural validation techniques. Findings validate the feasibility of rigidizable inflatable lunar habitats, applicable in extreme environments, also in temporary buildings, space structures, and soft robotics.},

  abstract     = {Sulfur mustard (2,2′-dichloroethylsulfide; SM) is a bifunctional alkylating agent that can easily penetrate skin and cause persistent pain and damage. Effective biological dressings are required to treat wounds caused or poisoned by SM. Though the use of SM is regulated under the Chemical Weapons Convention, it is still a threat during wars and terrorist attacks. Herein, we present a photothermal-enhanced detoxification microneedles array (MNA) encapsulated with ZnIn 2 S 4 @UiO-66-NH 2 (ZnInS/UIO) catalysts for the treatment of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES, SM analog)-poisoned wounds under simulated sunlight (SSL) irradiation. Due to the excellent photothermal detoxification capability possessed by ZnInS/UIO, the conversion rate of CEES can be significantly increased under SSL exposure. When encased in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) MNA and piercing into the skin, ZnInS/UIO catalysts can be released quickly from MNA for detoxification. After applying the resultant ZnInS/UIO-MNA to the CEES-poisoned wound bed, acceleration of the wound healing process and a reduced inflammatory response can be confirmed. In conclusion, ZnInS/UIO-MNA has encouraging potential as a first-aid dressing for CEES-poisoned wound healing in battlefields and injuries related to acts of terrorism.},

The addition of Zn resulted in the formation of soft Fe–Zn IMCs in the IMC layer, which reduced the hardness of the IMC layer.

The chemical composition of the printed alloy resulted enriched in carbon compared to the feedstock powder due to the C pick-up during MAPS, leading to distinct microstructures and enhanced mechanical properties compared to those of laser beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) benchmark samples. In particular, the microstructural examinations of the MAPS samples show a coarser carbide network stable even after thermal treatment at high temperatures, while the tensile tests revealed that MAPS samples have a higher mechanical strength than the PBF-LB/M counterparts but possess lower ductility.

In this study, high-strength NiTiNb alloys without macroscopic defects were successfully prepared using mixed elemental powders based on the previous investigation. Higher sintering temperature and Nb addition brought about faster atomic diffusion, which strongly affected the densification, grain size, phase composition and Nb solid solution, and further determined the transformation temperature and mechanical properties. The transformation temperature decreased with increasing Nb solid solubility. A high thermal hysteresis of 72–75 °C was obtained by nano-Nb precipitation. The compressive strength reached 1662–2185 MPa. The recovery properties gradually decreased with the increase of large Nb particles in the matrix, which should be optimized in further studies. Overall, the addition of Nb drastically reduced the sintering temperature of elemental NiTi powders, which was conducive to suppressing the loss of liquid phase and promoting homogenization.

The maximum tensile yield strength and ultimate tensile strength are achieved to be 296 MPa and 374 MPa, respectively, within the studied concertation interval. Solid solution strengthening and grain refinement are demonstrated to dominate the increase of tensile yield strength upon Er content, where the latter becomes the primary strengthening mechanism at relatively high Er contents (&gt; 5 wt%). It is closely related to the consumption of Gd and Y in solid solution by the precipitation of Mg 24 RE 5 particles and alloying element segregation at grain boundary. The significant reduced grain size of dynamic recrystallized grains upon Er content is attributed to the promoted dynamic recrystallization via particle stimulation nucleation and the retardant grain growth emerging from the drag and pinning effect of alloying element segregation and nano-precipitates at grain boundary.},

  abstract     = {Novel concepts for efficient compact spectroscopy are extensively researched due to their fundamental applications in prominent fields such as chemistry, biology, and physics. Here, with an unprecedented spectral-azimuthal resolution, such a concept is introduced and exemplified in the mid-infrared, in which its advantages are paramount and have yet to be established industrially. The concept is based on the design and instrumentation of optical absorption spectral tuning (or sensitivity) to the relative azimuthal component of light impinging on specifically designed metamaterials (MMs). The inversely-designed MMs offer perfect photo-absorption inside λ 0 / 200 λ0/200 ultra-thin layer of lead telluride. Two small-footprint system designs are proposed to instrument the spectral-azimuth-angle tuning for spectrometry. The first is based on a single or few spinning MM layout elements, and the second, to avoid spinning, utilizes a fixed focal-plane-array approach. The latter exploits the inherent variations in the local azimuthal -incidence angle. While low absorption is the Achilles heel of conventional mid-infrared photodetector spectrometers, the optimized MMs, besides their unique spectral-azimuth-angle tuning functionality, provide giant absorption enhancement, facilitating higher resolution and even smaller in-plane form factor. The highlighted concept opens an additional dimension to encode-decode spectral information, yielding profound advantages over conventional designs, such as those based on diffraction gratings.},

  abstract     = {The maturity and patency of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) are essential for patients undergoing hemodialysis. Dysfunction of AVF due to neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) presents a significant clinical challenge. While balloon dilation therapy and open surgery can address this issue, they are associated with a higher likelihood of restenosis and reduced long-term durability. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a new method for inhibiting NIH to prolong the patency of AVF treatment. In this study, we developed a local vascular-encapsulated sustained-release drug delivery system containing degradable rapamycin nanofiber membrane patches (R-NFMs). During surgery, R-NFMs were wrapped around the anastomotic site of the AVF and the venous outflow tract. In vitro assessments demonstrated the consistent and stable release of rapamycin from the R-NFMs, confirming the material’s non-toxicity and its support of healthy cellular morphology. Animal studies further revealed that the experimental group showed significant reductions in neointimal and medial hyperplasia, as well as decreased expression of α-SMA, compared to controls. In conclusion, these findings suggest that R-NFMs are effective in inhibiting NIH and may serve as an innovative preventative approach to this pervasive issue.},

  abstract     = {The two deformation modes of meta-biomaterials during cyclic loading have been revealed: stochastic and deterministic strut failure processes. Biomimetic Voronoi structures with a range of strut thicknesses and number of cells per unit volume are printed. We show that when the strut thickness is 200 μm or above, the fatigue fracture process of the lattice is deterministic and the fatigue scatters are below 15%. As the strut is thinned to 150 μm, the local failures occur randomly within the structure, which may lead to a high fatigue scatter (&gt;30%). The two distinct behaviours result from the processing limit of the laser powder bed fusion technique. We demonstrate that the fatigue scatter and the location of the failure process within the lattice are related to the probability that a cluster of unconnected struts larger than a critical value can exist within the lattice. Unlike solid parts, porosity hardly triggers any damage in metallic lattices during cyclic deformation. The discovery of the Janus-like failure process opens up our understanding of meta-biomaterials and defines the pathway towards the design of mechanically durable intricate implants.},

  abstract     = {The effective containment of fission products (FPs) within tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles is crucial for the safety and efficiency of High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs). Combining multi-scale (µm to nm) and multi-dimensional (2D and 3D) analysis, this study focuses on the migration mechanisms of silver (Ag), for which the Ag-110 m FP isotope is radiotoxic, facilitated by reactions with palladium (Pd) alloys and the silicon carbide (SiC) layer at elevated temperatures (1300–1500 °C). Three primary pathways for Ag migration are identified: (1) diffusion in solid palladium silicide to form (Pd,Ag) 2 Si, (2) infiltration through cracks and pores in the carbon phase, and (3) liquid phase migration along SiC grain boundaries. Especially at temperatures above the melting point of Pd 2 Si (1404 °C), a ‘dissolution-recrystallisation’ mechanism is proposed of the Ag-Pd-Si liquid phase migrating along SiC grain boundaries. The study employs state-of-the-art in-situ heating transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques to directly observe the dynamic migration processes of Pd silicide within SiC, providing unprecedented insights into the liquid behaviour in TRISO fuel. These findings highlight the significant role of liquid phases in determining the transport of FPs through the TRISO-SiC which is vital for developing strategies that enhance the safety and efficacy of HTGRs.},

Traditional designs do not adequately consider the different shapes of the foot, which often leads to discomfort and aggravation of foot disorders. This study presents an innovative approach to running shoe midsole design using 3D-printed chiral negative poisson’s ratio (NPR) structures to enhance shock absorption and support, thereby optimizing biomechanical performance and comfort. Using computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE), the biomechanical effects of different midsole structures has been explored through finite element analysis (FEA). The study focuses on optimizing the cushioning, propulsion and stability of the midsole to mitigate the impact on the ankle and knee. Static compression and dynamic impact simulations were utilized to comprehensively select optimized design of midsole structure and the selected structures was 3D printed to validate the biomechanical benefits in a wear trial. The results of the study highlight the superior performance of chiral NPR structures in reducing forefoot stress during standing and movement and advance the design and functionality of 3D printed materials in running shoes.},

At present, the main treatment methods for sepsis-induced ALI are antibiotics and fluid resuscitation, but the efficacy of these methods is unsatisfactory enough; therefore, the development of new therapeutic methods is urgently needed. In this study, we developed a novel bionic nanoparticle (R@ZQC NPs) using ZIF-8 nanoparticles as a carrier, internally supported with ginsenoside Rb1, and externally coated with quaternated chitosan and a macrophage membrane layer by layer. The biomimetic nanoparticles controlled the release of Rb1, had good biocompatibility, strong antibacterial activity, and targeted the inhibition of pulmonary macrophage PANoptosis. In vitro and in vivo, R@ZQC NPs effectively inhibited the activity of Escherichia coli and reduced mitochondrial damage by activating the AMPK pathway, thus alleviating the inflammatory response and ameliorating sepsis-induced ALI. In summary, this study revealed the great potential of R@ZQC NPs for antimicrobial activity, targeted inhibition of macrophage PANoptosis and reduction of the inflammatory response and represents the first attempt of R@ZQC NPs in the treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.

These parameters act in unison, comprising the principal forces on the electrified jet: pushing the viscous polymer out of the nozzle and mechanically and electrostatically dragging it for deposition towards the collector. This article will reveal the correlation between the printing process parameters and the fiber morphology for curved printing fibers below the critical translation speed (CTS), and prepare controllable curved scaffolds by adjusting the electric field strength, which have fully interconnected pores and allow cells to migrate and proliferate. Furthermore, the study verified the advantages of these scaffolds through mechanical and in vitro culture experiments. The results showed that compared with the linearly printed scaffolds, the curved printed scaffolds exhibited better mechanical properties and enhanced cell attachment and proliferation.},

Tip-based electrochemical deposition, a quintessential ACS electrochemical additive manufacturing technique, offers promising prospects for achieving bottom-up fabrication of metallic micro/nano structures. However, the complex physicochemical reactions involved in electrodes lead to a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying atomic electrodeposition and structural evolution. For the first time, this study proposes electric double-layer controlled electrochemical kinetics and investigates the effect of direct current (DC) and pulse current (PC) on nickel atomic electrodeposition using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The findings reveal that compared to DC electrodeposition, PC electrodeposition results in more orderly deposition morphology, improved surface smoothness, reduced dislocation density, and lower crystal distortion, with these effects being particularly pronounced under low pulse duty ratio conditions. In addition, the pulse frequency significantly influences the morphology and structure of the deposit. The high pulse frequency yields smoother surfaces with local protrusions, while the low frequency favors the formation of orderly and dense structures excepting slightly increased roughness. This study provides critical insights into understanding the microscopic mechanisms of atomic-scale electrodeposition processes and achieving atomically controlled tip-based electrochemical additive manufacturing of micro/nanodevices.},

  abstract     = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and refractory autoimmune disease that primarily affects the synovium of diarthrodial joints. Inflammatory macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in the synovial microenvironment produce pathogenic mediators such as cytokines and proteases that perpetuate immune-mediated inflammation and contribute to the destruction of cartilage and bone. Polydatin (PD), a natural active compound, has demonstrated potential anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effects. However, drug development and delivery of PD is still a great challenge owing to its low solubility, short half-life, and high dose requirement. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we developed a novel nanodrug system named HA-M@PB@Ag@PD NPs. This system is composed of hybrid membrane (M), hyaluronic acid (HA), Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB NPs), PD, and chitosan-silver (Chi-Ag). In vitro experiments demonstrated that HA-M@PB@Ag@PD NPs effectively cleared ROS, promoted the repolarization of inflammatory macrophages, and induced apoptosis of RA-FLS. Using a rat model of RA, HA-M@PB@Ag@PD NPs markedly suppressed joint inflammation, inhibited synovial hyperplasia, and protected joints against destruction of cartilage and bone. Moreover, HA-M@PB@Ag@PD NPs significantly improved the synovial microenvironment of arthritic rats by reducing the number of RA-FLS and inflammatory macrophages, and facilitating the repolarization of inflammatory macrophages.},

Spectrophotometric studies showed UV absorption by peptides containing tyrosine and tryptophan in the UVB (up to 80%) and UVA (up to 40%) ranges. Cysteine, in turn, contributed to high antioxidant properties, confirmed by DPPH assay. The presence of peptides contributed to a nonwoven fabric characterized by the ability to absorb UV radiation and prevent the occurrence of oxidative stress (caused by the presence of free radicals). In turn, the increase in the surface zeta potential of the nonwoven after UV irradiation and higher thermal stability (demonstrated by DSC studies) indicated the crosslinking of the PVP layer under UVR, which further contributes to the increased protection of the nonwoven against its effects. In summary, obtained nonwoven exhibited functional similarity to the native cornea, providing a potential solution for enhancing corneal tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.},

Different from traditional FSSs or reported FSFs, aramid/carbon fiber woven fabric serve as the flexible substrate in which carbon fiber provides functionality instead of metallic materials, and patches made of carbon fiber prepreg are periodically applied for property reinforcement. Equivalent circuit model is used to guide the basic determination of patch’s geometry, and it is further optimized via full-wave simulation software HFSS. A simulation model that reasonably reflect the correlation between structure and frequency-selection characteristic is provided, and structural factors affecting the characteristic are analyzed and discussed. Further, an FSF sample is prepared and its frequency response is measured. Measurement revealed the FSF selectively shields EM waves in the frequency range of 8.9 GHz to 11.4 GHz, and is of the bandpass-bandstop-bandpass characteristic. Benefit from EM property and flexibility, the proposed FSF has advantages in applications pursue lightweight, high strength, and require excellent EM functionality, such as aerospace and structure-EM function integrated products.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns the laser wire directed energy deposition (LW-DED) additive manufacturing process. The objectives were two-fold: (1) process mapping – demarcating the process states as a function of the processing parameters; and (2) process monitoring – detecting process anomalies (instabilities) using data acquired from an in-situ meltpool imaging sensor. The LW-DED process enables high-throughput, near-net shape manufacturing. Without rigorous parameter control, however, LW-DED often introduces defects due to stochastic process drifts. To enhance scalability and reliability, it is essential to understand how LW-DED parameters affect processing regimes, and detect deleterious process drifts. In this work, single-track experiments were conducted over 128 combinations of laser power, scanning velocity, and linear mass density. Four process states were observed via high-speed imaging and delineated as stable, dripping, stubbing, and incomplete melting regimes. Physically intuitive meltpool features were used to train simple machine learning models for classifying the process state into one of the four regimes. The approach was benchmarked against computationally intense, black-box deep machine learning models that directly use as-received meltpool images. Using only six intuitive meltpool morphology and intensity signatures, the approach classified the LW-DED process state with statistical fidelity approaching 90 % (F1-score) compared to F1-score 87 % for deep learning models.},

  abstract     = {The influence of prior austenite grain (PAG) orientation on the deformation behavior of a low-carbon martensitic steel is investigated using crystal plasticity (CP) modeling with hierarchical representative volume elements (RVEs). The Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) relationship is refined for accurate PAG reconstruction in martensitic steel. A robust calibration strategy for CP parameters based on nanoindentation tests is developed by integrating analytical calculations with inverse methods. Virtual polycrystalline aggregates are subsequently generated by manipulating initial PAG orientations. The simulations reveal that assigning cube texture to PAGs enhances strain hardening of martensite under plane strain tension. Moreover, the RVEs with brass and copper orientated PAGs exhibit similar deformation behavior, and a more homogeneous strain distribution is realized in the RVE with PAG cube orientation. The influence of PAG orientation on stress and strain fields is correlated with lattice rotation behavior during deformation. Notably, different strain paths elicit distinct lattice rotation trajectories, wherein uniaxial tension and plane strain tension favor grains reorientation toward hard γ -fiber γ-fiber , whilst equi-biaxial tension drives the crystal matrix to concentrate on 〈 001 〉 〈001〉 and 〈 011 〉 〈011〉 directions. These findings provide insights into the intricate relationship between microstructural orientation and deformation behavior in martensitic steels, which is crucial for performance optimization.},

  abstract     = {Co-doped NiMnSn Heusler-type metamagnetic shape memory alloys (MMSMAs) are promising materials for the next-generation solid-state refrigeration systems due to their excellent magnetocaloric performance around the martensitic transformation, which is easily tuneable by slight changes in the alloy composition. An improvement in the thermal efficiency of active magnetic regenerator devices, a key element in magnetocaloric cooling systems, arises by obtaining powdered magnetocaloric alloys that meet technical requirements for their implementation as a feedstock material in the additive manufacturing of 3D-printed heat exchangers. In the present work, powders of Mn-rich NiCoMnSn Heusler-type MMSMAs were obtained from their ribbon form avoiding or minimizing residual stresses, the number of defects and disorder in the crystal lattice and microstructure. Since atomic order and crystallographic structure are crucial in the transformation and magnetic properties of these alloys, a complementary structural analysis of the powders after different heat treatments was performed by powder neutron diffraction. The results show that the cubic austenitic phase of the non-heat-treated melt-spun powder exhibits a highly stressed structure, which leads to an incomplete martensitic transformation and, therefore, to the coexistence of martensitic and austenitic phases at low temperatures. The magnetic structure of the austenite phase was also determined by neutron powder diffraction, obtaining a ferromagnetic coupling between 4a and 4b Wyckoff positions in the samples analysed. It was found that a heat treatment facilitates the martensitic transformation and enables the formation of a pure martensitic phase. The observed changes in the magnetocaloric performance of the powders have been understood in terms of the differently stressed structures and their impact on the martensitic transformation. A fully completed structural transformation leads to a significant increase of the magnetisation change across the martensitic transformation and, consequently, to high values of both a magnetic field induced isothermal entropy change and refrigeration capacity.},

The elemental composition of the coatings was systematically controlled over a wide range, so that the stoichiometry of both phases was the same in all coatings and only phase fractions varied. Experimental results obtained using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopies were complemented by thirteen ab-initio simulations for the same coating compositions. We found that the structure of the as-deposited Zr–Cu–N coatings undergoes a gradual transition from an amorphous to nanograined and finally to nanocolumnar structure. When ZrN fraction exceeds 20 mol.%, both phases exhibit the tendency for spontaneous segregation even without heating, forming a heterogenous dual-phase nanocomposite structure. At approximately 50 mol.% ZrN, the ZrN nanocrystals enveloped by a relatively thin amorphous ZrCu phase reach an optimum size (3–5 nm), resulting in a maximum enhancement of hardness by 38 % compared to the rule of mixture. For ZrN fractions &gt; 80 mol.%, hardness and plastic work fraction follow the trend proposed by the rule of mixture and the coatings with a lower hardness but a higher plasticity compared to the ZrN coating are prepared.},

  abstract     = {Bone microstructures or scaffolds mimicking natural bone characteristics find widespread applications in bone tissue engineering (BTE). To accurately replicate a personalized bone structure, we developed a heterogeneous scaffold by combining medical image data with the octree adaptive subdivision technique. The transformations between Hounsfield units (HU)-strength and strength-lattice features were implemented for mapping bone information to the scaffold. Initially, HU values from computed tomography (CT) images were smoothly converted into corresponding strengths through a rational Bezier curve. Then, these strengths were further translated into the features of lattice structures, specifically the strut diameter and subdivision level. The novel concept of adaptive octree subdivision, executed on the lattices, allows for controlling bone porosity and mechanical property even at local levels. As a result, a personalized heterogeneous scaffold accurately simulating natural bone structure was designed and manufactured for bone grafting application on a 3D-printed alveolar model. The scaffold has an outer cortical bone layer capable of withstanding pressures of up to 208.2 MPa, while the inner cancellous bone exhibits a high porosity ranging from 77.6 % to 93.6 %. The research provides an elegant yet effective approach to the generation of bone microstructures, opening up practical BTE applications.},

Here we report on a near fully dense 316L stainless steel via optimized laser processing parameters. The results reveal that the dynamic mechanical response exhibits much greater sensitivity to defects than the quasi-static one. The densest specimen (porosity &lt; 0.01 %, 260W-316L) exhibits superior spall strength of 3.87 GPa and negligible damage fraction of 0.03 % at peak stress of 4.8 GPa, which are 12 % higher and 92 % smaller than those of 0.18 % porosity specimen (300W-316L). For both horizontal and vertical impacts, hardly any anisotropy of spall strength is observed in 260W-316L, demonstrating the crucial role of the pore defects on the dynamical behavior. Moreover, dislocation slip dominated spallation mechanisms have been observed in the additively manufactured 316L specimens, accompanied by a small amount of deformation twinning and martensitic transitions. This comprehensive understanding of the defect-dependent spallation behavior and deformation mechanisms provides valuable insights for optimizing the dynamic mechanical properties of additively manufactured metals and alloys.},

Based on the Jeffery’s theory, a grain rotation model under uniaxial compression is created to predict the texture evolution mechanism during sintering of Si 3 N 4 ceramics. With deformation, the grain orientation was predicted to rotate towards the plane perpendicular to the pressure direction, and large strain was favorable for the formation of strong texture. According to guidance of the model, the weakly textured microstructure prepared by normal hot pressing is attributed to the limited strain, due to the constrains of graphite die. Therefore, a new PHIP (pseudo-hot isostatic pressing) process with the large deformation is guided to fabricate the strongly textured ceramics by promoting the grain rotation and dynamic grain growth. Generally, the experimental results are well accordance with the model prediction. Furthermore, this model could be applied to guide the design and fabrication of other isotropic and anisotropic ceramic materials.},

After quenching steel at 860 °C for 1 h, it was tempered at 600, 640, and 670 °C for 2 h. The results indicated that the low − temperature impact toughness initially increased and then decreased, while the yield strength consistently decreased with increasing temperature. At a tempering temperature of 640 °C, the steel exhibited a relatively high content of reversed austenite and demonstrated the best low − temperature toughness and plasticity. The low − temperature toughness and plasticity of the steel significantly diminished, when the temperature exceeded 640 °C. This is because the degree of alloying element enrichment in the reversed austenite is reduced, accompanied by an increase in dislocation density and the formation of twins. These reversed austenites exhibit a diminished ability to hinder crack nucleation and propagation. The yield strength decreased with increasing temperature, primarily due to the coarsening of the Cu particles, which reduces their precipitation strengthening effect.

This paper introduces a new multiscale approach—encompassing microstructures, mesostructures and macrostructures—for designing high-performance MAMs. At the microscopic–mesoscopic level, Pomb materials derived from pomegranate peel are combined with magnetic nanoparticles (Co 3 O 4 ) using a hydrothermal method.

The effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reached 5.5 GHz for a thickness of 2.3 mm. At the macroscopic level, a metastructure based on Pomb@Co 3 O 4 (0.1 g) was designed to achieve ultrabroadband absorption with an EAB of 15.56 GHz, a range of 2.24–18 GHz and a total thickness of 15 mm.

The nacre-based calcium orthophosphates composite (NCOC) exhibited a compression strength of 10 MPa, which is superior to human trabecular bone. In vitro bioactivity tests revealed the formation of apatite with nano-porous flake-like crystals on the composite surface that mimic HA structure of a human bone matrix.

In vivo studies using rabbit back fascia demonstrated that NCOC displays better bone healing and biocompatibility than conventional bone substitute apatite in critical bone defect models. The degradation of calcium carbonate crystal in vivo does not compromise structural integrity of NCOC.

  abstract     = {The treatment of breast cancer (BC) remains a significant challenge, exemplified by the limitations of chemotherapy due to its high side effects. Light-responsive drug delivery systems (DDS) offer a promising approach to spatially and temporally release drugs, minimizing chemotherapy side effects and enhancing efficacy. However, achieving precise delivery and site-specific drug release poses complex challenges. Here, We present a novel nano-system combining light-responsive photothermal therapy (PTT) with photothermal-responsive chemotherapy via π − π Stacking. Conjugated polymer nanoparticles (cRGD-PTer N25/CPT NPs) is designed for spatiotemporal targeted PTT/chemotherapy. Research shows that the strong near-infrared absorption of PTer N25 endows cRGD-PTer N25/CPT NPs with excellent photothermal capabilities(57.4 %) and near-infrared laser-triggered drug release performance. The cRGD-PTer N25/CPT NPs enhanced BC-specific cellular accumulation, prolonged blood circulation, exhibited good biocompatibility, and improved PTT and chemotherapy efficacy in BC cell lines and mouse models while reducing systemic toxicity. The photothermal effect triggered the on-demand release of camptothecin (CPT), producing therapeutic effects and downregulating heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70), reducing cancer cell thermoresistance, and enhancing combined treatment efficacy. Under spatial and temporal control, the tumor growth inhibition rate of the cRGD-PTer N25/CPT NPs group reached 93.6 %, nearly eradicating tumor presence, whereas the control group exhibited only partial inhibition. Minimal cardiotoxicity and metastatic side effects are not observed. This work presents a viable strategy for designing novel controlled-release drug systems to improve breast cancer treatment efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Bone defect repair and tumor recurrence are the main challenges in the postoperative treatment of bone tumors. The incorporation of zoledronate (ZOL) into scaffolds presents a promising approach, attributed to its osteogenic and anti-tumor properties. However, there are still some unfavorable factors that make it difficult to eradicate tumor cells at the surgical site, including drug rapid release, the insufficient anti-tumor efficacy of ZOL and the multidrug resistance of chemotherapy. Herein, a novel nano drug delivery platform mesoporous silicon-coated graphene oxide (GO/MSN) and ZOL loaded nanoparticle (GO/MSN-ZOL) were developed. Then PLLA/ GO/MSN-ZOL scaffold that integrates photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy was fabricated using poly (L-lactic acid) as raw materials by selective laser sintering (SLS) technology. The GO not only imparted scaffold with photothermal properties for localized tumor cell ablation but also significantly enhanced its anti-tumor efficacy through synergistic effects in combination with chemotherapy. The mesoporous structure and large specific surface area of MSN contribute to the sustained release of ZOL. Additionally, GO could promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which in combine with ZOL’s osteoclast inhibition, enhances the bone repair capacity. This study offers a straightforward and promising strategy for treating tumor-related bone defects.},

Four different designs with varying reentrant truss thicknesses of 0.8 mm (H1), 1.0 mm (H2), 1.2 mm (H3), and 1.5 mm (H4) have been modified to assemble seamlessly with the empty spaces within the SL structure. Quasistatic compression tests were conducted to evaluate the deformation modes and compression characteristics. The findings from quasistatic experiments were subsequently validated using numerical simulations. The H4 metamaterial exhibited superior structural properties, with 42 % increase in stiffness and 35 % enhancement in specific energy absorption compared to only SL structure. Additionally, dynamic sinusoidal compression tests were conducted to evaluate the dynamic elastic ratio (DER), hysteresis work and viscoelastic properties using the tan δ. The H4 metamaterial outperformed the SL in all dynamic properties, with a 50 % increase in elastic modulus and 36 % increase in hysteresis work. This study shows metamaterial properties can be tailored for specific requirements. SL structure facilitate elastic recovery, while H4 metamaterials offer superior energy absorption and stability, making it well-suited for protective equipment and impact-resistant components.},

  abstract     = {Providing a comprehensive assessment of the creep-fatigue life of critical structures in nuclear power facilities is important for structural integrity and performance requirements during service. The data-driven modeling method can set aside traditional mechanical theory and use experimental data to drive creep-fatigue performance modeling directly, avoiding complex parameter fitting. A sufficiently robust purely data-driven model must be supported by a large amount of training data, which means significant time and financial costs. To address these issues, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed in this work to predict the creep-fatigue life of Inconel 617 at high temperatures, where the physical constraints are introduced to enhance the physical fundamentals. The prediction results show that introduced physical constraints promote the stability of prediction performance and analysis based on the strength of physical constraints provides valuable guidance for creep-fatigue modeling to select the suitable architecture for building PINN. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method and dependency analysis are utilized to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of the properties and structure of PINN.},

A warpage simulation model was developed considering the viscoelastic properties and cure shrinkage behavior of the epoxy molding compound (EMC). A compression molding monitoring system was also developed to analyze the cure behavior of the EMC. The gelation point of the EMC during compression molding was determined using a dielectric sensor, while cure shrinkage behaviors were analyzed using a fiber Bragg grating sensor. Viscoelastic properties were characterized through stress relaxation tests, and thermal properties were measured using three-dimensional digital image correlation. The developed simulation model was used to optimize the PMC temperature profile using a genetic algorithm. Experimental validation showed that the optimized temperature profile reduced the warpage from ∼1519 μm to 486 μm compared to a linear profile. The findings of this study have broader implications for the design and manufacturing of semiconductor packages, as the proposed approach can be applied to minimize warpage and improve package reliability.},

However, both the macro geometry and relative density distribution of the infilled microstructure exert considerable influence on performances of lattice-infilled structure and the structural manufacturability needs to be considered. In this work, an optimization design methodology for self-supporting additive-manufactured lattice-infilled structures is proposed, in which the macro geometry and relative density distribution of the microstructure are concurrently optimized. Microstructure is infilled after topology optimization and octree structure is introduced into the boundary layers of the lattice core to support the top shell during fabrication. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization design method for self-supporting additive-manufactured lattice-infilled structures was proved by both three-point-bending test and full-scale finite element simulation. Compared with the uniformly-infilled sample, mass-specific stiffness and strength of the topologyoptimized sample were improved by 41.2% and 112.1%, respectively. The proposed design method for lattice-infilled structures provides potential for designing additive-manufactured high-performance lightweight structures, which will broaden the boundaries of lattice structure in engineering applications.},

In this paper, we introduce the asymmetric Klein tunneling method in phononic systems, which enables selective direction and control of elastic waves by inducing polarization through an external field in an artificial barrier. Using tight-binding theory, we systematically studied phononics in a super-honeycomb structure, demonstrating the anisotropic transition properties of excited state phonons through a matrix model involving the ground state’s s-type and the first excited state’s p-type wave functions. Additionally, we exploit the thermal sensitivity of epoxy to achieve localized thermal field-induced distortion of the bottom flat band, forming a tiled Dirac cone, and thereby creating a reconfigurable polarized artificial barrier in the elastic wave system. Elastic waves propagate in these systems with topological charge conservation. Combining this with the theoretical of excited-state phonons, we demonstrate asymmetric Klein tunneling with directional selectivity in the elastic wave carriers, and systematically investigate the performance of this tunneling. Furthermore, we design a four-port elastic waveguide based on the principle of asymmetric tunneling, which achieves exceptional directional selectivity of elastic wave signals by adjusting the polarization direction of barriers at the junctions. These studies not only extend the application of Klein tunneling in elastic wave systems but also open new research avenues for the study of elastic wave devices controlled by various external fields, showing direct application potential in elastic wave signal processing.},

These pores, representing default defects, are indispensable factors in the investigation of mechanical properties of propellants. This study investigated default defects effects on HEDM propellants, analyzing both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. Utilizing micro-CT imaging, the microstructure and default defects were characterized. Subsequently, using the cohesive zone model (CZM), microscopic damage evolution was depicted with the representative volume element (RVE) model, allowing in-depth analysis. Furthermore, a damage constitutive model, based on microscopic damage, was developed, with its softening function calibrated using microscopic damage evolution characteristics. Implemented into ABAQUS via user-defined material subroutine (UMAT), this model enabled the prediction of the mechanical response of HEDM propellants with different defects. The results demonstrate that the developed model accurately predicts the mechanical responses of HEDM propellants with different defects, showcasing the potential of macro-microscopic approaches in analyzing propellants with default defects.},

Furthermore, considerations of charge transfer were incorporated into the solid solution hardening (SSH) model, and the model was further modified. Through comparing plasticity evaluation indices, the parameter D D ( γ Surf / γ GSFE γSurf/γGSFE ) was determined to be suitable for predicting the plasticity of NbTiVZr alloys. A full compositional space model for yield strength and plasticity has been constructed based on the modified SSH model and the parameter D D , respectively. Ultimately, an alloy design system combining the full compositional space models for yield strength and plasticity was established, achieving good consistency with experimental results. And a non-equiatomic alloy with a yield strength exceeding that of equiatomic alloys by 32.2 % (1409 MPa), while maintaining 29.27 % compressive strain was discovered.

When initial delamination occurs in other joints such as butt, lap and scarf joints, final failure always occurs. In these cases, the external stress causing initial delamination σ c Initial σcInitial is equal to the final failure stress as σ c Final σcFinal = σ c Initial σcInitial . However, in step joints, the final failure stress σ c Final σcFinal can be greater than the initial delamination stress σ c Initial σcInitial &lt; σ c Final σcFinal . To clarify the adhesive improvement mechanism, first, this paper discusses the ISSF (Intensity of Singular Stress Fields) for fully bonded step joint by varying the number of steps N S NS . Second, the singular stress field causing 2nd debonding is discussed by analyzing partially delaminated step joint. The results show that 2nd debonding requires larger external load than the initial debonding as σ c Initial σcInitial &lt; σ c Final σcFinal . This is because under the same external load the singular stress causing the 2nd deboning is smaller than the one causing the initial debonding. When N S ≥ 6 NS≥6 and suitable overlap length, the final bond strength σ c Final σcFinal can be more than 3.6 ∼ 4.4 times larger than the initial delamination stress σ c Initial σcInitial ≪ σ c Final ≪σcFinal resulting in much larger bond strength.},

The model outcome was presented in the form of leakage water flow, which demonstrates the self-sealing capacity or the recovery of watertightness. While in the research area of cement-based material self-sealing, the expansive agent cannot be neglectable, for example the superabsorbent polymer (SAP). Especially for the building components exposed to free water, an efficient water flow blockage after cracking is crucial to ensure stable service. Hence in this study, the self-sealing process of a granular expansive agent inside the crack of cement-based material was simulated. The model outputs were compared with experimental results to verify the reliability. Additionally, the autogenous self-sealing model was incorporated into this model to simulate the “crystallization-expansion” synergetic self-sealing. The contribution of crystalline product and expanded EA to water flow blockage were compared during the crystallizing process. Overall, this model is of great use to evaluate the role of expansive agent on water flow blockage after the cement-based material cracking in hydraulic engineering or engineering components exposed to water.},

  abstract     = {Owing to of its freedom from energy inputs, radiative cooling is emerging as a frontier in renewable energy research. Recent advances in nanophotonic structures have enabled scalable passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC), such as porous polymer films, which can spontaneously reflect solar irradiance and emit heat to the ultra-cold outer space. However, there is still limited fundamental understanding of these nanophotonic structures underlying the cooling effects of these porous polymer-based PDRC films. Hence, we performed optical simulations validated by experiments to quantify how the spatial distribution of nanopores in the polymer film affect its PDRC performance. Our simulation results showed that the influence of spatial distribution of pores on the PDRC performance replies significantly on solar reflectance. A gradient distribution of pores with random pattern can remarkably enhance solar reflectance under direct sunlight up to 153.4 %, while maintaining a slight variation of thermal emittance &lt;4.4 %. With such optimized spatial distribution of pores in polymer, daytime radiative cooling power increased 39.4 W/m 2 under direct sunlight in comparison with the randomly distributed pores. These findings indicate that the spatial distribution of nanopores is critical both for demonstrating the cooling effect and for the rational design of nanophotonic structures in high-performance PDRC applications.},

  abstract     = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) has gradually become a dominant technology for the fabrication of complex-designed thermoplastic polymers that require a higher level of control over the morphological and mechanical properties. The polymer internal crystal structure formed during the AM process can present significant impacts on the mechanical properties of the individual filaments, as well as the whole structure. Currently, limited details are known about the crystal structure evolution during the material extrusion AM processes of polymers. A novel in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) experimental configuration was developed enabling us to capture the material evolution data throughout the extrusion AM process. The in situ time-resolved data was analysed to reveal nucleation and crystallization sequences during the continuous deposition, with the aid of both complimentary numerical simulations and post-process ( ex situ ) characterisations. The thermal simulations supported the prediction of the filament temperature profile over time and location during the AM process, while ex situ characterisations validated the correlation between polymer crystallinity (resulting from printing parameters) and corresponding mechanical properties. The results obtained from varied process parameters suggest that the processing temperature has a dominant influence on the crystal microstructure evolution compared to the deposition velocity. A lower processing temperature just above the melting temperature permitted favourable crystallization conditions. The overall analysis demonstrated prospects for enhancing polymer AM, to engineering mechanically hierarchical structures through correlative investigations.},

One the one hand, the multiphysics field distribution was established to clarify the chip formation of cutting characteristics and transient deformation process. The multiphysics field distribution of HFUVAC exhibited periodic changes due to tool intermittent movement, resulting in reduced cutting temperature and force. This intermittent movement also enhanced the sharpening shear effect due to instantaneous impact stress, transitioning from fragmented quasi-shear strain to continual multiple-shear strain during chip formation. One the other hand, the microstructural changes were examined to explain material removal mechanisms. The microstructure of CC demonstrated grain refinement and dislocation slip induced by friction and significant shear deformation. The microstructure of HFUVAC revealed the formations of dynamic recrystallization, twinning structures, and stacking faults, which were associated with enhanced plastic activity and limited slipping due to high-frequency impacts. The work reveals the response of the workpiece microstructure under the composite effects of high-frequency impacts and cutting process, which provides theoretical basis for the microstructure modification design through cutting technology.},

Tannic acid (TA) owns abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups, endowing various firm chemical bindings and excellent antioxidant property. To this end, we developed a time-dependent and antioxidant multifunctional coating via TA mediated LbL self-assembly. This layer exhibited higher ROS removal capacity and stronger binding ability. Furthermore, it showed rapid and excellent antibacterial ability of over 85 % against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at 24 h, which additionally promoted osteogenic differentiation in vitro in long term. Moreover, the coating exhibited outstanding antibacterial and bone regeneration performance in vivo as well.

  abstract     = {Airway stenosis, a significant cause of dyspnea, is commonly managed with airway stents. However, conventional stents frequently lead to restenosis. Excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells during abnormal repair processes is a key factor in airway restenosis. To address this challenge, a novel drug-loaded airway stent has been designed with personalized tailoring for the patient. This stent features a three-layered structure: an outer layer made from a blend of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and Poloxamer 407 (P407), a drug-loading intermediate layer, and an inner layer made of TPU. This design aims to minimize airway irritation and enable adjustable drug release rates by adjusting the drug carrier and/or the content of P407 in the stent’s outer layer. Drug release profile conforms to the Improved First-Order model. Notably, P407 is released from the stent, serving a dual purpose: it creates micropores to regulate the drug release rate and synergizes with PTX to inhibit the proliferation of fibroblasts. This combination significantly enhances the inhibitory effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, without adversely affecting airway epithelial cells. This may represent a novel approach to reducing restenosis by addressing a critical complication associated with the use of airway stents.},

The Ni 60 Nb 40- x (Y, Gd) x PSMGs with either Nb-Y or Nb-Gd atomic pair ( Δ H mix ΔHmix =+30 kJ/mol) showed hierarchically phase-separated microstructures at the nanoscale, which can be interpreted based on a metastable miscibility gap. Interestingly, statistical analysis of the initiation of plastic deformation via nanoindentation first pop-in analysis in these PSMGs reveals a unique trimodal distribution, unlike the bimodal distribution in monolithic MGs. This tendency arises from the formation of nanoscale phase boundaries as additional differentiated heterogeneous SB nucleation sites. The homogenously dispersed SB nucleation sites help hinder strain localization and SB propagation. In particular, a PSMG with a nanoscale interconnected structure exhibits homogeneous-like plastic deformation, where neither obvious pop-ins nor distinct surface shear steps are observed in the (nano-)indentation test. We believe this study&#39;s results provide an effective guideline for tuning correlative heterogeneity and related mechanical responses in PSMGs, highlighting the importance of tailoring microstructure even in MGs.},

The findings indicate that the zigzag stress–strain curves associated with instability plastic flow exhibit typical multifractal characteristics. Furthermore, the multifractal analysis quantifies the influence of strain rate and initial phase composition on the instability characteristics of the stress–strain curves. Specifically, it was observed that lower strain rates and austenite content correspond to a chaotic state, whereas higher strain rates and austenite content result in self-organizing critical dynamics. Finally, the underlying physical mechanisms driving these differing modes of behavior are discussed, with a focus on their relationship to strain rate and the initial austenitic phase fraction.},

Addressing this gap, this study explores grain refinement in Al-Cu alloys with a process-microstructure linking cellular automata-finite difference (CAFD) approach supported by single-track laser surface remelting (LSR) experiments. To enhance the understanding of nucleation behaviour in alloys under additive manufacturing solidification conditions, this research analyses the influence of nucleation parameters on the post-LSR microstructures. Additionally, this study explores the computational dimensions of microstructure modelling, testing CA mesh sensitivity effects and benchmarking our CAFD models on two high-performance computing platforms. The CAFD model captures well the key microstructural features observed in LSR Al-Cu alloys with and without grain refiner addition. It is shown that the maximum nucleation density has a significant effect on the final microstructure, resulting in different proportions of coarse columnar grains resulting from epitaxial solidification, newly nucleated thin columnar grains, and equiaxed grains.},

Supervised ML has been more frequently used than unsupervised ML, whereas some specific semi–supervised ML ( e.g. , reinforcement learning) or deep predictive control have been overlooked. Most ML applications have been successful on the laboratory scale and in the short term. Furthermore, the deployment of ML applications has been overlooked. In addition, retroactive feedback from the manufacturing of fiber and polymers to the manufacturing of composite laminates and structures was neglected. Accordingly, a control loop in the chain of manufacturing processes was discussed. Additionally, language processing tools and statistics were used to summarize and analyze the papers.

Novel hydroxyapatite (HAp) scaffolds sourced and fabricated through the biomorphic transformation of rattan wood (GreenBone-GB) were laser-drilled (LD) with parallel and lateral sub-millimetre channels, which enhanced the overall porosity for promoting the flow of cells and fluids throughout the scaffolds. The compositional analysis of the LD scaffolds confirmed the presence of the Ca 5 (PO 4 ) 3 OH and Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 phases, with no evidence of drilling contamination. Water jet laser drilling enhanced the interconnecting porosity of the morphogenic scaffolds by 22.5 %, without obstructing the intrinsic uniaxial fibrous structure inherited from rattan wood. Across eight varied drilled patterns, the resulting scaffolds preserved the structural integrity and exhibited compressive strength ranging from 6.74 ± 1.25 to 10.18 ± 0.43 MPa, while the Vickers Hardness was comparable with natural bone. Cell viability assessments confirmed that the LD scaffolds exhibited no toxicity and presented &gt;90 % cell viability. We demonstrate that laser drilling effectively enhanced the pore volume for improved osteoconductivity via cell migration in the bio-morphogenic GB-structure. Since the GB scaffolds are CE-marked products, laser drilling for pore surface engineering could provide improved scaffolds for clinical use.},

In physical conditions, LSEC demonstrates unique structures that can distinguish it from other endothelia in other organs. Capillarization of LSEC, a dysfunctional phenotype, is the essential event from fibrosis to cirrhosis and finally to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They further precede angiogenesis and vasoconstriction, facilitating the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Targeting abnormal ECs in HCC has demonstrated great potential in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Multiple approaches have been employed for EC normalization, including nanoparticles (NPs). Evidence has shown that NP-mediated drug systems can greatly normalize ECs and increase anti-tumor efficiency. This review discusses multiple NP platforms, focusing on their potential in HCC.

  abstract     = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is one of the most emerging techniques nowadays. Affordable, easy to use, economical, for a broad audience − from specialists to home users. These are only several of its advantages. A disadvantage is the limited number of available filament types, especially those with high performance. Therefore, the aim of the work was to investigate the properties of custom–made filament printouts based on polylactic (PLA), graphite (G) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ). This work looked at structural and thermal analysis, acoustic performance, EMI shielding, and electrical and thermal properties, including thermal conductivity and heat diffusivity. The following were considered during the study: type of printing architecture, infill density, and filament formulations. Among the best values, which were obtained for the highest loaded sample based on 15 wt% graphite and 2 wt% MoS 2 (G15/M2), where EMI shielding effectiveness surpassed SE TOT ∼ 17 dB (per 1 mm sample thickness), electrical conductivity remained at a low level. It exceeded σ ∼ 0.2 S/m; thermal conductivity was slightly over κ ∼ 0.4 W/mK, and heat diffusivity was almost α ∼ 0.4 mm 2 /s. This work is the first step in designing high-performance materials dedicated to advanced applications based on the FFF technique.},

  abstract     = {Mass reduction is a concern both in mechanical engineering and living organisms to reduce energy and materials consumption. Lately, transfer of knowledge from biology to engineering has become easier thanks to additive manufacturing. Trabecular bone for example optimally adapts to the mechanical stress it undergoes. Mass reduction methods bio-inspired from trabecular architecture, proposed in the literature, are not always applicable for laser-based powder-bed fusion. In particular, bio-inspired mass reduction methods based on a material removal principle generate porosities throughout a solid initial part which can result in enclosed porosities that trap un-melted powders. Here, we propose a 3D depowderable bio-inspired mass reduction method. Powder removal was controlled in different samples through weighing and X-ray computed microtomography and the impact of the design strategy that ensures correct powder removal on mechanical performance (stiffness) was quantified. Mean performance difference is 10.35 % (between 1.82 % and 26.47 %). For stiff and light parts loaded in bending, the proposed method outperforms parts made of bulk steel alloy by leveraging an architecture bio-inspired from trabecular bone.},

The normalized temperature was defined as the ratio of temperature and the melting point of the base materials. And the normalized bonding pressure was defined as the ratio of the applied bonding pressure and the yield strength at the bonding temperature. The contribution of the plastic deformation to the void closure expressed a linear relationship with the normalized bonding pressure, of which the slope was 3 3 . The relationship was appropriate in TiAl6V4, pure copper C11000, aluminium alloy AA6061, stainless steel SUS 304, and Ni-based alloy Inconel 617 using analysis calculation. The diffusion bonding pressure design range can be summarized as σ n = 0.05–0.577. Subsequently, the analytic computational model was verified by FEA. The results showed that the maximum stress was concentrated in the position of the void neck. And the linear relationship between the normalized bonding pressure and the bonded ratio was also tenable. There was a stable static error existed between FEA and the analytic computational analysis.

However, in-depth process parameter-microstructure-property correlations are lacking, especially regarding precipitation behavior. In this work, AFSD of Al-Mg-Si-Mn alloy with various process parameter combinations was performed to understand the variation (by ∼ 70 %) in the nano/microhardness, concerning the precipitation behavior. The low nano/microhardness sample exhibited dissolution of the β” strengthening phase. However, higher nano/microhardness samples showed varying microstructural features with high dislocation density owing to fine-scale pre-β” precipitation and another sample possessed inhomogeneous β” phase distribution and β’ precipitation at the grain boundaries, thus exhibiting reprecipitation during AFSD. The variation in the grain structure was such that the high nano/microhardness samples exhibited large, elongated grains (∼11 to 13 µm) and low recrystallization fractions (∼16 –18 %) suggesting a predominantly non-recrystallized microstructure. Conversely, the lowest nano/microhardness sample exhibited the smallest grain size (∼5 µm) and, a higher recrystallization fraction (∼42 %). These findings demonstrate extensive variation in the precipitation behavior, grain structure, and mechanical properties due to the process parameters. Future applications can leverage this knowledge to tailor the microstructure and mechanical properties based on the identified process parameter combinations.},

Converting wastewater into H 2 and other forms of energy attracted significant attention in terms of simultaneously and sustainably managing both the wastewater and the energy generation problems. Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MEC) evolved recently as promising options for converting wastewater into H 2 and electricity but with serious constraints on scalability. The current research aims to explore design and manufacturing solutions to build structurally strong and electrochemically effective electrodes that can also lead to scalable MEC. Two designs based on the interdigitated and spiral electrode architectures are proposed and evaluated. The added design freedom with additive manufacturing by selective laser melting of specific alloys of choice is effectively utilised in physically prototyping the interdigitated and spiral electrode forms designed with controlled porosity constraints. Microstructural, electrochemical, and cell performance characterisations led to the understanding that the spiral electrode configuration with polypyrrole-coated stainless steel 316L anode is a promising design option for both longitudinal and lateral scale-up of the MEC.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a hybrid process method based on Cryogenic Minimum Quantity Lubrication and Ultrasonic Rolling Strengthening Process (CMQL-URSP) to improve the surface integrity and enhance the mechanical properties of blade surface. First, the principle of the CMQL-URSP hybrid process was described. Second, the TEM experiments were conducted to clarify the influence of the CMQL-URSP hybrid process on aircraft engine blades. Finally, the blade processing experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CMQL-URSP hybrid process on the blade surface micro-morphology, micro-hardness and residual stress. The results indicate that the CMQL-URSP hybrid process effectively overcomes the limitations inherent to the solitary application of URSP. The CMQL process inhibits work hardening, thereby allowing the URSP to achieve better low-plastic surface improvement. Grain refinement governed by the continuous dynamic recrystallization mechanism leads to the formation of nanocrystals, which significantly improves mechanical properties of blade surface. The CMQL-URSP hybrid process results in a reduction in surface roughness from Ra 2.644 μm to Ra 0.055 μm, an increase in surface residual compressive stress from 321 MPa to 657 MPa, and the formation of a reinforced layer with a depth of 3.7 mm on the blade, thereby enhancing the surface integrity of the blade.},

Two types of friction coefficient models were established by considering whether the effects of temperature and friction pressure were independent. The S-(T&amp;P) L model, which considered the couple effect of temperature and friction pressure, was recommended as the best suitable model with its very high accuracy and best simplicity.

The results have been compared with cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and commercial reference material (CRM) substrates. The wetting of the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) ink on the ACNF substrate was found out to be excellent. The thickness of the printed pattern increased and the hole area fraction decreased with each consecutive layer of ink. The comparative investigations demonstrated that the electrical properties of the printed patterns were almost as good for 4 layers of ink on the ACNF substrate (1.6 Ω resistance) as the ones on the CRM substrate (1.2 Ω resistance). Additionally, the printed pattern on the ACNF substrate endured the adhesion and bending tests significantly better compared to the CRM substrate. Therefore, this study demonstrates that ACNF substrates could be a suitable candidate for printed electronics, which are more sustainable yet with similar functionalities in comparison with the conventional fossil based substrates.},

The results indicate that the content of crystalline wax with large carbon number is higher than the original distribution of wax in bitumen, as the temperature decreases the main composition of crystalline wax in AAM-1 will change from C20-C38 to C13-C19, and the even smaller components will begin to crystallize at 15 °C. As for AAC-1, the decrease in temperature will only affect the crystalline wax components of C16-C25, which could be due to the paraffinic distribution or aromatic content based on the PNA distribution. To determine the internal factors affecting wax crystallization, bitumen with different component compositions were designed, finding that wax will be easier to crystallize from bitumen with more large carbon number paraffinic. While the crystalline wax content is nearly the same at −20 °C, as the aromatic content increases, the decrease in WPT is close to linear. This suggests that the shape and crystal morphology of the wax crystals may have changed, based on the crystal growth and nucleation theory of wax, thereby inhibiting the crystallization of wax.},

However, the reasons for this benefit are not understood. Accordingly, the properties of RA most advantageous to resist fatigue are not known. Within this context, this paper examines the interaction between second-phase RA and short fatigue crack growth in a steel processed via quenching and partitioning, using quasi in situ electron backscatter diffraction experiments. Results show that most RA transforms into martensite under the plastic strain surrounding the crack. They also reveal various mechanisms whereby RA transformation delays short fatigue crack propagation; transformation-induced crack closure (TICC), crack deflection and branching, and roughness-induced crack closure (RICC). Crack deflection and branching are driven by a tendency of cracks to propagate towards transformed RA, which is against the previous assumptions in the literature. Furthermore, the impact of crack deflection/branching on retardation is more powerful than that of TICC acting alone. Microstructures including second-phase RA should avoid RA-lean areas and promote elongated RA grains, with relatively large size, and major axis normal to the preferential crack growth direction. Untransformed RA within the plastic zone (i.e. overstabilized) does not contribute to crack retardation.},

  abstract     = {Directed Energy Deposition (DED) has recently been hybridised with in-situ rolling, providing elevated temperature deformations and enhancing build quality. Analysing the thermo-mechanical aspects of deformations with sufficient fidelity can not be achieved experimentally. So, a fully coupled thermo-mechanical model for a multi-layer case using the finite element method has been developed to capture the thermal and mechanical facets of the deposition and rolling processes. Modelling features a hybrid active and quiet element activation strategy that mitigates convergence issues from activating a newly deposited layer over previously rolled ones. The model&#39;s predictions have been validated with reasonable accuracy against temperature history and rolling load measurements in an experimental case study using IN718. These predictions provide insights into the in-situ rolling effects with their quantification, including the impact on the thermal and stress-strain fields and histories. For instance, the temperature at the rolling location and the local temperature drop increase with the number of layers. The thermal stress induced by deposition overshadows the influence of in-situ rolling. The rolling deformation penetrates till the third preceding layer, and deposition leads to above the recrystallisation temperature reheating till the fourth layer. These predictions can be used for parametric optimisation with metallurgical criteria.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the strength-ductility conflict in particle reinforced aluminum matrix composites (PRAMCs), a novel dual configuration strategy of microstructure was proposed in this work. The dual configuration including both heterogeneous grain structure and hybrid reinforcements was obtained by powder metallurgy, which was designed as submicron-sized SiC particles (SiCsm)/Al and micron-sized SiC particles (SiCm)/2024Al components. Representative alternating coarse grain (CG) bands containing SiCm and ultra fine grain (UFG) bands with dispersed SiCsm were revealed in microstructural characterizations. Compared to corresponding homogeneous composites with the same fraction particles, the dual configuration composite achieved simultaneous enhancement in strength and ductility and remained a comparable Young’s modulus of 98GPa, which represented 442 MPa in yield strength, 590 MPa in ultimate strength and 8.7 % in fracture elongation. The extra strength provided by hetero-deformation induced (HDI) strengthening is a potential dominant strengthening mechanism. The intrinsic toughening mechanisms primarily contribute to HDI strain hardening and enhanced dislocation accumulation capacity, while the extrinsic toughening mechanisms presumably attribute to more uniform microcrack distribution and blunting effect of CG zones on cracks. Our work provides a feasible route including ball milling and powder assembly to preparate high-modulus aluminum matrix composites for strength-ductility balance design.},

  abstract     = {Defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) parts often result from the meso-scale dynamics of the molten alloy near the laser, known as the melt pool. Experimental in-situ monitoring of the three-dimensional melt pool physical fields is challenging, due to the short length and time scales involved in the process. Multi-physics simulation methods can describe the three-dimensional dynamics of the melt pool, but are computationally expensive at the mesh refinement required for accurate predictions of complex effects. Therefore, we develop a generative deep learning model based on the probabilistic diffusion framework to map low-fidelity simulation information to the high-fidelity counterpart. By doing so, we bypass the computational expense of conducting multiple high-fidelity simulations for analysis by upscaling lightweight coarse mesh simulations. We demonstrate the preservation of key metrics of the melting process between the ground truth simulation data and the diffusion model output, such as the temperature field, the melt pool dimensions and the variability of the keyhole vapor cavity. We predict the melt pool depth within 3 μm based on low-fidelity input data 4× coarser than the high-fidelity simulations, reducing analysis time by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Strontium ions can be removed from wastewater in fixed-bed reactors by adsorption on hierarchical materials (different pore sizes and phases). A detailed understanding of the materials multiscale structure is therefore crucial to optimize their sorption properties. This article presents a multi-technique approach developed to characterize the relationship between microstructure and adsorption in a range of Linde-type A (LTA) zeolite-geopolymer composites,. Two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy and 3D X-ray tomography were used to image the porous and solid phases at different length scales. Advanced numerical methods involving machine learning were applied to segment the images and provide quantitative morphological values describing the porous network geometry and the location and accessibility of the zeolite particles in the geopolymer. These results were then correlated with the materials sorption properties, measured in batch and column processes. Increasing the materials zeolite content (from 0 to 27 wt%) slowed down their adsorption kinetics but increased their maximal adsorption capacities from 20 to 49 mg.g −1 and Sr 2+ -selectivity at equilibrium. In breakthrough experiments, the material with highest zeolite content had a much higher breakthrough volume passing from 169 to 478 ml in the presented experimental conditions (much higher wastewater decontamination capacity), but a shallower breakthrough curve (lower column efficiency).},

Prolonged contact with moisture and fecal matter has been identified as a primary factor contributing to diaper dermatitis. The embossing patterns on the diaper’s next-to-skin surface can reduce the contact area and decrease the risk of dermatitis. Current surface embossing designs of baby diapers have limitations in addressing issues related to prolonged usage, lack of support under body pressure, and insufficient reduction of skin contact with the surface layer. This paper reports on the development of a novel moisture-adaptive embossed surface layer through the embedment of a moisture absorbing hydrogel [viz. acrylic acid-co-sodium acrylate (AA-co-SA)] in the embossing structure. The incorporation of tailored AA-co-SA hydrogel dots within the diapers’ inner surface layer resulted in superior thermal and moisture comfort in comparison with existing commercial products. The designed embossments proved effective in reducing the contact area and maintaining an air gap between the skin and the diaper under heavy compression.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the application of textile reinforced mortar (TRM) as an overlay has become an important method for repairing and strengthening old masonry structures. However, the quantitative analysis and design of TRM-strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beams are still limited. To address this gap, a nonlinear finite element (FE) model is proposed in this study to simulate the flexural behavior of TRM-strengthened RC beams. The developed model is validated using experimental results and subsequently utilized for the design of TRM-strengthened RC beams. Various TRM design parameters, including the number of textile layers, textile longitudinal length, and textile mesh size, are parametrically investigated. The modelling results reveal that increasing the number of textile layers and longitudinal length while decreasing the textile mesh size can enhance the bending strength of TRM-strengthened RC beams. Furthermore, an analytical model is proposed to predict the flexural strength of TRM-strengthened RC beams, facilitating rapid strength estimation of TRM-strengthened RC beams. The predicted results demonstrate good agreement with the numerical simulation results. The established FE models can predict the bending performance of TRM-strengthened RC beams under different reinforcement conditions, and the simulation outcomes can provide valuable guidance for their design.},

A series of heat maps spanning the full compositional domain were generated to visually present the impact of alloy constituents on the alloy properties. Our findings identified a balanced (Mo,W) + Re blend as a promising composition for high temperature applications, attributed to a strong and stable (Mo,W) matrix with high Re content and the formation of strengthening (W,Re) precipitates that enhanced mechanical performance at 1600 o C. Several Mo-Re-W compositions were manufactured to experimentally validate the computational predictions.

  abstract     = {Friction stir processing (FSP) effectively improves the fatigue strength of arc-welded joints; however, wear of tools is inevitable in case of high-strength materials. Notably, a new benefit has been discovered: compressive residual stress is applied on the FSPed steel surface, alloyed with the WC tool constituent elements, contrasting with the tensile residual stress typically applied via conventional FSP. To elucidate the mechanism of compressive residual stress application, FSP was performed on a low-carbon steel plate at various rotational speeds. The alloyed topmost layers in the stir zone comprised martensite structures with a small amount of retained austenite grains, resulting in a hardness increase owing to the tool constituent elements. The residual stresses on the stir zone surface were influenced by the alloying contents and the corresponding martensite start temperature (Ms). Compressive residual stresses were maximized at an Ms of approximately 150 °C owing to martensitic transformation expansion near room temperature. Lowering the Ms below approximately 150 °C led to tensile residual stresses and an increased volume fraction of the retained austenite, suggesting that martensitic transformation expansion is insufficient to apply compressive residual stress. Conversely, the retained austenite can resist plastic deformation and crack propagation through deformation-induced martensitic transformation, thereby enhancing fatigue properties.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials with a zero Poisson’s ratio offer significant advantages in robotic actuation and space exploration due to their precise control of deformation. However, existing machine learning techniques cannot be directly used to accelerate the design of such materials due to the scarcity of this property. We propose a few-shot learning-based framework to generate non-periodic metamaterials with zero Poisson’s ratio. Our framework incorporates an out-of-distribution (OOD) target-oriented sampler into a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). Unlike other metamaterial generative models that only deal with continuous pixel data, our approach can handle discrete unit cell patterns by computing their probability distributions. We found that controlling the learning focus during the training process can effectively mitigate the scarcity of acceptable data within the training set. This mitigation is achieved by repeatedly selecting target samples through the OOD target-oriented sampler. Incorporating active learning into the training process can further enhance model efficiency by adaptively adjusting the ratio between acceptable and unacceptable samples. The impacts of training data size, effective data composition, and the number of iterations in active learning on design efficiency are discussed in detail. Compared to random trial-and-error generation, our model demonstrates a substantial increase in the acceptable rate, from 0.3 % to 39 %.},

To assess the impact of reusing iterations on the properties of the feedstock and printed part, we employed thermodynamic simulation to study oxidation in the building chamber. We then compared the 5 times reused powder of austenitic steel 316L (SS316L) and the printed part with its virgin counterpart. Our findings revealed that minor residual oxygen in the building atmosphere reacts with the molten pool and hot spatters, leading to the formation of Rhodonite (MnSiO 3 ) inclusions. As sieving cannot remove oxides smaller than steel particles, the repetition of feeding the used powder into the printing process directly increases the fraction of oxides in the printed parts. The increase in inoculated oxygen by reusing, coupled with the dissolution of oxides into the molten pool, facilitates the formation of Spinel (MnCr 2 O 4 ) and Tridymite (SiO 2 ) oxides, as well as clustered inclusions. While small oxides anchor cellular structures, stress concentration on the coarse fragile inclusions leads to sudden rupture and weaker tensile strength of the printed part with reused SS316L powder.},

Gold nanoclusters modified with lipoic acid (AuNCs) exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in a murine burn healing model. However, the impact of the AuNCs on dermal cell proliferation and granulation tissue formation remains unclear. We therefore examined their effects on dermal cell proliferation, the cell cycle, and the signaling pathways involved. AuNCs were combined with a silk fibroin scaffold and tested in a mouse burn model and human dermal fibroblasts in vitro . Combined with the silk fibroin scaffold, 50 nmol/L of AuNCs activated fibroblast differentiation, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, increasing granulation-tissue formation, reducing tissue necrosis and systemic inflammatory response, and improving wound healing in the model. The AuNCs increased PI3K/Akt signaling pathway phosphorylation in human dermal fibroblasts, upregulating protein expression of cyclin A, B, and CDK1, which participate in the G2/M cell cycle phase, ultimately promoting fibroblast proliferation. These findings support the beneficial effects of AuNCs on burn wound healing. We suggested that AuNCs on a silk fibroin scaffold or other vector is a potential clinical strategy for burn wound treatment.},

  abstract     = {The primary objective of this study is the development of Cu/Nb composite materials for Superconducting Radio-Frequency (SRF) applications under extreme service conditions characterized by a strong RF electromagnetic field, extremely low temperatures, and relatively low heat loss. A novel integrated manufacturing approach is proposed, which combines cold-sprayed AgCuTi alloy as an intermediate coating on the Nb surface and an electroplated Cu layer with a subsequent heat treatment brazing effect. This strategy aims to address the significant challenge of non-intermelting Cu and Nb while also considering effective lateral heat transfer. Mechanical property tests showed that the bond strength of Nb/AgCuTi/Cu composites exceeded 150 MPa. Low-temperature thermal transport tests indicate that the Residual Resistance Ratio (RRR) of the Cu layer surpasses 150, with a thermal conductivity at 4.2 K exceeding 1600 W/(m·K). Moreover, both the composite interface and mechanical properties of the specimens remain stable even after undergoing cyclic cold shock experiments. These findings suggest that the Nb/AgCuTi/Cu composite material developed in this study meets the technical requirements for long-term stable and high-performance operation in high-current and high-power superconducting accelerators.},

  abstract     = {Food safety is a critical public health priority, as food chemicals such as formalin, saccharin, sucralose, and sodium benzoate present a significant health threat. A flexible substrate based on Zn-Ca-Co ferrite is proposed as a solution to food safety concerns, addressing limitations found in conventional microwave sensors. This study explores the possibilities of Zn 0.5-x Ca 0.1 Co 0.4+x Fe 2 O 4 (x ranging from 0 to 0.30) nanoparticles synthesized by sol–gel as a flexible substrate, and a modified labyrinth-shape metamaterial structure reveals μ-negative characteristics from 7.084 to 7.48 GHz. The dielectric constant varied with composition, generating values of 1.34 to 1.84 for x values of 0.0 to 0.3. The sensor’s performance is assessed at various concentrations for each analyte, showing a clear link between chemical concentration and sensor response. The resonant frequency shift decreased as the analyte concentration increased, with formalin shifting from 110 MHz at 5 % to 40 MHz at 20 % and saccharin from 470 MHz at 25 % to 210 MHz at 33 % with notable sensitivity, ranging from 0.56 % to 7.01 %. The perceptible novelty of this study is that it introduces Zn-Ca-Co ferrite nanoparticles with enhanced magnetic and dielectric properties, designed for microwave sensing, and integrated into a flexible, μ-negative metamaterial for food safety applications.},

  abstract     = {Part identification has become a priority in manufacturing, especially when it comes to the additive manufacturing (AM) industry, where the counterfeit printing of almost any digitalized component is possible. As a means of avoiding forgery, the development of non-detectable labels, or digital passports is necessary. In the present work, a novel methodology for printing subcutaneous coding on aeronautical parts is proposed thanks to the multimaterial capabilities of the laser based directed energy deposition (DED-LB). The coding is based on embedding a dot pattern of a high-density alloy on a small area of a lower density component, which once covered and finished generates a pattern only visible by X-ray imagining. The viability of the proposed methodology is proven by embedding WC particles on a Ti6Al4V substrate. Firstly, the most relevant process parameters are optimized to ensure a sharp and a readable code, and their geometry is analysed by means of industrial Computed Tomography (CT). Also, the metallurgical quality and chemical composition of the generated dots is evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Finally, a demonstrator part is fabricated with a hidden code. The code readability and the mechanical properties are tested to ensure the feasibility of the developed methodology.},

Different from the conventional HMSIW with ground holes, the grounding operation of the presented via-free HMSIW is conducted by edge grounding to bottom layer. Thus, more space can be provided for SSPPs structure. Besides, the new proposed SSPPs unit contains two shorted-end slots and one open-end slot, which not only provides abundant freedom on adjustment of desirable fundamental mode, but also the controllable of high-order modes for wide stopband. The upper cutoff frequency can be controlled by the heights of the slots of SSPPs unit and the lower cutoff frequency can be adjusted by the height of via-free HMSIW unit. Finally, a compact BPF with measured operating band of 3.01–3.81 GHz and wide stopband reaches 15.2 GHz is designed. Multiple transmission zeros generated at two sides of the passband enable the filter has high selectivity. The measured results agree well with the simulations, validating the proposed structure and design method.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior ductility, microstructure, and strength simultaneously in tailor-welded blanks remains challenging. To address this, pre-aging blanks before friction stir welding was proposed. Systematic studies were conducted on the microstructure, ductility, and post-aging strength of pre-aged 2219 aluminium alloy after friction stir welding. Uniaxial tensile tests evaluated the ductility of tailor-welded blanks at room and cryogenic temperatures, along with their mechanical properties after artificial aging. Microstructural characterization and Vickers hardness measurements elucidated the strengthening mechanisms between the welded region and base material. No abnormal grain growth was observed in the welded region post pre-aging welding; instead, a finer grain structure prevailed. Ductility of the tailor-welded blanks initially increased and then decreased with increasing rotational speed. Excellent elongations, 27.8% at room temperature and 32.4% at cryogenic temperatures, were obtained at a rotational speed of 1300 rpm, reaching 91.5% of the base material. This attributed to the finer grain boundary strengthening in the welded regions. After artificial aging, a joint efficiency of 93.5% was achieved, owing to effective compensation of the reduction in precipitation strengthening caused by the welded heat input through finer grain strengthening. This approach represents a novel method for preparing ultrawide blanks for forming integral large-sized aluminum alloy components.},

Fiber laser systems produce parts exhibiting superior detail, finer cell size, and lower porosity compared to CO 2 laser ones because of the stability of the laser beam and the higher absorptivity of the laser light by the material powder. Electrochemical tests indicated that lattices exhibited inferior corrosion resistance compared to solid counterparts for both manufacturing techniques. This disparity is caused by the distinct corrosion mechanisms exhibited by lattices and solid parts, as observed through Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The observed differences are attributed not only to the increased different specific surface areas but also to the distinctive morphologies formed in the material beneath the surface. CO 2 LPBF lattices demonstrated higher corrosion sensitivity than the fiber LPBF lattices due to their distinct microstructure and the more prevalent presence of defects.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the microstructural degradation during rolling contact fatigue (RCF) in a martensitic dual-hardening bearing steel. The dual-hardening steel makes use of both carbide precipitation and intermetallic precipitation hardening. The microstructural degradation leading to fatigue failure is studied using electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The initial microstructure of the steel consists of tempered martensite with a fine dispersion of secondary M 7 C 3 , and NiAl precipitates. During RCF testing at 2.2 GPa contact pressure, ferrite microbands develop and the partial dissolution of NiAl and M 7 C 3 precipitates occur within the ferrite microbands. For the RCF testing at higher contact pressure of 2.8 GPa, nanosized ferrite grains develop in the ferrite microbands. The SXRD analysis reveals a decrease in dislocation density in the sub-surface region experiencing microstructural degradation. This is believed to be associated with the rearrangement of dislocations into low energy configuration cells. We conclude this manuscript by proposing a microstructure decay mechanism for martensitic dual-hardening bearing steel that provides insights in the fatigue initiation process.},

This study discovers a cooperative strain-hardening strategy in a newly designed high-entropy steel (HES) with a density of 6.82 g/cm 3 . In this lightweight HES, the duplex microstructure of compositionally complex austenite and D0 3 intermetallic compounds facilitates the interplay between geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and deformation twins (DTs) during plastic deformation. It generates a strain-hardening resilience during deformation and yields a very high dislocation density of 6.62 × 10 15 m- 2 , contributing to strain hardening of over 900 MPa and a large elongation of 47 %. The resilient strain hardening achieved by the GND-DT cooperative strategy can be applied to various heterostructured alloys, offering a pathway for strong and ductile lightweight materials.},

However, achieving high-quality parts with desired properties heavily depends on variances in the manufacturing process and powder composition, making quality control an indispensable aspect of almost all applications. Today, mainly grayscale imaging, photodiodes, or pyrometry are employed, whereas in-situ recording of chemical (compositional) information has rarely been done during PBF-LB/M. This pilot study uses Nd-Fe-B as a compositional sensitive model material to explore the feasibility of in-situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES) for elemental analysis of metallic samples during PBF-LB/M, validated by ex-situ analysis. Our results show that the Boltzmann-corrected local emissivity of the Fe and Nd lines in the plume is a reliable indicator for determining the temperature and elemental material concentration voxel-wise, which could enable a digital 3-D reconstruction of the material composition of a printed part in the future.},

This paper investigates the manufacturability and performance of unique Ti6Al4V heterogeneous glass sponge (GS) LSs fabricated via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Compared with the commonly used LSs, including Cross, body-centered cubic (BCC), Diamond and octet-truss (OCT), Ti6Al4V GS LSs exhibit the strongest compressive strength and energy absorption ability of 58 MPa and 23.84 J/cm 3 , respectively. Finite element (FE) models are established to evaluate the macroscopic deformation, microscopic stress and strain evolution in the solid struts of five different LSs. Local plastic stresses are found to generate near the nodes of Cross, BCC, Diamond and OCT LSs, thus forming plastic hinges, while the GS LSs can evenly transfer local plastic stresses to the grid-like rods of each layer, eventually showing a uniform stress distribution. Moreover, all the LSs are featured with satisfactory biocompatibility concerning cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and cell attachment. The results indicate that the Ti6Al4V GS LSs can address the conflict between lightness and strength simultaneously, thus achieving excellent energy absorption performance, compressive properties and great biocompatibility, endowing it with tremendous application potential in the field of medical implants.},

The mechanisms of hardness and microstructure evolution during aging and creep were studied through hardness test, SEM/EBSD and TEM/EDS. By comparing the difference between aging and creep, the coupling effect of temperature and stress in P91 steel was elucidated. Results show that creep stress could accelerate the entire degradation process in P91 steel. Firstly, the dislocation density increased rapidly at the beginning of creep, and then decreased also at a high rate after reaching its peak value. On the other hand, the dislocation density decreased slowly in aging condition. Additionally, with the migration of grain boundaries under creep stress, some intergranular M 23 C 6 entered inside grains and afterwards dissolved into matrix. On the other hand, other M 23 C 6 which remained intergranular continuously ripened and congregated with time, and finally turned into large ones at triple junctions of grain boundaries. Furthermore, stress had the greatest impact on dislocation density, whereas temperature affected volume fraction of M 23 C 6 the most. In creep condition, the degradation of mechanical properties of P91 steel was mainly caused by the reduction of dislocation strengthening which was followed by grain boundary strengthening.},

  abstract     = {Plasma disruptions in a commercial-scale tokamak will impose high magnitude, short-duration thermal loads on its plasma-facing first wall. Despite a plethora of mitigation measures, these severe, off-normal events are likely to briefly expose the structural materials of the first wall to significant temperature excursions. Eurofer 97, the reference structural material for the plasma-facing first wall of the EU DEMO tokamak, is a reduced activation 9Cr steel with a normalised and tempered ferritic/martensitic microstructure. Repeated exposure to the thermal effects of disruptions over the operating lifetime of a reactor may promote a cumulative evolution of Eurofer 97′s microstructure, affecting key material properties crucial to first wall performance. This novel transient thermal degradation mechanism has been explored via a laser-based transient heating experiment, supported by time-dependent finite element thermal analysis studies of DEMO’s water-cooled lithium–lead first wall during a mitigated plasma disruption. Transient-affected samples of Eurofer 97 were characterised via scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques (SEM/TEM), including electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and selective area electron diffraction (SAED). Microhardness and magnetisation testing data are also presented. A single 700 °C thermal transient was found sufficient to coarsen and partially recrystallise Eurofer 97′s tempered martensite sub-grains at the tungsten-Eurofer 97 interface. Further transient exposure at 700 °C resulted in the significant growth of equiaxed grains, the nucleation of intergranular Cr-rich M 7 C 3 and M 23 C 6 carbides, and the coarsening of V-rich and intra-granular Ta-rich MX precipitates. The microstructural effects of 850 °C transients are also reported. Notably, after 1,000 transients at 850 °C the hardness of Eurofer 97 was found to have decreased by 32 %.},

  abstract     = {The influence of temperature on the deformation behaviour of the C 15 CaAl 2 Laves phase, a key constituent for enhancing the mechanical properties of Mg alloys up to service temperatures of 200 °C, remains largely unexplored. This study presents, for the first time, the nanoscale brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) of this intermetallic phase through in situ testing including nanoindentation and micropillar splitting conducted at elevated temperatures. By correlating observations from these techniques, changes in deformation of CaAl 2 were identified in relation to temperature. High-temperature nanoindentation quantitatively determined the BDT temperature range, and revealed that CaAl 2 undergoes a BDT at ∼0.55 T m , exhibiting an intermediate region of microplasticity. A noticeable decrease in nanoindentation hardness was observed at ∼450–500 °C, while indentation cracking was not observed above 300 °C. Results from high-temperature micropillar splitting revealed cracking and brittle pillar splitting up to 300 °C, with an increase in apparent fracture toughness from 0.9 ± 0.1 MPa·√m to 2.8 ± 0.3 MPa·√m, and subsequent crack-free plastic deformation from 400 °C. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the deformed material from nanoindentation revealed that the BDT of CaAl 2 may be attributed to enhanced dislocation plasticity with increasing temperature.},

  abstract     = {Planar flow casting (PFC) has been applied to prepare Fe-6.5wt. %Si ultra-thin ribbons with a strong 〈0 0 1〉 fiber texture. However, critical issues such as fine grain size and large surface roughness are vital to overcome. In this study, low strain cold-rolling and subsequent annealing are applied to planar flow casting Fe-6.5 %Si ribbons. Cold-rolling reduces surface roughness and introduces heterogeneous deformation in the ribbons. Recrystallization occurs preferentially in high deformed areas during annealing. Recrystallizing grains grow significantly by consuming neighboring deformed grains with fine size and 〈0 0 1〉 orientation, leading to greatly reduced iron loss. Thus, the ribbon annealed at 1000 ℃ exhibits the best combination of magnetic properties with B 8 of 1.29 T and P 2/5000 of 6.95 W/kg. The kinetics of recrystallization and grain growth are described along with the calculations of activation energies, which suggests the cold-rolled ribbon has a faster growth rate than the undeformed one. Two mechanisms, namely strain-induced boundary migration (SIBM) and thermo-induced boundary migration (TIBM), are used to explain the grain growth. SIBM is dominant at low temperatures while TIBM is dominant at high temperatures. This work presents a strategy to tailor the microstructures and properties of PFC-prepared alloys with fine grain.},

  abstract     = {The addition of aluminum (Al) powder to CL-20 significantly enhances the overall energy of mixed explosives. Nonetheless, the metal acceleration ability of explosion after Al addition shows unpredictable behavior due to the unclear reaction characteristics of Al in CL-20 detonation products. This study utilizes a plate push test employing CL-20-based aluminized explosives to acquire the reaction degree formulation for Al powder with varying particle sizes in a CL-20 detonation environment. Moreover, it elucidates the reaction mechanism of microsized Al particles during the initial phase of afterburning. Additionally, this reaction formulation enhances the equation of state (EOS) for CL-20-based aluminized explosives. Subsequently, the new EOS is implemented in LS-DYNA to simulate the metal flyer acceleration process. Consequently, the impact of Al particle size on the metal acceleration capability of aluminized CL-20 is examined. The results indicate that for CL-20-based aluminized explosives with 15 % Al content, an optimal Al particle size of 34.12 μm exists when the particle size exceeds 10 μm. This optimum increases the speed of the driving metal plate by 7.4 % compared to CL-20/LiF explosives.},

Biomaterials can be used to repair maxillofacial defects. However, traditional biomaterials lack biocompatibility and cannot accurately match the shape of damaged tissues, leading to tissue immune rejection and chronic inflammation, thereby limiting their repair ability. Biomaterials can improve mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) survival by simulating the extracellular matrix (ECM). MSCs have excellent self-regenerative abilities and can differentiate into almost all cell types, making them valuable for tissue engineering. This review summarizes biomaterial-based, stem cell, and cell-free therapies and discusses their properties, advantages, disadvantages, and application mechanisms, with a particular focus on their use in oral and maxillofacial tissue defect repair and regeneration and the limitations of the current materials and strategies.

  abstract     = {In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, this study introduces a biomimetic “bomb” approach to target HCC by utilizing macrophages (MAs) as ultrasound-responsive carriers. This advanced biomimetic drug delivery system (MAs-DOX/PFP/Ms, MAs-DPM) encapsulates doxorubicin (DOX) and perfluoropentane (PFP) and is designed to precisely target HCC. MAs-DPM exhibits excellent drug loading capacity and biocompatibility, can effectively release DOX and enhance ultrasound imaging capabilities under ultrasound irradiation (UI). Experiments confirmed that MA maintained its biological activity and vitality during co-incubation and phagocytosis with DOX-loaded DPM, and microscopy confirmed that MA effectively engulfed DPM without changing cell morphology or function. Transwell experiments demonstrated that this bionic “bomb” (MAs-DPMs) not only retained the tumor targeting ability of macrophages, but also successfully delivered therapeutic drugs to tumor cells. Compared with samples without UI treatment, UI significantly increased the release of DOX from MAs-DPM, enhanced the drug release rate and inhibited the growth of HCC cells. Live/Dead staining experiments further intuitively revealed the precise “biobomb” effect of MAs-DPM under UI, effectively proving its ability to inhibit HCC cell proliferation. In vivo studies demonstrated that MAs-DPM was able to proficiently localize tumor sites within 24 h. Furthermore, the ultrasound-mediated phase transition of PFP enhanced the imaging efficacy, confirming the feasibility of macrophage-mimicking biological bombs for real-time in vivo ultrasound tracking. In the tumor-bearing nude mouse model, UI-treated MAs-DPMs remarkably delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival time compared with other groups. Subsequent histological and serum index evaluation further confirmed the in vivo safety of MAs-DPMs, and UI-treatment did not induce significant histological or pathological changes or statistical differences in vital organ or serum markers. These experiment results highlight the great potential of MAs-DPM as a strategic approach for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.},

The most satisfactory model is further updated based on the actual relative density of fabricated cellular materials. The LCF assessment exploits a volume-based strain energy density (SED) criterion, calibrated after comparing static properties of strut-based and bulk materials.

The influence of different dislocation configurations obtained at different deformation temperatures on critical SRX temperature was analyzed. The high-density entangled dislocations were observed to gradually transition into low-angle grain boundaries at heat treatment temperature within the γ-channel, potentially serving as the primary driving force for the SRX of AlloyX. Compared with the lower γ′-fraction SX DD32, it is further determined that the preferential dissolution of the small-sized γ′ in the interdendritic region (IDR) caused by high Al is the important factor that induces the recrystallization to occur preferentially in the IDR of AlloyX rather than the dendrite region (DR).},

The deformation stage of the proposed model comprises two sub-models: grain boundary (GB) migration and GB diffusion. The void nucleation/growth stage is composed of three consecutive calculations: void nucleation, void growth, and postprocessing. The process simulated in the void nucleation/growth stage is driven by relative GB velocity of the respective GBFs and diffusional fluxes between adjacent GBFs, which are provided from the deformation stage. The void nucleation rate is quantified using the relative GB velocity, and the initial void size is determined based on the stability condition for void existence derived from Helmholtz free energy. The void growth rate is evaluated by the atomic diffusion on the GBF and the surface of each void.},

This study explores a kind of self-toughening method of HfB 2 ceramic by incorporation the highly crystalized multi-branched HfB 2 microrods. The multi-branched HfB 2 microrods were synthesized by sol–gel process and carbothermal reduction, exhibiting length of 6–13 μm and diameter of 0.60–1.50 μm, respectively. Detailed analysis of the formation mechanism of HfB 2 microrods reveals that the HfB 2 multi-branched structure is a collaborative consequence of orientation attachment mechanism and reactive templates growth, in which process monoclinic HfO 2 crystals transform into crystalized HfO 2 microrods at ∼1000 °C, and worked as template to induce one-dimensional HfB 2 microrods. Furthermore, spark plasma sintering experiments show that the optimal mechanical properties were attained by 6 wt% addition of HfB 2 microrods, comparing with HfB 2 ceramics free of self-toughening agent, the hardness and fracture toughness of self-toughened HfB 2 ceramic improved by 8.82 % and 81.91 % respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-toughening of the microrods without sacrificing the hardness of HfB 2 ceramic.

  abstract     = {Cubic transition-metal carbides are high-melting compounds with remarkable high-temperature mechanical properties but are generally considered to be brittle at low-temperatures. Here, we report on the activation of multiple slip systems and plasticity in 001, 110, and 111 oriented vanadium carbide (VC) single-crystals subjected to uniaxial compression at room-temperature. Using in situ scanning electron microscopy based mechanical testing, we observe plastic strains up to 21%, size-dependent yielding, and work hardening in VC(0 0 1) and VC(1 1 1). In comparison, VC(1 1 0) crystals are relatively brittle with limited localized plasticity. VC(1 1 1) crystals exhibit the highest yield strengths of up to ∼23 GPa while VC(0 0 1) crystals are some of the softest with yield strengths as low as ∼13 GPa. For loading along [1 1 0], we find that only the primary slip system, {1 1 1} 〈 1 1 ¯ 0 〉 〈11¯0〉 , is active. In VC(0 0 1) and VC(1 1 1), we find the operation of two sets of slip systems, [{1 1 0} 〈 1 1 ¯ 0 〉 〈11¯0〉 and {1 1 1} 〈 1 1 ¯ 0 〉 〈11¯0〉 ] and [{1 1 1} 〈 1 1 ¯ 0 〉 〈11¯0〉 and {1 0 0} 〈 1 1 ¯ 0 〉 〈11¯0〉 ], respectively. Intriguingly, the estimated critical resolved shear stresses for all the three slip systems are nearly the same. Our results, which reveal orientation-dependent differences in the activity of the same slip system, provide new insights into plastic deformation in refractory compounds.},

  abstract     = {Martensitic transformation temperatures are the most important indicators for designing shape memory alloy (SMA) components. Subjected to alternating temperatures in service, they undergo functional fatigue, which affects little the thermal hysteresis. We investigate the thermal cycling induced functional fatigue in Ti 44 Ni 47 Nb 9 wide hysteresis SMA, decorated with multi-scale Nb-rich particles. We identify an accelerated functional fatigue behavior leading to the hysteresis widening from 58 to 71 K after 20 thermal cycles, in contrast to which hysteresis maintains nearly constant in Ti-Ni binary SMAs. Compared to Ti 49 Ni 51 with similar transformation temperatures and latent heats, the hysteresis widening in Ti 44 Ni 47 Nb 9 is attributed to accelerated decrease in starting temperature of martensite transformation ( M s ). Microscopic characterizations reveal an inhomogeneous microstructure, consisting of (Ti,Nb)Ni B2 matrix and multi-scale Nb-rich particles and (Ti,Nb) 2 Ni particles. The presence of unique multi-scale Nb-rich particles has been demonstrated at the core of the underlying mechanisms of accelerated functional fatigue. Densely distributed Nb-rich nanoparticles narrow the mean matrix distance of transformation to 156.3 nm, which restricts the size and cross-over of the transformation induced dislocation leaves. Our work provides a new mechanism to widen the thermal hysteresis of SMAs, which is probably applicable to the other SMAs systems with dense nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {A major concern about parts produced by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) are intrinsic defects or porosities that are difficult to overcome by simply optimizing the process parameters. As these defects and porosities play a crucial role in the mechanical behaviour, especially in fatigue, additive manufactured parts are often subjected to thermo-mechanical post-treatments. To this end, this work proves Friction Stir Processing (FSP) to be an effective post-treatment to drastically reduce the porosity level. FSP leads to an improvement of 60 % of the technical fatigue strength and by two orders of magnitude of the fatigue life of L-PBF Scalmalloy® specimens. The fatigue performances obtained on FSPed and heat-treated specimens are equivalent or even better than the best fatigue life reported in the literature, whatever their L-PBF conditions and post-treatments, while avoiding Hot Isostatic Pressing. However, FSP reduces the beneficial effect of the conventional strengthening heat-treatment applied to L-PBF Scalmalloy®, lowering the high tensile strength for which the alloy is normally reputed. Advanced characterisation by X-ray microtomography and Transmission Electron Microscopy allows us to reach a better understanding of the involved phenomena: drastic reduction of the biggest defects and heterogeneous nucleation of Sc- and Zr-rich precipitates on grain boundaries and dislocations.},

The TiNbCrMoV coating exhibited the best corrosion resistance, followed by TiNbZrCrV and CrNbZrMoV coatings, and finally TiCrZrMoV and TiNbZrMoCr coatings. The excellent corrosion resistance of TiNbCrMoV coating was mainly attributed to the presence of grain boundaries which provided the diffusion channels of atoms, thus forming a protective oxide layer.

  abstract     = {Calcium leaching involves the removal of calcium ions from the pore solution and hydration products, leading to a decrease in pH, coarsening of pore structure, and, in severe cases, loss of cohesion, shrinkage, and cracking. Recalcification is a restoration process aiming at repairing degraded C-S-H structures by externally supplying calcium ions. However, our understanding of recalcification mechanism, its potential to reverse calcium leaching, and its effects on deteriorated cementitious matrices remains limited. This study aims at enhancing the understanding of the impact of recalcification on calcium leached cement pastes. Our findings demonstrate that calcium leaching can be partially reversed by immersion in a saturated calcium hydroxide solution. Recalcification functions by introducing calcium ions to the degraded matrix, triggering a reaction with the degraded C-S-H. This process reverses silicate polymerization, increases the Ca/Si ratio in the degraded zone’s, and densifies the pore structure. After only 14 days of recalcification, the degraded portion experienced a 50 % reduction in porosity, an increase in pH. By day 28, recalcification halved the permeability of the treated sample and completely consumed all silica gel. Additionally, our findings reveal that higher temperatures adversely affect the structure of C-S-H, hindering the beneficial structural modifications facilitated by recalcification.},

Such novel structural properties include bending-sense-independent snap-through with energy dissipation, and the decoupling of initial bending stiffness from peak moment. By leveraging an FEA-generated dataset of mechanical performance metrics, we employed a data-driven design approach from literature involving the use of a quadratic regression machine learning model to predict the mechanical behavior of various hierarchical tape springs. The machine learning model was then used as an objective function in a genetic algorithm that searched for hierarchical tape spring designs with user-specified combinations of peak moment and bending stiffness. Designs discovered with the genetic algorithm were validated with FEA, the results of which revealed that the decoupling of bending stiffness and peak moment was made possible by moving transverse veins along the length of hierarchical tape springs with longitudinal veins. If the transverse veins were close to the center line, the tape generally had a higher peak moment, if there were multiple transverse veins near the center line, the hierarchical tape would have a lower bending stiffness with a comparable peak moment. Finally, to prove that the hierarchical tape springs could be fabricated and tested, three designs were chosen and fabricated with a custom vacuum forming rig and tested via four-point bending. Experimental trends were similar to those observed from finite element results.},

  abstract     = {Although superelastic NiTi shape memory alloy wire displays very high resistance to plastic deformation in austenite and martensite phases, incremental plastic strains are recorded whenever the cubic to monoclinic martensitic transformation (MT) proceeds under external stress leading to functional fatigue degradation. Therefore, special closed-loop thermomechanical loading tests were performed to shed light on the mechanism by which the incremental plastic strain are generated. These tests revealed that both forward and reverse MTs occurring above certain stress thresholds generate plastic strains specific for the [temperature, stress] conditions under which the MTs occurred. While the forward MT upon cooling does not produce plastic strain or permanent lattice defects up to 500 MPa stress, the reverse MT upon heating starts to generate them from 100 MPa. While plastic strain generated by the forward MT merely elongates the wire, plastic strain generated by the reverse MT also reduces the recoverable strain. Since the reverse MT upon heating generates plastic strains at lower external stresses than the forward MT upon cooling, it is largely responsible for cyclic instability of NiTi actuators. The characteristic thresholds and magnitudes of plastic strains generated by the forward and reverse MTs define the functional fatigue limits for specific NiTi wires.},

Both isotropic and anisotropic thermal deformations can be realized and diverse reconfigurations are possible under thermo-mechanical loads for sandwich panels utilizing these meta -sheets as skins.

This work utilizes 3D FIB-SEM nanotomography to reconstruct the microstructure of this material under various process conditions. The analysis reveals that, even with an Ag volume fraction as low as 47.3%, Ag particles form a robust 3D network. Geometric tortuosity quantifies the effect of different sintering conditions on the Ag particle network in all spatial directions. Effective thermal conductivity is simulated based on realistic microstructure models. Results show a significant negative correlation between tortuosity and effective thermal conductivity. Increasing sintering temperature in Model B notably reduces tortuosity and enhances effective thermal conductivity. Sensitivity analysis underscores the dominant role of Ag volume fraction in regulating effective thermal conductivity. Finally, transient thermal impedance measurement of this material as a thin die-attach layer in actual high-power devices demonstrated its application potential.

In this work, a novel interfacial projection strategy was proposed to improve the dispersion of TiB 2 particles in Al-Si composites through high-throughput first-principles calculations with the experimental verification. Firstly, the Al(1 1 1)/TiB 2 (0001) interface model was constructed. Then, the pre-substitution of Si at 2 at. % concentration was employed to simulate the solutionized Al matrix. Secondly, alloying behaviors of 55 elements (10 substitution sites per element) in the Si-Al(1 1 1)/TiB 2 (0001) interface were studied by high-throughput first-principles calculations in terms of the relative interface formation energy and the relative work of adhesion. With these values, a theoretical alloying map for evaluating the dispersion ability of these alloying elements was plotted. Accordingly, the copper mold experiments were conducted to validate the theoretical alloying map. Based on the electron analysis, the enhanced interface bonds by alloying primarily attributed to electron accumulations around Si atom, indicating that the pre-substitution Si atom was vital for a reliable simulation result. Generally, this interfacial projection strategy provides a precise and potent approach in designing high-performance Al matrix composites, and should be applicable to other reinforced particles.},

Using a DED process replicator and in situ synchrotron radiography, together with analogous experiments in an industrial DED machine, we investigate the impact of carrier gas and shield gas flow rates on build quality. The results reveal that there is a critical shield gas flow rate above which melt pools are flattened, tracks widen, and thus layer thickness decreases. The reduction in layer thickness is most prominent in conditions with low carrier gas flow rate, as the highly turbulent shield gas flow may divert slow moving powder particles away from the melt pool, decreasing capture efficiency. Very high flow rates increase internal porosity, as fast-moving particles impacting the melt pool surface can entrain chamber gas behind them. High gas flow rates also cool the melt pool, creating shallower melt pools with increased thermal gradients near the solidification front, increasing pore entrapment in the solidified track.},

The effects of the process parameters on the performance of the wires were studied. The experimental results showed that good metallurgical interfaces can be prepared because of the synergistic strengthening effects between the solid–liquid composite and rapid solidification. The interfacial diffusion zone composed of FeAl 3 and Fe 2 Al 5 increased the bonding strength of the wires by 13 % compared with that of wires prepared by using the rolling process. The equiaxed fine crystal tissue morphology of the cladding aluminum and twin crystal organization resulted in good mechanical properties. Compared with LB35 and LB40, the conductivity and tensile strength were increased by 14 % and 22 %, respectively.},

  abstract     = {To date, the aging softening of Mg-Li-Zn based alloys has been a critical issue limiting their industrial application. Here, we design a new Mg-Li alloy that exhibits exceptional mechanical stability after solution treatment and then water quenching by means of a hitherto unrecognized mechanism. The results indicate that precipitation of a semi-coherent MgLi 2 (ZnAg) phase leads to rapid age-hardening of the Mg-Li alloy after water quenching, as evidenced by the Ag atoms in the precipitate. A massive solid solution of Ag atoms in the β-Li phase strengthens the stability of the alloy and retards the diffusion of Li atoms from the β phase into the α matrix during aging. Zn atoms in the MgLi 2 Zn precipitate are replaced by Ag atoms which explain the origin of age-hardening and inhibit the evolution of the substable strengthened phase MgLi 2 Zn to the equilibrium softened phase MgLiZn. This research may contribute to the theoretical basis for solving the age-softening problem of Mg-Li alloys.},

Recent studies have identified local delivery of parathyroid hormone relative peptides (PTHrPs) as a novel pathway for bone repair as well, but how to load and locally release PTHrPs for good bone repair is a major obstacle. Here, a biopolymer of PLGA-PLL loaded with PTHrP1 is electrospunned into nanofiber membranes for guided bone regeneration. In vitro experiments show that PLGA-PLL synergized with PTHrP1 significantly promote osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis, providing a favorable bone regeneration microenvironment. In vivo experiments show that the membrane recruits endogenous stem cells and promotes their ectopic osteogenic differentiation in an osteoporotic environment. Furthermore, the membrane can promote osteogenic differentiation and angiogenesis in situ and improve the local osteoporotic microenvironment, ultimately promoting the repair of bone defects. Therefore, present study provides a promising strategy for local delivery of PTH, which opens a new pathway for the treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.},

  abstract     = {Mesangial cell (MC)-mediated immune inflammatory injury is a basic pathological process in glomerulonephritis. However, due to the limited drug accumulation and serious adverse effects, it remains challenging to explore a rational delivery system integrating high efficiency and low toxicity to deliver anti-inflammatory drugs to the glomerular MC region. Salvianolic acid B (SAB)-loaded hybrid membrane biomimetic nanovesicles (SAB@HMVs) were developed by fusing erythrocyte membrane nanovesicles with mesenchymal stem cells biomimetic membrane nanovesicles. SAB@HMVs had a spheroidal structure, low cytotoxicity, particle size of 143.83 ± 1.33 nm and exhibited a high drug loading capacity (7.02 %±0.30 %) along with a good sustained release function. The in vitro anti-inflammatory results revealed that HMVs were effectively taken up by MCs and showed significant anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies revealed that SAB@HMVs could deliver SAB to kidney tissue and elicit an effective anti-inflammatory response to improve the pathological changes in the glomerular mesangial region, significantly reducing the levels of cytokines and alleviating kidney inflammation. Especially, noteworthy was the observation that SAB@HMVs augmented the renal delivery of SAB, downregulated the gene expression of p38 MAPK and NF-κB, inhibited the levels of MMP9 and TNF-α proteins as well as elevated the level of iκB protein, indicating that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SAB@HMVs should be based on regulating MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. We provided a novel strategy to increase nanovesicles accumulation in MCs with the potential to exert anti-inflammatory regulatory effects in glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, this biomimetic hybrid membrane loaded with pure drugs may offer a functional platform to address multiple clinical needs.},

While collagen-based implants hold potential for skin rejuvenation, their clinical application is limited by the poor durability of non-crosslinked implants and the negative impacts of crosslinking agents, such as cytotoxicity and calcification. Herein, we report a highly durable and biocompatible bionic collagen implant for superior skin rejuvenation with advanced anti-calcification characteristics and enhanced collagen regeneration. Utilizing biomimetic self-assembly and covalent crosslinking approach, we successfully created long-lasting and biomimetic collagen implants with densely-packed collagen fibers. Crosslinking of collagen fibers with a low concentration of N-hydroxysuccinimide activated suberic acid (NHS-SA) was highly efficient, resulting in complete crosslinking and thicker collagen fiber formation with a uniform network structure. Compared with glutaraldehyde-crosslinked collagen fibers, NHS-SA-crosslinked assembled collagen fibers (NACF) demonstrated considerably improved thermal stability and durability. Furthermore, the NACF implant exhibited superior biocompatibility, establishing NHS-SA crosslinked collagen fibers as a safer and more bioactive choice for implant applications. In mouse subcutaneous implant models, the NACF implant outperformed other collagen implants, demonstrating exceptional biocompatibility, effective collagen regeneration, and excellent anti-calcification potential. The NACF implant shows immense promise in collagen regeneration, offering considerable potential to advance skin rejuvenation therapies.},

In the as-built condition the bainitic microstructure consists of a refined α-phase within a matrix of β-phase. The intermetallic phase, Ti 2 Cu, forms predominantly on the interface of the α- and β-phase and within the β matrix. The high strength of these materials is attributed to the refined α-phase and Ti 2 Cu particles as well as significant solid solution hardening.

The results show that Y has a positive effect on the shift of the eutectic point and promotes it moving to the low Si side. Adding 0.1 at.% Y refines the Nbss phase from 38.7 to 11.2 μm. Y 2 O 3 forms due to the strong affinity of Y to O. The edge-to-edge model predicted that there was no phase relationship between Y 2 O 3 and Nbss and primary γ-(Nb,X) 5 Si 3 , which was verified by TEM. Y refines the Nbss and the Nbss/γ-(Nb,X) 5 Si 3 cluster with compositional supercooling. As Y content increased, the fracture toughness at room temperature increased and decreased. When the Y content was 0.1 %, the K Q value reached 17.2 MPa·m 1/2 . The internal oxygen consumption of Y and the refinement of Nbss lead to the toughness improvement of the Nbss phase, promoting the formation of a large number of dimples. Microcracks form in the fine γ-(Nb,X) 5 Si 3 of eutectoid cluster, which hinder the primary crack growth and enhance the ambient fracture toughness. These findings are of great significance for the further development of high-performance Nb-Si-based matrix composites.},

Test data indicate that once the critical shear rate threshold for the fluid is reached, the STF-filled structure can effectively smooth the peak acceleration by 50%, decrease the penetration depth and significantly enhance the energy absorption capability by a remarkable 85%. The proposed hybrid composite paves the way to novel functional applications, exploiting the adaptive behavior of non-Newtonian fillers.

High-throughput solidification calculations were conducted using the CALPHAD method, evaluating 11,235 alloys in the Cr-Co-Ni-Al-Ti system under specific boundary conditions. The acquired information was used to filter the alloys, focusing on alloys exhibiting an FCC+L1 2 phase field at 750 °C, a solidification interval narrower than 100 °C, and a solvus temperature under 1100 °C. The filtered alloys were analyzed to estimate their solid solution and precipitation hardening contributions to yield strength, with antiphase boundary energy (APB) assessed using two models. Three alloys were selected for testing the proposed strategy, including one with the highest yield stress and others for comparison. These alloys were produced, processed, and characterized using DSC, synchrotron XRD, SEM, and TEM. The results showed that the desired microstructure was achieved, with the alloys consisting of an FCC matrix and a high-volume fraction of L1 2 precipitates. Tensile tests at room temperature, 650 °C, 750 °C, and 850 °C demonstrated that the proposed model predicts well the yield strength trends, demonstrating the potential of the proposed approach for accelerating the discovery and development of novel HEAs with tailored properties.},

After infiltration, the resulting multi-directional freeze-casting ceramic/polymer composite (MFCC) has isotropic and satisfactory mechanical properties. Meanwhile, it remains lightweight and performs the highest specific strength (66.7 kN m/kg) and specific energy absorption (19.2 kJ/kg) among tested materials. The vertical-aligned structural regions are responsible for the robust strength, and horizontal-aligned regions prompt energy absorption capacity. Radial-aligned regions induce slant crack propagation and alignment shift between two regions leads to crack deflection, further enhancing energy absorption capacity. Additionally, the MFCC samples with different sizes or pore sizes, demonstrate isotropic thermal conductivity due to the multi-directional alignment of ceramic walls, which provide efficient thermal pathways across different directions. The MFCC and its structural design are promising for enhancing material performance, especially in applications where isotropic mechanical properties and thermal conductivity are important.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing techniques, such as laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB), are well known for their exceptional freedom in part design. However, these techniques are also characterized by the development of large thermal gradients during production and thus residual stress (RS) formation in produced parts. In this context, neutron diffraction enables the non-destructive characterization of the bulk RS distribution. By control of the thermal gradients in the powder-bed plane by scan strategy variation we study the impact of in-process scan strategy variations on the microstructure and the three-dimensional distribution of RS. Microstructural analysis by means of electron backscatter diffraction reveals sharp microstructure transitions at the interfaces ranging from 100-200 µm. The components of the RS tensor are determined by means of neutron diffraction and the principal stress directions and magnitudes are determined by eigenvalue decomposition. We find that the distribution of RS in the powder-bed plane corresponds to the underlying scan strategy. When the alternating scan vectors align with the x- and y sample coordinate axes, the principal stress directions co-align. In the present geometry, nearly transverse isotropic stress states develop when the scan vectors are either aligned 45° between x and y or continuously rotated by 67° between each layer.},

In vitro , GelMA microspheres were physically evaluated and assessed for their biological effects on TDSCs, including adhesion, proliferation, and ability to differentiate into tendons, and were also analyzed by sequencing at the RNA level and validated for relevant signaling pathways. A rat Achilles tendon microinjury model was used to evaluate the effect of GelMA microspheres combined with TDSCs on tendon repair. GelMA microspheres promoted adhesion, proliferation, and early tendinous differentiation of TDSCs. TDSCs were able to secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix and activate RAS/ERK signaling in the GelMA microenvironment. In vivo , injection of TDSCs-loaded GelMA microspheres promoted repair of Achilles tendon microinjury. GelMA microspheres and TDSCs synergistically promote Achilles tendon regeneration with the involvement of the RAS/ERK signaling pathway .},

  abstract     = {Lattice structures fabricated by the selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing process hold great potential for diverse applications. However, their actual mechanical behaviors often deviate from their counterparts with the as-designed geometries due to manufacturing defects. In this study, we presented an in-depth mechanical characterization of imperfect octet lattice structures via an image-based finite cell method (FCM) in combination with the multi-level hp refinement scheme for resolving the local defects and a Lemaitre damage model to conduct the damage analysis. Micro-computed tomography scanning was utilized to scan six SLM-fabricated octet lattice cells to obtain their as-built geometries. Based on the obtained geometry, the force-displacement curves and the damage distribution of the octet lattice cells and struts under given loads were predicted. The numerical results indicate that external defects significantly affect the struts&#39; damage distribution, while internal voids have a lesser influence due to their low volume fraction. It is identified that the SLM-fabricated octet lattice cell presents better elastoplastic behavior along the loading direction perpendicular than parallel to its build direction. These insights into the mechanical performance of imperfect octet lattice cells underscore the defects&#39; adverse effects and advance the understanding of their significance in SLM components.},

  abstract     = {Additively manufactured (AM) ceramics are gaining popularity due to improved flexibility in the design of customized structures. Microstructure-based finite element (FE) models were developed to study the strain-rate-dependent failure behavior of AM Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 ceramics under uniaxial compression. Upon validation with experimental data, the model was leveraged to quantify the history of intergranular and transgranular failure mechanisms across microstructures. It was revealed that the intergranular mechanism plays a key role in the material strength across strain rates. Crystallographic orientations were found to remarkably decrease the material strength due to the earlier initiation and faster growth of the intergranular mechanism. The increase in porosity was found to amplify the transgranular mechanism resulting from a higher number of pores acting as crack nucleation sites , decreasing the material strength regardless of strain rate . The model reflected the existence of a threshold for grain boundary strength, beyond which further enhancements yield marginal improvements in material strength. Additionally, the effect of grain size on the initiation and evolution of failure mechanisms was studied and the corresponding limitations of the model were discussed. The current work correlates the microstructure of the material to its macroscale response through micromechanical models , informing the design of better-performing AM Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 ceramics.},

  abstract     = {The continuous drive for miniaturization and enhanced functionality in micro-electronic devices demands highly integrated circuit (IC) packaging. This trend leads to a dense network of micro-electronic packaging interconnections, facilitated by the reduction in traditional solder interconnection sizes. However, these advancements bring about significant challenges, including thermal expansion differences between materials used in the package and the presence of non-planar substrates. Such issues can lead to thermomechanical stresses in interconnections and warpage, resulting in serious reliability issues. In response, nanostructured compliant interconnections have emerged as a promising solution. These interconnections effectively manage thermal expansion variations and substrate non-coplanarity, mitigating the risks associated with miniaturization and high integration demands in IC packaging. This review explores the latest trends and advancements in developing nanostructured compliant interconnections for modern micro-electronics. The focus is on integrating various interconnection materials, including nanoparticles (via sintering), nanoporous materials, nanowires (NWs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This integration aims to improve the performance and mechanical reliability of interconnections under extreme thermal loading conditions. Advanced bonding techniques and their significant impacts on interconnection reliability are also discussed. Additionally, the study provides insights into future developments of nanostructured compliant interconnections, guiding researchers toward specific technical areas for future exploration.},

Two different manufacturing processes including hot rolling (wrought plate) and laser-powder directed energy deposition (LP-DED) were considered. In addition, specimens were tested in two heat treatment (HT) conditions, namely solution annealed (SA), and age-hardened (AH). The microstructures of the materials were characterized using a scanning electron microscope. Tensile properties of specimens were evaluated at 21 °C, 538 °C, and 871 °C along with the fatigue properties at 21 °C under two different strain amplitudes of ε a = 0.005 mm/mm and ε a = 0.002 mm/mm. The LP-DED material in both the SA and AH conditions showed similar tensile strengths to the wrought AH material at all test temperatures, whereas the wrought SA material showed a noticeable deficit in strength at 21 °C and 538 °C, and was only comparable at 871 °C. Fatigue results indicated that there was no significant difference in fatigue life for specimens tested at ε a = 0.005 mm/mm, while differences in fatigue life were observed for specimens tested at ε a = 0.002 mm/mm, where fatigue life was observed to correlate well with the size of the crystallographic facets at crack initiation sites.},

Mapping the structural modification of the photoexcited and subsequently heated alloys reveals previously neglected chemical reactions with air, offering a direct solution for incorporating nanoparticles into an amorphous oxide matrix and broadening the range of laser-induced surface self-organization features. Our findings are attributed to the occurrence and enrichment of oxygen surface contamination that reacts with selected elements of the metallic glasses. Additionally, the growth of the crystalline phase from undercooled liquid may originate from the dissolution of oxides.

By investigating the intricate interplay of factors such as phase composition, nickel content, and the presence of carbides, this research aims to elucidate the diverse oxidation kinetics and underlying mechanisms specific to each alloy type. Results show that the BCC alloy exhibits slower oxidation kinetics compared to its FCC counterpart, suggesting better performance in high-temperature environments. Moreover, while both alloys develop strong adhesive oxide scales primarily composed of Cr 2 O 3 , the FCC alloy experiences more pronounced scale spallation and cracking. A faster progression of decarburization was observed in the BCC alloy. This comprehensive comparison highlights how variations in matrix structure, along with nickel content and carbide behavior, critically influence oxidation kinetics, scale adhesion, and the overall integrity of oxide scales. Understanding these nuanced interactions is crucial for designing high-performance alloys tailored for extreme operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Rare-earth (RE) doping has been demonstrated as a feasible approach to improve the cyclic performance of Ni-Mn-based Heusler alloys, but the current demonstration of underlying mechanism is simply ascribed to strengthening of the grain boundary cohesion. In this work, the effects brought by RE doping on microstructure, stress induced martensitic transformation behavior and cyclic stability of Ni-Mn-based alloys were systematically investigated. By Tb doping, a stable adiabatic temperature change (|Δ T ad |) of ∼ 5.5 K over 1000 cycles with no significant degradation was obtained in (Ni 43 Mn 47 Sn 10 ) 99.5 Tb 0.5 . (1) Through the in-situ digital image correlation strain measurement and in-situ SEM observation upon loading process, it revealed a multipoint nucleation of the martensitic transformation across the specimen arising from the intergranular NiSnTb secondary phase as nucleate sites, which weakens the strain concentration and suppresses the crack tendency. (2) The multipoint nucleation promotes the transformation volume fraction, making the large |Δ T ad | could be driven by a small transformation strain (Δ ε tr ) and (Ni 43 Mn 47 Sn 10 ) 99.5 Tb 0.5 yields a |Δ T ad /Δ ε tr | up to 8.7 K % −1 . Such reduction in applied strain further alleviates the extension of the cracks. Both the two factors brought by Tb doping in (Ni 43 Mn 47 Sn 10 ) 99.5 Tb 0.5 give rise to the enhancement in cyclic stability of the large elastocaloric effect.},

This paper presents a comparative study on the microstructure and corrosion behaviour of WAAM steel plates and the conventionally rolled Q345 steel. The WAAM steel exhibited comparable corrosion performance to the conventionally-produced steel within twelve days exposure in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, including the corrosion current density, and the characteristics of steel/concrete interface, determined through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Post-corrosion observations revealed that preferential dissolution occurred at (Si, Mn)-rich oxide inclusions, in addition to the general corrosion of surrounding steel matrix.

  abstract     = {Crystallisation inhibitors, such as sodium ferrocyanide (NaFeCN), are highly effective in mitigating NaCl-induced weathering in lime-based mortars; however, direct addition of NaFeCN in lime-mortars increases its susceptibility to leaching and rapid depletion, thus compromising long-term performance. Here, we present hydrogel-capsules for the controlled-release of NaFeCN within hydraulic mortars for the prolonged prevention of salt weathering. Capsules were prepared by complexing chitosan and calcium-alginate in different ratios containing different concentrations of NaFeCN. The release of NaFeCN from these capsules was measured in (1) simulated lime-mortar solution (2) from mortar specimens incorporated with calcium alginate (CA) and chitosan-calcium-alginate (Cs-CA) capsules using ultraviolet–visible light spectrophotometry and Inductive Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy. Mortars containing Cs-CA capsules exhibited controlled-release of NaFeCN with four times lower effective diffusion coefficient, compared to incorporating NaFeCN directly in mortar. Conversely, mortar containing CA capsules (without chitosan) released NaFeCN rapidly. Thus, chitosan’s presence in CA is necessary for tuning NaFeCN release and the reason may be attributed to chitosan’s role in reducing CA’s permeability and chitosan’s electrostatic-attraction to ferrocyanide anions, slowing diffusion of the latter. In conclusion, using Cs-CA capsules can control the release of NaFeCN within mortar, providing a steady NaFeCN supply to prolong mortar’s resistance against salt damage.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the topology-optimized lattices structures were designed to serve as ductile nylon reinforcements in lattice-enhanced cementitious composites. The mechanical behavior of the prepared composites was examined via a flexural test where the strength and mid-span deflection were especially concerned. The digital image correlation (DIC) approach was employed to monitor and evaluate the failure pattern and strain distribution. Further investigation was conducted on the mechanical effects of two major optimization factors in the lattice design process, namely cell size and optimization volume fracture. Finally, the improved ductile performance of the suggested composites was compared to that of prior works. The results indicated that the proposed topology-optimized lattices significantly promote the mechanical performance of the prepared composites, i.e., strength and ductility. It may present a higher ductility enhancement efficiency than homogenous lattices under an identical volume. The cell size of lattices is inversely related to the enhancing effects, and more extensive optimization volume fracture enhances composite strength and ductility. Compared with previous works, this study gained advancement in terms of printing materials, unit topology, and cement types. The topology-optimized lattice generally provides a novel solution to the ductility enhancement effect, providing both superior performance and greater design flexibility.},

  abstract     = {Composite tape springs are curved shells with the ability to assume two energetically stable states. By carefully selecting layup and mold during manufacturing, these structures can store significant strain energy, making them ideal for deployable systems. Yet, their potential as reversible reconfigurable structures, particularly as adaptive hinges, remains largely unexplored. In structural applications, both stable states of these hinges must exhibit high stiffness to support loads while retaining the capacity for reversible reconfiguration. This paper introduces kinematics-based stacking concepts aimed at enhancing the stiffness of bistable hinges in both states, allowing for specific fold angles without compromising compliance. These designs leverage snap-through kinematics, resulting in unique architectures with customizable stiffness and stability. Additionally, the paper presents a novel energy-based semi-analytical approach for analyzing the stacking concepts. This approach involves constrained exploration of the energy landscape to assess the design space in terms of stiffness and energy barriers. Through comprehensive parametric studies, the research demonstrates significantly increased stiffness and reduced peak stresses compared to single tape spring designs. This research highlights the potential of employing tape springs as reconfigurable load-bearing structures in diverse applications, including precise adjustments of low-mass payloads like solar panels or antennas on space structures.},

The MRC prototype features a sandwiched construction and is fabricated using quartz fiber-reinforced composite (QFRC) skins, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam cores, and silver-based frequency selective surface (FSS) screens. The calculation, simulation, and measured results demonstrated that the transmission of the planar specimen is larger than −1 dB at 2–4 GHz and the RCS reduction is less than −10 dB at 8–18 GHz. The measured results also verified that in the HH and VV polarizations, the mono-static RCS of a square pyramid (SP) specimen at specific directions from 8 GHz to 12 GHz is significantly reduced.

  abstract     = {Due to the preferential oxidation of Cr in various corrosion-resistant alloys, Cr-depletion extensively forms around the oxides and impairs passivation ability. This harmful effect has been widely recognized, but available solutions are limited. Here, to prevent such oxidation-induced Cr-depletion in corrosion-resistant alloys, we proposed a general strategy based on inclusion engineering using oxygen-preferred elements in alloy design. The inclusion-Cr depletion-passivation relationship was systematically studied in 3.5 wt% NaCl using commercially cast original, Si-modified, Al-modified, and Ti-modified CoCrFeMnNi alloys, in which the prominent inclusions were identified as MnCr 2 O 4 , MnO-SiO 2 , AlN, and TiN, respectively. Unlike the original alloy, all modified alloys prevented Cr-depletion with improved corrosion resistance; however, the Si-modified alloy exhibited the most remarkable improvement due to few nitride by-products. Thermodynamic analysis on the free energy changes of potential reactions revealed that all the additives were preferential to be oxidized over Cr, whereas Al and Ti nitridation reactions have the most negative free energies compared to all oxidation reactions, which validated experimental results. From experiments and thermodynamics, an effective method was proposed, and its application was discussed with three newly-designed alloys prepared using arc melting. We believe the proposed strategy can be widely used in designing alloys to prevent oxidation-induced Cr-depletion.},

Autonomous living scaffolds regulate cell migration, proliferation and differentiation in real time by releasing living cells steadily for long-term. Regarding structure, we review the functional role of natural bone structures in bone homeostasis, providing insights into the design of bone-inspired scaffolds. Due to the conflict between the mechanical properties and bone regeneration ability, this review proposes assembled scaffolds.

The combinatorial libraries were subjected to point-by-point structural (XRD synchrotron radiation) and chemical (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) analysis, characterizing roughly 172 alloys. A strong correlation was found between peak symmetry and width, and early stages of crystalline phase formation. These nanocrystals are difficult to detect from the evolution of the peak position. In view of current literature, our data questions the recently claimed universality of the peak width as indicator of high glass forming ability. The addition of Ag significantly improves the poor glass formation of binary CuZr (36 alloys) under identical deposition conditions, as fully amorphous alloys are found for the majority of the investigated composition space. A thorough understanding of the microstructure of CuZrAg alloys on flexible substrates is highly relevant in view of favourable antibacterial properties and potential application as coatings for biomedical surfaces.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an innovative design methodology for conical-shaped variable stiffness composite laminates. It employs the spectral Chebyshev method to solve dynamic equations, optimizing lamination parameters to maximize fundamental frequency. Subsequently, the fiber angles at the sampling points across the domain are retrieved. In the final step, a custom normalized cut segmentation approach is proposed to partition the domain into clusters and delineate fiber paths based on discrete fiber angles, while satisfying the manufacturing constraints such as curvature, gaps, and overlaps. The effectiveness of the proposed design methodology is demonstrated through several case studies, where maximum enhancement in fundamental frequency for the same part weight is compared to optimized constant stiffness composite laminates. The results show that an enhancement of 16% is achievable for a variable stiffness laminate disregarding manufacturing constraints for the fully clamped case study. However, the improvements reduce to 12.6% and 14% (deviating from the ideal optimal fundamental frequency by 4.5% and 3.3%), respectively, once the manufacturable constant and curvilinear fibers in each cluster are computed. This work can lead significant advances of engineering applications by enabling the design of variable stiffness laminates with complex geometries improving mechanical performance and/or reducing structural weight compared to conventional laminates.},

This study investigates the in-situ evolution of the σ phase in DSS through a multi-faceted approach. Distinct σ phase formation mechanisms were identified at 850 °C and 950 °C, with short-range diffusion of eutectoid decomposition at 850 °C and long-range diffusion of nucleation and growth at 950 °C. In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that the lattice parameter of the γ phase peaks at ∼ 600 °C. The thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the γ phase is 1.8 times higher than that of the α phase at low temperatures. Interestingly, the convergence of the CTEs of the α and γ phases above 600 °C triggers σ nucleation. The strain field diagram shows maximum impinging strain at the lattice parameter maxima just before the σ formation range. The adverse effects of the σ phase on DSS heat transport properties were also explored, showing an initial increase in thermal conductivity with an increasing γ volume fraction, followed by an 18 % decrease upon σ evolution. First-principle calculations highlight the correlation between Ni enrichment and lattice parameter maxima, supporting these findings.},

By leveraging the power of deep learning, inverse design can be conducted on the unit cell structure based on the mechanical properties of its lattice structure. Assisted by deep learning, this study introduces a novel data-driven approach to design three-dimensional (3D) unit cells for lattice structures with anticipated properties. The approach can be efficiently and accurately applied to various unit cell structures. An auto-encoder is trained to extract the geometric features from unit cell point clouds. The effective mechanical properties of the lattice structures are calculated by combining the homogenization method and the finite element method. Subsequently, a mapping relationship between mechanical properties and geometric features is established through the multi-layer perceptron neural network. The models are ultimately employed to design 3D unit cells given anticipated properties of lattice structures. The results show that the mechanical properties of the generated unit cells satisfy the anticipated values. The applications of proposed method are demonstrated in orthopedic implants, new hybrid unit cells, and functionally gradient structures. Furthermore, the method can be extended to unit cell design across diverse domains.},

This study demonstrates that by simply remelting AZ91/AZ80 machining chips and shape casting, the tensile properties of the castings can be preserved and substantial grain refinement can be achieved, compared to casting from ingots using the same alloy. Cooling curves for the samples, obtained through the immersion thermocouple method, showed that nucleation event density in chip melts consistently exceeds that in ingot melts, particularly at low undercoolings. Tensile tests showed that chip castings exhibit a slightly higher 0.2% proof stress than castings from ingots, with increases of 5% and 1% for as-cast and solution-treated conditions, respectively, due to the Hall-Petch effect. Elongation to fracture was similar for both chip and ingot samples, with fractography indicating entrainment defects, rather than grain size, predominantly determined this outcome. These combined results indicate that the shape casting of AZ91/AZ80 machining chips could be used as part of the closed-loop recycling of magnesium.},

This study explores harnessing the shape memory effect (SME) in Nickel-Titanium shape memory alloys (NiTi SMAs) in structures fabricated using additive manufacturing (AM) to advance the development of active ILMs by creating unit cells that open or close at specific temperatures. The study encompasses designing and fabricating two distinct interlocking array configurations using near-equiatomic NiTi powder and the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) AM technique, following a previously developed AM process optimization framework to manufacture defect-free parts. To guide the design process, finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to predict strain values during engage-disengage cycles. The martensitic transformation characteristics of the ILMs were characterized. Thermomechanical testing revealed that the ILMs demonstrate high locking force once engaged, coupled with complete shape recovery and good cyclic stability. Digital image correlation (DIC) was also employed to validate the FEA predictions during the engage-disengage cycles. The results indicate that NiTi SMA-based ILMs can be designed and fabricated into complex shapes using L-PBF. By leveraging the SME, the functionality of an ILM can be improved upon. The combination of computational modeling, additive manufacturing, and thermomechanical and physical property characterization provides a framework for designing future ILMs out of active materials.},

Accordingly, tensile test coupons were manufactured under varying processing conditions, and their microstructure-related attributes, e.g., grain morphology, size and texture; porosity; and microhardness were characterized. Additionally, the yield and tensile strengths of the samples were measured using digital image correlation.

In this study, we attempt to tailor the microstructural evolution to manipulate the mechanical performance and corrosion resistance of Al-7Si-3Cu-(0.4 Mg)-(0.5Ge) alloys fabricated by GPa-level pressure combined with solution and/or aging treatments. It was found that as the solidification pressure increased, the dendritic growth tendency of the α-Al phase became less pronounced, and the modification of eutectic Si became increasingly significant. Complete solid solution alloys were even achieved under 6 GPa. The corresponding kinetic and thermodynamic mechanisms of pressure-induced microstructural evolution were explored in detail. Upon aging treatment, dense irregular Si precipitates emerged from the supersaturated matrix in Al-7Si-3Cu alloys solidified at 5 GPa and 6 GPa, while denser and finer Si precipitates growing along the 〈1 0 0〉 Al directions dominated the matrix of Al-7Si-3Cu-0.4 Mg-0.5Ge alloys, which resulted in considerable enhancement of mechanical properties. The electrochemical corrosion behavior was evaluated in the as-cast and heat-treated conditions.

RPVs, which are fabricated from low-alloy steel, are exposed to irradiation damage at moderate temperatures, and thus experience irradiation embrittlement in service. Since the 1960s, commercial reactor designs and construction have sought to minimize beltline-region welds in RPVs to limit the more extreme irradiation embrittlement found in these arc welds. But recent advancements in welding, compounded by long lead times and astronomical costs for single-forging RPVs, have prompted the nuclear industry to reconsider RPV welds. To design and deploy improved RPV welds, a scientific understanding of their structure–property relationships must be attained. However, many studies report only on microstructure or mechanical properties, hampering a rigorous mechanistic understanding. Additionally, RPV weld irradiation embrittlement data enables researchers to more accurately evaluate the risk of RPV welds and design modern RPV welds with enhanced irradiation stability and structural integrity.},

The results show that active learning successfully constructs a probabilistic estimation of the ZPR boundary. A comprehensive analysis of the identified ZPR contour is performed to extract crucial design insights. The findings indicate that the near-ZPR characteristic can be attained through various combinations of geometric parameters. This offers users the flexibility to select the configuration that best aligns with their specific requirements. Additionally, an investigation of the various ZPR configurations that have been discovered is carried out to understand the mechanism that yields near-ZPR property. One discovered near-ZPR design was subsequently fabricated using 3D printing for validation purposes.

Under quasi-static tension at cryogenic temperature, the engineering yield and ultimate tensile strengths (UTS) reach 980 MPa and 1800 MPa, respectively, with notable ductility (62 %). The product of UTS and total elongation (TE) is 111.6 GPa %, surpassing most cryogenic high strength-ductility alloys. The significant mechanical strength enhancement is attributed to the denser deformation twins (DTs), multiple twinning, and extensive face-centered-cubic to hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) phase transitions, resulting in a high work hardening capacity. Upon dynamic tension at cryogenic temperature, the strength and strain hardening are further improved, which originates from the thickening DTs and HCP sequence and localized plastic deformation. The effects of temperature and strain rate on phase transition are studied. It is proposed that there is a competing relationship between high strain rate and increased stacking fault energy (SFE) due to temperature rise. The coupling effect of cryogenic temperature and high strain rate inhibits phase transition due to the deformation inhomogeneity in CrCoNiSi 0.3 MEA. The findings make a valuable contribution to understand the influence of temperature and strain rate on the mechanism of FCC-to-HCP phase transition.},

  abstract     = {Solid solution strengthened ferritic ductile iron (SSFDI) exhibits improved mechanical properties compared to conventional ductile cast iron (DCI) grades, however, its potential widespread application is hindered by unpredictable brittle fracture which might be attributed to microstructural silicon segregation and associated superstructure formation. The aim of the present study is therefore to deepen the understanding on the effect of local silicon segregation on the mechanical properties of SSFDI, which is crucial especially for the common applications of DCI in cyclically loaded structures. Micropillar compression tests were carried out on three different casts to investigate the solution strengthening effect of silicon in the ferritic matrix. An almost perfect linear relationship between critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) and global silicon content was found. It was also found that the variation of CRSS with silicon content corresponds well to the variation of the macroscopic yield limits (under tension and compression) with global silicon content of different SSFDI alloys. This indicates that the ferritic matrix dominates the yield limit of the DCI alloys investigated in this study, while the morphology of the graphite nodules plays a minor role under monotonic loading conditions.},

Non-homogeneous duplex grain size distributions greatly reduce stress-rupture life. Regional distribution of coarse grains is not good for acquiring high stress-rupture life, the formation of micro-void and propagation of cracking can easily occur at coarse grain boundary especially when plate-like Cr 23 C 6 precipitates at grain boundary. But relatively homogeneous duplex grain size distributions are of great significance in improving stress-rupture life, the samples even possess the life value up to more than 13000 h especially when hardly any plate-like Cr 23 C 6 precipitates at grain boundaries. Slightly increased Ti/Al ratio from 1.65 to 1.80 is also beneficial to obtain a significantly longer stress-rupture life value. The γ′ phase is very stable and always exhibits a coherent orientation relationship with γ on {1 0 0} and {1 1 1} atomic planes. The grain boundary cracking will not easily appear at the early stage of stress-rupture test in the samples with relatively homogeneous grain size distribution, the coarse and adjacent fine grains possess better deformation adjustability, and the grain boundary cracking is apparently wider and the number of cracking is also getting more after fracture for the sample with longer stress-rupture life.},

This study explores the possibility of generating controllable hydrophobic metasurfaces on Ni-Mn-Ga-based magnetic shape memory (MSM) alloys using femtosecond pulse width laser (FPWL). While hydrophobic surfaces have been achieved on different materials through a variety of different techniques, the research marks the first systematic attempt to tailor hydrophobicity on the surface of Ni-Mn-Ga-based alloys. By characterizing surfaces treated with different laser parameters, the distinct morphologies and hydrophobic properties corresponding to each surface were identified. This newfound control over surface properties with specific machining parameters opens possibilities for applications in microfluidic devices. Additionally, the potential of utilizing the magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS) exhibited by Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals to alter surface hydrophobicity was explored. Metasurfaces mimicking the dimensional changes in elongation induced by MFIS demonstrated higher static contact angles (SCAs) for water droplets compared to the original surfaces. This approach presents a promising avenue for creating multifunctional microdevices with controllable hydrophobicity using Ni-Mn-Ga-based alloys. Our findings not only offer insights into tailoring of hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties on Ni-Mn-Ga-based MSM alloys but also provide a novel methodology for fabricating functional metasurfaces on other metals.},

In this study, we develop a biological metabolism-inspired injectable hydrogel crosslinking by hydrazide modified hyaluronic acid (HA-HYD), aldehyde modified hyaluronic acid (HA-ALD), and ε-polylysine coated catalase-mimic nanozyme (mesoporous manganese cobalt oxide). Herein, this nanozyme-reinforced hydrogel with outstanding and durable reactive oxygen species (ROS) depletion capability and biocompatibility can alleviate the oxidative stress microenvironment, improve cell viability and proliferation, as well as up-regulate chondrogenic related gene expression and cartilage matrix formation of chondrocytes in vitro. Intra-articular administration of this engineered hydrogel can effectively scavenge endogenous over-expressed ROS to ameliorate the harsh microenvironment in the cavity of TMJ-OA. The nanozyme-reinforced hydrogel reduced proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) and enhance anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) expression, induced polarization of synovial macrophages towards M2 phenotype, alleviated structural damage to the cartilage and subchondral bone of the condyle, thus reducing cartilage matrix destruction and protect cartilage in osteoarthritis.

The mortars containing MFC in suspension and paste forms showed slightly higher workability, mechanical strength, and denser microstructure than those with HPMC. The MFC samples showed a higher viscosity and yield stress than the ones containing HPMC. A large-scale concrete 3D printer was used for the printability test. The HPMC mortars showed slightly superior extrudability and printability; however, the shape stability was inferior to that of the MFC mortars. The compressive strength of the 3D-printed samples was 40% lower compressive strength than the mold-cast samples; however, the flexural strength was comparable. Overall, the MFC in paste form outperformed the other VMAs studied here, providing better shape stability, while maintaining acceptable printability.},

  abstract     = {The drawback of low strength of 304 stainless steel could be overcome by fabricating gradient nanostructures (GNS). However, deformation-induced martensite results in magnetic generation and plasticity degradation. In this work, a single austenitic GNS 304 stainless steel is fabricated by first creating a dual-phase GNS through the ultrasonic surface rolling process (USRP), followed by rapid induction heating. The yield strength of the single austenite GNS (520 MPa) is 1.68 times higher than that of the homogeneous coarse-grained structure (310 MP) without sacrificing plasticity (elongation of 65 %). Quantitative calculations indicate that fine grain, dislocation, twinning, and back-stress strengthening contribute to the strength increment by 30 %, 17.5 %, 23.4 %, and 29.1 %, respectively. Coarse-grained regions deform mainly through FCC-HCP-BCC martensitic transformation, whereas the subsurface layer forms stacking faults and twins due to increased stacking fault energy caused by the reduction in grain size. At the topmost layer, the stress required to activate dislocations is lower than that for twinning. Under high-stress conditions, martensite forms along the nanograin boundaries via a phase transition from FCC to BCC. Consequently, the excellent plasticity of the single austenite GNS stems from the synergistic effects of high back-stress hardening, TRIP and TWIP effect.},

To this day, however, hardly any studies have investigated the fatigue strength of post-treated additively manufactured components with notches. In this study, fatigue tests were performed on plain and notched specimens to determine and compare the crack initiation and crack propagation behavior due to different manufacturing-related effects. Tests were performed on specimens produced by the two aforementioned AM processes and compared to specimens taken from wrought sheets. The fatigue strength of AM materials is influenced by microstructure, defects, residual stress, and notches. PBF-LB/M specimens exhibit the highest fatigue strength in plain, notch-free conditions, attributed to differences in microstructure and static strength affecting fatigue crack initiation. Notched specimens show larger differences among materials, with PBF-LB/M having shorter fatigue crack propagation life related to line-type defect clusters, while the plain PBF-LB/M specimens are less affected as their fatigue strength is primarily determined by fatigue crack initiation.},

Here, we proposed an efficient method for the construction of lattice structures by elongating two-dimensional planar patterns along the load direction, which enabled the efficient utilization of 100 % materials for load bearing. Inspired by Chinese Knot (CK), a series of meticulously crafted TC4 lattice structures were fabricated by using selective laser melting. These structures feature nine tubular units arranged in a 3 × 3 matrix interconnected by sixteen parallel plates, and their failure modes were subsequently investigated by uniaxial compression tests. The results show that the specific compressive strength of the CK structure enhances as increasing the density. The detachment between the plate and tube, and the buckling of the plate, lead to the premature failure, which in turn leads to substantial variations in strength, estimated at approximately 80 MPa at ∼ 1.5 g/cm 3 . When the thickness of the plate exceeds 0.5 mm, and the tube wall thickness exceeds 0.04 mm, the CK structures show high stability and exhibit a 45° shear failure mode. Notably, the specific strength of the CK structure can surpass 330 MPa∙cm 3 /g, which represents the peak level of specific compressive strength compared to the current TC4 lattice structures.},

  abstract     = {Research on creating special structures with a negative Poisson’s ratio, known as auxetic metamaterials, is widely conducted for potential applications in flexible electronics, aerospace, biomedicine, and other fields. Auxiticity is the phenomenon of transverse expansion that occurs when stretched longitudinally. However, conventional metamaterial tunable properties have certain limitations, mainly in the form of limited Poisson’s ratio tuning range and transverse deformation. In this work, a series of symmetric antichiral auxetic structures with significant auxetic effect and low Poisson’s ratio of −5 are designed and fabricated by 3D printing. Based on the manipulating of unit parameters and the use of shape memory polymers, the auxetic metamaterials exhibit tunable mechanical properties and programmable shape memory behaviors. Owing to these features, the auxetic metamaterials are demonstrated to achieve excellent shape-fitting and size-fitting capabilities, which are followed by expanding in a full range to contact any objects (due to auxiticity) and then contract to conform their shapes (due to shape memory). By integrating flexible electromyography(EMG) electrodes, the shape memory auxetic metamaterials can be used as self-adaptive wearable devices to fit with human limbs, which can ensure the good attachment, high signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), and breathability when collect EMG signals.},

  abstract     = {There have been a lot of interest in developing synthesis methods for the preparation of homogeneous multicomponent metal oxides for wide range of applications in the literature. One synthesis method of metal oxides was patented by Pechini in 1967, which involved an intermediate metal containing resin formation followed by calcination. Extensive research based on this patent took place over last few decades. However, many works in past would include confusions and contradictions among so called “sol–gel methods”, “co-precipitation methods” and “solution routes”. Even now, the confusion between the sol–gel method and the method described in the patent by Pechini prevails in the literatures. Interestingly, (i) the synthesis method described by Pechini is different from the so-called sol–gel methods, (ii) chemically, complex formation and polymerization reactions take place at the early stage and (iii) the performance of materials produced by this method is excellent for many applications. Herein, based on the extensive research, a scientific name such as the polymer complex (PC) method has been proposed. Furthermore, the general development and advancement of this method and recent advances in the area of thermoelectric, energy storage and photocatalytic materials preparation, respectively involving the PC method have been discussed.},

However, the breadth and depth of studies on scaling the fabrication process from PiezoMEMS to NEMS (Nano-Electro-Mechanical Systems) remain limited. Effective MEMS miniaturization not only improves energy efficiency and surface area reduction but also enables the coupling of nanoscale physics, particularly Casimir Forces, with the NEMS design, device operation, and fabrication opportunities. Here, combined with the finite element method (FEM) modeling, the experimental aluminum nitride (AlN) nanotransducer fabrication is performed to address the fabrication challenges with beam-based in-plane nanostructures and to develop the piezoelectric NEMS design utilizing a controllable stiction behavior. The FEM modeling demonstrates that the designed structure featuring a 220 nm thick silicon (Si) beam with AlN layers located on vertical sidewalls exhibits controllable jump-to-contact and jump-off-contact behaviors. Based on modeling results, a complete piezoelectric sidewall transducer structure is fabricated. The final transducer represents a patterned Si nanobeam with the Molybdenum-AlN-Aluminum transducer located on the vertical sidewalls. The presented findings not only open new opportunities in the piezoelectric MEMS scaling but also establish a platform for the design of innovative “more-than-a-Moore” devices, such as in-plane mechanical latching switches.},

  abstract     = {n this study, an innovative algorithm is developed to transform microstructures to hierarchical graphs without manual feature engineering. The hierarchical graph comprises two layers. Initially, pixel data, which includes Euler angles, phase, and position, forms the pixel-wise graphs within individual grains. Following this foundation, the grains serve as nodes, constituting the second layer. Importantly, the hierarchical graph preserves essential measurement data and structural details for training machine learning models. After that, a contrastive learning model based on hierarchical graph is designed to capture representations of microstructures obtained by the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. This model can be directly extended for other microscopy techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Using the learned microstructure representations, an autoencoder model for the directed energy deposition (DED) is developed to establish the relationship among process parameters, microstructures, and material properties, completing the process-structure–property cycle quantitatively. The performance of the present model is naturally benchmarked against two other models: a contrastive learning model based on pixel-wise graph (without manual feature engineering) and a contrastive learning model based on grain-wise graph (employing manual feature engineering). The results of the present model highlight the potential in decoding the process-structure–property relationships in the DED process.},

In this work, a methodology of incorporation of a graded Multi-Material Compatibility Interface (MMCI) was employed to allow deposition of tungsten layers (melting at 3410 °C) on a much less refractory metal, copper (boiling at 2562 °C). The manufacturing of parts combining tungsten and copper is of interest for components designed to dissipate heat in extreme environments, such as the divertor for tokamak fusion reactors. A succession of miscible filler metals rationally selected from thermodynamics were printed by laser and powder injection, with optimization of energy and material inputs for each layer, supported by material characterization and physical numerical analysis of the process phenomenology. 90 % wt. tungsten layer deposition on a copper initial substrate is achieved using an MMCI with 6 intermediate layers and 1.6 mm total thickness. The results reveal the importance of controlling the dilution ratio to achieve stable depositions of multi-material with compositional gradients, with a progressive increase in melt pool temperatures. The numerical analysis highlighted the important role of the dissolution and mixing of partially melted refractory powders, and the selective vaporization of volatile elements.},

To examine the effect of plastic straining on structural changes, micropillars were fabricated on the cross-section of the disk along the radius at specific locations, i.e. center, half radius and perimeter. Compression tests of these micropillars were conducted in a scanning electron microscope with simultaneous recording of continuous acoustic emissions. Present paper captures the effect of competition between thermal relaxation and deformation induced structural changes. Specifically, probability distributions were constructed for a series of acoustic emission events, revealing that the occurrence of acoustic emission bursts at larger deformations is in correlation with the shift of the X-ray diffraction halos and change in thermal characteristics. Accordingly, a transition was identified from random to correlated acoustic emission behavior parallel with a progressive increase in the accumulation of excess free volume from negative to positive values.},

Conventional precipitates used for strengthening typically contain only two major constituent elements selected from Ni, Al, and Ti. However, knowledge about the intrinsic properties and strengthening mechanisms of multicomponent precipitates remains limited. Here, we propose introducing novel multicomponent L1 2 -type precipitates containing palladium (Pd) to strengthen FeNi-based alloys. The strengthened FeNi alloy achieves an eightfold increase in strength compared to the FeNi matrix while maintaining good ductility. Using meticulous micro-characterization and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques, in conjunction with first-principles calculations, this study investigated the effects of Pd addition on the thermodynamic stability, morphology, coherency, and strengthening mechanisms of the precipitates. Results indicate that the addition of Pd induces the nucleation of L1 2 -type precipitates, increases their ductility, and eliminates anisotropy in the shear modulus of the precipitates. Excessive Pd content can alter the shape of precipitates from spherical to acicular due to increased interfacial mismatch between the precipitates and the FeNi matrix. These insights shed light on the impact of Pd addition on the intrinsic properties of L1 2 -type precipitates, offering a promising pathway for the design of advanced FeNi-based alloys with optimized mechanical performance.},

  abstract     = {Reducing friction is a promising strategy to decrease material losses and energy consumption in industrial systems. However, in aqueous-lubricated steel contacts, the contact pressure rarely exceeds 50 MPa during super-low friction due to excessive wear. This work demonstrates that even in steel/steel contacts, by combining graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with aqueous glycerol, it is possible to maintain super-low friction (µ ≈ 0.012) under a contact pressure as high as 316.5 MPa. Moreover, the use of GQDs improved the wear performance by 98 % compared to pure aqueous glycerol due to the formation of a tribochemical film, resulting from the electrostatic adsorption of GQDs on the positively charged sites on the worn surface. In particular, the exfoliation of graphene sheets within GQDs, the shearing of graphene layers inside the GQDs, and the OH–OH repulsion between the asperities shortens the running-in period and consequently reduces the friction and wear. At the same time, the formation of a chemically adsorbed tribofilm containing friction-induced structurally degraded GQDs protects the surface from wear and facilitates the maintenance of super-low friction at high contact pressures by improving the load-carrying capacity. This study suggests that green nano-lubricants based on GQDs have immense potential in sustainable engineering.},

However, constrained by the magnetic control mode and the high flexibility of the soft materials, achieving rapid movement and perception-feedback of magnetic soft robots are still challenging. Therefore, this paper aims to draw inspiration from biomimetic joint structures to design and fabricate a magnetic arthropod soft robot capable of rapid cyclic extension-contraction deformation under an alternating magnetic field. First, a type A magnetic arthropod soft robot (MASR-A) is developed with a speed up to 1.4 body length per second (BL/s) with three-joint-unit. Next, we designed a type B magnetic arthropod soft robot (MASR-B) that offers higher flexibility and deformation adaptability with bodies owing five-joints structure. Then, inspired by snail’s tentacles, we developed bionic antennae based on triboelectric tactile sensors (TTSs), which can convert external mechanical collisions into electrical signals output, with a sensitivity of up to 0.13 V KPa −1 . By mounting the bionic antennae on the head of MASR-B to realize the magnetic soft robot’s sensing function, enabling MASR-B to detect collisions with obstacles of various materials (PMMA, Resin, PLA and etc.). Particularly, the bionic antennae consists of two completely independent triboelectric sensing units (LTTS and RTTS). The signals from these two TTSs are received and identified by a microcontroller to determine the direction of obstacle relative to the robot. The relay is then controlled to alter the magnetic field generated by the electromagnetic coils to enable MASR-B to avoid obstacle. This paper provides a biomimetic design approach for the rapid movement and flexible sensing of magnetic soft robots.},

A design space of four TPMSs hybridization is introduced and used to generate over 8000 samples. Stiffness constants obtained using the homogenization method is used in elastic characterization. The hybrid TPMSs is proved to lack common cubic symmetry but possess wide rotational symmetry. Indirect stiffness constant-based way exhibits better predictions for optimal stiffness and elastic isotropy than direct property parameter-based one. The approach successfully identified useful structures: quasi-elastic-isotropic ones and a ultra-stiff one that is ∼ 9 % stronger than the currently strongest TPMS. The method offers comprehensive guidance for stiffness constant-based TPMS design using DL technique.},

  abstract     = {Based on the solid waste-based modification, green shear-thickening functionalized ballistic composites were prepared. Silica aerosols were obtained from solid waste diatomaceous earth through sol–gel preparation, gel aging, and supercritical drying. The modified silica aerosols acted as the dispersed phase, regulating the green shear-thickening liquid. A comparison was made between the performance of the modified shear-thickening liquid (SG@STF) and traditional shear-thickening liquids. By modifying solid waste based shear thickener (SG@STF) Combined with aramid fabric (AF) to test Ballistic performance. Characterization tests revealed that the rheological properties of SG@STF were significantly enhanced by increasing the volume fraction of the dispersed phase in STF from 50 % to 60 %. This enhancement was attributed to the addition of reactive functional groups on the surface of the silica sol. Yarn pull-out tests demonstrated that SG@STF/AF improved the tensile strength by 120 % compared to AF fabric, thanks to its superior friction properties. Ballistic tests showed that SG@STF increased the ballistic ultimate velocity of AF fabric by 105 %, elevating AF’s ballistic limiting velocity from 51 m/s to 105 m/s. Consequently, SG@STF/AF exhibited superior ballistic properties compared to AF fabric. The doping of SG enhanced the friction between yarns and increased the load-bearing area of the fabrics, thereby improving the ballistic properties of SG@STF/AF and achieving the desired modulation of their ballistic properties.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional aperiodic lattices emerge as remarkably isotropic metamaterials with potentially unconventional mechanical behavior. This study investigates numerically estimating the effective elastic properties, as a function of relative density, of novel two-dimensional aperiodic lattice metamaterials derived from the recently discovered aperiodic monotiles, known as the “Hat,” “Turtle,” and “Spectre” tiles. Furthermore, several classes of the Hat-based lattices; namely Hexagon (H), Triangle (T), Parallelogram (P), and Fan (F), are also investigated. The results show that these aperiodic lattices have isotropic elastic properties independent of relative density. The Hat-based and Turtle lattices exhibit larger elastic moduli, gradually converging to the Spectre-based lattices as relative density increases. A distinctive feature of the Hat-based lattices is their directional auxetic behaviour with an anisotropic Poisson’s ratio, whereas the Turtle lattices show an auxetic behaviour only at lower relative densities. Despite anisotropic Poisson’s ratios, the current aperiodic lattices maintain elastic isotropy, offering a unique blend of anisotropic auxetic behavior and isotropic elastic moduli. This study contributes to a better understanding of the elastic properties of aperiodic monotile lattice metamaterials and their potential for engineering their mechanical behavior for certain applications.},

Simultaneous improvement on yield strength and uniform elongation is observed in the dual-graded structure at cryogenic temperature, compared to those at room temperature. Stronger hetero-deformation-induced hardening and higher density of geometrically necessary dislocations are observed at cryogenic temperature in both single-grain-size-graded and dual-graded structures. The hardening mechanisms at room temperature are characterized by low density of deformation twins and stacking faults (SFs) on one slip system, while are dominated by high density SFs at two slip systems and formation of Lomer-Cottrell (L-C) locks at cryogenic temperature for the single-graded structure. The hardening mechanisms at both room and cryogenic temperatures are revealed by high density of SFs and L-C locks in the dual-grade structure. These SFs and L-C locks can provide strong hardening themselves as dynamic Hall-Petch effect on one hand, and can interact with coherent L1 2 precipitates for intense precipitation hardening on the other hand. The better tensile properties for the dual-graded structure at cryogenic temperature should be attributed to a special SF-induced plasticity, i.e., the formation of SF networks and their interactions with nanoprecipitates.},

However, there remains an urgent need to study the high-accuracy constitutive model and complex deformation mechanism of Al-Li alloys deformed at high strain rates and cryogenic temperatures. In this study, the flow stress behavior and microstructure evolution of 2195 Al-Li alloy were investigated over a wide stain rate range (from 2000 s −1 to 5000 s −1 ) and temperature range (from 298 K to 123 K). The flow stress increases by ∼ 32% at 2000 s −1 and ∼ 37% at 5000 s −1 as the deformation temperature drops from 298 K to 123 K, but only increases by ∼ 4% at 298 K and ∼ 8% at 123 K as the strain rate increases from 2000 s −1 to 5000 s −1 . At the high strain rate of 5000 s −1 , the T 1 phases exhibit bending (at 298 K) and fracturing (at 123 K), with increased lattice distortion and substructure generation around the intersections of T 1 phases. A new constitutive model (g-Johnson-Cook model) is developed, which shows a higher accuracy than both the Arrhenius model and Johnson-Cook model in describing the deformation behavior.},

  abstract     = {Good strength-ductility balance in graphene nanosheet (GNS)-reinforced aluminum nanocomposites can be achieved through tailorable and facile agglomeration control. Our previous study showed that pre-modulating the Al powder morphology by adding hard silicon carbide nanoparticles (SiCnp) during the two-step ball milling process effectively promotes the uniform dispersion of GNSs. However, excess SiCnp content causes SiCnp aggregate and premature cracking of composites. Here, GNS-reinforced aluminum nanocomposites with different SiCnp content (0.3–1.5 vol%) were prepared, and the optimal SiCnp-to-GNS ratio was determined after optimizing the SiCnp content in a pre-studied composite preparation process. The effect of SiCnp on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the composites was systematically investigated. The cold welding deformation of Al flakes increased with the SiCnp content. Nonetheless, inadequate or excessive SiC content caused insufficient lamination or excessive cold-weld stacking of Al flakes, respectively. Al-0.9vol.%SiCnp powders possessed the highest specific surface area which resulted in high homogeneous dispersion of 3.0 vol% GNS during the second ball-milling stage. Consequently, the resulting hybrid reinforced (GNS + SiCnp)/Al composites showed simultaneous improvement in strength and plasticity, unlike Al-3.0vol.%GNS composites. This showed that introducing hard nanoparticles (i.e., the hybridization strategy) is a promising method to simultaneously enhance strength and plasticity of aluminum nanocomposites.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing provides unprecedented opportunities for designing and producing intricate, architected materials with exceptional properties while maintaining reduced weight. One of the most straightforward ways to create such structures is to mimic the lattice geometries of crystals. New approaches are now exploring how to influence the behaviour of these structures by mimicking not only the crystal arrangement but also peculiar mechanisms occurring at the crystallographic scale. In such a context, this study first presents a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice derived from the homonymous crystal structures of Ti or Zr metals. Subsequently, the twinning phenomenon responsible for the plastic deformation of these metals is reproduced geometrically into this structure to improve its energy absorption capability. Compressive tests conducted on 3D-printed samples confirm such a hypothesis: the specific energy absorption of twinned structures is significantly higher than that of the equivalent HCP ones, with an increase of up to 24.3%. Introducing twinned regions stabilises the plastic deformation despite a limited reduction of the peak stress. Therefore, replicating the twinning metallurgical mechanism within an HCP-inspired metamaterial proves successful, further validating the approach of mimicking and transferring atomic phenomena at a different scale to tailor the properties of architected materials.},

In order to tailor the transformation to a particular application, the compositional dependence of properties in NiTi-based SMAs, such as martensitic transformation temperatures and hysteresis, has been exploited. However, the compositional design space is large and complex, and experimental studies are expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable piecewise linear regression model that predicts the λ 2 λ2 parameter, a measure of compatibility between austenite and martensite phases, and an (indirect) factor that is well-correlated with martensitic transformation hysteresis, based on the chemical features derived from the alloy composition. The model is capable of predicting, for the first time, the type of martensitic transformation for a given alloy chemistry. The proposed model is validated by experimental data from the literature as well as in-house measurements. The results show that the model can effectively distinguish between B 19 and B 19 ′ B19′ regions for any given composition in NiTi-based SMAs and accurately estimate the λ 2 λ2 parameter.},

In this study, we mechanically joined pure Ti and pure Mg without brittle layers by forming bicontinuous microstructure, 3D entanglement of immiscible phases, at the joint interface. We butt-joined pure Mg and Ti–Cu alloy interlayer, which we pre-diffusion bonded to the pure Ti and heated at 813 K and 20 MPa for 5 min. At the joint interface, Cu and Mg eutectic melted, which induced liquid metal dealloying of the interlayer. The entire Ti–Cu interlayer is dealloyed, and a byproduct (Mg–Cu phase) is removed by pressurization during melting. These brittle layer removal processes left only α-Ti/Mg–Cu phase bicontinuous microstructure at the joint interface, improving the joint strength. Ti/Mg joints fractured at the Mg base metal at ca. 90 MPa by tensile tests. The findings of this study provide the basis for achieving immiscible alloy joining, for which effective joining methods have not yet been established.},

In this study, we introduce a back-propagation framework for lattice-based mechanical neural networks (MNNs) to achieve prescribed static and dynamic performance. This approach leverages the steady states of nodes for back-propagation, efficiently updating the learning degrees of freedom without prior knowledge of input loading. One-dimensional MNNs, trained with back-propagation in silico , can exhibit the desired behaviors on demand function as intelligent mechanical machines. The framework is then employed for the precise morphing control of the two-dimensional MNNs subjected to different static loads. Moreover, the intelligent MNNs are trained to execute classical machine learning tasks such as regression to tackle various deformation control tasks. Finally, the disordered MNNs are constructed and trained to demonstrate pre-programmed wave bandgap control ability, illustrating the versatility of the proposed approach as a platform for physical learning. Our approach presents an efficient pathway for the design of intelligent mechanical metamaterials for a wide range of static and dynamic target functionalities, positioning them as powerful engines for physical learning.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing techniques have gone beyond their reputation for rapid prototype production and are increasingly adopted for the manufacture of functional components comprising high-end materials and intricate lattice structures. Silicon nitride, renowned for its exceptional mechanical properties and thermal stability, has emerged as a promising candidate for lightweight structural applications. Nonetheless, its high refractive index and density have limited the fabrication of highly complex structures using extrusion and photopolymerization based techniques. In this work, a highly reactive silicon nitride-based ink with high solid loading is developed for the fabrication of ultra-lightweight, truss-based structures. By employing a robot UV-assisted direct ink writing process, it is possible to control the printing head orientation, thus overcoming the limited curing depth of silicon nitride-based inks. The failure behavior of the sintered lattice beam structures under 4-point bending loading has been modeled by applying a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) based approach to the results of finite element (FE) simulations.},

Material Extrusion (MEX) Additive Manufacturing allows control over microstructural homogeneity, minimizing material waste and enabling the selection of the geometry and size of the parts, key features in the biomedical field. Granule-based MEX has been recently developed and uses a granulated metal-polymer composite as starting material that is extruded to fabricate complex parts. The binder is eliminated and the final part is obtained after sintering. This research aims to investigate the potential of MEX as a promising route for fabricating CoCrMo parts for prosthesis manufacturing. A feedstock based on Paraffin Wax and High-Density Polyethylene as binder, was prepared with optimized solid loading, then screw based MEX printing parameters, in terms of printing temperature and extrusion flow, were explored to maximize density after sintering. The microstructure development was evaluated based on carbon content, shrinkage, density, grain size, and hardness and wear performance of the optimized samples investigated. Almost fully dense parts with a microstructure free of carbides and secondary phases has been developed, which enables an excellent wear response in terms of wear rate and wear coefficient.},

  abstract     = {The simulation and optimization of metamaterial, known for their engineered properties in various applications, encounter intricate challenges due to complex microstructure interactions, extensive design spaces, and substantial computational requirements. To address these challenges, our research introduces a novel data-driven framework utilizing deep generative modeling to enhance the design process of metamaterials. Focusing on composite metamaterial with double negative coefficients of thermal expansion and Poisson&#39;s ratio, we apply an Alternative Active Phase and Objective functions (AAPO) method for deciding the initial metamaterial dataset. To enhance dataset diversity, a distortion filter is applied, broadening the range of design possibilities. Subsequently, we utilize a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), integrated with a regressor, to train on this diversified database. This training effectively maps complex unit cell geometries to a coherent latent space, simultaneously correlating them with continuous material properties. Our approach demonstrates robustness in multi-phase and multi-physics optimization as well as efficiency in generating specialized databases of unit cells. This framework is pivotal in systematically designing unit cells and multiscale systems, specifically aiming for distinct thermo-mechanical behavior targets. To mitigate the computational demands encountered during multiple design meta-materials via gradient-based topology optimization, we have integrated high-performance methods and automatic differentiation. This integration marks a significant advancement in the data-driven design of metamaterials, offering substantial practical and theoretical benefits in the field.},

In this study, we fabricated a MXene (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) composite PTI (TPTI) scaffold and evaluated its characterization. We co-cultured the scaffolds with rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to access the biocompatibility and osteogenic potential of the TPTI scaffold under on-demand near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. Then TPTI scaffold was implanted in a femoral condyle defect model to evaluate the osteogenic properties by micro-computed tomography, histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The results of experiments reveal that MPTI scaffold has appropriate spatial structure, suitable mechanical strength, and superior photothermal properties. It can maintain the temperature at 42.0 ± 0.5 °C and promote the release of ICT from scaffold under 0.85 W cm −2 NIR irradiation. Furthermore, the scaffold is biocompatible and could promote cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and biomineralization in vitro , as well as the repair of bone defects in vivo , and its effect is further enhanced under NIR irradiation. In conclusion, the MPTI scaffold has the potential to be applied in bone defects repairing, and its osteogenic property can be promoted under NIR irradiation through mild photothermal therapy.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies are at the forefront of technological development in machine design as they allow the production of complex parts with high stiffness-to-weight ratios, such as lattice structures, that conventional production processes cannot manufacture. Despite the advantages of AM and lattice structures, their potential is currently limited by concerns related to their fatigue strength due to process-related intrinsic defects. Considering that fatigue is a leading cause of mechanical failures that require costly maintenance, the interest in understanding the fatigue strength of AMed lattice structures is evident. This work explores the applicability of the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for predicting the fatigue limit of lattice structures, building on the positive results obtained for AMed fully-dense materials. It includes a literature review of the experimental fatigue analysis of lattice structures, highlighting the experimental evidence of the fundamental role of AM defects and notches on the fatigue strength of AMed lattice structures. The main conclusions are that AMed lattice structures should be considered defective and notched materials, and the fatigue assessment should be performed with LEFM-based approaches. Lastly, this paper validates LEFM-based predictions against 400+ experimental data for AMed materials from the literature, including small-sized specimens and lattice structures.},

The mechanical properties of the designed alloy with the layered (α-Ti and Ti 2 Cu) structure are superior to the other structures, especially with an outstanding compressive yield strength of 1221.9 MPa. Simultaneously, the wear resistance of the heterogeneous structures containing Ti 2 Cu precipitates was significantly improved, with a specific wear rate only half of that of the EBPBF-fabricated Ti6Al4V alloy.

From simulation results, the metal particles melt and flow forward under the action of the laser. Also, the presence of diamond particles can obstruct the normal flow of melted CuSn20 fluid. Increasing the laser power can widen and stabilize the molten pool, however, exacerbate the thermal damage of diamond particles. Specially, the migration and marginalisation of the diamond particles during the formation of molten pool were found by simulation and experimental results. Unavoidably, there are obvious gaps in the interfacial bonding region of diamond and CuSn20 due to the comprehensive reasons of thermal gradient, differences in thermophysical properties of two materials and undergo continuous migration and rotational behavior of diamond particles. These findings have potential value for understanding and optimizing the process of SLM-fabricated metal-bonded diamond tools.},

  abstract     = {Partially aromatic polyamides owing to their excellent thermal stability are widely used in high temperature applications, however, like their aliphatic counterparts, they are readily flammable and more challenging to process. In this work, several organophosphorus flame retardants were synthesized and compounded with partially aromatic polyamide and evaluated for their processability, thermal, and fire behaviour. The compounds containing a commercial flame retardant, Exolit® OP 1230 (EX), and two new flame retardants, namely 1,4-phenylenebis(diphenylphosphine oxide) (MP) and (1,1′-biphenyl]-4,4′-diylbis(diphenylphosphine oxide) (BP), showed self-extinguishing capability (i.e., UL94 V0 class) with 4 wt% phosphorus (P) loading, together with a substantial reduction in the pHRR (up to 47 %), with respect to the pristine PAP. Rheological measurements on extended timescales were used to assess the melt stability of partially aromatic polyamide compounds. The presence of MP and BP in the polymer matrix did not trigger any excessive degradation phenomena such as chain scission, branching, or crosslinking reactions, thus, allowing a stable processability similar to a pristine partially aromatic polyamide sample. Finally, analysis of evolved gases during thermal decomposition revealed that MP and BP mainly exert a flame inhibition effect quite early in the decomposition process.},

Traditional LSP design processes, reliant on manual parameter selection, often result in imprecise control over the stress distribution, necessitating multiple iterations and high costs. This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach, utilizing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, to automate and optimize the design of LSP parameters for nickel-aluminium bronze surfaces. Our findings demonstrate the RF model’s capability to accurately predict and optimize residual stress distributions, achieving compressive stresses up to 472 MPa with a notable reduction in design iterations. The model forecasts both uniform and non-uniform stress patterns, particularly identifying areas susceptible to Residual Stress Holes (RSH) with improved precision. With an Absolute Percentage Error (APE) of only 6.2 %, our approach significantly outperforms traditional ML algorithms, offering a novel method for efficiently designing complex residual stress fields in LSP applications.},

A newly-developed virtual fiber is proposed based on the generalized beam elements, for which the low bending stiffness of the fiber is calibrated by experimental data and decoupled from the high tensile stiffness. The feasibility of the proposed virtual fiber method is demonstrated through a simulation example of three-point bending of 6 k carbon fiber yarn. Influence of modeling parameters including amount of virtual fibers in the yarn and the element length of virtual fibers on the simulations is analyzed. High precision model of 3D needled preform is then generated using the proposed virtual fiber method. Through-thickness and axial compressive deformations of the preform are simulated.

Metallic components with multi-performance and high reliability are always desirable for a broad range of high-end industries. Multi-material additive manufacturing is a promising way to provide multiple performances, yet there exist several persistent challenges on multi-material sustainability and recycling, interfacial defects and strength, dimensional accuracy and fineness, and manufacturing efficiency and cost, prohibiting its widespread practical applications. In this study, we introduce an additive/modification integrated manufacturing (AMIM) strategy for fabricating highly reliable multi-performance metals using only a single material with a one-step process. We demonstrate that, through a unique combination of pattern-induced orientation-consistent and layer-accumulated orientation-amplified mechanisms, the surface wear resistance performance of 316L stainless steels could be expanded to cover an exceptionally wide range from commercially available plastics to metals to ceramics. Furthermore, these strikingly different performances can be digitally programmed and precisely printed to form integrated 316L stainless steel components with excellent interfacial strength and high dimensional accuracy. This strategy paves a facile, inexpensive, and sustainable way to achieve multi-performance metals that are fully recyclable and environmentally friendly, serving as an alternative to the multi-material composite strategy.},

However, a high Mn content inevitably causes the macro-segregation of Mn, which can significantly compromise the mechanical properties. This study effectively prevented the formation of Mn macro-segregation by employing the sub-rapid solidification. It resulted in the distribution of Mn micro-segregation bands within dendritic gaps in Fe-9Mn-2Si-0.5Al-0.1C steel. Mn micro-segregation bands results in a high proportion of pre-existing austenite ( γ pre γpre ) with small size and suitable stability in the as-cast strip, forming a lamellar structure with alternating distribution of lath martensite and austenite on the micrometer scale. The as-cast strip necessitates only basic simple hot rolling control without the need for any tempering treatment to achieve excellent mechanical properties comparable to conventional lengthy processes (ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 1762 MPa, total elongation (TE) of 20 %, and product of strength and elongation (PSE) up to 35 GPa%). Utilizing this structure as a foundation, a simple austenite reverse tempering (ART) treatment can lead to additional enhancements in comprehensive mechanical characteristics with the UTS of 1529 MPa, TE of 25 % and PSE of 38 GPa%.},

  abstract     = {The magnetism-ductility contradictory relationship presents a significant challenge in the development of magnetic alloys. The impact of the BCC-B2 transition, along with Mn site occupancy, on magnetism and ductility have been investigated by using first-principles calculations. The calculations involved the evaluation of magnetic moments, density of states (DOS), phase stability and ductility of FeCoMn alloys. The results of binary alloys confirm the enhancement of magnetism due to the BCC-B2 transition. Furthermore, the ordering phase transition can strengthen the magnetic interaction between Fe and Mn atoms, which is associated with minimal variations in the density of states of Fe and Mn in the B2 structure. Regarding the ductility of FeCoMn alloys, two factors contribute to increased brittleness. Firstly, the increased covalent component in bonding, as a result of the strong hybridization between different elements, leads to an increased brittleness. Secondly, the increased Peierls stress provides a larger resistance to dislocation motion, which also contributes to the increased brittleness. Finally, the Pearson correlation coefficients and data analysis indicate that VEC, spin polarizations and Mn content provide major contributions to the contradictory relationship between magnetism and ductility.},

Nevertheless, a methodical analysis of fundamental principles, development process, and application scope has yet to be reported since RAB was proposed in 2000. Although various braze systems have been developed, a comprehensive comparison and classification are still absent, making it difficult to guide the selection of RAB braze. Besides, this technique faces several intractable issues, such as excessive interfacial reactions, large thermal mismatch, etc., seriously restricting the RAB application. Hence this review elucidates the basic information, braze systems, existing issues, and corresponding solutions of RAB. The joining mechanism, development history, and application fields are explicitly introduced. Reported braze systems are analyzed in-depth and divided into three categories according to reactivity. Further, we outline four issues of RAB: excessive interfacial reaction, excessive thermal expansion coefficient of braze, limited aging performance, and high-temperature softening of braze, and discuss the corresponding solutions. Finally, our review proposed several potential improvements and possible future research trends in the RAB technique, aiming to guide the future development of RAB and offer new insights to broaden its application range.},

Degenerative changes, injuries, infections, and tumor resections causing defects in musculoskeletal tissues such as cartilage, bones, skeletal muscles, menisci, ligaments, and rotator cuffs can detrimentally affect patients’ quality of life and mental well-being. Traditional autologous and allogeneic transplantations have been clinically employed. However, autologous transplantation suffers from the limitation of a finite number of transplantable tissues, while allogeneic transplantation faces challenges such as immune rejection. The extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a natural scaffold for cells to fulfill physiological functions such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) emerges as a promising biomaterial generated through specific tissue or organ decellularization. Leveraging 3D bioprinting technology, dECM-based biomaterials enable customized printing and construction. This study reviews various decellularization techniques, post-decellularization strategies, and commonly used 3D bioprinting technologies. It summarizes the integration of dECM-based biomaterials with 3D bioprinting technology applied in musculoskeletal system research.

These images were characterized by entropy values, and assessed by simulated visual saliency (ITTI model) and subjective questionnaires. Finally, we discussed how different color quantities and schemes affect complexity and visual saliency of wood figures. The results indicate that changes in color attributes significantly impact the visual perception of wood figures. When the number of replacement colors is four, both the change rate in image complexity and the mean visual saliency are at their highest, at 24% and 0.335 respectively. Among the colors red, yellow, and green, red tends to influence the intensity of visual saliency more, the subjective complexity of green is higher. In addition, we found that more complex figures are less affected by changes in color attributes, and people can also distinguish the degree of difference between figure types well.},

Inductive electrical conductivity measurement is safe, inexpensive, and capable of acquiring valuable information about precipitation and dissolution processes. However, commercial eddy current sensors work only at low temperatures near room temperature and are thus not suitable for in situ conductometry during heat treatments of Al alloys. We designed a high-temperature eddy current sensor and performed in situ conductometry during the homogenization of six Al-Mg-Si wrought alloys, three of which are experimental recycling-friendly alloys with increased Fe content. The results are interpreted with regard to microstructural investigations, and the advantages and limitations of our approach are discussed. As a proof-of-concept, we show how the conductivity curves and extrusion process parameters can be combined to predict final extrudate grain structures using machine learning. To achieve this, we employed finite element simulation of extrusion coupled with microstructural simulation over a wide parameter range, validated by extrusion experiments and metallography, and trained a feedforward neural network. We believe our interdisciplinary approach can lead to improvements in the industrial processing of Al wrought alloys.},

Similar to other sub-fold Miura foldcores, stable plastic hinge lines were generated at sub-fold sites under the guidance of the sub-folds and transformed into traveling hinge lines or stationary hinge lines in the subsequent crushing process. Therefore, in comparison to the conventional foldcore, the dual-sub-fold Miura foldcore exhibited a higher average crushing force with an improvement of 60.8 % in the optimum case. The dual-sub-fold Miura foldcore exhibited relatively lower stiffness at the sub-fold sites, effectively reducing the initial peak crushing force. This reduction in peak crushing force reached a maximum decrease of 70 %. Moreover, this dual-sub-fold foldcore was glued to two parallel rigid plates (top and bottom), making it more suitable for engineering applications. The parametric study indicated that the dual-sub-fold Miura foldcore exhibited predictable and stable deformation modes. It was found that the average crushing force could be effectively enhanced by reducing the core folding angle, elevating the sub-fold position, decreasing the sub-fold size, and elongating the foldcore. The theoretical model for predicting the energy absorption performance of the foldcore was also established.},

To that end, a combined simulation and experimental investigation on composite laminate under repeated indentations is reported. The repeated indentations consist of seven identical peak-force indentations that are separately applied to the centre of the laminate. The results show that delaminations grow in all seven indentations, which can be interpreted as a continuous degradation of the effective delamination growth threshold with each subsequent indentation. More specifically, the second indentation effective delamination growth threshold is 62.4 MPa, which is about 19 % lower compared to the first one (77.2 MPa). Subsequently, the delamination growth threshold degraded approximately linearly with indentation. This effective delamination growth threshold reduction can be associated with the occurrence and evolution of the crack-rich zone preceding the delamination front.},

  abstract     = {Fine sulfides can promote the refinement of microstructure and improve the strength and toughness of materials. The interface properties between sulfides and steel matrix are associated with this phenomenon. The first principles calculation combined with two-dimensional lattice mismatch and two-step nucleation theory is adopted to calculate the interface properties of TiS/bcc-Fe, TiS/fcc-Fe and TiS/MnS at the atomic level. The results show that TiS has a weak ability to promote the transition of austenite to intragranular ferrite (IGF) due to the low adhesion work value. And TiS needs to overcome energy barriers to induce the formation of IGF because the higher interface energy of TiS/bcc-Fe than TiS/fcc-Fe. The heterogeneous nucleation ability of TiS(0 0 1)/MnS(1 1 1) is stronger than that of TiS(0 0 1)/MnS(1 1 0), indicating that TiS is beneficial for improving the deformation performance of MnS without affecting the ability of MnS (1 1 0) surface to induce IGF nucleation for grain refinement. Based on the two-step nucleation theory, the structures and properties of TiS clusters are analyzed. The formation pathway of TiS/Fe interface can be described as: Ti atom + S atom + Fe atom → core (TiS n )–shell (fcc-Fe(1 1 1)) → core (TiS(0 0 1))–shell (fcc-Fe(1 1 0) + bcc-Fe(1 0 0)).},

  abstract     = {The corrosion performance of martensitic steel remains a matter of dispute, with no consensus on whether it exhibits heightened or diminished corrosion resistance. In this study, the corrosion behavior and mechanism of martensitic steel were systematically investigated by simulating a cargo oil tank environment. The results indicate that under strong acidic conditions, the corrosion rate of martensite (1.1404 mm/y) is significantly higher than that of ferrite-pearlite (0.7430 mm/y) due to its increased dislocation density and internal stress. Additionally, the presence of high-energy defects provides abundant active sites for the redeposition of Cu-bearing particles, while their uneven distribution further exacerbates corrosion. Therefore, we propose a competitive mechanism that governs the corrosion behavior of martensite, complementing the understanding of its behavior and mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Integrating additive manufacturing (AM) into polymer extrusion offers process chain flexibility and design freedom. It reduces the need for time-consuming iterations and trial-and-error in the die design process. Consequently, polymer AM of extrusion (i.e., soft tooling) allows for a shorter product development cycle and cost-effectiveness for small-scale production and highly customized products. In this study, carbon fibre (CF)-polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) dies were manufactured using the fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM process, employing a streamlined die design achieved through freeform transition planes. Calibration slides were produced using masked stereolithography (MSLA), FFF, and conventional manufacturing techniques (i.e., machining) to preserve the final product’s cross-section during the cooling process. The dimensional and surface characteristics of these calibration slides were evaluated to assess the dimensional accuracy and surface topography of various materials and manufacturing processes. The dimensional evaluation reveals that MSLA-printed parts exhibit deviation from the nominal dimension closer to the conventionally manufactured part. The integrated soft tooling in the polymer extrusion line was tested with polypropylene (PP) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as extruded materials. The surface topography of the CF-PEEK die displays distinctive ripple features resulting from the FFF process, identified by relatively flat peaks and deep valleys. The overall surface texture parameter values of CF-PEEK were higher due to the presence of deep valleys. Considering that the areas around the peaks interacted more with polymer molecules during the extrusion, the surface texture parameters of the extrudates were closer to the value observed in 90 µm region areas around the peaks. Notably, extrudates of AM calibration slides have lower surface texture parameters than extrudates of conventionally manufactured calibration slides, even though surface defects in the form of dimple sink marks were observed in extruded material of PP from extrudates using AM calibration slides.},

  abstract     = {This work introduced a facile method for fabricating heterostructures in a medium Mn steel via a direct warm rolling process. The heavy warm rolling promoted the transformation of metastable austenite (∼12.2 vol%) into hard domain α’ martensite, which formed a heterogeneous microstructure with the untransformed γ (soft domain). After 600 °C re-annealing, the hard domain α’ re-reversed to α + γ, and the heterostructure disappeared. Compared to the homogeneous structure, the heterostructure exhibited the synergistic enhancement of strength-ductility (yield strength (YS): 782 → 1113 MPa; ultimate tensile strength (UTS): 1099 → 1304 MPa; total elongation (TEL): 20.8 % → 21.7 %). Quantitative analysis showed that the heterogeneous deformation induced (HDI) strengthening (∼261 MPa) was the primary contributor to the increased ΔYS (782 → 1113 MPa) value, rather than the traditional strengthening mechanisms. Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) effect were the main deformation mechanisms of both homogeneous/heterogeneous structures. However, compared to the homogeneous microstructure, the heterogeneous structure possessed the more pronounced TRIP and HDI hardening effects as well as L-C locks, the cooperative effect of these three factors further improved the strain hardening ability to break through the strength-ductility trade-off dilemma.},

  abstract     = {The repeated melting and solidification cycles in the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process lead to significant thermal gradients, resulting in notable distortion in the as-built part. Distortion compensation methods, which pre-deform the part design so the as-built shape aligns with the target, have been widely adopted to mitigate this issue. This research introduces a data-driven distortion compensation framework for the L-PBF process. It employs an experimentally-calibrated inherent strain method to generate a dataset and utilizes Gaussian process regression to create the compensated geometry. Experimental validation shows that the proposed method can reduce the maximum distortion by up to 82.5% for a lattice structure and 77.8% for a canonical part. Furthermore, the compensation results reveal that (1) the lumped layer thickness in finite element models has little impact on simulated distortion reduction but can notably affect the experimental reduction; (2) discrepancies between simulated and experimental compensation performance are largely attributed to the curvy surfaces with sharp transitions in trial and compensated shapes, a result of pre-deforming the design; (3) the number of trial geometries considerably affects the effectiveness of compensation, while the number of deformation states does not have a statistically significant impact.},

A significant increase in the yield and ultimate compressive strengths with rising strain rates up to 3.0 × 10 3 s −1 was observed and attributed to enhanced dislocation activities and stress-induced microstructural transformations. The formation of the B2 phase and Zr 5 Al 3 precipitates was found to be crucial in bolstering the alloy strength at high strain rates. Beyond strain rates of 3.0 × 10 3 s −1 , a decrease in strength occurred due to thermal softening and strain localization. Microstructural analyses at 3.5 × 10 3 s −1 revealed grain refinement, the development of micro shear bands, and dislocation tangles, which were indicative of dynamic recrystallization. Besides, the findings also revealed that the post-dynamic compression heat treatment further enhanced the hardness and microstructural stability of the alloy. These results highlight the potential of the (TiNbZr) 89 (AlTa) 11 RHEA for applications requiring materials with high strength-to-weight ratios, particularly in dynamically loaded environments. It is expected that the results of this study will further advance our fundamental understanding of the behavior of RHEAs under extreme conditions, thereby opening new avenues for material innovation.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art Ni/Ti supermirror neutron optics have limited reflected intensity and a restricted neutron energy range due to the interface width. Incorporating low-neutron-absorbing 11 B 4 C enhances reflectivity and allows for thinner layers to be deposited, with which more efficient supermirrors with higher m-values can be realized. However, incorporating 11 B 4 C reduces the optical contrast, limiting the attainable reflectivity at low scattering vectors, making this approach infeasible. This study explores various approaches to optimize the material design of 11 B 4 C-containing Ni/Ti supermirrors to maintain high reflectivity at low scattering vectors and achieve low interface widths at large scattering vectors. The scattering length density contrast versus interface width is investigated for multilayer periods of 30 Å, 48 Å, and 84 Å, for designs involving pure Ni/Ti multilayers, multilayers with 11 B 4 C co-deposited in Ni and Ti layers, multilayers with 11 B 4 C co-deposited only in Ni layers, and multilayers with 11 B 4 C as thin interlayers between Ni and Ti layers. Our results suggest that a depth-graded hybrid material design by incorporating 11 B 4 C inside the Ni and Ti layers, below approximately 26 Å, and introducing 1.5 Å 11 B 4 C interlayers between the thicker Ni and Ti layers can achieve a higher reflectivity than state-of-the-art Ni/Ti multilayers over the entire scattering vector range.},

A multi-scale characterization starting from macro-scale optical micrography, micro-scale X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction mapping to nano-scale transmission electron microscopy was adopted to fully comprehend the microstructural heterogeneity along the build direction. Notably, the top layers of the build demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties, exhibiting hardness of around 550 HV and an ultimate tensile strength of 2 GPa, which decreased progressively towards the base. Interestingly, resurgence in strength and hardness was observed for the layers located 10 mm above the substrate. The primary solidification cycle led to the formation of untempered martensite having high strength and hardness while subsequent reheat cycles led to the alteration of these martensites, enhancing ductility at the expense of strength. Auto-tempering and carbide (Fe-C based) precipitation due to prolonged thermal exposure contributed to the increased the strength in the lower layers. Additionally, the temperature profiles during the L-DED thermal cycles were modeled and correlated with the observed phase transformations, allowing for a detailed understanding of the structure–property relationships at different heights within the build.

  abstract     = {At present, titanium alloy/carbon fiber reinforced polymer (TA1/CFRP) laminates, representing the latest fourth generation of fiber metal laminates (FMLs), are predominantly applied in the field of aerospace. The miniaturization of traditional FMLs in thickness or plane size to the micron level for the study of structural properties of ultra-thin laminates will further expand the application of FMLs in the field of micro-devices. Given that carbon nanotubes have a strengthening mechanism in polymers. However, most existing studies have focused on the effect of carbon nanotubes on the properties of macro-scale FMLs, while the enhancement mechanism of the interfacial and mechanical properties of ultra-thin micro-scale FMLs has not been studied, leaving the mechanism still unclear. Based on this, this paper explores the interfacial deformation mode, damage fracture and performance enhancement mechanism of the ultra-thin TA1/CFRP laminates by comparing the parameters of tensile strength and elongation under quasi-static conditions and different process parameters of multi-walled carbon nanotubes content, test temperature, geometry size and grain size. Meanwhile, the correlation law between high-speed tension and quasi-static tension is determined, a 29.3 % increase in tensile strength as the strain rate rises from 0.001 s −1 to 100 s −1 , yielding the basic deformation law of ultra-thin FMLs.},

Then, alloy compositions and descriptors were used as input variables of the model to improve its robustness and applicability due to the richness of information. Four distinct alloys were discovered by employing Bayesian optimization within the framework of a quaternary alloy system. The best alloy demonstrated an exceptional high-temperature strength of 175 MPa at 300 °C in the absence of heat treatment. Microstructural analyses of these alloys indicated the critical role of vanadium-rich intermetallics in enhancing the high-temperature strength of aluminum alloys. Furthermore, the output of the model was explained using the SHapley Additive exPlanations method.

Certain moulds require inserts with high aspect ratio (&gt;3) where using traditional tool steel, with low thermal conductivity, is insufficient for cooling. This necessitates the manual addition of high thermal conductivity pins, such as copper. Recent advances in selective powder deposition enable the fabrication of multi-material components with multi-material interface perpendicular to the build plate (vertical interface). This work investigates, for the first time, the manufacturability of tool steel and CuCrZr multi-material components with vertical interfaces. EDS and EBSD across multiple vertical interfaces revealed that metallurgically sound interfaces were obtained with porosity along the intermixed zone, attributed to using one set of parameters per material, without correction. Anisotropy in the intermixing zone was observed along the recoating direction (1.5 mm) compared to the other direction (0.5 mm), leading to increased porosity.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach, namely Variable-Periodic Voronoi Tessellation (VPVT), for the bio-inspired design of porous structures. The method utilizes distributed points defined by a variable-periodic function to generate Voronoi tessellation patterns, aligning with a wide diversity of artificial or natural cellular structures. In this VPVT design method, the truss-based architecture can be fully characterized by design variables, such as frequency factors, thickness factors. This approach enables the optimal design of porous structures for both mechanical performance and functionality. The varied, anisotropic cell shapes and sizes of VPVT porous structures provide significantly greater design flexibility compared to typical isotropic porous structures. In addition, the VPVT method not only can design micro-macro multiscale materials, but is also applicable for the design of meso-macro scale truss-based porous structures, such as architecture constructions, biomedical implants, and aircraft frameworks. This work employs a Surrogate-assisted Differential Evolution (SaDE) method to perform the optimization process. Numerical examples and experiments validate that the proposed design achieves about 51.1% and 47.8% improvement in compliance performance and damage strength, respectively, than existing studies.},

  abstract     = {Osteoporotic bone defect repair is one of the challenges in orthopedics because there are no preferable biomaterials to readily initiate new bone regeneration in critical-size pathological bone damage. Our previous studies revealed that core–shell Ca-phosphate/silicate microspheres can tune time-evolving biodegradation, which is beneficial for modulating bone repair. Herein, we expanded this strategy to develop core–shell-type 5 % Sr- and 8 % Zn-doped wollastonite fiber-derived granules with different porosities (0 %, 10 %, 20 %) in the shell layer. Physicochemical analyses indicated that granules with higher porosity in the shell layer exhibited more appreciable Sr and Zn ion release and biodissolution in vitro . Osteoporotic femoral bony defects in rabbits were used to verify the osteogenic efficacy of the core–shell granules. The granules with 10 % porosity could initiate more osteogenesis within 6 weeks, and the new bone tissue could grow into the defect region, while the new bone tissue only migrated into the periphery pores under the other granule conditions. Histological evaluation also revealed appreciable new bone ingrowth in the granules with 10 % porosity, whereas the other implant groups had limited new bone tissue. These findings demonstrate that bone repair initiation can be enhanced by finely designed local porosity in specific components of core–shell bioceramic fiber-tailoring granules to control bioactive ion release and osteo-stimulation in vivo ; moreover, such bioceramic fabrication is promising for developing osteo-stimulative implants to resolve clinically challenging bone defect repair.},

  abstract     = {Designing lead-free piezoelectric ceramics with tailored electrical properties remains a critical challenge for various applications. In this paper we present a novel methodology integrating Machine Learning (ML) and optimization procedures to fine-tune electrical properties in lead-free (1-x) Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO 3 - x CaTiO 3 piezoelectric ceramics. A comprehensive dataset of dielectric measurements serves as the foundation for training ML models that accurately predict the permittivity ( ε ′ ε′ ) and dielectric loss (tan δ ) as functions of Ca 2+ concentration (x % Ca), temperature and frequency. Two ML techniques are evaluated: random forest regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network Regression (MLPR). The MLPR model exhibited a superior regression performance, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.931 and a root mean squared error of 0.029. The MLPR was then optimized by the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to maximizes ε ′ ε′ while minimizes tan δ . Within the NSGA-II framework, the optimal values were found at the Pareto curve knee, corresponding to a frequency, temperature, and x % Ca of 609.739 kHz, 398.15 K, and 6.10, respectively, resulting in ε ′ ε′ equal to 857.87 and tan δ equal to 0.0120. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining ML and optimization for designing the electrical properties of piezoelectric ceramics, paving the way for more efficient and targeted material development.},

Herein, polyurethane microcapsules encapsulating liquid water (W-PUMCs) were prepared by inverse emulsion polymerization, then mixed with Cr 2 O 3 in specific proportions into the epoxy resin matrix to obtain a material capable of simulating the reflection spectra of green leaves in the visible and near-infrared bands. The normalized similarity (NS) between the spectrum of this material and that of plant (cherry) green leaf can reach 0.9779 in the range of 400–2500 nm. W-PUMCs are used to simulate the spectral characteristics caused by water in the leaves because the spectral NS between W-PUMCs and the green leaf in the 1100–2200 nm range is 0.9930. Cr 2 O 3 is employed to simulate the other major spectral features of green leaves. This strategy guarantees simulation accuracy while simplifying the preparation process and reducing production costs and providing solutions to spectral simulation in the fields of military stealth and ecological protection.},

In this study, a design methodology for dissimilar welding is suggested. The Miedema model and Toop model are developed to calculate the thermodynamics of quaternary alloy systems (Mg-Fe-Al-Cu). Finite element modelling (FEM) of temperature fields and the calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) are combined to provide prerequisite information for modelling. As a test subject, laser welded lap configuration joints of AZ31B magnesium alloy and DP590 steel with a copper coating were put into the design scheme. The interfacial elemental diffusion and formation of intermetallics (IMCs) along the interface during the welding process are predicted. This simulation design scheme predicts the interfacial reaction kinetics and identifies whether the intermediate element works or not. The effects of the Cu coating thickness on the weld constitution, interfacial microstructures and mechanical properties were studied. Cu coating promotes the weld formation fostering the metallurgical reaction of the fusion zone (FZ) with the steel brazing interface. The mechanism of interfacial reactions during the welding-brazing process has been clarified. The Vickers hardness distribution across the interface shows that the Cu-IMCs are ductile.},

However, strain heterogeneity complicates their deformation mechanisms and fracture modes. In this study, we fabricated a series of gradient porous NiTi alloys based on gyroid (G), diamond (D), and I-WP (I) unit cells, with porosities ranging from 50% to 70%. Surprisingly, the I structure exhibited an abnormally high compressive strength of nearly 600 MPa at around 50% porosity, more than twice that of the G and D structures. This performance gap was attributed to the activation of mixed deformation mechanisms and distinct fracture modes. While the G structure showed a uniform radial strain distribution, the D and I structures displayed pronounced radial strain gradients with concentrated central strains. The D structure deformed through relative sliding of oblique struts, while the I structure maintained macrostructural stability, with thick edge struts providing continuous strain hardening until monolithic fracture. This unique deformation behavior results from the synergistic effects of its intrinsic macrostructural stability, significant radial strain gradients, and sufficiently thicker edge struts. The integration of metallurgical and architectural design principles represents a novel approach to tailoring the mechanical properties of gradient porous metals for advanced applications.},

Therefore, there is a need to provide patients with a promising cartilage defect repair strategy. In this study, we have reported an icariin-loaded PVA based biocompatible hydrogel scaffold for cartilage defect repair. The PTGH+Icariin hydrogel was prepared by a simple physical cross-linking method and consisted of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), tannic acid (TA), gelatin (Gel), hyaluronic acid (HA) and icariin. Inspired by the natural cartilage matrix compositions, the Gel and HA were used to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of hydrogel. Furthermore, icariin was introduced to further enhance the hydrogel’s ability for cartilage regeneration. The results showed that PTGH+icariin hydrogel exhibited porous microstructures and tough mechanical properties. In vitro cell experiments confirmed PTGH+Icariin hydrogels could promote chondrocytes proliferation, chondrocytes spreading and chondrocytes migration. Meanwhile, the PTGH+Icariin hydrogel demonstrated the ability to promote the cartilage regeneration in a rat cartilage defect model. In particular, the implantation of PTGH+Icariin hydrogel could facilitate the restoration of motor function in rats.

The transition from the shell to the 15–30 mm thick head was done by variating wall thickness, enabled by additive manufacturing. After additive manufacturing, the full-scale component was tested up to the maximum internal water pressure of 111 bar (defined per the vessel’s industrial application). Further, to evaluate the mechanical properties of the additively manufactured steel and the effects of pressure loads on it, quasi-static tensile and fatigue tests were conducted on coupons prepared from the material in two conditions: as-built (without any preload) and preloaded (after the pressure test) extracted from various sections. Finally, metallurgical characterization was performed to establish a correlation between the microstructural features and the mechanical performance.

Despite the increased utilisation of various metamaterials there remains limited understanding of how to optimise laser process specifically for these geometries. Selective laser melting (SLM) of representative single struts is focused on this study from the perspective of surface properties, mechanical performance, and in-vitro biological response. Specifically, the influence of laser power (100 – 200 W) and speed (2250 – 900 mm/s) and struts angle (20–90° ) ) for a 250 μ μ m strut diameter was explored. Struts built below 45° to the substrate using optimal laser parameters (150 W and 1125 mm/s) were found to exhibit a surface topography that facilitated the highest level of cell adhesion (84.3 cells/mm 2 ) after 24 hrs (p ≤ ≤ 0.001). To support this finding, a novel image analysis method was developed to characterise the average roughness across the complete strut profile. An opposite trend was observed for mechanical strength with struts built at above 45° without failure. These findings were brought together in a parameter design map was to guide stakeholders in producing customised biomedical devices, enabling control of key physiochemical properties with the aim of maximising osseointegration.},

In this work, the microstructure and microhardness evolution of a metastable β-type Ti-30Zr-10Nb alloy under hydrostatic pressure (≤10 GPa) were investigated and compared with those under uniaxial pressure (≤1106 MPa). The results revealed that under hydrostatic pressure, Ti-30Zr-10Nb alloy formed a peculiar hierarchical microstructure composed of submicron-scaled α” plates with self-accommodating morphologies, nanoscale ω particles, and microscale shear bands containing nanoscale α” domains. The formation of a hierarchical microstructure effectively coordinates not only the isotropic macroscopic strains but also the local shear stresses under hydrostatic pressure. Compared to uniaxial pressure, the hydrostatic pressure facilitates the β to ω transformation, but hinders the β to α” transformation. The microhardness of the Ti3010 alloy reaches approximately 319 HV at a hydrostatic pressure of 10 GPa, which is 28 % higher than the highest microhardness obtained under uniaxial pressure. The current results highlight the promising potential of hydrostatic pressure in optimizing the mechanical properties of metastable β-Ti alloys.},

  abstract     = {Copper foils demonstrate a tendency for self-annealing, which adversely impacts the stability of the products. The self-annealing induced recrystallization of copper foil is closely related to the grain growth mode. When copper foil grows in equiaxed grain mode, resulting in a decrease in tensile strength from 780 MPa to 330 MPa. Conversely, the columnar grain copper foil exhibits excellent room-temperature stability in mechanical properties. The mechanism of copper foil room temperature self-annealing behavior was put forward. It was found that the internal stress generated in the process of preparing copper foils is the key factor driving the recrystallization of equiaxed grains. This internal stress originates from nanocrystals and high-density dislocations, with the latter arising from the doping of organic elements. The initial high stress values and the plasticity of dislocations contributed to a noteworthy decrease in residual stress. As dislocation plasticity ensues, the anchoring of interstitial atoms gives rise to dislocation loops. The interaction between dislocation loops and coincident twin boundaries induces the formation of twin steps. The quantity of twins of equiaxed copper foil increases greatly after self-annealing. Conversely, the initial dislocation density of columnar grain copper foil is an order of magnitude lower than that of equiaxed grains.},

  abstract     = {Residual stress is the main hindrance to achieve a robust ceramic/metal brazed joint. In this study, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) particles was fabricated into solid-state transformation composite filler, which was proposed as a new strategy to strengthen Ti 3 SiC 2 /Cu brazed joint. After detailed characterization conducted on YSZ particles and brazed joint, the abnormal expansion properties of YSZ and its strengthening brazed joint mechanism were clarified. The content of Y 2 O 3 in YSZ had significant effects on the phase transformation of ZrO 2 from tetragonal to monoclinic. When 3 mol.% Y 2 O 3 was added, the maximum phase transformation occurred at about 500 ◦ C, half of brazing temperature, during the cooling process. The phase transformation of ZrO 2 effectively released residual stress in the joint, which was induced by both temperature changes and residual stress. The abnormal volume expansion during phase transformation decreased the thermal mismatch of brazed joint further to strengthen brazed joint.},

Hence, in situ fracture experiments are frequently performed at the micron to sub-micron scale. To evaluate fracture process of these experiments, knowledge of the crack length or the crack tip opening displacement is required. Acquired in situ frames provide a direct measurement of the crack length, crack tip opening displacement and -angle. An algorithm was developed to extract these parameters from the in situ frame sequences automatically. To verify the performance of the algorithm, fracture characteristics were measured manually for several frames of the available in situ experiments. The fracture behavior of these samples ranged from brittle over semi-brittle to ductile. The comparison between algorithmic results and manual measurements demonstrated the applicability of the algorithm to different fracture behaviors. Additionally, the fracture characteristics determined by the algorithm are in accordance with the fracture toughness data reported in literature. The crack tip opening displacement measurement gives thorough insight into the plastic deformation during fracture. The automatic extraction of the fracture characteristics allows a more detailed analysis of small-scale fracture processes and enables a reproducible, continuous evaluation of the fracture characteristics of all frames.},

The detailed investigations show that the grain boundary oxidation promoted by the different deformation modes between neighboring grains, despite the reduced oxygen-related damage in the coarser LPBF HX microstructures, are the potential causes for the inter-granular fatigue crack initiation and the subsequent crack coalescence. In the meantime, the crack propagation could be hindered by the refined carbides and annealing twins with Σ3 misorientation (60°/〈1 1 1〉) in LPBF HX. Furthermore, the recrystallized grains formed ahead of the crack tip due to the severe deformation within the plastic zone and high testing temperature have different crystallographic orientations, which leads to the crack propagation path changes and increases the fatigue crack propagation resistance.},

Nanotechnology development is closely linked to fabricating and characterizing structures below 100 nm, driven by technological advancements enabling their in-depth analysis. Up to now, several top-down and bottom-up nanofabrication approaches have been developed to realize a plethora of nanostructures. Although effective, these methods have many drawbacks like high costs and limitations in feature size. In this scenario, Scanning Probe-based Lithography (SPL) emerges as a very promising alternative to conventional nanofabrication techniques, overcoming their main method limitations with versatility, flexibility, low cost, and nanoscale resolution. This review focuses on mechanical Scanning Probe-based Lithography (m-SPL), tracing its evolution from inception to recent advances. Different m-SPL methods, such as Nanoindentation, Static and Dynamic Plowing lithography, Nanomilling, and their variants are discussed in-depth, emphasizing their advantages and drawbacks, and highlighting their application. Moreover, this review explores the effects of combining m-SPL with other energy sources, such as heat and electric energy, and outlines future perspectives in the field. Overall, m-SPL stands out as a promising avenue in nanofabrication, offering sub-nanometer resolution and diverse material manipulation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The development of 3D-printed calcium phosphate bone grafts represents a breakthrough for personalized bone tissue engineering. However, their high brittleness is a limiting factor for clinical applications. The present work aims to overcome this drawback by developing a composite ink for direct ink writing using a polycaprolactone solution (20 wt% in pyridine) as binder for a self-hardening α-tricalcium phosphate powder. The ink consolidation results from a two-step process. First, evaporation of the solvent gives rise to a flexible green body, in which the polymer matrix retains the loose ceramic particles. Subsequently, upon contact with water, the hydrolysis of these particles creates a continuous network of biomimetic hydroxyapatite nanocrystals, with the consequent hardening of the ink. The presence of the polymer improves the mechanical properties, increasing the flexural strength from 2 to 4 MPa and the strain energy density from 0.2 to 1.1 kJ/m 3 . Unlike the inks based on hydrogel binders, where the hardening reaction starts as soon as the liquid and solid components are mixed, the ink prepared with the non-aqueous binder is stable, with over 5 months shelf life, and allows the hardening reaction to be triggered at will by contact with water.},

To build up BnM- and LbL-structure materials such as nanoclays, sodium water glass, and polymer dispersions were selected since they are well-established low-cost materials in building. Nanoclays were analyzed regarding their size, dispersibility and exfoliation. Montmorillonite (MMT) was used to be mixed with polymers to produce self-assembled BnM-structured films and coatings. Also, LbL-structures were formed by alternating layers of sodium water glass and polymer. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to verify the morphology. The MMT-containing coatings demonstrated enhanced nucleation potential when exposed to cementitious eluate. Micromechanical pull-out tests on single carbon fibers with BnM- and LbL-coatings embedded in concrete demonstrate the potential to increase composite toughness. The successful implementation of the bio-inspired structures using affordable materials lays the groundwork for their scalability and integration into composite structures for building.},

The fabric incorporates an internal conductive network constructed with silver nanowires (AgNWs) and polydopamine (PDA) coating on its outer surface. This innovative textile successfully strikes a balance between strain sensing and electromagnetic interference shielding while concurrently exhibiting biocompatibility and antimicrobial properties. Significantly, acknowledging the susceptibility of measurements from polymer-based strain sensor materials to time drift, we introduce both a modeling approach and a novel calibration technique. This advancement facilitates the generation of stable cyclic sensing signals, even under substantial deformations of up to 80 % at a high stretching speed. Importantly, it provides a practical solution for addressing signal drift observed in flexible sensors when utilized in environments characterized by long-term and large deformations.},

To optimise future materials, understanding the microstructure is critically important. Here, we present two novel approaches based on artificial intelligence that allow the segmentation of the phases of a microstructure for which simple numerical approaches, such as thresholding, are not applicable: One is based on the nnU-Net neural network, and the other on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Using scanning electron microscopy images collected from large areas (∼1 mm 2 ) of dual-phase steels as a case study, we demonstrate how both methods effectively segment intricate microstructural details, including martensite, ferrite, and damage sites, for subsequent analysis. Either method shows substantial generalizability across a range of image sizes and conditions, including heat-treated microstructures with different phase configurations. The nnU-Net excels in mapping large image areas. Conversely, the GAN-based method performs reliably on smaller images, providing greater step-by-step control and flexibility over the segmentation process. This study highlights the benefits of segmented microstructural data for various purposes, such as calculating phase fractions, modelling material behaviour through finite element simulation, and conducting geometrical analyses of damage sites and the local properties of their surrounding microstructure.},

The results show that the unique in-process heat treatment during WAAM, offers the possibility to modify the nanochemistry of nanoprecipitates and improve the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys in the peak aged state without sacrificing mechanical performance. Density functional theory shows that the WAAM process transforms the interfaces between matrix and precipitate into a strong hydrogen trap, which can reduce the hydrogen content of grain boundaries and suppress hydrogen-induced intergranular fracture.},

Moreover, the easy-to-use airhole method further ensures stable and long-term contact with the skin for recording.

As a particular example, it is known that the reaction force of a typical negative-stiffness honeycomb (NSH) metastructure under compression will not monotonically increase with displacement, but manifests successive local extremums. This makes it an attractive choice as a concept for energy-absorbing applications, especially for recurrent low-velocity collision scenarios. Here, we analytically derive the equations of the piecewise-defined force–displacement functions for the general case of an NSH two-dimensional lattice metastructure followed by finding the optimal geometric design parameters. Using analytical methods, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental upper limit of 5/6 to the energy absorption efficiency of such metastructures. The obtained theoretical results are validated by finite-element numerical simulations and experimental compression tests. The findings of this study enable designers to identify optimal geometries of NSH metastructures for different practical applications with particular requirements on maximum reaction force and displacement.},

  abstract     = {The twin boundary (TB) is a planar defect that both destroys the integrity of the crystal and significantly deteriorates the performance of semiconductor devices. However, limited research exists on the initial crystal nucleus kinetics of TB, which is a crucial aspect for a comprehensively understanding the twinning mechanism. Here, the nucleation kinetics process of TB has been thoroughly studied regarding crystal morphology, growth interface at the atomic scale, and first-principle calculations in β -Ga 2 O 3 . The nucleation kinetics process of TB originates from the smooth interface growth mode of (1 0 0)-B, which requires a significant degree of supercooling. During the crystal growth, the large degree of supercooling in front of the (1 0 0)-B plane at the three-phase boundary (TPB) leads to nucleation of TB. The twin type of β -Ga 2 O 3 is recognized as twin-B among the two thermodynamically equivalent structures. It is a glide reflection twin whose glide process initiates with a 1/4 length of the [0 0 1] vector and then with a 1/2 length of the [0 1 0] vector. This study has developed the nucleation kinetics of TB, thus enriching the theory of crystal defects. The revealed relationship between TB and the smooth interface growth mode holds great significance for guiding the suppression of twins.},

  abstract     = {Flexible viscoelastic foams with relative density in the range of 5-50% are widely used to control interaction forces, notably in cushions for impact protection, shoes, mechanical grippers, etc. The design of new foams to improve performance is challenging, due to the lack of efficient models to connect cellular architecture, viscoelasticity of the base resin, and non-linear responses that stem from large deformation of open pores. This paper presents highly efficient solutions for the response of linearly viscoelastic, kinematically non-linear and shear-deformable struts that are loaded at an oblique angle to their axis. The models can be used to predict structure-property relationships for strut-based metamaterials, including non-linear stress-strain response and accompanying hysteresis. To illustrate this, the entire design space of a simple unit cell is mapped in terms of a broad range of strut angles and thicknesses; the unit cell is inspired by features in stochastic foams that dominate their response. An enormous range of stress-strain responses can be obtained from this single foam-like cell, including purely softening, purely stiffening, and non-monotonic stiffness with adjustable tangent moduli. The model is also used to illustrate connections between viscoelastic material parameters, loading rate, and hysteresis for two distinct classifications of non-linear stress-strain response.},

The objective was to improve the performance of PP by enhancing its mechanical properties and imparting antibacterial characteristics. An industrially scalable process was utilized to fabricate PP/Ag nanocomposites through the reactive melt mixing technique. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) served as the reduction agent, and silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ) was incorporated as the additive. During the extrusion of the three-dimensional printing (3DP) filaments, reactive melt mixing occurred, resulting in the production of specimens for various standard tests. The addition of 5.0 wt% AgNO 3 and 2.5 wt% PEG in the PP thermoplastic led to a slight improvement in mechanical performance, with a 9.9 % increase in tensile strength observed. The antibacterial properties of the composites were assessed through agar well diffusion tests against Escherichia coli ( E-coli ) and Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ). A more significant biocidal effect was observed for S. aureus compared to E-coli . These composites have the potential to be utilized in industrial applications that require enhanced mechanical properties and durability, as well as important biocidal properties, such as in the medical equipment industry or the defense sector.},

  abstract     = {T-carbon, a new carbon allotrope essentially composed of intra-tetrahedron bonds and inter-tetrahedron bonds, has attracted strong scientific interest in recent years due to its excellent mechanical performance for a wide range of applications. This study demonstrates that strain hardening can endow T-carbon with exceptional mechanical strength at a high compressive strain under plastic deformation, which is rarely observed in conventional carbon-based materials. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this behavior occurs in T-carbon nanowires and is caused by graphitization, where their original sp 3 -dominated carbon network transforms into a stronger sp 2 -network. Further analysis shows that graphitization occurs due to the breaking of intra-tetrahedron bonds, which is dominated by the deformation behavior of inter-tetrahedron bond angles. Particularly, when the deformation angle is small, only a small portion of the strain energy is stored in the tetrahedrons, while the remaining energy is released by breaking the intra-tetrahedron bonds of T-carbon nanowires, thus leading to graphitization. Moreover, such underlying mechanisms behind strain hardening and graphitization are found to occur in bulk T-carbon. This strain hardening potentially enables T-carbon to overcome the strength–ductility tradeoff issue of high strength leading to ductility loss.},

However, our understanding of the cellular composition of PVM and the key genes-mediated MuSCs functions is limited. We analyzed cells heterogeneity and identified key genes using scRNA-seq. To validate the presence of EGR1 + MuSCs, we performed Flow cytometry assays. We utilized pseudo-time, CytoTRACE, and RNA velocity to reconstruct cells differentiation trajectory. CellPhoneDB was used to identify the interactions between MuSCs and other cells. We identified 22 cell clusters and 10 cell types, including MuSCs. We found EGR1 + MuSCs representing the activated subset. We observed the overall number of MuSCs decreased, while the proportion of EGR1 + MuSCs gradually increased during PMD. We demonstrated the target ATF3 of EGR1 and EGR1 were significantly upregulated in PMD, suggesting EGR1-ATF3 signaling may regulate MuSCs functions. Cell differentiation trajectory indicated EGR1 + MuSCs exhibited higher stemness. We discovered immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells may collaborate with MuSCs through specific ligand-receptor pairs to regulate MuSCs functions. These findings unveils the activation of EGR1-ATF3 signaling in EGR1 + MuSCs, providing new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying PMD.},

However, incorporating such granular materials within practical structural solutions remains a challenge. In this study, we use additive manufacturing to overcome this challenge by designing a modular geometry that allows us to encapsulate such granular materials within a 3D printed scaffold. Using the 3D printed porous scaffold provides the added benefits of tunability and durability. Further, we introduce a design methodology and software tool to facilitate the efficient design of such hybrid sound absorbers. The proposed method uses the Johnson-Champoux-Allard model, Biot theory, and the transfer matrix method to model the acoustical behavior of hybrid absorber designs that use layered granular aerogels and 3D printed bulk absorbers. The tool can also be used to inversely characterize the acoustic bulk properties of such materials. We validate the design concept and tool by comparing the model predictions with experimental measurements. Finally, we outline strategies for designing hybrid absorbers that can provide application specific low-frequency and broadband absorption performance within specific frequency ranges, while considering engineering constraints on their total mass and depth.},

In this study, the spatial distributions of various phases in three Al-based entropy alloys were investigated. A closely interconnected intermetallic compound (IC) network comprising Al 2 Cu and Al 45 Cr 7 phases was identified. Finite element (FE) modeling was conducted based on the reconstructed three-dimensional microstructure to simulate compressive deformation behavior. The IC network served as the main stress bearer during deformation. Thin sections in the Al 2 Cu network were the weak sites where stress concentration and damage first occurred. However, the breakage of this limited region contributes to relatively coordinated deformation and extended plasticity. The breakage of large particles accounts for the final alloy failure. The results of the FE model were compared with the experimentally measured stress–strain behavior and mechanical properties, showing very good agreement. Given the non-uniform distribution of strain and stress during deformation, a strengthening model, merging the Voigt and Reuss models, was also developed to predict the mechanical properties of Al-based entropy alloys with the aim of facilitating Al-based entropy alloy development.},

This, coupled with the wide availability of metal powders, leads to a critical issue: contamination across different systems in different process steps. Consequently, it is necessary to find a new, fast, and reliable analysis sensible to tiny traces of contamination. This work evaluates the applicability of Ultraviolet–Visible-Near InfraRed (UV–Vis-NIR) spectroscopy, a technique providing information on powders’ reflectance, for studying contaminated powders. This work focuses on assessing 3 binary systems obtained from the cross-contamination of 3 components (A92618, C10200 and S31603) in a low contamination range (from 0.5 vol% to vol. 6%) and in a high contamination range (25 vol% and vol.50%). After the UV–Vis-NIR analysis, multivariate analysis has been used to obtain quantitative results. Results show that, as the contamination level increases in the binary system, the shape of spectra changes and becomes progressively more similar to the contaminant one. The chemometric analysis allows the detection of the contaminant type and its concentration percentage in the contaminated powder.},

It should be emphasized that the as-prepared nano-heterojunctions also showed amazing bacterial elimination efficiency in sewage. The antibacterial mechanism was also investigated using a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. It can be attributed to the formation of unique nano-heterojunctions between PB and PBA, which improves the absorption of NIR light and facilitates the separation of generated electron-hole pairs.

Due to the complex physical processes involved in the femtosecond laser scanning process, it is difficult to predict the required LIPSS morphologies, which hinders rapid customization of the large-area LIPSS patterns. In this study, a structural optimization method combining data-driven deep learning with energy deposition model was proposed to control LIPSS morphologies of silicon. After femtosecond laser processing under dynamic irradiation condition, four LIPSS morphological types were well defined based on experimental results. Deep learning model was constructed to extract data features by labeling and encoding sample data. The accuracy of self-correlation validation reached 98.0% and the accuracy of cross-correlation validation reached 91.9%. Our results show that the distribution of LIPSS morphological types exhibits the dependence of energy deposition, which is the joint effect of the effective pulse number and accumulative fluence. Moreover, the period of groove (super-wavelength LIPSS) increases with the increase of energy deposition, while the period of LSFL (low spatial frequency LIPSS) slightly decreases with the increase of energy deposition.

With the increasing demand for advanced materials, especially in modern applications facing rigorous conditions, it becomes imperative to gain profound insights into the dynamic behavior of HEAs. In this study, the (FeCoNi) 86 Al 7 Ti 7 HEA, renowned for exceptional printability and room-temperature mechanical properties, has been fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM), and its tensile and impact behaviors at ambient and cryogenic temperatures are systematically investigated. Experimental results reveal enhanced tensile properties as temperature decreases, achieving a high ultimate strength of 1313.6 MPa and impressive ductility of 24.8 % at 77 K. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic deformation mechanisms, including dislocation slip, stacking faults, Lomer and Lomer-Cottrell locks, which maintain a high strain-hardening rate and thus suppress strain localization. In contrast, impact properties deteriorate due to constrained dislocation mobility at high strain rates and low temperatures, with Charpy impact energy decreasing from 8.1 J at 293 K to 5.1 J at 77 K. Consequently, cracks readily initiate at cellular boundaries or defects, propagating in an intergranular manner and inducing localized deformation. This study provides valuable insights for the future applications of 3D-printed HEAs in extreme operational environments.},

Due to the printing process, which includes the pumping and extruding of the material, the fibres are not uniformly orientated in the material but have an orientation dependency due to the specific printing process applied. Three different cases for the fibre orientation distribution functions are presented with increasing levels of relation to the printing process. These three cases have been used in a micro-mechanical model to verify with experimental stress-crack opening results (single crack). Furthermore, a spring model is used to give insight into the potential to develop pseudo strain hardening behaviour (multiple cracking) in various printing directions. The method is also used to model the experimentally obtained spread in uni-axial tensile dogbone test results. From these experimental dogbone tests, average stress-strain relations are determined in two directions. Finally, a multi-layer method is used on the component level to validate the use of these average stress-strain relations for modelling the bending behaviour of printed elements in multiple directions.},

This study used a facile computerized embroidery process to design and fabricate carbon fibers with controllable and precise patterned structures. The obtained carbon fiber/cement composites (CFCs) exhibited excellent electrothermal performance (100 ℃ under 30 V), low energy consumption (400 mW/℃), and homogeneous heat distribution with a unique heating element (carbon fibers) structure. The difference between the maximum and average surface temperatures improved, and the surface heat distributions of the CFCs under different structures were determined using a finite element simulation. CFCs with different complex heat element structures were successfully fabricated, and the mechanism regulating the heat distribution of the CFCs was revealed. Embroidery technology provides a novel strategy for the fabrication of carbon fiber/cement composite materials with a controllable carbon fiber structure, thereby significantly broadening the application of cement composites for electrothermal applications.},

Genetic, environmental factors, and significantly, oxidative stress due to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) play pivotal roles in these disorders. With their profound implications on global health, it becomes imperative to seek innovative therapeutic solutions. Nanozymes, known for their superior stability, cost-effectiveness, and tunable properties, present themselves as a prospective answer in mitigating ROS-driven bone ailments. This review explores the diverse applications and mechanisms of nanozymes in the context of bone health. They show potential in not only counteracting ROS-induced oxidative stress but also in modulating angiogenesis and showcasing antibacterial effects. We systematically analyze the effects of nanozymes on conditions such as osteonecrosis of the femoral head, skin flap transplantation, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc disease, osteoporosis, and osteosarcoma, highlighting their potential roles in modulating disease processes. In addition, we discuss the challenges of applying nanozymes to orthopedic diseases. It offers insights into the transformative potential of nanozymes in bone therapeutics, underscoring the need to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities for their broader application in orthopedics.},

  abstract     = {Soft robotics aims to replicate the structure and mechanics of skeletal muscles. The challenge lies in seamlessly integrating these muscle-inspired soft actuators with the joints they intend to actuate, resembling the natural connection between muscles and tendons (i.e., myotendinous junction). This study addresses this issue by producing electrospun bundles of aligned nanofibers using a thermoplastic polyurethane, mimicking the muscle fascicle, and nylon 6.6 for the tendon one. A novel method was developed to create electrospun bi-material bundles with two different types of myotendinous-inspired junctions, called flat and conical. Scanning electron microscopy and microtomography analyses confirmed that conical junctions mimicked natural myotendinous structures better than flat ones. Tensile mechanical tests demonstrated that bi-material junctions reached stress at failure comparable to polyurethane bundles (11 ± 2 MPa), with the conical junction showing stiffness (0.13 ± 0.02 N/mm) and net elastic modulus (153 ± 10 MPa) values closer to the natural myotendinous ones. Cyclic tests verified the mechanical stability of junctions and their ability to dampen nylon 6.6 hardening over time. Moreover, all bundles withstood cyclic loading without breaking. These findings suggest the potential of biomimetic electrospun junctions for applications in soft robotics, marking a significant step toward advancing this field.},

Their performances are attributed to the low thermal conductivity and to the decomposition of the phenolic resin. These phenomena are strongly influenced by the materials microstructure. In the present work, standard and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-modified carbon-phenolic ablators were manufactured and characterized: the influence of PVP on the final microstructure and chemistry of the ablators was studied through SEM-EDS, X-ray Microscopy (XRM) analysis and FTIR technique; the mechanical properties were evaluated through compression tests on virgin and charred samples while ablative performance of the ablators were evaluated with an oxyacetylene flame exposure test. Weak bonds between phenolic resin chains and PVP were observed. The microstructure of the ablators, both before and after the exposure to the oxyacetylene flame, is strongly influenced by the PVP addition, furthermore the addition of 10 and 20 %wt of PVP can guarantee a reduction of about 30 % of the back temperature during the oxyacetylene flame test with respect to the standard carbon-phenolic ablator. Compression tests on the manufactured ablators enlighten also an improvement in the mechanical properties for PVP-enriched ablators, in particular considering their charred state.},

  abstract     = {Due to the risk of releasing carcinogenic nickel ions from conventional 316L stainless steel under a corrosive human body environment, a new variant of steel termed nickel-free stainless steel (NiFSS) has been investigated. The present study investigates the tribological properties and biocompatibility of NiFSS manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M). The ferritic NiFSS exhibited significantly lower coefficient of friction (0.08 to 0.28) and wear rate (1.60 × 10 -6 mm 3 /Nm to 6.60 × 10 -6 mm 3 /Nm) compared to reported values for austenitic 316L SS, under both dry and simulated body fluid (SBF) conditions and various sliding geometries. This improvement is attributed to the superior hardness (3.394 ± 0.1340 GPa) and elastic modulus (238 ± 9.0797 GPa) of NiFSS. To assess the biocompatibility, the viability of mouse pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells was evaluated with an Alamar Blue assay when the cells were cultured on top of PBF-LB/M built NiFSS and 316L SS samples. The results indicated that even though cell growth was most optimal on regular cell culture plastic, cell viability was better maintained on PBF-LB/M built NiFSS compared to 316L SS. Therefore, the results of the present study propose that PBF-LB/M fabricated NiFSS holds promise for application in biomedical devices for joint arthroplasty.},

In response, this study employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to generate virtual samples for enhancing the in-house experimental data, by which the generated virtual data well captured the distribution of the raw experimental data. As a result, compared with the model without data augmentation, the enhanced prediction model (composition → property) fitted by virtual samples improved its R 2 value from 0.52 to 0.86. Based on this model, a multi-properties-oriented (yield strength σ s , magnetic induction B 50 , and iron loss P 10/400 ) composition prediction model (property → composition) was established to rapidly discover high-performance non-oriented silicon steel. Experimental characterization and theory calculation of the explored candidate alloys exhibited that their yield strength was above 750 MPa, which primarily results from solid solution strengthening (50 %) and precipitation strengthening (36 %). Moreover, the alloys possessed magnetic induction B 50 of over 1.72 T and low core losses with P 10/400 of 12.1 W/kg (0.2 mm) and 17.0 W/kg (0.35 mm). Further microstructural characterization exhibited that such satisfactory performance is associated with copper (Cu)-rich nanoprecipitates that dramatically improved the yield strength without deteriorating the magnetic properties.},

By conducting a comparative analysis of unit cell design and manufacturing deviations, we assess their impact on the compressive properties of GSLSs. Notably, the original GSLS with circle-/grid-like heterogeneous geometries exhibits outstanding overall compression performance, including stability, stress dispersion and unique cell-by-cell and layer-by-layer fracture mechanisms among GSLSs, which are attributable to their reinforced diagonal struts and heterogeneous unit cells. Hence, three strategies for unit cell design and optimization were proposed.

Subsequently, the objective function was iteratively optimized using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) based on the constraint function. Finally, a numerical simulation model was developed using the key parameters derived from the structural optimization to investigate the penetration performance of a 12.7 mm projectile on different structures. Comparing the damage failure scenario, penetration resistance, ballistic performance, and energy absorption efficiency of different structures, it was found that after parameter optimization, wave-staggered composite plate reduced the penetration depth by 31.61 %, improved the ballistic limit by 27.21 %, and enhanced the energy absorption efficiency of ceramic by 8.30 % compared to the block plate.},

The large number of adjustable parameters, the different physical process limits, and the various possible optimization strategies complicate the design of suitable laser micromachining processes that enable high quality and high throughput. In this contribution, a comprehensive model is proposed that helps to identify the optimization strategies and process parameters required for the scaling of laser micromachining to high throughput at high average laser power without exceeding the process limits to ensure high surface quality. The model was experimentally verified on the example of laser micromachining of pockets in metals and silicon using an ultrafast laser with an average power of 1.01 kW, a pulse duration of 600 fs, different pulse energies, pulse bursts, and beam diameters. As a result, high material removal rates exceeding 120 mm 3 /min were achieved for silicon, stainless steel, copper, and aluminum, which exceed previously achieved removal rates by one to two orders of magnitude. The machined surfaces exhibit high quality as confirmed by the low measured roughness of about 1 µm.},

By leveraging the insulator-to-metal transition of VO 2 nanoparticles, responsive composite films were developed by integrating these nanoparticles within a biopolymeric network of cationic cellulose nanofibers (CNF + ). These films exhibit a reversible change in GHz permittivity upon exposure to thermal or optical stimuli, facilitating dynamic control of their electrical properties. The layered structure of the films further enhances their robustness, featuring a VO 2 nanoparticle core encased within CNF + layers. This design not only strengthens the structure but also significantly boosts light-induced conductivity, particularly in layered variant, underscoring its potential in optoelectronic applications. Simulation studies reveal that the nonuniform, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) of the developed mixed film adeptly manipulates incident electromagnetic waves, making it suitable for 5G/6G wireless signals. Conversely, the layered film serves as a switchable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shield, demonstrating notable differences in shielding efficiency between its hot and cold states. Consequently, CNF + /VO 2 composite films designed in this work emerge as a versatile, adaptable platform for intelligent electronics, particularly in the realm of 5G/6G wireless communications.},

Therefore, based on the proposed circular polarization discrimination method relating to ellipticity angle β, this study exploits Python-programmed elitist preserving genetic algorithm to optimally design a reflective-type broadband LTC polarization conversion metasurface. The simulation results demonstrate that the final metasurface can realize the wideband LTC polarization conversion; the measured results are in excellent agreement with the simulations, thus validating the proposed design method. It provides an efficient alternative for broadband LTC polarization conversion metasurface designs, which drives the development of the design of LTC polarization conversion metasurfaces from manual methods towards automation.

As a result, the sulfurizing reaction proceeds more completely at a lower temperature. The as-prepared material exhibits a different light response to the blank sample, changing from a higher energy level to a lower one. And the electrochemistry is greatly elevated as well. Theoretical calculations validate that KI plays the key role by altering the electron transmitting path. We can thus unify the behaviors of KI in the field of heat, light, and electricity, phenomenally. Furthermore, we investigate the morphology changes of the electrode by dipping it in an ordinary solution and subjecting it to a cycle calendar life in the electrolyte, respectively. As a result, we make clear that the difference of the behaviors between ordinary solutions and electrolytes is also in associated with the electronic path of KI.},

Subsequently, the shape and hardness distribution of each weld bead were comprehensively analyzed.

However, the operational window of these materials is limited by the phase transition temperatures of the polymer matrix and the brittleness of the composites. Herein, a conductive polymer composite based on a co-polyester thermoplastic elastomer reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) was developed, which exhibits a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) switching temperature of 200 °C. This system shows a more gradual increase in resistivity with temperature and a less pronounced drop in resistivity past the critical transition temperature than other PTC composites. Moreover, Joule heating experiments revealed the ability to regulate at a predefined maximum temperature (within 150 – 200 °C), tuneable through parameters such as filler concentration, applied voltage and thermal boundary conditions, as also demonstrated by multiphysics simulations. Due to the more gradual PTC curve, this composite can produce steady state heating far below the PTC peak, unlike almost all other PTC materials: a unique advantage for self-regulating heating devices as the polymer is not in a melt state, reducing polymer degradation, filler mobility and increasing safety margin before onset of NTC behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Weldability plays a crucial role in the journey of high entropy alloys towards their engineering applications. In this study, gas metal arc welding was performed to join an as-rolled CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy using Monel 400 as the filler wire. The present research findings demonstrate a favorable metallurgical chemical reaction between the Monel 400 filler and the CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy, resulting in compositional mixing within the fusion zone that promotes a solid-solution strengthening effect, counteracting the typical low hardness associated to the fusion zone of these alloys. The weld thermal cycle induced multiple microstructure changes across the joint, including variations in the grain size, existing phases and local texture. The grain size was seen to increase from the base material toward the fusion zone. An FCC matrix and finely sparse Cr-Mn-based oxides existed in both base material and heat affected zone, while in the fusion zone new FCC phases and carbides were formed upon the mixing of the Monel 400 filler. The role of the filler material on the fusion zone microstructure evolution was rationalized using thermodynamic calculations. Texture shifted from a γ-fiber (in the base material) to a strong cubic texture in the fusion zone. Digital image correlation during tensile testing to fracture coupled with microhardness mapping revealed that, stemming from the process-induced microstructure changes, the micro and macromechanical response differed significantly from the original base material. This study successfully established a correlation between the impact of the process on the developed microstructural features and the resultant mechanical behavior, effectively assessing the processing-microstructure-properties relationships towards an improved understanding of the physical metallurgy associated to these advanced engineering alloys. In conclusion, this work provides an important theoretical framework and practical guidance for optimizing the engineering applications of high entropy alloys.},

Only local adhesion anchors the printed object on the surface and ensure proper print-development without structure loss and long-term usability. Although surface treatments such as silanization are well known to considerably increase adhesion strength, quantification of adhesion is not straightforward and commonly assessed indirectly by surface characteristics and technological methods. The present work aims to quantify adhesion on a micrometer scale through SEM in situ tension experiments, that utilize a newly developed specimen geometry. Multiple specimens, with various footprints, were manufactured on both silanized and untreated fused silica substrates, allowing the comparable quantification of adhesion stresses between different surface conditions. Specimens on an untreated substrate failed with a high scatter in detaching force, whereas specimens on a silanized substrate tend to fail within the photoresist, either at the gauge section or just above the substrate, rather than at the interface itself. Thus, the adhesion stress was increased at least by a factor of 1.4 by the silanization treatment. Generally, a novel approach was developed, that can quantify local adhesions properties in realistic packaging or integrated circuits.},

Therefore, the objective of this study was to understand how aqueous and high temperature environments influence plasticization and contraction of biopolymer scaffolds through the physio–chemical mechanisms of hydrolysis and negative thermal expansion. To achieve this objective, scaffolds were printed using a negative thermal expansion stretch–dominated design in both PLA and PLA-TPU material configurations. The samples were evaluated after a simulated cooking experiment (90 °C for 10 mins). The formation of crystals in the single material PLA during cooking led to bend–dominated contraction while the dual-material PLA-TPU experienced stretch–dominated contraction. Furthermore, exceeding the glass transition temperature of PLA during simulated cooking in an aqueous environment caused irreversible deformation to the scaffold structure that has the potential to influence organoleptic properties.},

According to the results, the open-circuit voltage ( V oc ) of F-TENG can reach 245.54 V. The short-circuit current ( I sc ) and transfer charge ( Q sc ) of F-TENG can arrive at 9.16 µA and 81.16 nC. As the self-powered pressure sensor, two linear sensing regions of F-TENG can be observed, with sensing sensitivities of 5.9 kPa −1 and 2.05 kPa −1 , respectively. In the meantime, when the F-Zn hydrogel serves as strain sensor, the Gauge Factor (GF) can arrive at 0.99. It&#39;s important to note that F-TENG can complement the static sensing of the F-Zn hydrogel strain sensor by having application value in dynamic motion sensing.

These issues are likely exacerbated by detrimental biochemical interactions and the formation of new blood vessels within the osteochondral unit, impacting tissue repair quality. In this study, we devised a novel freeze-welding technique to create a unified porous scaffold. Chitosan was chosen as the primary material due to its structural and compositional similarity to glycosaminoglycans in the ECM. In particular, by meticulously adjusting freezing and solute conditions, we engineered the scaffold to have an axially aligned porous structure in the cartilage layer and a radially aligned porous structure in the subchondral layer (scaffold A/R), each designed to meet the unique repair needs of the respective tissues. This scaffold showed enhanced mechanical compressibility, shape retention, and interfacial bonding capabilities. The results demonstrated that this unique spatial scaffold structure offers significant advantages over purely axial scaffolds in guiding osteochondral regeneration. These advantages were evident in its ability to independently promote cartilage and bone growth, reduce undesirable bone-cartilage crosstalk, particularly in the context of vessel invasion in the cartilage layer, and optimize the remodeling of the osteochondral interface. This study offers valuable insights into the structural design patterns for osteochondral regeneration, highlighting the potential importance of structural scaffold design in guiding endogenous tissue remodeling during heterogeneous tissue regeneration.},

However, intense ultraviolet (UV)/ irradiation, high/low temperatures, and/or chemical solvent with strong acid/alkali/corrosion feature seriously affect their mechanical properties, thus severely shorten the life cycle of AF-based products. Inspiration by the principle of multiple refractions and partly reflections, an innovative strategy by depositing of laminated Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 composite onto the surface of poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique was presented. The tenacity of ALD-coated PMIA only decreases by ∼ 8 %, and the yellowness index (YI) only increasing to 129.24 %, far lower than 321.63 % of pristine PMIA fabric under the combination of intense UV irradiation (4260 W/m 2 ) and high temperature (200 °C + ) for 6 h, which equals to continuous strong sunlight exposure for approximately 7.5 years. Meanwhile, ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) value increased to 126.4, which is double that of the pristine PMIA fabric, exhibiting an impressive UV-resistance property. Furthermore, the ALD-coated PMIAs also shows a significant enhancement in both chemical and thermal stabilities. In all, this work not only forge a new route for the functionalization of fibrous materials, but also exhibits great promise for next generation advanced composite material and cutting-edge equipment in harsh environment.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight alloys are known to improve the fuel efficiency of the structural components due to high strength-to-weight ratio, however, they lack formability at room temperature. This major limitation of poor formability is most of the time overcome by post-fabrication processing and treatments thereby increasing their cost exponentially. We present a novel Ti 50 V 16 Zr 16 Nb 10 Al 5 Mo 3 (all in at. %) complex concentrated alloy (Ti-CCA) designed based on the combination of valence electron concentration theory and the high entropy approach. The optimal selection of constituent elements has led to a density of 5.63 gm/cc for Ti-CCA after suction casting (SC). SC Ti-CCA displayed exceptional room temperature strength (UTS ∼ 1.25 GPa) and ductility ( ε ∼ 35 %) with a yield strength (YS) of ∼ 1.1 GPa (Specific YS = 191 MPa/gm/cc) without any post-processing treatments. The exceptional YS in Ti-CCA is attributed to hetero grain size microstructure, whereas enormous strength-ductility synergy is due to the concurrent occurrence of slip and deformation band formation in the early stages of deformation followed by prolonged necking event due to delayed void nucleation and growth. The proposed philosophy of Ti-CCA design overcomes the conventional notion of strength-ductility trade-off in such alloy systems by retaining their inherent characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Alloy 718 is widely used in critical temperature components of modern aircraft engines and gas turbines. However, its industrial-scale forging faces challenges around heterogeneous microstructures and properties in the final product. This has been attributed to inherent heterogeneous microstructures of the billet starting materials and/or the heterogeneous nature of deformation during hot forging itself, leading to heterogeneities and inferior mechanical performance during service. To overcome these challenges, a three-step TMP approach, denoted simply as TMP3, is introduced to unlock effective microstructure and homogeneity control, irrespective of the given billet microstructure. Using electron and atom probe microscopy, the through-process microstructure evolution is revealed, highlighting dependencies of homogeneity and superior properties on various dynamic recrystallization mechanisms and the δ-phase dissolution. The process affects the dislocation density, δ-phase characteristics, and solute distribution in the matrix γ-phase. This facilitates Nb redistribution, resulting in fractions and morphologies of γʹ and γ“ Co-precipitates during subsequent direct ageing. The final samples have a hardness of ∼ 500 HV, a ∼ 5 % improvement over previous methods, providing a reliable proxy for high-temperature yield strength, independent of the billet position. Our TMP3 approach can be scaled-up and will enable manufacturing of high-performance Alloy 718 parts ready for next generation aircraft engines.},

  abstract     = {Bone defects caused by tumors, trauma, or other bone diseases are common in clinical practice. Titanium alloy (TC4) and tantalum (Ta) are the primary metallic materials for bone repair. However, TC4 frequently suffers from poor osseointegration and implant loosening, while the high cost of Ta limits its widespread use for reconstructing large bone defects. To address this issue, this research employs magnetron sputtering (MSP) to deposit a nano-thin amorphous Ta-coating on the 3D-printed TC4 implant. SEM examinations of compressed samples show robust interfacial bonding without shedding, while the presence of Ta within the porous structure indicates high coverage. High-resolution TEM analysis first reveals a distinct multilayer amorphous zone consisting of surface TaO x , Ta-coating, and hybrid TaO x and TiO x , along with an impact-refinement nanocrystalline TC4 zone. Insufficient energy leads to the formation of amorphous layers. Meanwhile, interfacial bonding is strengthened through the solid solution of oxygen and interfacial densification of amorphous-crystalline bonding and impact compression. Biological evaluations demonstrate that the Ta-coating exhibits superior cell proliferation and bone ingrowth effects compared to TC4 and pure Ta implants, primarily attributed to the amorphous oxide composition on the surface. This study offers novel, cost-efficient, and excellent biological performance materials for bone defect implants.},

In the present work, a continuous SPD process named the Conform, utilizing a rotational speed of 4 rpm and a mold preheating temperature of 300 °C, was performed on the high-alloying 7055 Al alloy and prepared rod materials with excellent mechanical properties. The results indicated that violent shear deformation accompanied by rapid temperature rise contributes to the specific grain refinement mechanism of continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) and discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX). The grain configuration formed by this cooperative mechanism is advantageous for the alloy&#39;s compatible deformation capability. As a result, a synergistic improvement in the strength and ductility of the Conformed 7055 Al alloy was obtained. Additionally, the strengthening mechanisms induced by the Conform process were quantitatively calculated, revealing that solid solution strengthening and dislocation strengthening were the primary reasons for the enhanced strength of processed alloys.},

As research into these materials progresses, the demand for materials with even more complex and superior properties has increased. Traditional trial-and-error methods are limited to optimizing single factors and are plagued by heavy workloads and prohibitive costs when applied to multifactor composite designs. Addressing these problems, this study introduces a nonparametric multiobjective optimization process for composite materials. This approach employs a Gaussian process (GP) to establish a multiobjective regression model and uses nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to determine the Pareto front. Pareto solutions were ranked in accordance with their similarity to ideal solutions and on the basis of predetermined preference weights. The results demonstrate variations in optimal outcomes contingent on the weight values assigned. The differences between the optimized results and experimental validations reached 12.9%, with the minimum deviation being 0.6%. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated. The strategy combines GP and NSGA II to extend design methods for small samples and materials with multiple attributes. This method enables the simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives, offering greater efficiency than addressing them individually.},

When subjected to axial compression, the lattice can undergo a topological transformation by forming contact connections. This topology change involves a transition from rectangular-like unit cells to kagome-like unit cells, associated with an approximately fourfold increase in stiffness. The lattice exhibits negative Poisson&#39;s ratio with a step-change from ≈−0.66 to ≈−0.23 prior to and during contact formation, respectively. After contact formation, it displays a nonlinear Poisson&#39;s ratio behaviour. The mechanics underpinning these behaviours are analysed using a combination of experiments and numerical modelling. A comparison with similar planar lattices reveals the effect of the global topology of the lattice (e.g. planar, cylindrical) on the unit cell-level topology morphing.

  abstract     = {The ribbon kirigami pattern has garnered significant attention over the past decade because of its interesting geometric and mechanical properties such as extreme elongation and high ductility, making it a viable choice for various applications such as developing medical devices and flexible electronics. Despite the promising prospects of this type of morphing structure, its deformation mechanism and sensitivity to materials properties and geometric parameters have remained largely unexplored. Here we take a computational approach to studying the deformation process and ductility of a typical ribbon kirigami metastructure. To this end, the deformation process is divided into various stages. We demonstrate the existence of a certain threshold of the process at which the deformation behavior starts to be dominated by the properties of the constituent material, after the initial geometric-design-dominated stages. This turning point, called the design–material transition (DMT) threshold, determines a key limit in the deformation capacity of such metastructures for practical applications. Based on the introduced deformation mechanism, an elongation prediction model is derived for the metastructure, followed by conducting experiments to validate the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm and an interior-point method are utilized to develop an efficient algorithm for the optimization of the geometric parameters of the kirigami pattern. We anticipate that the findings of this study open a path to engineering functional kirigami patterns for the design and fabrication of highly ductile shape-shifting structures.},

The targeting oligopeptide (PT) for osteosarcoma cells was inserted into the outer membrane of nanoparticles, thereby further enhancing the tumor-targeting capability through receptor-mediated binding. The prepared CIDP-PT nanoparticles exhibited high targeting efficiency and multifunctionality. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that CIDP-PT significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy for osteosarcoma via the NIR-II photoresponsive and tumor-targeting approach. It achieves efficient tumor cell eradication through multiple modalities while maintaining an exceptional level of biocompatibility.

  abstract     = {Recent experiments identified a new type of stress induced structural transformation allowing to combine high strength, great work hardening and good ductility in multiphase Ti alloys. These properties are achieved through reorientation of the α ′ α′ martensite plates being in specific self accommodating 〈 5 4 ‾ 1 ‾ 3 〉 〈54‾1‾3〉 type II twin relation, i.e. under applied load one martensite variant reconfigure to its twinned configuration with visible motion of the { 1 3 4 ‾ 1 } {134‾1} twin boundary. This mechanism of plastic deformation was never observed before thus, its current understanding is fragmentary. In this article we present the results of experimental observations and ab initio calculations of 〈 5 4 ‾ 1 ‾ 3 〉 〈54‾1‾3〉 type II twins determining the crystallography of twin formation, structure and energy of the { 1 3 4 ‾ 1 } {134‾1} interface as well as mobility of the corresponding twinning disconnections. It was found that the investigated boundary has one of the lowest energies among known twinning modes in hexagonal Ti. Moreover, the 〈 5 4 ‾ 1 ‾ 3 〉 { 1 3 4 ‾ 1 } 〈54‾1‾3〉{134‾1} disconnections have the smallest Burgers vector and step height in comparison to other active twinning systems. As a result, these disconnections are highly mobile which rationalize migration of the { 1 3 4 ‾ 1 } {134‾1} twin boundaries at straining. Furthermore, energy of the twin boundary and mobility of disconnections can be adjusted by particular alloying elements enabling the conscious development of new alloys exhibiting reorientation induced plasticity.},

  abstract     = {The formation conditions of lacy ferrite in austenitic stainless steels solidified with primary ferrite was clarified through crystallography in order to increase the amount of lacy ferrite which contributed to the improvement of properties. Lacy ferrite was formed when the misorientation between ferrite and austenite from the Kurdjumov–Sachs (K-S) relationship was ≤ 7° on the close-packed plane and ≤ 9° in the close-packed direction during solidification. In contrast, vermicular ferrite was formed if the misorientation exceeded these values. The temperature gradient during solidification was controlled unidirectionally by two-pass laser welding. Following the performance of two-pass welding with a highly unidirectional laser, it was confirmed that the formation ratio of lacy ferrite to total ferrite significantly increased in the second-pass weld metal by remelting the first-pass weld metal, in which the heat flow direction and preferential growth direction of ferrite and austenite were controlled to be almost parallel. The growth ratio while maintaining the K-S relationship established between ferrite and austenite in the first-pass weld metal, and/or the ferrite formation ratio that satisfies the K-S relationship, increased in the second-pass weld metal because the growth of both the primary ferrite and secondary austenite was crystallographically independent of each other during solidification.},

  abstract     = {Like many pixel-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, digital light processing (DLP) based vat photopolymerization faces the challenge that the square pixel based processing strategy can lead to zigzag edges especially when feature sizes come close to single-pixel levels. Introducing greyscale pixels has been a strategy to smoothen such edges, but it is a challenging task to understand which of the many permutations of projected pixels would give the optimal 3D printing performance. To address this challenge, a novel data acquisition strategy based on machine learning (ML) principles is proposed, and a training routine is implemented to reproduce the smallest shape of an intended 3D printed object. Through this approach, a chessboard patterning strategy is developed along with an automated data refining and augmentation workflow, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness by reducing the deviation by around 30%.},

In this model, the dendrite and eutectic structures are simulated using a CA technique. The solute diffusion is solved by the FD method. The nucleation, growth, and motion behavior of gas pore, and hydrogen transport are simulated by a LB Shen-Chen scheme. It is found that the pores can grow fully but compete in the primary dendrite growth stage. Conversely, pores newly nucleated in residual inter-dendrite liquid during the eutectic solidification stage grow restrictedly and independently. Pore shape severely deformed by the compression of the surrounding solid structures. Moreover, the effects of the initial Si composition, initial hydrogen concentration and cooling rate on the pore formation are qualitatively and quantitatively studied. It is found that the initial Si composition significantly impacts on the pore size and distribution, but little effect on the porosity percentage which decreases markedly with the decreasing initial hydrogen concentration and increasing cooling rate. Comparison reveals that the simulated microstructure morphological characteristics and the predicted porosity percentage agree well with the experimental observation reported in the literature.},

Samples of the developed artificial ligament with a multilayer braided structure were fabricated and tested. Alterations in the number of braiding layers, wales, and courses significantly affect the mechanical properties of the artificial ligaments. Specifically, the toe length exhibited an increase of up to 104.58 %, while the linear stiffness exhibited variations concomitant with changes in these parameters. Additionally, a mathematical model to describe the relationship between the toe length and linear stiffness was developed based on the braiding parameters and material properties of the fibers. Alternative fibers were employed and tested to demonstrate a consistency with the mathematical model. The correlation coefficients were calculated as 0.9644 for the toe length and 0.9203 for the linear stiffness. Lastly, this study mimics the mechanical behavior of the human medial collateral ligament (MCL) by integrating the artificial ligament into a bio-fidelity knee model with a joint stiffness of 1.77 Nm/deg, resulting in a high degree of similarity with human knee in valgus-varus, further affirming the utility and applicability of this study.},

The PLL-CQDs, characterized by small particle size (2.31 ± 0.70 nm) and fluorescence properties, preserved the positive charge of PLL, affirming successful preparation. In vitro studies revealed that PLL-CQDs significantly increased T cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, while effectively suppressing differentiation into CD 4+ phenotype. Furthermore, they promoted alkaline phosphatase expression and calcium nodule formation in MC3T3-E1 cells, indicating potential for periodontal bone regeneration. In viv o experiments demonstrated that PLL-CQDs mitigated alveolar bone resorption and modulated periodontal tissue inflammation.

However, the passive diffusion of prodrug nanoparticles is hindered due to the absence of capillaries and dense extracellular matrix in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in low efficiency of anti-tumor drug delivery. In this study, we developed a metal matrix proteinase 2 (MMP2) and glutathione (GSH) responsive Janus prodrug nanoassemblies targeted towards tumors. The Janus prodrug nanoassemblies consist of targeted micelles and prodrug nanoaggregates linked by click chemistry. The size of the nanoassemblies can be reduced within the tumor microenvironment of high concentrations of MMP2. Active targeting and size shrinkage synergistically enhance cell uptake efficiency and tumor penetration capacity of nanoassemblies. The release of camptothecin (CPT) occurs in a GSH-dependent manner, while under irradiation with 660-nm red light, the photosensitizer introduced in the prodrug generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce tumor cell death. Fluorescence imaging results demonstrate enhanced tumor targeting capabilities of Janus prodrug assemblies. As a theranostic agent for tumors, Janus prodrug assemblies achieve desirable synergistic chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy for colon cancer treatment. This work would provide a novel strategy for cancer diagnosis and treatment.},

This report investigated electrospun fiber meshes based on poly(vinylidenefluoride- co -trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] as instructive biomaterials for osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). The influence played by methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), used as a solvent in place of dimethylformamide (DMF)/acetone mixture, and the effect of rotating velocity of the electrospinning collector on fiber morphology, mechanical and piezoelectric properties were studied. The solvent had noticeable effects on morphology and piezoelectric properties of electrospun fibers, with MEK outperforming DMF/acetone. By increasing the collector velocity up to 4000 rpm, the fiber diameter reduced and the mutual alignment of the fibers increased, corresponding to enhanced mechanical properties and piezo-active β-phase content. However, as a consequence of the diverse mechanical properties of random and aligned fibrous architectures, which ultimately affected the piezoelectric properties, randomly-oriented fibers exhibited higher remnant piezoelectric properties (V out and d 31 piezoelectric coefficient) than aligned ones. On these scaffolds, hMSCs showed an excellent capability of early osteogenic differentiation, leading to high calcium production. Fiber surface topology, fiber mesh morphology and remnant piezoelectric properties played a determinant role on hMSC osteogenic commitment.},

Here, we present a novel inorganic nanosheet called MnO 2 /PDA@Cu, consisting of manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) with copper (Cu) ions loaded on its surface through in-situ polymerization, using polydopamine (PDA) as an intermediate. We then encapsulated the MnO 2 /PDA@Cu nanosheet into a methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HA) soluble microneedle patch, creating a photodynamic-controllable multifunctional MnO 2 /PDA@Cu-HA microneedle. We used this microneedle to treat IDWs in a rat full-thickness skin defect model. Results demonstrated that the MnO 2 /PDA@Cu-HA microneedle effectively delivered therapeutic agents to both wound surface and deep layers, where PDA&#39;s photodynamic therapy swiftly combated bacteria under 808 nm near-infrared irradiation. Simultaneously, MnO 2 acted as a nanoenzyme, mitigating ROS levels and providing oxygen for wound healing. In addition, the photothermal effect of PDA further facilitated the release of Cu, promoting vascularization. The MnO 2 /PDA@Cu-HA microneedle significantly accelerated wound closure, re-epithelialization, and collagen deposition, enhancing IDW healing. In conclusion, our synthesized MnO 2 /PDA@Cu-HA microneedle represents a photodynamic-controllable multifunctional platform for IDW treatment, offering a promising approach for effective wound management.},

Quercetin (Que), a natural compound, has previously demonstrated its potential anti-osteoporosis effects via promoting bone formation and anti-bone resorption. However, Que is poor water solubility, lack of bone targeting, and requires high concentration to exert its therapeutic effects. In this work, a pH-responsive and bone-targeted nanomedicine HCCP-Que-PEG-ALN (HQPA) was developed via using hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP) as the cross-linkage, Que, alendronate (ALN), and amino-polyethylene glycol (NH 2 -PEG) as other building blocks. We demonstrated that HQPA can form spherical nanoparticles in aqueous solution with average size of 158.3 ± 59.8 nm with high drug loading capacity of Que (31.4 w/w%) and obvious bone-targeting capability. in vitro experimental results indicated that HQPA NPs have dual anti-osteoporosis effects of promoting osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclasts. Furthermore, HQPA NPs can effectively reduce the bone loss in OVX mice with low toxicity to major organs. We believe that this method should be a general and useful route for fabrication of bone-targeted natural-compounds-based nanomedicines for treatment different bone-related diseases.},

However, obtaining an ideal hemostatic agent that exhibits biocompatibility, biodegradability, and hemostatic efficacy remains challenging. Recent studies demonstrate that morphological characteristics of hemostatic materials impact their efficacy. This study reports on the importance of morphological modification of traditional Chinese medicine plant polysaccharides. The hemostatic properties of Three-leaf Qing polysaccharides, optimized in particle (SYQ-P) and sponge (SYQ-S) forms, were investigated in vitro and in vivo. SYQ-S and SYQ-P exhibit excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility, thereby improving fibroblast cell proliferation. The hemostatic mechanism involves stable blood clot formation through intrinsic coagulation pathways. In a lethal mouse liver defect bleeding model, blood loss and clotting time were lower with polysaccharides use than with commercial hemostatic drugs. SYQ-S demonstrates instant water-triggered expansion and high absorption capacity, while the sponge-like morphological characteristics effectively improve blood component concentrations. With efficient hemostasis and excellent biocompatibility, SYQ-S dramatically accelerated wound healing in a full-thickness skin defect model in vivo. Thus, SYQ-S effectively promotes the formation of granulation tissue, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, which ultimately accelerates wound healing. Our work highlights the design of natural Chinese medicine polysaccharides and presents a promising hemostatic agent for widespread clinical application.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage degradation, inflammatory responses, and osteophyte formation. Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) is a hallmark of OA development, and increased MMP13 expression is closely associated with extracellular matrix degradation. MMP13 expression varies significantly at different stages of OA progression. While cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors are commonly used to treat OA, their long-term systemic administration increases the risks of adverse effects. Therefore, with the aim of achieving localized and responsive delivery of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, the current study investigated an innovative MMP13-responsive micro-nano hydrogel microsphere system. Celecoxib-loaded cationic liposomes are non-covalently attached within the microsphere, enabling controlled drug release for OA treatment. In an OA environment with elevated MMP13 expression, the system is degraded via the action of MMP13 substrate peptide (MMP13sp), facilitating accelerated release of drug-loaded liposomes to improve the inflammatory microenvironment and treat OA rapidly. Compared to a phosphate-buffered saline solution with hyaluronidase (HAase), the prepared hyaluronic acid methacrylate microspheres HAMA/MMP13sp/Lipo@celecoxib exhibited rapid degradation in a solution containing a physiological concentration of MMP13/HAase, demonstrating specific enzyme responsiveness for precise anti-inflammatory drug release. The MMP13-responsive hydrogel microsphere system achieves intelligent and controllable drug release in OA, effectively decelerating disease progression and promoting articular cartilage repair.},

However, their widespread implementation has been hindered by intricate fracture mechanisms and limited toughness. This study presents a real-time approach for identifying damage type in 2.5D SiC f /SiC composites and highlights the significant impact of minor eccentric loading angle on the fracture behavior and mechanical properties using acoustic emission (AE). Even a slight degree of eccentric loading angle can significantly alter the fracture behaviors, leading to a significant increase in fracture toughness. The fracture damage evolution law of 2.5D SiC f /SiC under varying eccentric loading angles was investigated with the help of the AE damage identification, fracture morphology and finite element analysis. These findings provide valuable insights for multi-axis stress analysis of 2.5D high-performance composites.},

  abstract     = {A novel auxetic structure-based stiffener for stainless steel–carbon reinforced polymer (CFRP) T-joints with outstanding strength and toughness improvement is proposed. The stiffener was composed of a bulk web and re-entrant structure flange that was 3D printed using a selective laser melting 3D printer. The stiffener was bonded to a CFRP skin, and a pull-off test was performed to evaluate the pull-off strength, stiffness, and toughness of the joint. The results demonstrated that the proposed structure has specific strength and toughness that were 3.4 and 77 times greater than those of the baseline joint, respectively. The improvement in strength was due to the delayed damage initiation caused by the mismatch between the bending stiffness of the bulk web and the stiffener under the first re-entrant structure. However, the damage initiation in the baseline joint was located at the stiffener edge. Moreover, the negative Poisson&#39;s ratio of the re-entrant structure arrested the delamination growth after damage initiation, which enhances the toughness of the joint. By optimizing the structure of the stiffener, a joint with 2.66 and 38.2 times larger specific strengths and toughness compared to the baseline joint with the same specific stiffness was achieved.},

  abstract     = {Most traditional powder melting-based additive manufacturing (AM) technologies generally yield high-performance parts at the expense of additional cost and energy consumption. As an economical and efficient alternative method, material extrusion (ME) that deploys polymer-based filaments with highly filled metal particles offers the possibility of scalable, low-cost fabrication of metal components. As a critical step, sintering governs the mechanical strength and geometry of the final parts. The grain growth behavior induced during sintering should be well controlled to achieve the parts with the desired mechanical performance. Due to the nature of AM, grain growth kinetics could also involve extremely complex grain boundary migration and atomic diffusion mechanisms caused by the heterogeneous pore distribution. In this work, an analytical model was developed to predict and understand the grain growth behavior of stainless steel (SS) 316L built by ME-based sintering-assisted AM. Such a model accounts for anisotropic viscosity parameters calibrated through a three-dimensional dilatometry test, enabling the prediction of grain size evolution during sintering. Grain growth kinetic parameters were further identified by the grain size data at the heating and holding stages. To validate and generalize the model, we also conducted the grain size evolution prediction under different sintering temperature profiles for as-built SS 316L specimens. This work will provide scientific insights into the grain growth behavior of metal parts built by this AM technique and its understanding can be readily transferred to other sintering-assisted AM processes like binder jetting and ink writing for metal structure creation.},

  abstract     = {Co-precipitation of γ′ and γ′′ is the main strengthening mechanism that provides superior high-temperature strength in directly aged Alloy 718 aerospace parts. Control of their morphology, fraction, and configuration might allow exposure to more demanding operation environments in next-generation aircraft engines. The density of geometrically necessary dislocations introduced during hot deformation has been shown to significantly affect the co-precipitate morphology of γ′ and γ′′ in materials free of the δ-phase. However, the combined effects of geometrically necessary dislocation density and lower Nb content due to higher δ-phase fractions on co-precipitation behaviour and strengthening remain unknown. We verify these effects by hardness testing as a proxy for high-temperature strength in materials with 4.1 % δ-phase fraction. Deformation at 950 °C yields a remarkable increase of 12 % in hardness after direct ageing, explained by the prevalence of complex co-precipitate configurations. Deformation at 1000 °C decreases the δ-phase fraction and geometrically necessary dislocation density but achieves up to 19 % volume fractions of γ″, leading to a predominance of monoliths and duplet co-precipitates and a better direct ageing response. Atom probe microscopy reveals the flux of elements during co-precipitation. We recommend a δ-annealing treatment before the final forging step for manufacturing stronger Alloy 718 aerospace parts.},

Thin, disk-like hopper can harness the inhomogeneous deswelling to create the required constraint and flexible snap-through part. Here, hoppers composed of a single type of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or concentric PDMS rimmed by a stiffer PDMS are cast into precisely micromachined molds. The mechanical properties and swelling/deswelling behavior of the constraining rim and flexible snap-through materials, in concert, allow a superior specific power of 1782 W kg −1 , specific energy of 4.44 J kg −1 for a jump up to 321 mm, outperforming many more complex implementations. The jump benefits from an improved storage modulus ratio and a lower swell of the rim to the snap-through center part, which enhanced the confinement and elastic energy storage. A sharp spatial gradient in volume change between the two materials during deswelling, tunable by the porosity of the rim materials, enhances the jumping by allowing more material to store and release elastic energy, revealed by the strain analysis with 3D-digital image correlation. The illustrated multimaterials and porous materials strategies can promote the development of integrated energy harvesting and actuation for soft robotics.},

Though offering a vast chemical and phase space, relatively few MABs have been synthesised. To guide experiments, we perform high-throughput ab initio screening of MABs that combine group 4–7 transition metals (M); Al, Si, Ga, Ge, or In (A); and boron (B) focusing on their phase stability trends and mechanical properties. Considering the 1:1:1, 2:1:1, 2:1:2, 3:1:2, 3:1:3, and 3:1:4 M:A:B ratios and 10 phase prototypes, synthesisability of a single-phase compound for each elemental combination is estimated through formation energy spectra of competing dynamically stable MABs. Based on the volumetric proximity of energetically-close phases, we identify systems in which volume-changing deformations may facilitate transformation toughening. Subsequently, chemistry- and phase-structure-related trends in the elastic stiffness and ductility are predicted using elastic-constants-based descriptors. The analysis of directional Cauchy pressures and Young&#39;s moduli allows comparing mechanical response parallel and normal to M–B/A layers. The suggested promising MABs include Nb 3 AlB 4 , Cr 2 SiB 2 , Mn 2 SiB 2 or the already synthesised MoAlB.},

The macroscopic shock response characteristic was determined through a series of plane impact tests, which included the Hugoniot curves of the composite.

The transgranular fracture in large grains and intergranular fracture in small grains exhibit obvious local plastic deformation characteristics. Moreover, the presence of second-phase SiC particles markedly influences both crack propagation and the microfracture mode of the composite.

Moreover, the potential correlations between energy indices and high-temperature performance of rejuvenated bitumen are explored. Our findings show that recycling agents can effectively reinstate the cohesive energy density (CED) values of aged bitumen, correlating well with their high-temperature rheological properties. The results reveal that the energy parameters of potential energy (U V E P ), kinetic energy (U W E K ), non-bond energy (E N ), total energy (U V E T ), diagonal energy (U N E D ), and cross-terms energy (E CT ) can reflect the restoration level of recycling agents (RAs) on atomic-level energy characteristics of aged bitumen. Compared to rutting failure temperature (RFT), elastic recovery (R 3.2 ), and creep compliance (J nr3.2 ), the zero-shear viscosity (ZSV) greatly correlates with CED. Meanwhile, the U W E K index from MD simulations demonstrates a strong correlation with high-temperature rheological indicators of rejuvenated bitumen. With the rise in U W E K , there is a linear decrease in the RFT, Log(ZSV), and R 3.2 values of rejuvenated bitumen. Conversely, the Log(J nr3.2 ) exhibits a linear increasing trend. However, the correlation patterns between rheological indicators and either E N or E CT are contingent on the aging degree of bitumen. Based on the correlation coefficient, the U W E K stands out as the primary choice among all energy indices for predicting high-temperature rheological performance of rejuvenated bitumen.},

This study explored PCL as the core and PVA as the shell. Core/shell scaffolds displayed favorable wettability (contact angle: 67.0° ± 1.3) and improved mechanical properties (wet state tensile strength: PVA 1.1 ± 0.2 MPa, PVA/PCL-Saponin 2.0 ± 0.5 MPa).

Subcutaneous implantation in rats showed no significant inflammation after one week. Eventually, in the animal model, the conduit containing Saponin was more effective than Tween 80 in repairing the rat&#39;s sciatic nerve within six weeks, as evidenced by NF-200 counts and histological studies.

  abstract     = {Facing the current lack of clarity in temperature selection mechanisms for warm rolling in medium Mn steel, three warm rolling methods were conducted in 3Mn steel according to the rolling temperatures in the dual-phases region or ferrite region. Subsequently, the effect of heat treatment on the austenite morphologies and tensile properties of warm-rolling samples was studied. Rolling in dual-phase regions (750 °C) led to heterogeneous austenite morphology composed of equiaxed and lamellar grains while rolling in the ferrite region (600 °C) resulted in significant cementite precipitation and the absence of retained austenite. Warm rolling promoted the formation of dislocation cells in the lath-like grains, and they did not evolve into grain boundaries completely because low deformation temperature didn’t trigger the complete dynamic recrystallization. Tempering after rolling provided a significant enhancement in plasticity through the enrichment of C and Mn in austenite and the formation of multiple heterogeneous austenite morphologies with equiaxed, coarse lath-like and fine lamellar grains. In addition, superlattice structures in the matrix are formed through the formation of stacking fault networks and the spinodal decomposition.

  abstract     = {Actuators are largely used in biomedical applications in the presence of sensitive live cells or biomolecules, which makes actuators triggered by water uptake highly appealing. Dual-material printing and hydration driven expansion is a method of choice to produce such actuators, but mostly rely of non-degradable polymers or on the combination of polymers of different nature that may lead to interface incompatibilities. To overcome this challenge, we report here on two photocrosslinkable resins based on a single family of degradable hydrophilic or hydrophobic star-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide) copolymers. The two materials are first printed individually and characterized to ensure that their properties enable the printing of dual material objects by stereolithographic digital-light processing. Dual-materials actuators are then printed by sequential switching of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic resin baths. Objects of simple and complex shapes are easily obtained and exhibit rapid actuation (&lt;60 s) upon hydration. The swelling-induced shape changes are accurately reproduced by numerical modeling of the printed geometries using the obtained material swelling properties. This set of results offers new perspectives to develop 4D-printed temporary medical devices.},

However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the optimal feedstock form. Thus, this study investigated the influence of feedstock shape on material formation, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The results revealed that irrespective of whether a strip or wire was used, the plasticized material flowed through a thin plastic flow channel (approximately 112 μm) between the tool head and the feedstock. Wire feedstock resulted in greater deformation and more significant grain refinement than strip feedstock, with grain refinements of 95 % and 81 %, respectively. Additionally, gaps between multiple wires were filled with plasticized material, forming a dense and defect-free mixing zone. Moreover, the tensile performances of the deposited samples obtained from wire and strip feedstocks exhibited no significant differences, measuring 143.9 MPa and 144.5 MPa, respectively. Numerical simulations were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the temperature field and material flow behavior when strips and wires were used as feed materials. The findings of this study are anticipated to serve as a reference for selecting feedstock forms for FRAM.},

Currently, high-efficiency low-toxicity management of this intractable disease is highly urgent. Here, a drug-backboned polymer, polyglycyrrhetinic acid (PGA), was synthesized through the condensation of GA, a principal anti-inflammatory component of Glycyrrhiza glabra . PGA was then used as a therapeutic polyprodrug carrier to fabricate carrier-free PGA@Cel nanoparticles (NPs) for treating rheumatoid arthritis. The as-prepared NPs exhibited a uniformly spherical morphology with an average particle size of approximately 180 nm and a celastrol (Cel) loading capacity of around 4.5 %. Upon intravenous injection, the NPs demonstrated prolonged blood circulation, efficient accumulation at inflammatory joints through extravasation via leaky vasculature and subsequent inflammatory cell-mediated sequestration (ELVIS) effect. The present study demonstrated enhanced anti-inflammatory and rheumatic decay efficiency in rat models of antigen-induced arthritis, while simultaneously minimizing off-target toxicity. Overall, our results elucidate that this carrier-free drug-backboned nanopolydrug platform provides a promising strategy for RA therapy.},

  abstract     = {Adequate substance exchange is an important prerequisite for tissue repair, and how to efficiently establish mature vascular networks to enhance the graft-host substance exchange is a challenge. Herein, inspired by the special structure of the aquatic plant “Ludwigia sedioides”, ultra-thin microporous scaffolds (TMS) of bovine Achilles tendon derived collagen were fabricated as “floating leaves” via pyridine reaction, and cleverly combined with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after the Schiff base and Michael additions reactions of polydopamine to construct a biomimetic “Ludwigia sedioides” spacer (PTMS@P), allowing blood vessels (as a “rhizome”) freely shuttling and substance exchange. In this spacer, growth factors were efficiently released to peak concentrations in the first 12 h, thereby facilitating rapid blood vessel growth. In the subsequent 96 h, these slow-released growth factors retained at 11.6 % to 45.8 % of the peak concentrations, sustainedly promoting vascular networks shuttling through the spacer, graft-host substance exchange and extracellular matrix synthesis in fibroblasts. In vitro, the spacer significantly fostered fibroblasts and endothelial cells’ proliferation, adhesion and migration, which were fundamental for revascularization and substance exchange. Immunohistochemical staining of CD31 and Ki67 in vivo demonstrated that abundant vascular networks shuttled through PTMS@P and extended from flap base to the farther flap body, promoting more robust substance exchange and cellular metabolism, which significantly enhanced the survival of ischemic flaps in nude mice. Altogether, this “Ludwigia sedioides” inspired spacer PTMS@P with strengthened revascularization and substance-exchange functionality holds promising applications for tissue repair and regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy via laser powder-bed fusion leads to non-equilibrium α ′ α′ martensitic microstructures, with high strength but poor ductility and toughness. These properties may be modified by heat treatments, whereby the α ′ α′ phase decomposes into equilibrium α + β α+β structures, while possibly conserving microstructural features and length scales of the α ′ α′ lath structure. Here, we combine experimental and computational methods to explore the kinetics of martensite decomposition. Experiments rely on in-situ characterisation (electron microscopy and diffraction) during multi-step heat treatment from 400 ∘ C up to the alloy β -transus temperature (995 ∘ C). Computational simulations rely on an experimentally-informed computationally-efficient phase-field model. Experiments confirmed that as-built microstructures were fully composed of martensitic α ′ α′ laths. During martensite decomposition, nucleation of the β phase occurs primarily along α ′ α′ lath boundaries, with traces of β nucleation along crystalline defects. Phase-field results, using electron backscatter diffraction maps of as-built microstructures as initial conditions, are compared directly with in-situ characterisation data. Experiments and simulations confirmed that, while full decomposition into stable α + β α+β phases may be complete at 650 ∘ C provided sufficient annealing time, visible morphological evolution of the microstructure was only observed for T ≥ 700 T≥700 ∘ C, without modification of the prior- β grain structure.},

  abstract     = {Voxel modeling is a technique in which an object is represented by an array of cubes. One advantage in design-for-manufacturing is that selected voxels may be assigned desired responsive properties through additive manufacturing. It allows for achieving reversible shape transformation in soft responsive self-repairing solids within a strategic sequence. The first step in the sequence involves selecting an equivalent geometric shape. The second step involves mapping shapes to preserve properties during continuous deformation. The third step involves transforming the shape from one form to another. The fourth step involves defining changes in dimensions. The final step involves correlating the flow of stress with the stretch of the solid. This research also considers self-repair or self-healing as part of the transformation process because the splitting or joining of solids involves continuous deformation. The newly transformed shape can also be considered as the intermediate shape, or first shape for next transformation. This leads to a chain of shapes that are topologically equivalent, and interchangeable. The iterative steps involved in shape transformation finds applications in topology optimization, generative design, metastructures, among others. One application of shape transformation in these domains is that it serves as an alternative to material reduction techniques.},

In this paper, a multifunctional hybrid plate lattice structure denoted as SBHP is proposed by hybridizing the traditional body-centered cubic plate (BCCP) and simple cubic plate (SCP) lattice structures, and its acoustic and energy absorption properties are investigated by theoretical modeling, simulation analysis and experimental verification. The effects of hole diameters and plate thicknesses on the sound absorption performance are investigated by impedance matching and system damping state analysis. The results show that the average sound absorption coefficient of SBHP-1 is increased by 24% and 62%, and the normalized half-absorption bandwidth is enlarged by 45% and 89% than those of BCCP and SCP, respectively. Heterogeneous lattice structures constructed by using the synergistic mechanism of strong and weak coupling have a more outstanding broadband sound absorption effect.

Optimization of the static and vibration suppression properties is achieved using the assembly concept. The static properties of the proposed meta-materials are initially investigated using the finite element method (FEM) and static compression tests. The results demonstrate that the N-SSHM exhibits a superior load-bearing capacity compared to the T-SSHM. Subsequently, the vibration properties of the meta-material are studied using simulations and experiments. The wave propagation characteristics of the meta-materials are explored by introducing the phase velocity and group velocity. The study also examines the effects of design parameters (ring size, metal pin size, and pin material) on the bandgap characteristics, and the vibration suppression properties of the meta-material are further enhanced by introducing particle damping. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed N-SSHM has a lower starting frequency and wider bandwidth for the bandgap than the T-SSHM. In summary, the N-SSHM demonstrates significant improvements in both load-bearing and vibration suppression compared to the T-SSHM.

This method can potentially eliminate absorption valley and improve the coupling strength through a synergistic energy dissipation mechanism and hybrid impedance matching behavior. Excellent sound-absorbing capability of the elaborately crafted HPAM was demonstrated analytically, numerically, and experimentally. Specifically, the results revealed an impressive average absorption coefficient of 0.77, with 73 % of the α points exceeding 0.8 across the entire test frequency range. Furthermore, the sound absorption of HPAM can be further optimized to attain ultra-broadband properties by modifying the hierarchical configuration and composite design of the porous materials. The physical mechanism is revealed through the integration of the hierarchical scaling effect and the energy-trapped mode. Numerical simulations revealed the emergence of three distinct absorption peaks at frequencies of 0.76, 1.4, and 3.6 kHz, respectively, and the effective absorption spectrum exceeded 3.4 kHz. Overall, the proposed design highlights the role of hierarchical structures and porous materials in synthesizing superior sound-absorbing properties that fully elucidate the relationship between structure and performance, and provide an avenue for potential noise-control applications.},

The oxide scale shows a complex multi-layer structure, where the Al 2 O 3 layer and continuous dense nitride layer act as protective layers against diffusion and metal oxidation. The oxidation mechanisms are discussed thermodynamically and kinetically. Compared with Nb, Ta is more significant in inhibiting diffusion and promoting the formation of the protective continuous nitride layer, thus being more effective in improving the oxidation resistance of cast TiAl alloy.

FGM lattices with gradient directions parallel and vertical to the compressive loading were respectively designated as FGM-P and FGM-V lattices. The results showed that the FCCZ lattice exhibited higher compressive properties than the cubic lattice did. The fracture modes of FCCZ and cubic lattices were respectively ∼45° shear fracture and layer-by-layer fracture. The FGM-V lattice exhibited higher specific energy absorption at 50 % strain than the FCCZ and cubic lattices did by 7.6 % and 19.4 %, respectively. This phenomenon can be attributed to the effective alleviation of strain localization in the FGM-V lattice postponing the fracture. Furthermore, the specific energy absorptions of PBF-LB\M Corrax lattices were comparable to those of PBF-LB\M Ti-based alloy lattices in the literature. Thus, the PBF-LB\M Corrax lattice appears to be a potential low-cost material for high-performance and lightweight structural applications. This lattice design extends the flexibility of additive manufactured lattices and provides a specific guideline for further improving their mechanical performances.},

  abstract     = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) gains increasing interest due to its cost-effectiveness. However, concerns arise regarding inherent MEX characteristics potentially affecting mechanical properties. This study investigates the effects of shot peening and heat treatment on MEX 17-4PH stainless steel. After shot peening, surface nanocrystalline and compressive residual stress are induced. Aging results in higher hardness and tensile strength with lower elongation, while shot peening results in higher surface hardness with minimal change in elongation. For fatigue properties of as-sintered specimens, Al 2 O 3 particle contamination dominates at high cycle regimes, while other MEX surface inhomogeneities dominate at low cycle regimes. Furthermore, as-aged properties are dominated by all surface inhomogeneities, resulting in the non-improvement of fatigue performance compared to the as-sintered specimens. However, shot peening on the as-sintered specimens significantly enhances fatigue properties through the formation of surface nanocrystalline structures and the induction of compressive residual stress, albeit with the occurrence of wrapped corners acting as fatigue crack initiation sites. Remarkably, the combination of aging and shot peening yields the most improvement in fatigue performance, exhibiting behaviours akin to as-sintered specimens with shot peening but without the generation of wrapped corners. Instead, fatigue crack initiation sites shift to subsurface region’s inhomogeneities.},

Lower temperatures are expected to have little to no effect on mechanical properties even after very long holds at these temperatures. This article, however, demonstrates that new precipitates grow and cause a noticeable hardening effect in solution-annealed AM maraging steel after only a 6-hour hold at a temperature of 350 °C. High-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy (HRSEM, HRTEM) was used to identify the new precipitates. Very fine coherent microdomains containing mainly nickel and molybdenum layers were found. Particles of a new phase, Al0.5CNi3Ti0.5, were also detected. Additionally, various precipitates were also found in both the as-built and the AM solution-annealed maraging steel samples. Precipitates such as Ni3Ti, Al0.3Ni0.35Ti0.35 and Al2O5Ti, were also observed in the as-built condition. After subsequent solution annealing at 820 °C additional Ni3Mo particles and another type of Ti-rich particles, Ni4Ti3, were further found in the AM steel microstructure. The additional new phases which precipitated during the final hardening at 350 °C caused an 18 % (200 MPa) increase in strength.},

  abstract     = {Metallic coatings are widely employed to improve the oxidation resistance of superalloys. However, the interdiffusion between the metallic coatings and the superalloys leads to microstructural degradation in both. Some of the underlying degradation mechanisms are still elusive, e.g., the γ′ (Ni 3 Al) phase depletion in superalloys, where a large amount of γ′ precipitates are dissolved in the γ matrix even though the incoming Al from coatings indeed increases the Al content. Here, we investigated the interdiffusion behavior between the Amdry365 coating and the IN792 superalloy at 1100 °C, using multiple microscopic techniques and thermodynamics calculations. Our results showed an excellent agreement between experiments and thermodynamics simulations, indicating the dominant role of Al on the initial diffusion-induced phase transitions. We proposed the Al-Cr interference effect to account for the pile-up behavior of Cr and the reduced Al content near the coating/superalloy interface. The local phase equilibrium calculations revealed that the γ′ depletion in the superalloy is primarily attributed to the loss of γ′-forming elements, such as Ta and Ti. Our findings opened up an avenue for studies on the superalloy/coating interdiffusion, contributing to reducing this damaging impact.},

The doping Mn ion is stabilized in the tetravalent state and occupies the Sb 5+ site. After the Sc 3+ -In 3+ substitution, the emission characteristic of the original Mg 2 InSbO 6 :Mn 4+ is regulated and effectively red-shifted, and the extruded [MnO 6 ] octahedron present distorted due to the aberration of the near-neighboring lattice sites of Mn 4+ . Through the Sc 3+ -In 3+ substitution and Li + compensation, the optimal thermal stability at 423 K is enhanced by 19.1% compared with that of Mg 2 InSbO 6 :Mn 4+ .

Advances in process modelling techniques have enabled the prediction of defects. However, the high computational cost of these tools limits their usefulness in an industrial context as they often struggle with the ever-increasing size of industrial structures, and present significant challenges to undertaking large optimisation problems. In this work, a recently proposed homogenisation scheme is used to accurately simulate the autoclave processing of a composite part of industrial complexity in a fraction of the time of other state-of-the-art processes. Physical manufacture of a demonstrator part is used to evaluate the model in terms of accuracy. Based on the observed good agreement (discrepancy of less than 1.5% in the thicker sections and less than 7% in the thinner region of the part), a data-driven optimisation of the part’s caul plate has been conducted that aims to mitigate defects whilst keeping cost and material use low. Further manufacturing trials validate the proposed framework by demonstrating successful defect elimination and a 25% improvement in the maximum local deviation from ideal design.},

The identification of significant heat accumulation can be used for part quality monitoring to inform the design process, enhance the quality of printed parts, and optimize the process parameters. This study aims to efficiently identify heat accumulation with affordable in-situ infrared imaging for further characterization and mitigation to enhance the quality of printed parts. A computational framework employing machine learning is developed to identify zones of local heat accumulation in real time. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by experiments conducted on a build with a wide variety of geometrical features.

This study proposes a machine learning (ML)-based predictive modeling framework to predict the entire stress–strain curves, compressive modulus, and energy absorption of lattice structures with varying structure and process parameters. Feature engineering techniques are used to transform raw data into new data representations compatible with ML models, including artificial neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Two novel feature representations, including polygons and colormaps, are developed to transform structure and process parameters from tabular format into image format for CNN. The LSTM model that predicts stress–strain curves achieves a minimum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.147. The CNN (colormap) model achieves a minimum MAPE of 0.174 when predicting compressive modulus. The ANN and LSTM models achieve a minimum MAPE of 0.068 when predicting energy absorption.

The chosen approach involved employing a novel Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at cryogenic temperatures (CT), in which the temperature was strictly controlled, followed by subsequent ageing. Post-ECAP ageing at 400 °C for 15 min resulted in a substantial enhancement in yield strength in CT-processed specimens, with a remarkable increase of 22% in comparison to their pre-aged counterparts. Additionally, ageing under these conditions yielded a more stable microstructure at elevated temperatures, with average grain size variation below to 1 μm. The observed stability was attributed to the formation of fine Cr-rich precipitates during ageing that hinder grain boundary motion, thereby preventing grain growth and potential softening of the CuCrZr alloy. These findings elucidate a promising thermomechanical processing avenue for strengthening microstructures processed by cryogenic severe plastic deformation and/or exposure to elevated temperatures. Finally, the adopted processing route in this study not only facilitated but distinctly culminated in attaining the paramount strength/ductility relationship for CuCrZr alloys with a stable microstructure at medium-to-high temperature range.},

By performing high-throughput CALPHAD calculations to obtain the temperature differences between liquidus and solidus phases (ΔT) and employing gradient descent optimization to identify local minima in ΔT surface, we obtained a reliable dataset for EHEAs across 5–6 component alloy families, which effectively addresses current limitations in both the quality and availability of EHEA data. In conjunction with literature-based experimental data, this dataset serves as the foundation for ML models trained with an XGBoost classifier. The physical descriptors with the most significant effects on the classification of eutectics and non-eutectics are identified. Our study reveals that configurational entropy alone yields a remarkable 98% classification accuracy, elucidating its dual role in phase stabilization and melting point depression. For the first time, an explicit phase selection rule to identify eutectics has been derived from an artificial neural network model, which facilitates efficiently screening EHEAs without resorting to CALPHAD nor ML models.

For structural application though, this potential has not yet been realized, mostly because of hardly superior mechanical properties and elevated alloying costs. To overcome this hurdle, efforts have been made to increase mechanical properties using individual strengthening mechanisms, such as grain refinement, prior plastic deformation, precipitation hardening, and solid solution strengthening. In this study, we aim to combine multiple of these mechanisms into a singular alloy by adding V and C to the Fe 30 Mn 10 Co 10 Cr (at.-%) alloy. Using a custom calphad database, thermodynamic calculations were carried out to determine a suitable chemical composition which was subsequently cast and thermo-mechanically processed. Aging treatments above 700 °C for 4–24 h led to vanadium carbide precipitation, increasing the yield strength by up to 450 MPa to nearly 1 GPa. Extensive aging times were necessary to facilitate precipitation, thereby indicating slow diffusion processes. A transition from twinning-induced to transformation-induced plasticity by vanadium carbide precipitation was observed and attributed to the reduction of C-content and stacking fault energy in the matrix as well as twin-precipitate interactions.},

  abstract     = {Impact toughness is essential for evaluating the mechanical properties of ship hull steels. This study focused on understanding the embrittlement mechanism of NiAl precipitation-strengthened HSLA steels by integrating advanced characterization and atomic-scale calculations. The factors causing the deterioration of the impact toughness of NiAl precipitation-strengthened steels, which have been contentious, were identified. The embrittlement mechanism and crack propagation mode were revealed using first-principles calculations and 3D impact fracture morphology, respectively. The results suggested that the numerous homogeneous NiAl nanoparticles within the bcc-Fe matrix reduced the impact toughness of the HSLA steels. As the precipitate interparticle spacing ( L ) decreased, the impact toughness decreased until it attained a critical value (∼27 nm). This is interpreted effectively by the calculations indicating that the shear modulus (75 GPa) and fracture energy (4.5 J/m 2 ) of the NiAl phase, particularly the NiAlMn phase (46 GPa, 4 J/m 2 ), are significantly lower than those of bcc-Fe (83 GPa, 5 J/m 2 ). This induces the fracture of nanoparticles under rapid impact loading, which functions as numerous crack initiations before plastic deformation of the matrix. The small L achieved after peak-hardening aging can result in the interconnection of these crack sources and cause instantaneous cleavage fractures, similar to brittle materials.},

Therefore, it is crucial to achieve the decomposition of α&#39; martensite and improve the ductility. However, the reverse transformation behavior and its mechanism of the β phase, as well as its stability remain unclear. Our findings demonstrate that the reverse transformation behavior of the β phase follows a diffusion-controlled process. The decomposition of α&#39; martensite into α + β initiates at approximately 550 ℃, while the transformation from α to β phase occurs around 870 ℃. Increasing temperature leads to an increase in reverse-transformed β phase. The retention of these reverse-transformed β phases at room temperature also depends on their stability, which exhibits a significant correlation with V element partitioning. Additionally, this study reveals a critical temperature (840 ℃) at which the maximum volume fraction (18.6 %) of retained β phase is obtained, exhibiting exceptional mechanical properties, particularly the uniform elongation surpassing those observed in an as-printed microstructure of LPBF-ed Ti-6Al-4V alloy.},

In the present work, a new series of (TiZr) 95-x Hf x Mo 5 (x = 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 31.67) multi-principal elements alloys (MPEAs) have been designed for potential implant materials. The mechanical properties, deformation characteristics, tribological properties, corrosion resistance, and in vitro biocompatibility of the MPEAs were characterized. All the TiZrHfMo alloys possess a high yield strength (913–––1083 MPa) and tensile strength (931–––1118 MPa) and a large microhardness (296–––333 Hv). The addition of Hf into the alloys induced severe lattice distortion, which increased the solid-solution strengthening effect. It also resulted in a finer grain size and led to excellent wear resistance. Meanwhile, the results showed that the dislocation glide mode transformed from planar slip to cross-slip and the transformation became apparent with the decrease of Hf. Also, the MPEAs showed a good corrosion resistance compared to CP-Ti, which was credited to the superior passivation films. The in vitro biocompatibility experiments displayed that the TiZrHfMo alloys exhibited high cell viability ratios, which were close to that of CP-Ti. The present work demonstrates the huge potential of TiZrHfMo MPEAs as implant material for biomedical applications.},

The microstructural evolution of the γ ′ γ′ precipitates during cooling after solution heat-treatment was investigated by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Vickers microhardness tests were performed on the samples that were interrupted at different temperatures to establish a relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties. The results revealed that the secondary γ ′ γ′ precipitates preferentially nucleated at a higher temperature, and gradually grew during the cooling stage. Meanwhile, the morphology of the secondary γ ′ γ′ precipitates transitioned from spherical to cubic, to rounded cuboidal, to a butterfly-like shape, and ultimately splitting into octo-cubes, whose driving force was attributed to the mutual competition between surface energy and elastic strain energy. During the initial stages of the cooling process, the microhardness decreased due to the growth and coarsening of the secondary γ ′ γ′ precipitates. As the temperature decreased, the supersaturation within the matrix became sufficient to overcome the energy barrier for a second burst of nucleation, the tertiary γ ′ γ′ phases precipitated, resulting in an increase in microhardness.},

Despite the fact that interfacial healing mechanisms during HCB have been extensively investigated, the interfacial healing mechanisms in duplex superalloys still need to be clarified. This article investigates effect of deformation temperature on multiple interface (γ′-γ′, γ-γ, γ-γ′) healing mechanism of dual-phase superalloys. The healing mechanism of γ-γ interface at different temperatures involves a necklace-like distribution of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) grains occupying original interface. With increasing deformation temperature, the healing mechanism of γ′-γ′ interface transforms from DDRX to diffusion bonding due to weakening of strain concentration. Simultaneously, as deformation temperature increases, the deformation mechanism of primary γ′ phase transforms from shearing by stacking fault to dislocation pairs. At deformation temperature 1100 °C, the healing mechanism of γ′-γ interface is heterogeneous epitaxial recrystallization (HERX) induced by primary γ′ phase driven by diffusion of Cr element in dislocation pairs. However, as deformation temperature decreases, healing mechanism in γ′-γ interface transforms into DDRX. Although interfacial healing mechanism is transformed at different deformation temperatures, the synergistic action of different recrystallization mechanisms ensures that mechanical properties of joints reached the same level as those of base material.},

The impacts of the microstructural changes on the mechanical performances, including hardness, plasticity, interfacial adhesion, and environmental stability, were essential for the deformation and crack propagation of the coatings. Their performances and lubrication mechanisms were concerned under heavy loads, in a wide range of temperatures, and in corrosive marine environments. Finally, the study concluded the basic requirements of metal-based coatings for extreme environments at this stage.

Moreover, some desirable properties are mutually exclusive, presenting challenges for materials design. Herein, we employed an active learning strategy to address the strength-ductility trade-off in SAC105 lead-free solders. We developed two Gaussian regression models, one for strength and one for elongation representing ductility. The Gaussian Upper Confidence Boundary algorithm, a Bayesian optimization method, was used to balance exploitation and exploration by considering prediction uncertainty. The variance weight was designed to decay with adaptive iterations. The two models were linearly combined and the maximal combined model recommended alloys on the Pareto front for experiments. After just three iterations, a new 91.4Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu-1.5Bi-4.4In-0.2Ti low-silver SAC solder was discovered, exhibiting 73.94±5.05 MPa strength and 24.37±5.92% elongation, representing the best comprehensive mechanical properties. Weldability experiments also showed excellent performance. Based on Ab initio molecular dynamics, a precise machine learning potential revealed the alloying mechanism in Sn-In solid solutions with quantum accuracy in systems of over 10 3 atoms, closely matching experimental X-ray diffraction pattern.

In this study, A series of all-atom models of the interface between carbon fibers (CF) and calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) were established and molecular dynamics simulations was used to investigate fiber pullout and uniaxial tensile response in the matrix. By incorporating graphene oxide (GO) sheets within the interface, the damage strength and critical energy release rate of the C-S-H and carbon fibers interface were significantly improved, with increases of 22.64% to 63.81% and 37.18% to 43.90%, respectively. Furthermore, the role of hydrogen bonding and interatomic interactions in resisting interfacial damage is clarified with delving into the intermolecular interactions inside the interface.

Non-planar layers may address this problem; however, their complexity hinder automatic trajectory generation. This paper presents an algorithm for slicing part models and defining trajectories in axisymmetric layers using parametric curves as generatrix for surface creation. The algorithm is based on two coordinate systems, the Cartesian coordinate system { c } {c} and a slicing coordinate system { s } {s} . Thus, by defining planar layers in { s } {s} , the model can be sliced with non-planar uniform layers parallel to the build platform. Commercial software was used to define these planar layers in { s } {s} . To validate the methodology, two case studies have been defined and validated in a robotized additive manufacturing cell. The precision of this implementation has been validated by simulating the extrusion of material in the generated trajectories while measuring the distance between the extruder and the build platform. The results show how the variation in this measurement is dependent on the complexity of the geometry but consistent with repetitions, obtaining values of uncertainty ranging from ± 250 to ± 350[μm].

Combining Cu alloys with stainless steel is appealing for components necessitating high thermal / electrical conductivity in some areas and high strength and corrosion resistance in others. In this work, CuCrZr-316L samples were fabricated with a recoater allowing for deposition of two powders within a layer. As-printed samples exhibit significant intermixing and two types of defects: porosity in CuCrZr and steel cracking near the interface. Subsequent hot isostatic pressing (HIP) effectively addressed these issues by closing pores and healing cracks. Despite an overall softening, CuCrZr stays harder near the interface thanks to a very fine-grained structure retained after HIP. Alternatively, when CuCrZr powder near the interface is left unmelted and subsequently sintered, regions with small equiaxed grains and Cr-rich precipitates are formed, which exhibit properties similar to those of printed and HIPed CuCrZr. Hence, locally leaving powder unmelted and sintering it proved to be a successful strategy for producing defect-free 316L-CuCrZr components via PBF-LB, provided an airtight enclosure is ensured through proper design considerations.},

Additionally, the comparison between the developed metamaterials and star-shaped cellular structures on the mechanical properties was conducted using six groups of samples. The results demonstrated that the developed metamaterials exhibited remarkable superiority in deformability, sensitivity, and auxeticity.

However, design challenge remains in the balance of multiple functionalities. Here, we combine the sandwich structure with the neck-embedded cavities to design a cellular metamaterial having sound-absorption, compression/impact resistance and energy harvesting functionalities. For sound absorption, an autoencoder-like neural network is constructed to generate an instant design, after which a probabilistic module is inserted to optimize it by searching solutions in a slightly expanded design space. This inverse design has been experimentally validated, showing broadband sound absorption from 400 to 650 Hz merely with nine ultra-thin resonators. Beyond serving as absorber, the resonant cavities, once installed with well-tuned piezoelectric membranes, can gather broadband acoustic energy at low frequencies. Additionally, the cellular metamaterial inherits the excellent mechanical properties of honeycomb cores, having a low density of 0.64 g/cm 3 yet displaying a high yield strength (21.2 MPa) in out-of-plane compression test and a superior energy absorption capability (8.6 J/cm 3 ) in low-velocity impact tests.

This work synthesizes HMNPs-C 60 -N-GQDs-SS-PEI (HMNPs:Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @mSiO 2 -C 18 ) nanoparticles, integrating diverse functionalities for enhanced cancer therapy. The inclusion of SiO 2 and C 60 significantly improves the loading efficiency of gallic acid (GA).

Introduction of Polyethyleneimine (PEI) imparts positive charge to facilitate accumulation on negatively charged tumor surfaces and enhances biocompatibility. Additionally, the fluorescence properties of N-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) facilitate real-time monitoring of material distribution in vivo during mouse and clinical therapy. Furthermore, the nano-magnetic targeting material demonstrates efficient drug loading and precise control over drug release, addressing issues such as the poor biocompatibility and high biotoxicity associated with traditional materials.

That is why adaptive structures have received increasing attention, especially in robotics, aerospace, automotive, and biomedical engineering. Current adaptive structures require significant active actuations and controls, factors that add to their complexity, weight, and production costs. In contrast, most biological adaptive systems respond to external stimuli in a passive-automatic way. Here, inspired by a striking biological example, i.e. insect wings and specifically their vein-joints, we develop structures in which adaptability is determined by the presence of a network of bioinspired compliant joints. By systematically changing the key geometric parameters of the bioinspired joints, we show that they can be designed in a variety of patterns to passively control the adaptability of the structures under loading. We further test the performance of the bioinspired joints in practice.

Using 316L stainless steel as the raw material, a series of specimens were fabricated employing additive manufacturing technology. Corresponding finite element models were established using Abaqus. Then the experimental and numerical investigations were conducted to analyze the deformation behavior of these structures subjected to quasi-static compression. Further numerical research was conducted to analyze the mechanical properties of multi-cell hollow sphere structures with varied parameters, including wall thickness, perforation diameter, and ellipsoid ratio. The results confirmed that a perforation diameter of 4 mm resulted in optimal performance for the SPHS. In comparison to the basic structure SHS with identical relative density, this configuration exhibited a 60 % higher specific yield strength. Additionally, for SHES, when the ellipsoid ratio exceeded 1 while less than 1.8, the specific yield strength demonstrated a maximum increase of 69 % ∼ 105 % and the maximum enhancement in specific energy absorption was 60 % ∼ 85 %.},

In this paper, a simplified transport-mechanical model is proposed to numerically analyze the deterioration of concrete prism under ESA and dry-wet cycles. Firstly, a transport model of sulfate ion in concrete prism is established by considering the behaviors of ion diffusion, convection and chemical reaction, and numerically solved by the finite difference method. Secondly, the crystallization pressure of sulfate products in porous system is analyzed to calculate the equivalent expansion force. Then, the expansion strain and its-induced damage are calculated, and the criterion of boundary movement is further proposed. On the basis of model validation, a numerical simulation is performed to analyze the transport-mechanical response in concrete prism under ESA and dry-wet cycles. The results show that, there is no clear demarcation between the convection and diffusion zones in the prism. The spatial–temporal evolution of ESA-induced damage is similar to that of ion concentration. The longer the wetting time in one dry-wet cycles, the deeper the spalling of concrete prism caused by ESA.},

The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively segments and reconstructs unclear raw CT slice images, providing a convenient and advanced tool for accurately assessing the meso -scale structures of cement bridges and voids in PCBM prepared with different combinations of cement content and compaction force. An increased cement content or compaction force results in the migration of cement paste, leading to thicker localized cement bridges and blockage of permeable pore space. This phenomenon further disrupts the homogeneous distribution of cement bridges and voids. An increased compaction force tends to elongate and flatten pore throats, while an increased cement content may clog voids, rendering them impermeable. The vertical permeability of the PCBM is significantly greater than the horizontal permeability, which should be considered during material design optimization. The proposed method could serve as a reference for microscopic analysis and structural design optimization of PCBM.},

However, it remains a key challenge to realize excellent sensitivity and high resolution. Herein, a series of La 2 MgTiO 6 :Dy 3+ ,Mn 4+ phosphors are developed and the related energy transfer between Dy 3+ →Mn 4+ is discovered. The coupling distance between Mn 4+ and adjacent ligands is greatly affected by temperature. However, the energy differences between the emission energy levels and lower energy levels of Dy 3+ hinder the multi-phonon relaxation process, which moderates the thermal quenching rate of Dy 3+ . Therefore, highly sensitive FIR thermometers are built according to the significant discrimination temperature dependence of Dy 3+ and Mn 4+ . The maximum S a and S r reach 0.022 K −1 (@563 K) and 2.622 %K −1 (@544 K). In contrast, a thermometer based on the emission lifetime of Mn 4+ is fabricated, which is extremely sensitive to temperature. Interestingly, Dy 3+ can effectively promote the quenching of Mn 4+ , and then improve the sensitivity. The maximum S r enhances from 1.621 %K −1 (@503 K) to 2.305 %K −1 (@480 K). The high sensitivity and resolution of the dual-mode fluorescence thermometry have exceeded most of the current optical thermal measurement materials.

This work demonstrates a novel correlative microscopy approach for characterising creep cavitation and establishing correlations with local microstructural parameters in a statistical manner. This approach combines datasets from stitched higher-resolution backscattered electron (BSE) images, XeF 2 Focused Ion Beam (FIB) images, and backscattered electron diffraction (EBSD) maps with advanced image correlation techniques. Deep-learning image segmentation techniques and statistical analysis are applied to find relations between creep cavitation and local microstructural environment. This approach is demonstrated in a cyclic creep-tested 316H stainless steel specimen with extensive creep cavities. The results show that in this material, strain localization, grain boundary misorientation, and substantial precipitation dominate the nucleation of cavities, whereas other microstructural properties such as grain size and Schmid factor play smaller roles. This study presents the use of the correlative microscopy approach to provide new insights into creep cavitation behaviour and its implications for establishing creep cavitation damage models.},

These deficiencies significantly limit its potential application in pathologic bone defect therapy. In this work, we constructed a hydrogel scaffold mimicking the dynamic features of ECM with the combination of antimicrobial and osteogenic capabilities as well, to investigate its applications in the therapy of infected radial defects. The hydrogel scaffold enables not only minimally invasive implantation but also adaptability and adhesion to irregular defect shapes. Both in vitro and in vivo assays have indicated that the hydrogel scaffold could rapidly eradicate bacteria, restore the infection-induced localized inflammatory microenvironment. Further loading osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) to recruit stem cells promotes osteogenic differentiation and ultimately enhances bone regeneration in the defect region. In summary, our work indicated that hydrogels with ECM-related inherent bioactivities and dynamic inner structures represent a feasible solution as a tissue bionic substitute for the therapy of infected bone defects.},

However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. This study introduced two biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics with different surface architecture, finding that compared to micron-scale counterparts (BCP2, ∼3.07 μm), BCP with submicron-scale structure (BCP1, ∼0.66 μm) enhanced ectopic bone formation and facilitated M2 macrophage polarization in vivo . Previous studies have focused predominantly on soluble cytokines secreted by macrophages, the significance of exosomes in intercellular communication has been overlooked. This study isolated exosomes from macrophages treated with either submicron- or micron-scale surfaces, designated as B1-Exos and B2-Exos, respectively. Notably, B1-Exos could significantly improve osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), potentially attributable to miRNA cargos within these exosomes. SmallRNA sequencing, western blotting, qRT-PCR, and bioinformatics analyses indicated that submicron-sized BCP1 ceramic markedly elevated miR-142a-5p levels in macrophage-derived exosomes, activating the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, and consequently guiding the differentiation of MSCs towards osteoblast lineage. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the biomaterial-mediated osteoinduction mechanism, but also inform the design of bone repair materials with specialized surface design for proper immunomodulation to initiate osteogenesis.},

  abstract     = {The application of meshes in surgery is severely limited by complications associated with the non-absorbable nature, the lack of bioactivities, and the need of sutures and/or staples to fix meshes on tissues. In this contribution, a self-adhesive hydrogel-mesh composite (HMC) with biodegradability and multiple bioactivities was developed to address these issues and meet the clinical requirements. In this HMC system, GelMA hydrogel network was first macrotopological entangled with the fibers of a natural small intestinal submucosa (SIS) meshes, and then strengthened by soaking in a multi-functional H-bond provider (i.e., tannic acid, TA) solution to form the G/SIS-TA composite. The pyrogallol groups of the TA molecules endow G/SIS-TA with excellent wet adhesiveness (shear strength: ∼60 kPa), antioxidant, and antibacterial ability. The G/SIS-TA was also found to exhibit excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, and immunoregulatory activity. The G/SIS-TA significantly decrease the bacterial burden in a mouse peritonitis infection model and promote the healing of infected full-thickness rat skin wounds in vivo . This work not only reports a novel SIS-based HMC which was efficient in treating infected wounds, but also offers an innovative strategy of the development of self-adhesive bio-patch for various biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {The treatment of osteoporotic implant failures tends to be challenging due to an imbalance in bone homeostasis. Recently, the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the inflammasome containing nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like-receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) protein have been shown to indirectly affect osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Owing to the release of multi-metal ions from laponite (LAP), we fabricated a multifunctional LAP coating on a three-dimensional microporous sulfonated polyetheretherketone (SPEEK) surface via polydopamine (PDA) modification (SPEEK@PDA-LAP). The balance between osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis was examined using macrophages in an osteo-immune microenvironment. Employing in vitro assays, we showed that the SPEEK@PDA-LAP alleviated intracellular ROS accumulation and inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in macrophages, creating an osteoimmunomodulatory microenvironment to stimulate osteogenesis and inhibit osteoclastogenesis. The micro-computed tomography and histological results of in vivo experiments indicated that SPEEK@PDA-LAP implants reversed the balance between osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis to promote the formation of new bone around the implant even under osteoporotic conditions. The results indicate that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and regulating intracellular ROS in macrophages can be an effective therapy for osteoporosis. These results highlight the potential of functional PEEK materials for bone regeneration in patients with osteoporosis.},

To date, most reported carrier-free nanomedicine systems rely heavily on π-π stacking interaction between hydrophobic drugs. This work found that the hydrophilic IR783 dye can collaborate with the hydrophobic curcumin (Cur) compound to form a novel Cur@IR783 nanocolloid (NC) via self-assembly. The self-assembly of the hydrophilic IR783 and hydrophobic Cur improved the water dispersity of Cur, significantly facilitating its administration in vivo . Moreover, Cur@IR783 NC retained the IR783 properties of NIR fluorescence and photothermal conversion efficiency. Fluorescence imaging demonstrated that Cur@IR783 NC accumulated at the tumor site via the enhanced permeation and retention effect, which ensured enhanced anti-tumor effect. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the Cur@IR783 NC with laser irradiation yielded the most potent antitumor effect, and Cur@IR783 NC exhibited high biocompatibility. Overall, Cur@IR783 NC showed remarkable synergistic antitumor activity via chemo-photothermal combination therapy, providing a new promising approach for Cur-based applications in cancer treatment.},

  abstract     = {The recent remarkable success of mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) technology has stimulated intensive efforts to expand nanoparticle strategies to treat various diseases. However, as an anti-tumor drug delivery system, traditional MSN is prone to clearance by the host immune system, resulting in suboptimal pharmacokinetics and inadequate drug concentrations in tumors. The emergence of biomimetic drug delivery systems has effectively addressed these challenges. In this study, we aimed to develop a biomimetic drug delivery system based on MSN to achieve both immune evasion and tumor targeting. To this end, we coated folic acid-modified mesoporous silica (FMSN) cores with lipid-hybridized macrophage membranes (HEs) through co-extrusion, yielding FMSN@HEs. Initially, we demonstrated effective retention of key proteins Integrin α4 and Integrin β1 in the HEs, leading to significantly reduced clearance of FMSN@HEs by phagocytes in vitro. CCK-8 experiments validated the ability of CUR-FMSN@HEs to effectively inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. In tumor-bearing mice, FMSN@HEs exhibited stronger tumor targeting and penetration abilities compared to MSN without HEs. The immune escape and tumor-targeting properties of the FMSN@HEs suggest that they could be used as novel bionic drug carriers, potentially providing more options for antitumor therapy.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the limited application forms and inadequate therapeutic effects of 3D-printed scaffolds and osteogenic drug carriers. Nonetheless, concerns persist regarding the negative effects of burst and nonsustained release. In this study, we further enhanced the osteoinductive potential of 3D-printed BAG scaffolds by coating them with simvastatin (SIM) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with sustained release properties. Morphological assessment through SEM revealed evenly coated 3D-printed BAG scaffolds (BAG/PLGA/SIM), which showed sustained SIM release properties in vitro. The SIM released from BAG/PLGA/SIM still exhibited osteogenic activity in the augmentation of ALP activity and mineralization in mesenchymal stem cells. In an animal study of rat calvarial bone defects, both SIM-loaded BAG scaffolds, BAG/PLGA/SIM and BAG/PLGA/5 × SIM, significantly improved bone regeneration. Moreover, the IHC analysis of BMP2 and vWF expression also exhibited significant increases in both SIM-loaded BAG scaffolds. Notably, a higher SIM concentration (BAG/PLGA/5 × SIM) did not outperform a lower SIM concentration (BAG/PLGA/SIM) in promoting new bone formation. In conclusion, BAG/PLGA/SIM scaffolds could provide an excellent 3D architecture with sustained SIM release properties in vitro and excellent osteogenic properties for bone repair in vivo. The drug-loading method on 3D-printed BAG scaffolds could provide an alternative strategy for the development of multifunctional scaffolds for clinical applications.},

However, the majority of surface modifying materials currently do not consider the microenvironmental demands that are constantly changing ——Antibacterial is required at the early stage after implantation and osteogenesis becomes an intense appeal at the later stage. In the present study, strontium ranelate (SrR) and chitosan (CTS) were loaded onto the titanium surface via layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly based on tannic acid (TA) with separate antimicrobial and osteogenic layers. The obtained Titanium-Strontium Ranelate-Chitosan (Ti-SrR-CTS) implant achieved an outstanding early-stage antibacterial effect against S. aureus and E. coli and a more prominent late-stage osteogenic effect than ordinary titanium implant in vitro . In vivo results further verified that Ti-SrR-CTS implants had 97.68% antibacterial efficacy and 1.82 times the amount of new bone compared to ordinary titanium at different stages, respectively. This work has successfully designed a novel implant coating with both excellent antimicrobial and osteogenic properties, which provides a promising surface modification strategy for orthopedic applications.},

In this study, the 3D printing technology was utilized to fabricate personalized n-HA/PA66 bone tissue scaffold. The mechanical properties of n-HA/PA66 composite can be adjusted by configuring different raw material components and applying different porosity. It was found that 50 % porosity n-HA/PA66 composite scaffold showed a uniform porous structure and a compressive strength of 33.9 MPa. The composite scaffold also exhibited excellent biological properties while improving mechanical properties, in vitro cell tests indicated that the 3D printed n-HA/PA66 composite scaffold promoted differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into osteoblasts. In in vivo animal model proved that the scaffold promoted endogenous bone regeneration in rabbit patellar bone defects, with newly formed bone volume of 20.9 % after two months of implantation.

In this work, we used conventional liposomes for in situ generation of small gold nanoparticles and sequentially loading BODIPY to overcome the drawbacks of the two PTAs and simultaneously realize enhanced PTT. Gold- and BODIPY-coordinated liposomal nanocomplexes LAB with small gold nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface and BODIPY entrapped inside showed uniform size of about 100 nm with good stability. LAB demonstrated laser-responsive drug release property, good cellular uptake efficiency and tumor accumulation ability. After laser irradiation, LAB can exert enhanced PTT in cancer cell lines by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential and increase intracellular reactive oxygen species level to promote cell apoptosis. In tumor-bearing mice, LAB showed fantastic tumor inhibition effect with good biosafety.

In cellular experiments, this construct provided prolonged drug retention in BC cells. In a subcutaneous tumor mouse model, the DM/Pep1 nanoparticles exhibited a superior tumor inhibition effect compared to that of free DOX/MET. The DM/Pep1 nanocomplex upregulated CD4, induced calreticulin (CRT) exposure, downregulated PD-L1, and enhanced the MET-mediated antitumor immune response.

The microstructural evolution of the Co super-saturated film at temperatures ranging from 673 to 1073 K was evaluated using X-ray diffraction and high resolution microscopy techniques such as scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, there is a competition between grain growth and phase separation. Co precipitates at grain boundaries acting as pinning sites preventing rapid grain growth during heat treatment at intermediate annealing temperature. However, grain growth occurs very quickly at higher temperatures, once the elemental phases of Cu and Co are formed.

  abstract     = {In this work, the hot deformation behaviors of the high-nitrogen steel X30CrMoN15-1 from 900 °C to 1200 °C have been investigated. The microstructure observation indicates that the maximum DRXed grain size reaches 59.05 μm under the deformation temperature of 1200 °C with strain rate of 0.005 s −1 , while the minimum grain size is 2.12 μm under the condition of 900 °C with strain rate of 1 s −1 . The fully dynamic recrystallization (DRX) occurs at the conditions of high temperature and high strain rate (1000 °C − 1200 °C, 1 s −1 –5 s −1 ). There are two main mechanisms of crack formation. Under lower temperatures (900 °C-1000 °C), the significant stress concentration produced by M 2 (C, N) should be responsible for crack propagation along the DRXed grain boundaries. As the temperature increases to 1100 °C, the formation of cracks is mainly attributed to the uncoordinated deformation and huge pinning of dislocations by Lomer-Cottrell (L-C) locks. A new hot processing map has been established to reveals that the optimal processing domains are located at 1020 °C − 1090 °C with strain rate of 0.37 s −1 –4 s −1 and 1140 °C − 1200 °C with strain rate of 2 s −1 –5 s −1 .},

  abstract     = {This study examines the flow behavior and deformation mechanism of a FGH4113A superalloy with high γ′ content for different strain rates (0.01–1 s −1 ) at sub-solvus (1030, 1080 °C), near-solvus (1130 °C), and sup-solvus temperatures (1180 °C). The results indicated that the alloy exhibits four different flow behaviors: rapid softening after reaching peak stress (at 1030–1080 °C), slow softening after reaching peak stress (at 1130–1180 °C/0.1–1 s −1 ), steady state flow (at 1130 °C/0.01 s −1 ), and continuous hardening (at 1180 °C/0.01 s −1 ). The strain rate sensitivity exponent decreases as the flow behavior transforms from dynamic softening to continuous hardening. Moreover, the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) fraction decreases with increasing strain rate at sub-solvus temperatures, where an inverse trend was observed at near- or sup-solvus temperatures. These observations are influenced by the interplay of continuous original grain boundary migration (COBM), DRX, and grain growth. Meanwhile, the primary γ′ phase has different roles under distinct deformation conditions. At sub-solvus temperature, the primary γ′ phase facilitates DRX, grain refinement, and coordinated plastic deformation. At near-solve temperature, the primary γ′ phase predominantly contributes to coordinated plastic deformation. At the sup-solvus temperature, the γ′ phase entirely dissolves, with the grains coarsened by COBM continuously undergoing compressed, exhibiting continuous hardening.},

  abstract     = {Digital control in manufacturing processes produces significant amounts of metadata. The production process metadata, such as thermal and optical measurements, enables a higher degree of property grading than uninstrumented manufacturing and feedback for fault detection. This study explores how metadata can design fatigue-resistant structures using physically grounded models such as density functional theory, cyclic plasticity, and fracture mechanics that train machine learning algorithms. Machine learning models work very efficiently in their trained physical space. In comparison, mechanistic models are computationally costly for complex phenomena such as fatigue. We show how fatigue can be administered consistently at all scales by energy-based criteria and how a mechanistic function can be built based on this concept. The energy mechanistic function allows exact quantification of the effect of the existing flaws from manufacturing on fatigue lifetime under certain load boundary conditions. Since the mechanistic function is local and subscale to the prediction scale of the machine learning model, it can be used to build density functions for probabilistic regression of the fatigue property on the scale above. The analysis is applied to the selective laser melting process due to the availability of digital control and metadata generation during deposition.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the wear resistance of carburized M50NiL steel, this study introduces a method for refining the grains in carburized layer to a micro/nano-scale. The method involves extending the carburization time to ensure the formation of large M 7 C 3 carbides at grain boundaries, and adjusting the quenching temperature to facilitate the particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN). The process promoted the recrystallization of the residual austenite (RA), together with the subgrains unexpectedly discovered, successfully achieving the grain refinement. In this paper, the formation mechanism of recrystallization and subgrains are discussed based on interfacial energy model and first principles calculation. The results indicate that recrystallization is driven by the release of energy at the interface between M 7 C 3 carbides and the matrix during quenching, while the formation of subgrain boundaries is due to the reduction of fault energy in the RA, which caused by the increase of C content, promotes the dislocation movement and entanglement. Furthermore, the effects on hardness and wear resistance of micro/nano-crystalline region (MNCR) were investigated. The results show that MNCR after complete carburizing heat treatment has abundant dispersed carbides and refined martensite, which led to an approximate 15HV 1 increase in the hardness, and exhibited nearly a 50% reduction in wear loss.},

By taking advantage of the possibility of minimizing stress gradients and stress peaks around the hole via GO, we redesigned the cross sections of the lattice beam elements, equalizing the stresses over the entire domain. Consequently, the resulting optimized microstructure highlighted a significant enhancement of the overall toughness due to a drastic decrease of the stress concentration factor in the hole proximity, preserving the initial stiffness and lowering the total overall weight. To validate the robustness of the procedure and the numerical Finite Element outcomes, two non-optimized and optimized structures were actually built up through 3D printing and tested in the laboratory under the same boundary conditions used for the simulations. This evidence confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in obtaining optimized beam-like plates with high toughness, which could pave the way for designing new light materials with extreme mechanical performance well beyond the sole stiffness and strength.},

Current treatments, involving autografts, allografts, and synthetic graft materials, face obstacles like secondary trauma, inflammation, and inadequate biocompatibility. Tissue engineering, integrating cell biology and material science since the 1990s, relies heavily on biomaterial scaffolds to promote cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Traditional scaffold fabrication, including 3D printing, methods lack precision, hindering effective tissue repair by controlling cell distribution and the extracellular matrix. Biomedical engineering advancements have introduced 3D bioprinting as an innovative solution, overcoming constraints of conventional scaffolds. 3D bioprinting technology enables rapid and precise reconstruction of damaged tissues with loaded cells, mimicking in vivo environments. This paper explores key 3D bioprinting technologies such as inkjet-based, extrusion-based, fused deposition modeling, laser-assisted, VAT photopolymerization, freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels, and sacrificial template printing. The selection of materials with suitable mechanical and biological properties is crucial, considering the distinct requirements of each technique.

However, the compression response of those manufactured by powder bed fusion process is underexplored. This study proposes a comprehensive comparison of in-plane quasi-static compression performance of 2D auxetic lattice structures, utilizing three designs (anti-tetrachiral (ATC), double arrow-headed (DAH), and tree-like re-entrant (TLR)), manufactured with stiff Ti6Al4V by the electron beam powder bed fusion process (PBF-EB) with various manufacturing speeds. The results revealed unique failure patterns and superior energy absorptions among 2D lattice structures in the literature. TLR design enhanced energy absorption by overcoming failures between DAH columns and exhibited the lowest standard deviations in specific energy absorption (SEA) values (9.75 %–12.62 %). Besides, Kernel average misorientation (KAM) values followed the order of DAH, TLR, and ATC, and inversely correlated with SEA values. ATC structures with the lowest KAM outperformed DAH and TLR by 47.5 % and 6.44 %, respectively. Scan speed variations affected SEA and porosity values differently for each lattice design while exhibiting similar microstructure characteristics. The findings in this study propose a significant contribution to the development of aerospace sandwich structures where harsh environments exist and employment of 2D topologies are required.},

Although higher Si (4wt.%&lt;) content is favorable for increasing the resistivity and improving the soft magnetic properties, fabrication of transformer core with higher Si containing electrical steels is difficult by conventional wrought processes due to an increase in its brittleness. Additive manufacturing provides a novel alternative plausible way to fabricate transformer cores with higher Si content and unique design features. The current work focused on process optimization and design aspects of laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of Fe-6.5wt.% electrical steel. Additively manufactured components with 99.5% relative density were produced. The optimally fabricated component contained columnar grains of α -FeSi phase morphologically oriented in the build direction. The optimally fabricated Fe-6.5wt.% component was also subjected to annealing treatment at 1150 ∘ C for 1 h in Ar resulting in multi-fold grain growth and improved soft magnetic response. Based on optimal laser processing parameters, 3 different designs for toroidal cores with slit patterns for varying degree of cross-sectional areas were additively fabricated. The toroidal cores were subjected to same annealing treatment as that of the additively fabricated component. Core with least cross-sectional area exhibited improved magnetic performance compared to the other designs.},

While proven to be versatile and efficient, the damage-tolerance of such laminates is unexplored. This study for the first time in literature addresses the damage-tolerance of this efficient damping mechanism using a combined experimental and numerical approach. Results of experimental low-velocity impact tests on different configurations of FMELs are presented. In subsequent numerical modal analyses, different types of damage, namely delaminations, intra-ply damage and permanent deformation, are modeled and their influence on the vibrational behavior is investigated. While all types of damage influence the natural frequencies and modal damping ratios with a strong mode dependency, all laminates retain a high amount of modal damping with losses typically not higher than 15%. The results obtained reveal, that CLD is an efficient intrinsic damping measure in FMELs even in the presence of different types of damage. The key contributions of this paper include the thorough experimental characterization of low-velocity impact damages in different configurations of FMELs as well as the numerical assessment of those in frequency-domain simulations.},

Given this lack of knowledge, the main question addressed in this work is: What happens to the fatigue crack growth properties when extrinsic size effects play a role? To answer this question, nanocrystalline nickel cantilevers, ranging in width from 5 to , were subjected to fatigue crack growth. The crack growth rates and stress intensity factors were calculated and the Paris exponent in the stable crack growth regime was determined. It was found that the results scatter more strongly for the smaller cantilevers compared to the larger cantilevers. Results are interpreted in terms of plastic zone size and ligament size which are found to be critical for small cantilevers.},

This study investigated geometrical effects on the load-carrying capabilities of these connections upon a global tensile deformation, as well as lean modeling tools to facilitate the development of architected composite metastructures. Numerical fracture mechanics approach on different connection geometries and thicknesses showed that connection delamination is a critical failure mode, but crack-driving-force has low dependence on connection shape for given ligament thickness (and stiffness). Adopted analytical models could capture either moment or force-driven delamination failure, while the intermediate regime necessitates numerical tools. First-ply failure may precede depending on shape and ligament stiffness. These trends were also verified on an exemplary rotating chiral composite geometry. Furthermore, interface load-carrying capability improvements were studied via design considerations including connection filler material and element variable thickness. Indicatively, the latter showed a 157 % increase in bending deflection (and global deformations), while reducing crack driving force by 38 % for a given load case.

Ti alloys of different crystalline phases, including α, near-α, (α + β), β, and shape memory alloys, offer diverse options for orthopedic applications. Strengthening properties, wear, fatigue, and corrosion resistance are crucial factors influencing the performance and reliability of Ti implants. Moreover, this review discussed the challenges to Ti-based biomaterial durability through surface modifications to enhance their biofunction, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and antibacterial properties. Recent developments in fabrication techniques for Ti-based biomaterials are also discussed. Eventually, this review investigated how ML revolutionized Ti orthopedic implants by providing insights into the behavior of new alloys, aiding in manufacturing optimization, allowing for real-time quality control, and advancing the development of personalized, biocompatible, and reliable implants.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advancements in using machine learning (ML) techniques to establish the microstructure-property linkage for composites’ representative volume elements (RVEs), challenges persist in effectively characterising the effect of microstructural randomness on material properties. This complexity arises from the difficulty of expressing randomness as definitive variables and its intertwined relations with other factors, such as material constituents. Such complexities result in limitations in generalising ML models across different material constituents. Conventional solutions to these challenges usually necessitate large datasets, which require considerable computational resources, for an accurate and generalisable ML models to be trained. This paper presents an innovative approach to tackling these challenges by integrating a high-accuracy convolutional neural network (CNN) with a novel microstructure-factored constitutive model (MCM). The MCM, rooted from classic empirical constitutive modelling, effectively segregates the microstructural and constituting material effects, extending the generalisability and thus significantly enhancing the efficacy of the CNN. This new approach enabled a CNN trained on the transverse stress-strain curves of one set of material constituents (CF/PEEK at 270 °C) to be generalised for the rapid prediction of various sets of material constituents at different temperatures, unseen by the CNN during training, with an average mean absolute percentage error around 3 %.},

Based on density function theory, the trap distribution and charge-attracting properties of the grafted XLPE were calculated. For the charge-attracting groups, the results indicate that with the grafted of trap molecules containing polar groups C O and N-H, the electron and hole traps are introduced and the ability of attracting negative charges and positive charges are extremely improved, respectively, resulting in the enhanced space charge hindering and suppressed resistivity. The benzene ring can form both electron and hole traps with relatively shallower energy level, and results in an improved space charge dissipation and decreased resistivity. For the combination of charge-attracting groups, the continuous arrangement of homogeneous charge-attracting groups can achieve an enhanced modification effect, and heterogeneous charge-attracting groups will attenuate the modification ability. For the molecule structure, the grafting of compact cyclic molecular can affect the electrostatic potential distribution on XLPE’s chain, and exhibits a stronger modification effect.},

Presently, reported self-healing superhydrophobic coatings exhibit scratch-healing capabilities ranging from 5 μm to 40 μm. However, achieving large-scale scratch-healing (&gt;100 μm) remains a significant challenge within this research domain. In this paper, we introduces the design and fabrication of a dual-layer self-healing superhydrophobic anti-corrosion coating using polycaprolactone (PCL), EASTMAN Kristalex 3085 resin (EK), epoxy resin (EP), and 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane (PFDTES) modified silica particles via a facile spray-coating approach. The surface morphology, chemical composition, wettability, self-cleaning, damage-healing, and anti-corrosion behaviors of the coating were thoroughly evaluated. Results demonstrate that the coating exhibits self-healing capabilities across multiple scratch-damage scales (45 μm, 55 μm, and 100 μm), particularly exhibiting superior large-scale scratch-healing ability. Furthermore, the coating displays outstanding corrosion resistance, with the charge transfer resistance (R ct ) increasing by nearly 8 orders of magnitude compared to the bare Q235 carbon steel substrate. Although the corrosion resistance of the scratch-damaged coatings significantly decreases, the anti-corrosion capability of the scratch-healed coating is effectively restored to its initial state, showcasing excellent anti-corrosion sustainability. Additionally, the coating demonstrates remarkable mechanical stability, withstanding 90 sandpaper abrasion cycles and 70 tape-peeling cycles.},

Dissimilar to previous metalens doublet by all-dielectric metasurfaces in the optical band, an innovative and more robust approach by angular dispersionless meta -atom to directly eliminate aberrations in low spectrum is proposed. As a proof of concept, an elaborately selected singlet metallic resonator for simultaneously high transmission, full phase coverage and the ignored angular dispersion is presented in the microwave. The designed metalens with only one single phase gradient profile can focus wide field-of-view (FOV) incident waves of ± 40° with both a large numerical aperture of 0.56 (NA = 0.56) and high focusing efficiency of 53 % on average at microwave regime. The metalens is also fabricated by a single-step printed circuit board technique and the measured high-performance focusing are also achieved for the entire FOV. The presented on-chip and integrated wide FOV metalens provides a simple yet cost-effective method to develop wide-angle metalenses especially in low frequency band where plasmonic metasurfaces are commonly adopted. Besides, its excellent wide-angle focusing performances can satisfy diverse applications in modern radar engineering such as imaging, sensing, communications and detection, etc.},

The process maps generated for these powders were also assessed, focusing on their melt-solidification behavior and their implications for buildability (i.e., product quality). The build density distribution across the process map exhibited substantial variations. This variability was primarily attributed to the distinct melting behaviors associated with the unique characteristics of each powder. Both the real powder layer thickness of the powder bed and the melt-pool depth could be estimated by performing numerical simulations. Powder characteristics, particularly particle size and particle-size distribution, had significant effects on the achieved build density. Considering these findings, we introduced a new parameter z R / D 90 , which is determined by the powder characteristics and real powder layer thickness. Consequently, z R / D 90 emerged as a valuable parameter for predicting the buildability of the powder. Therefore, this parameter can be noted as a reliable predictor of powder buildability, thereby providing guidelines for manufacturing parts with few defects.},

However, sintered nanocopper will be prone to degradation resulting from corrosion in sulfur-containing corrosive environments such as offshore areas. In this study, experiments, including aging test and corrosion characterization, and simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) studies were conducted to explore the corrosion behavior and mechanism of elemental sulfur (S 8 ) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) on sintered nanocopper. The experimental results indicated that loose corrosion products were observed on the sintered nanocopper during the ageing process involving S 8 , and compact layered corrosion products formed during the ageing process involving H 2 S. Furthermore, similar corrosion product compositions (Cu 2 O, Cu 2 S, CuO, CuS, and potentially Cu 2 SO 4 or CuSO 4 ) were observed in both the S 8 - and H 2 S-ageing processes. However, the S 8 -ageing process exhibited more noticeable corrosion penetration. This was explained in simulations results: the unsaturated Cu sites on the oxide layer [Cu 2 O(1 1 1)] of the sintered nanocopper could adsorb both H 2 S and S 8 , while the saturated Cu sites only exhibited the potential to adsorb S 8 .},

This study is centred on the development of a high-power-density polymer gear transmission system for the accessory unit of a gas turbine engine, utilising an adaptive NSGA-III algorithm and surrogate sub-models. A comprehensive assessment indicator for the operating performance of the transmission system is suggested, encompassing gear strength, bearing temperature, and shaft torsional stiffness. The model made it possible to simultaneously optimise forty-six structural parameters, including gear tooth module, web thickness, and bearing clearance. In contrast to the original steel design scheme, the optimised polymer gear transmission system indicated a 49% reduction in weight and a 1.96-fold increase in power density.

Besides that, the effect of disorder is little understood in those origami patterns. Therefore, we investigate the disorder effect and show it can lead to diverse normal responses perpendicular to shear deformation in crumpled Yoshimura, with slopes of the force perpendicular to torsion that can be positive, zero, or negative depending on the disordered pattern of folds. The disorder leads to an asymmetry concerning the shearing direction, which we quantified via an asymmetry index from the 2D Fast Fourier transform spectrum of the crease pattern images.

The effect of HIP and UIT on the microstructure, grain orientation, grain boundary distribution, phase distribution and mechanical properties of AM CoCrNi MEAs were systematically studied. The results show that HIP decreased the partial mechanical anisotropy of AM CoCrNi MEAs, and YS was significantly reduced. The main reason is that the HIP induces the formation of large number of Cr 2 O 3 particles, and transformation of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) into high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs). Surprisingly, both the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the AM CoCrNi MEAs were increased when the UIT was added after every laser deposition of one layer (UIT-1). This is due to the combined effect of quasi-static loading and ultrasonic oscillations of UIT, which results in the dislocation multiplication and the formation of a large number of substructures. In addition, the above strengthening phenomena also lead to decrease partial mechanical anisotropy of AM CoCrNi MEAs.},

  abstract     = {Metalloid nanoparticles (MNPs) possess unique physicochemical properties but are challenging to create through biological or chemical routes. Using Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL), Mg–C MNPs are fabricated from powders. The produced nanocolloids were ablated after the target was removed to tailor the particle size. MNPs with a mean size 300 nm could be reduced to 60 nm. Alternatively, MNPs with a mean size of 60 nm could be increased to 90 nm. The increase/decrease in size is controlled by the laser processing parameters and showcases the ability of PLAL for real-world applications that require meticulous control of size. The as-fabricated nanocolloids were successfully inkjet printed on paper, achieving a low resistivity of 75 Ω/square after 60 prints, highlighting their potential in printed electronics. To address a historical research gap, this article explored the impact of PLAL processing parameters, including fluence (1–2 J/cm 2 ), pulse width (0.2–0.9 ns), repetition rate (10–20 kHz), and pH, factors often overlooked which is partly limiting applications. The influence of powder vs rod target on the PLAL process was addressed revealing that powders produce better size control and are easier to handle but they produce lower colloid concentrations.},

  abstract     = {This innovative study proposes a revolutionary strategy to enhance the efficacy and customization of hip arthroplasty, focusing on a short prosthesis design meticulously tailored to individual patient needs, with special emphasis on the femoral stem. The implemented methodology involves data collection through a meshless software, which quantifies the stress/strain shielding resulting from femoral insertion. Automatic pre-processing is performed using clustering algorithms, allowing the data to be divided into anatomical areas of the body. Subsequently, training of machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and stacking, is carried out to accurately predict the shielding caused by the stem. These predictions are based on design parameters, specifically linked to the patient&#39;s femoral cavity dimensions and their relationship to stem size, which are quantified through dimensionless parameters and serve as model inputs. The reliability of the models is confirmed by evaluation of data from patient with different femoral morphology than those used during the training and validation phases. This approach not only provides fast and cost-effective analyses for medical experts and engineers, but the described methodology can also be successfully extended to the development of alternative arthroplasty prostheses, such as shoulder and knee implants.},

  abstract     = {To investigate the failure mechanism of high-temperature fracture in polycrystalline iron, this study conducted in-situ observation experiments to study the dynamic damage evolution process of iron under tensile loading at high temperatures. Meanwhile, through molecular dynamics simulation, the micro-defect initiation mechanism of polycrystalline iron under the coupling effect of high temperature and stress was revealed at the microscopic scale. The results indicate that during the high-temperature deformation process of polycrystalline iron at 1400 K, grain boundary slip is the main deformation mechanism. When the grain boundary slip is obstructed, stress concentration can easily occur at the grain boundaries (especially the triple junctions), leading to crack initiation. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations have shown that in the initial stage of deformation, with increasing strain, both HCP phase transformation atoms and dislocation length exhibit a trend of initially increasing followed by decreasing, peaking at around 5 % strain. Afterward, the system undergoes dynamic recrystallization, with dislocation movement and grain boundary migration leading to dislocation elimination. When the strain reaches 12.3 %, microvoids initiate at the triple junctions and grow up in an O shape. At a strain level of 12.45 %, there is a sudden drop in system stress, indicating fracture initiation.},

The microstructures after each thermal cycle are investigated to characterize the coarsening behaviour of both alloys. Results show that the thermal stability of the tested alloys can be expressed in terms of several temperature regimes: A fully stable regime, a transient regime in which growth of individual grains occurs, and finally a regime in which the microstructure is fully coarsened. The onset of grain growth is accompanied by high strain rate sensitivity on the order of 0.2–0.3. Furthermore, the obtained hardness and strain rate sensitivity values are in good agreement with continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) and strain rate jump (SRJ) experiments. This highlights the applicability of the HTSI method to the characterization of the thermomechanical properties of ultrafine-grained alloys.},

  abstract     = {The fatigue performance of Laser Powder Bed Fusion manufactured 316L stainless steel is critical for cyclic loading applications. Additive manufacturing of 316L produces a characteristic microstructure consisting of grains with a fine cellular structure within. This microstructure shows a comparatively high fatigue strength combined with a high defect tolerance. The purpose of this paper is to numerically analyse the local response of this microstructure to cyclic loading and, in particular, the joint action between lack of fusion defects and the surrounding grain structure. The traditional incremental analysis method for polycrystalline alloys is computationally expensive. Therefore, a direct cyclic analysis combined with a phenomenological crystal plasticity model is used in this work to predict the stable cyclic response of the material, resulting in a much lower computational cost. Three statistically equivalent representative volume elements are generated. The considered crystal plasticity parameters are calibrated using experimental tensile stress–strain curves. The comparison with incremental analysis demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The shakedown limit, based on the maximum load that allows the convergent cyclic response, significantly depends on the local grain orientation around lack of fusion defects, revealing a reason for the large scatter in the fatigue strength.},

In this study, a novel micro-sized composite, Ag-10Al paste, containing 10 wt% Al particles, was designed. A remarkable phenomenon, the ejection of ultrafine Ag nanoparticles from micron-sized Ag flakes, was observed for the first time. The phenomenon was utilized for the in-situ surface modification of Al. Subsequently, the microstructure and mechanical properties of the sintered Ag-10Al/direct bonded copper (DBC) joints were studied. Results indicated that the Ag-10Al composite exhibited superior microstructure stability compared to sintered Ag. The Ag/Al interface was systematically analyzed, revealing a unique Ag/nano Ag 2 O/Al 2 O 3 amorphous/Al structure. This structure was formed through the Ag nanoparticle jetting effect of Ag flakes, achieving effective bonding between nano Ag 2 O and Al 2 O 3 amorphous phases through mutual dissolution at the atomic level. Moreover, the sintered Ag-10Al joint demonstrated enhanced mechanical performance stability over the sintered Ag joint. After 1000 h aging at 300 ℃, the shear strength of the sintered Ag-10Al joint reached 34.1 MPa, meeting the requirements for power semiconductor packaging. In conclusion, the Ag-10Al composite paste was thoughtfully designed, excelling in both performance and cost-effectiveness.},

A focused study on elucidating the effects of critical process parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed, and hatch distance, was undertaken to discern their impact on the material&#39;s microstructure, oxygen/nitrogen content, and hardness. Synthesis of nano-sized AlN and Al 2 O 3 precipitates within the Fe-12Cr-6Al matrix was achieved when nitrogen was used for a process gas. A rise in laser power from 120 W to 200 W, coupled with a reduction in scanning speed from 1200 mm/s to 400 mm/s, resulted in decreased porosity and an increase in grain size. Additionally, all printed samples showed lower oxygen content compared to the initial powder, while nitrogen ratios were notably higher. A marginal increase of the Vickers hardness value, from 240 ± 4.5 to 266 ± 3 HV, was observed as the laser power increased and the scanning speed decreased. The hardness values were higher than those obtained from different production methods with identical compositions. These compelling results suggest a positive impact of nitride precipitates and oxide precipitates to improve hardness values.},

Two reduction routes are employed to form reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The chemically reduced CNT/Si/rGO-5 %-Chem anode exhibits superior mechanical resilience compared to thermally reduced counterparts, which suffer from reduced strength and structural integrity. Chemical reduction also enhances electrochemical performance, increasing the initial capacity of the non-reduced CNT/Si/GO-5 % composite anode from 1,461 to 2,342 mAh g −1 , with improved long-term cycling performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows lower pre-cycle charge transfer resistance (148 Ω) and superior solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) resistance (43 Ω) for chemically reduced anodes compared to thermally reduced ones. After cycling, the chemically reduced composite anode exhibits reduced electrolyte resistance and charge transfer resistance, indicating stable electrochemical reactions. The composite structure undergoes adaptive rearrangements during cycling, optimizing active material utilization. In summary, CNTs accommodate silicon swelling, while chemically reduced rGO promotes stable SEI formation, highlighting the benefits of chemical reduction in enhancing mechanical durability and electrochemical performance, making the self-standing CNT/Si/rGO composite film a promising LIB anode.},

Yet, the support structure is often required to print such structures, adding undesired weight to the otherwise light-weight structures. In this work, the SEAM is integrated with a 6-axis industrial robot to enable the dynamic reorientation of the nozzle, which stays perpendicular to the deposition surface. As a result, the geometrically-complex hollow tubes and arc-like thin shells can be directly printed without any support structure. In addition, by selectively designate the infill directions and starting points, a light-weight honeycomb-infilled curved shell can be directly printed without any additional processing. Mechanical tests have also shown the conformally-printed curved parts exhibit higher strength than the conventionally-printed counterparts.

Compared with the traditional flat state obtained by axial compression when all beams snap through, four inclined stable states are easy to trigger by lateral compression at a local position when two adjacent beams snap through. The transitions between these states are studied by both experiments and numerical simulation. The transition to inclined states requires less energy than the transition to the flat state. Different trends of load–displacement responses are associated with loading positions and transitions. A parametric analysis is performed to illustrate the relationship between the stability of inclined states and critical parameters, such as span, apex height, and thickness. Two types of hourglass double-layer units are designed and studied through experiments. The continuous transitions in two steps or three steps are observed, and the load–displacement response is the accumulation of responses from each single layer. At last, two multi-layer structures with multi-stability have been developed to demonstrate their deformation capability in multiple directions through multiple steps.},

Especially, MXenes are widely used as excellent photothermal agents. However, there are limited reports on MXenes as sonosensitizer. Herein, a high-entropy MXene (HEM), TVNMC was fabricated for the generation of reactive oxide species (ROS) against Methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Interestingly the energy storage and conversion from the diverse composition of the TVNMC MXenes allowed the generation of ROS under US irradiation and even enhanced under Photothermal therapy. This combinatorial therapy undertook a near-total kill and eradication of MRSA with its biofilm. Moreover, TVNMC MXene simultaneously eliminated MRSA abscesses while promoting wound healing with negligible anomaly to murine tissues under sonodynamic and photothermal therapy, making the TVNMC MXene a promising sonosensitizer for possible biomedical usage. Overall, this system provides great potential for the use of high-entropy MXenes as a new type of sonosensitizer in anti-infection therapy.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dot (CDs) materials are typically hindered by aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. However, there are limitations in terms of their development and application. The introduction of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics into CDs has emerged as a viable solution to this challenge. In this work, we synthesized a novel yellow fluorescence (FL) rare earth-doped AIE CDs (named Y-CDs), which integrate the benefits of AIE materials, rare earth materials, and CDs. Y-CDs exhibit bright yellow FL, good temperature sensitivity and pH response properties. In cell imaging, Y-CDs showed excellent targeting capability towards the nuclear in HeLa cells. Y-CDs also showed excellent biocompatibility and safety in imaging of zebrafish embryos and zebrafish. Even on the 10th day following culture of zebrafish embryos, the digestive system and lens of zebrafish can be accurately located and imaged. The work presented here suggests the great potential of replacing commercial dyes with Y-CDs for highly specific nuclear labeling and bioimaging.},

In this work, a novel FeSiCrNi alloy with the chemical composition of Fe-6.5Si-2Cr-12Ni (wt%) is designed and subjected to thermomechanical processing including local canning compression at room temperature and annealing at elevated temperatures. It is observed that microstructures of FeSiCrNi specimens with a compression degree of 70 % are dominated by dislocation cells. The microstructural evolution is transformed from static recovery to static recrystallization when FeSiCrNi specimens are annealed from 400 to 700 °C. Grains with high strain energy are successively nucleated via the integration of subgrain boundaries at 600 °C and a pronounced growth of recrystallized grains occurs at 700 °C. In particular, microtextures of the FeSiCrNi alloy essentially consist of γ -fiber ({1 1 1}∥ND) and λ -fiber ({1 0 0}∥ND) textures during recovery and recrystallization. The intensity of λ -fiber texture is weakened with increasing annealing temperature, while the intensity of γ -fiber which is composed of {1 1 1} 〈1 1 2〉 and {1 1 1} 〈1 1 0〉 textures is strengthened.

Analytical techniques such as MIP, TGA-DTA, FTIR, Raman, SEM, and EDX are utilized to analyze the nanoadditives in alkali-silicate suspensions, fresh and hardened GCN. Ultrasonication is important for achieving better dispersion of MWCNTs, while CNH disperses more easily. Both MWCNTs and CNHs enhance flexural strength by up to around 58% and 44%, respectively, and reduce crack formation compared to the pristine geopolymer. Hydrothermal curing, despite leading to higher porosity, improves flexural strength due to increased geopolymerisation. The formation of a cross-polymerized network with oxo bonds and the release of water during the process contribute to increased strength and porosity, respectively.},

This study explores the possibility of designing a completely non-assembly steerable surgical instrument using Selective Laser Melting. Despite its advantages for medical devices, the rough surface quality of unfinished parts can be problematic for non-assembly designs, leading to increased friction and wear in rigid body mechanisms and tendon-actuated mechanisms. We investigated printing of rolling contact joints with crossed flexures as low-friction joints, adjusted for printing in titanium for the design of the instrument. Grid-based lattice structures were incorporated as miniature flexures, and we explored the influence of various grid sizes on the flexibility and bending stiffness of the lattices. Based on this exploration, we altered the rolling joint configuration from two crossed flexures to a single straight flexure for our design. The resulting steerable surgical instrument design is completely non-assembly, including its actuation, facilitates easy removal of support structures, and requires no surface finishing steps. It has a diameter of less than 20 mm, facilitates opening and closing of a grasper, and steering of the grasper by 20 degrees.},

In this work, based on the highly enriched characteristics of M1 type macrophages in local inflammation, we used exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) as drug carriers, modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to prepare an inflammation targeted and anti-inflammatory treatment nanoplatform (EXs-PH). By targeting M1 macrophages, HA endows EXs-PH with the ability to target inflammation, while PEG reduces the interaction between plasma proteins and exosome membrane proteins, giving the exosomes the ability to circulate within the body for a long time. The results indicate that after HA and PEG (PH) modification, exosomes derived from BMSC (EXs) can effectively enrich in the inflammatory site, achieving precise administration of curcumin (Cur) with anti-inflammatory and repair promoting functions. In vivo experiments on acute and chronic inflammatory models of spinal cord injury (SCI) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) also showed that PH modified Exs loaded with Cur (Cur@EXs-PH) were more effective in improving the recovery of motor function after lesions. In conclusion, the engineered Cur@EXs-PH we designed, provides a new drug delivery carrier for treating inflammatory diseases.},

The interlayered designs also exhibit a significant increase in energy absorption by up to 43 times more than their pristine counterparts. Competing damage mechanisms and failure events are captured by microscopy images, digital image correlation and high-speed photography observations.

The SC-BCC cellular structures, exhibiting improved torsional, compression, and bending stiffness, were strategically integrated into the bone plates. Configurations ranging from one to three rows, with porosity ranging from 30% to 90%. Increasing the number of rows and porosity maximized the interfragmentary movement at the fracture site. Specifically, SC-BCC configurations with one, two and three rows at 90% porosity demonstrated callus volume improvements of 31.33%, 42%, and 43.2%, respectively, compared with the lowest callus volume observed with SC-BCC at one row and 30% porosity. Regardless of the improved volume, callus stiffness was highest at 30% and 90% porosity levels across all cases, indicating more mature tissue formation in calluses and better physiological load support. High stresses located at 90% porosity, followed by 50% porosity, discouraged their mechanical performance. Therefore, employing 30% porosity configurations with appropriate vertical rows for desired movement is recommended for optimal biomechanical performance.

The lineal-path function and pore size distribution was used to characterise the air void structure. A two-dimensional lattice fracture model of foamed concrete considering different wet densities was established. The model was verified experimentally at a wet density of 700 kg/m 3 and then used to predict the strengths of specimens with wet densities of 600 and 800 kg/m 3 . Square and rectangular specimens (slenderness ratio = 2) with widths of 10, 20, 40, 70.7, and 100 mm were investigated. Results show that the air void structure significantly influences the observed size effect on the compressive strength in the investigated size range. A random forest regressor was used to predict the compressive strength of the foamed concrete; the regressor yielded satisfactory results. Finally, existing analytical size effect models were used to fit the simulated strength. Although good fitting was achieved, special attention should be given to the applicable range and physical meaning of fitted empirical parameters.},

  abstract     = {The research community has recently been captivated by the atomic-scale short-range order observed in high- and medium-entropy alloys. However, significant challenges persist in improving the mechanical performance through manipulation of the short-range order. Herein, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to establish the correlation between this ordering and the chemical composition for the Cr–Co–Ni medium-entropy alloys. It is demonstrated that atomic-scale clustering can be tailored through adjusting the chemical composition. Particularly, it can be promoted by decreasing the content of elements that do not participate in the clusters. The short-range ordering plays a significant role in affecting the dislocation evolution and tensile properties. Reducing the tendency to form Cr–Co clusters yields enhanced strengthening due to the increased local unstable stacking fault energy. Increasing the tendency to form Ni–Ni clusters instead results in enhanced strain hardening due to the high sessile dislocation density impeding the movement of dislocations. These findings unveil the crucial role of chemical composition on short-range ordering and have significant implications on the design of high-performance high- and medium-entropy alloys.},

In this study, we performed low-temperature bonding of (1 1 1)-oriented nanotwinned silver (NT-Ag) films and thoroughly investigated the influence of (1 1 1) texture on the interfacial microstructure and bonding strength of the joints. The results demonstrated that high-quality bonding of highly (1 1 1)-oriented NT-Ag films was achieved even at 200 °C in air. The defect-free, coherent Ag(1 1 1)Ag(1 1 1) bonding interface was formed via face-to-face bonding of the highly (1 1 1)-oriented columnar grains. The shear strength of the joints significantly increased with the rise in (1 1 1) texture intensity. Moreover, we developed the void closure model to quantitatively elucidate the contribution of (1 1 1) texture to void closure and bonding ratio. Modeling results revealed that the (1 1 1) texture, with the highest surface diffusion coefficient, greatly increased the interfacial bonding ratio by accelerating surface source diffusion, thereby enabling high-strength bonding at low temperatures. The experimental validation and modeling results presented here contribute a novel perspective for optimizing interfacial microstructure and bonding strength by regulating the surface texture in the solid-state bonding of metals.},

  abstract     = {The binary Fe–Ni system offers alloys with notably low linear coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), contingent upon their Ni content. In this respect twin-wire arc additive manufacturing (T-WAAM) presents the opportunity of in-situ alloying through the simultaneous feeding of two metal wires into a weld pool to obtain desired alloy compositions. This study aims to deposit a graded wall with Ni contents targeted at 42, 46, and 52 wt% in the building direction of the wall, along with a block comprising of 46 wt% Ni, employing the T-WAAM approach. The results show effective incorporation of additional Ni into the weld pool and geometrically stable weld beads in the continuous metal transfer mode during the T-WAAM process. This mode led to the defect-free and chemically stable deposition of the graded wall and the block with average Ni contents of 42.3 ± 1.1, 45.8 ± 1.4, 52.6 ± 0.8 wt%, and 46.4 ± 0.9 wt%, respectively. The measured Curie temperatures of the as-deposited alloys and the mean CTE values of alloy 46 were found to be comparable to the commercial alloys. In summary, this study validates the feasibility of in-situ deposition of low thermal expansion alloy compositions, thereby enabling the possibility of on-demand thermal expansion properties.},

  abstract     = {Using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, a new fully coherent precipitate platelet designated X′′, with a flexible atomic layer FCC structure, was identified in a low Cu/Mg ratio Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy. The emergence of the X′′ phase is primarily attributed to the preferential segregation behavior of Mg and Cu atoms towards the {1 1 1} α Ag layers. The strengthening mechanism of the X′′ phase is principally driven by the coherency strengthening, yielding efficient reinforcement (99.8 MPa increment per 1 % volume fraction). After dislocation cutting, the X′′ phase maintains coherence with the matrix, minimizing local strain accumulation at the interface. The mechanical tests show that the alloy with the precipitated X′′ phase, despite its lower strength compared to the alloy with the precipitated Ω phase, exhibits superior ductility and work hardening. The study holds promising implications for designing novel Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys with a desirable strength-ductility balance.},

Ti6Al4V microspheres were suspended into 5 M NaOH (60 °C/24 h) solutions, with extensive variations in microsphere:solution ratios to modify microsphere interaction and initiate self-assembly through proximity merging of titanate surface dendritic growth. The formed structures, which either produced 1) unbonded, sodium titanate-converted microspheres; 2) flat (non-macroporous) scaffolds; or 3) open, hierarchically porous scaffolds, were then assessed in terms of their formation mechanism, chemical composition, porosity, as well as the effect of post-heat treatments on compressive mechanical properties. It was found that specific microsphere:solution ratios tended to form certain structures (3 flat non-macroporous, &gt;8 powder) due to a combination of microsphere freedom of movement, H 2 gas bubble formation, and exposed surface reactivity. This promising discovery highlights the potential for lower temperature, simplistic production of 3D constructs with modifiable chemical properties due to the ion-exchange potential of titanate structures, with clear applications in a wide-range of fields, from medical materials to catalysts.},

While additive manufacturing of copper has attracted interest, the exploration of applying Drop-on-demand Metal Jetting (DoD-MJ) to 3D print pure copper remains uncharted. To fill this research gap, we employed an in-house DoD-MJ platform, MetalJet, to generate Cu microdroplets and deposit them onto ceramic and metallic substrates, a first-time achievement in this research context. Our study demonstrates the successful generation of uniform Cu microdroplets, emphasising the pivotal role of oxygen content control in preventing nozzle-level reactions, a factor that can disrupt droplet formation. Both alumina and aluminium nitride substrates exhibited poor wettability with molten Cu droplets, and no interface formed between these surfaces due to thermodynamically unfavourable reactions. Nevertheless, the irregular surface of alumina displayed an interesting capability to enable the adhesion of Cu droplets to the substrate through an interlocking mechanism. Lastly, the electrical resistivity of MetalJet printed pillars was measured as low as 6.75 × 10 - 8 Ω m 6.75×10-8Ωm without any post-treatment, offering exciting possibilities for applications in 3D electronics.},

Recent works indicate that forming a CrTaO 4 protection layer gives HEAs excellent long-term oxidation resistance. In this study, the high-temperature oxidation resistance properties of CrTaTiMo Refractory Medium-Entropy Alloys (RMEAs) were assessed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Through the oxygen adsorption and diffusion calculations, we demonstrated the preferential oxygen adsorption sequence on the surface of the RMEA as Ti, Ta, Cr, and Mo. Furthermore, our analysis identified the sites featuring Ta as subsurface atoms were the weakest locations for oxygen atom diffusion. The dynamic oxidation mechanism of oxygen molecules on CrTaTiMo RMEA was investigated by AIMD simulations. The results confirmed that the adsorption and dissociation of O 2 molecules on the alloy surface. Additionally, the diffusion of the O atom took place at temperatures greater than 873 K and confirmed the O-attracting feature of Ta atoms. Moreover, electronic structure calculations confirmed the bonding of oxygen atoms with those four metal elements. This study could serve as a valuable reference for the strategic development of the CrTaTiMo-based RMEAs or RHEAs for high-temperature, long-term oxidation resistance applications.},

This method simplifies all-atom molecular models, significantly accelerating Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of bitumen by 10 to 100 times. Key advantages include halving the particle count, eliminating complex hydrogen interactions, and decreasing the degrees of freedom of the molecules. Developed by mapping forces from an all-atom model to the centers of mass of UA model beads, the force field ensures accurate replication of energies, forces, and molecular conformations, mirroring properties like pressure and density. It features 17 bead types and 287 interaction types, encompassing various hydrocarbon molecules. The UA force field&#39;s stability, surpassing all-atom models, is a notable achievement. This stability, stemming from smoother potential energy surfaces, leads to consistent property measurements and improved stress tensor accuracy. It enables the extension of MD simulations to larger spatiotemporal scales, crucial for understanding complex phenomena such as phase separation in bituminous materials. This foundational work sets the stage for future developments, including refining parameters and introducing new bead types, to enhance the modeling capabilities of the force field, thereby advancing the application and understanding of bituminous materials.},

  abstract     = {Electrospun fibre has shown great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to its high specific surface area and extracellular matrix-mimicking structure. However, fabricating an electrospun fibrous scaffold with controllable complex 3D macroscopic configuration remains a challenge. In the present study, a novel method was designed to transform 2D electrospun poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) fibrous membrane to tubular PLLA fibrous scaffolds with 3D complex but tailored configuration. The electrospun PLLA fibrous membrane was rolled around a designed mould and then treated with acetone. Treated vascular grafts’ length, diameter, and shape can be tailored by the mould parameters. Moreover, treated vascular grafts achieve favourable mechanical properties (Young’s modulus = 155 MPa, tensile stress = 8.79 MPa and radial force = 2.2 N) and the mechanical properties could be engineered on demand. In addition, treated vascular grafts kept their initial structure and size during long-term in vitro experiments once they were formed. In addition, with the acetone-induced recrystallization of PLLA, pristine solid PLLA fibres were changed to hierarchical porous PLLA fibres with ultra-high specific surface area (28.9 m 2 /g) and wettability (water contact angle = 101.32°), which has positive effects on cell adhesion and proliferation ability. A7r5 in vitro experiment shows that the proliferation rate of treated vascular grafts increased 153% at day 4 and 170.6% at day 7 compared with pristine vascular grafts.},

Thereby, F-ZnO&amp;Ag/NFC/Ti 3 C 2 T x -30.4 exhibits the ultrahigh averaged EMI SE T of 103.9 dB (the maximal value of 123.8 dB) at a low thickness of merely 209 μm, which is far superior to that of almost all the reported NFC composites at the similar thickness to date. In the real EMI shielding application test, composite films are confirmed to block signal transmission and switch off the toy car system. Such simple and high-efficiency asymmetric sandwich structure design makes a great progress towards preparing and adjusting thin EMI shielding composite films for the promising application prospects in advanced electronics and communication technology.},

In contrast, the 0.70 wt% ScH 3 and 0.34 wt% ZrH 2 modified Al-Mg alloy (hereafter denoted as Al-Mg-Sc-Zr1) was demonstrated to be an exceptionally effective inoculation for Al-Mg-Sc-Zr1 alloy, owing to the low lattice mismatch (0.4 %) between Al 3 (Sc,Zr) and α-Al.

Consequently, the as-built Al-Mg-Sc-Zr1 alloy demonstrated outstanding tensile strength with sound elongation to fracture due to crack-free and fine grain strengthening. Additionally, compared with Al-Mg-Sc-Zr1 alloy, the further modification with more ScH 3 and ZrH 2 promoted substantial grain refinement via inoculation treatment of 1.15 wt% ScH 3 + 0.55 wt% ZrH 2 . Moreover, the grain refinement effect of ScH 3 and TiH 2 modification was also studied and correlated to the resulted ultrafine equiaxed grains and performance.

In this study, we present a novel strategy to develop Ti6Al4V-based implants embedded with biogenic hydroxyapatite derived from equine bone to overcome these problems. A selective laser melting technique was employed for facile fabrication with flexible fusing feedstock and regular uniform distribution of equine bone. The physicochemical characteristics, cell attachment and proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, osseointegration, inflammatory response, and metabolomics of the developed Ti6Al4V/equine bone composite were then investigated. The Ti6Al4V-based composite integrated with equine bone at a certain concentration has improved the crystalline structure (β-Ti) suitable for implantation and exhibited higher hydrophilicity and protein adsorption. They significantly promoted cell attachment, osteogenic differentiation, and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro . In vivo study confirmed the osseointegration and alleviated inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the Ti6Al4V-based implants integrated with equine bone significantly reduced metabolites associated with inflammatory responses both in vitro and in vivo . The observed reduction in inflammatory responses suggests a subsequent promotion of osteogenesis. These promising results position the Ti6Al4V-based implant integrated with equine bone as a potential candidate for replacing conventional dental and orthopedic implants.},

Compared with MSN-NH 2 , MSN-TPGS, and MSN-TPGS@P123, the MSN-TPGS@SB12 possessed “one stone three birds” functions that enhanced mucus penetration, increased trans -mucosal absorption, as well as suppressed P-gp efflux. The pharmacokinetics study demonstrated that the MSN-TPGS@SB12 loading puerarin (MSN-TPGS@SB12-PUE) exhibited much higher bioavailability compared to other PUE-loaded formulations. Furthermore, the MSN-TPGS@SB12-PUE could significantly enhance the anti-inflammatory efficacy of PUE in vitro and in vivo . In summary, bilayer-functionalized MSN-TPGS@SB12 is a promising vehicle for overcoming the multiple gastrointestinal barriers (mucus clearance, intestinal epithelium barrier and P-gp efflux). Meanwhile, this study also provides a better understanding of the importance of tunable surface property of MSN on oral delivery of drugs.},

  abstract     = {Oral diseases include oral cancer, periodontitis, endodontium infection, and caries. The oral cavity is prone to the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria and infectious diseases owing to its unique environment. During the drug-based treatment of oral diseases, saliva can dilute the drug formulation, reduce the interaction between the drug and site of action, and weaken drug efficacy. Therefore, searching an effective drug delivery approach is extremely critical and urgent. Stimuli responsive hydrogels respond to altered environmental conditions under disease states, allowing specific drug delivery. Accordingly, smart drug delivery systems can prolong the duration of drug action, reduce adverse reactions, decrease the frequency of administration, and improve patient compliance, thereby accelerating recovery. In this review, we discuss the different types of stimuli responsive hydrogels for smart drug delivery, focusing on their application in oral disease management. Further, we present current challenges and provide suggestions for future research on stimuli responsive hydrogels for oral disease treatment.},

  abstract     = {Establishing a phototheranostic platform constructed by the second near-infrared (NIR-II) region has proved a revolutionary and promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, the antitumor effectiveness is severely limited by the monotonicity of the NIR-photothermal therapy (HPTT) modality and tumor thermotolerance caused by the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Here, a minimalistic approach is used to construct an organic nanoplatform (IFT@PEG-GOX NPs) with the reciprocal cyclic promotion of hypothermia and starvation treatments for NIR-II imaging-guided tumor therapy. After the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect causes IFT@PEG-GOX NPs to accumulate in tumors, glucose oxidase (GOx)-mediated tumor starvation may obstruct the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and downregulation heat shock proteins (HSPs), thereby reducing the thermotolerance of cells. After that, sensitized HPTT was activated and GOx&#39;s catalytic activity was increased by NIR laser irradiation. Then, there would be a subsequent, intensified inhibition of HSP along with an additional amplification of the GOx-mediated tumor starvation. As a consequence, the HPTT/Starvation therapy (ST) bidirectional cycle method is initiated, leading to a bidirectional cyclic enhancing impact of HPTT and ST and significantly better tumor suppression.},

  abstract     = {Mineralized collagen scaffold is one of the best choices for bone defects treatment, but weak mechanical strength is the main factor restricting its development. Recent studies demonstrated that despite being a fundamental form of mechanical stimulation in human activities, the impact of cyclic compressive stress on collagen mineralization remains unclear, with even less known about the dynamic mechanical mechanism. This study employed cyclic compressive stress to investigate its effect on collagen mineralization. The findings revealed that cyclic compressive strain promotes collagen mineralization by facilitating increased mineral penetration into the collagen and altering mineral morphology on the collagen surface. As the mineral volume fraction of mineralized collagen rises, its elastic modulus also increases. Additionally, the finite element simulation results proved that cyclic compressive stress can impact mineral distribution by affecting their transport and deposition, consequently influencing the stress distribution and regulating mechanical properties of mineralized collagen. Alterations in mechanical properties provide feedback on internal stress distribution, subsequently impacting mineral mineralization. This study achieves a closed-loop study on the mechanical regulated collagen mineralization, offers insight into the mechanism of collagen mineralization, paving the way for further exploration of biomineralization mechanisms and potentially inspiring novel approaches for the fabrication of mineralized collagen scaffolds.},

This article demonstrates such an approach with the use of parametric geometry modeling, optimization, and additive manufacturing, enabling a thermal performance comparison of different heat sink morphologies, using both steady-state numerical simulation and experimental evaluation, by establishing equity across the compared heat sinks in terms of (thermal) mass. Limitations in additive manufacturing precision, as well as inconsistencies between numerical simulation and experimental evaluation results, were encountered in this case study. Likely resulting from the heat sinks’ thermal properties on the additive manufacturing process and the simulation environment’s disproportionate reliance on convection surface area, these limitations and inconsistencies will likely diminish as additive manufacturing and numerical simulation technologies improve. The cross-morphological comparison approach presented here is shown to be viable in principle and may inform decision-making in applied mechanical engineering design research and practice.},

  abstract     = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or hepatic steatosis, has become one of the most common pathologies among liver-related disorders. The rapid accumulation of fat in this organ, and the consequent increment in oxidative stress levels, have been recognized as one of the main factors involved in the pathological mechanism underlying hepatic steatosis, and progressive non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Experimental and epidemiological data have shown how antioxidant compounds rich in phenolic groups, such as resveratrol and quercetin, are particular efficient in contrasting the onset of this pathology. In this work, an in vitro model of NAFLD was established based on oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells. Steatotic cells were treated with polydopamine nanoparticles (PDNPs), biocompatible polymeric nanostructures rich in phenolic groups with high antioxidant power. PDNP treatment has shown to be effective in counteracting the hallmarks characterizing hepatic steatosis, and a reduction in the accumulation of lipids has been observed. Further analyses showed a significant reduction in triglyceride and cholesterol levels, jointly to reduced levels of oxidative stress. All these data, corroborated by proteomics and gene ontology analysis, suggest PDNPs to be a promising pharmaceutical candidate for the prevention and treatment of hepatic steatosis.},

One promising tissue is the hepatocyte sheet, cultured in temperature-responsive cell culture dishes. However, the preparation of hepatocyte sheets requires precoating of the dish with fetal bovine serum (FBS), which is not desirable for clinical applications. To overcome this issue, we developed a thermoresponsive polymer-modified glass with an affinity for hepatocytes. Poly( N - p -vinylbenzyl- O - β - d -galactopyranosyl-(1→4)- d -guliconamide)- b -poly( N -isopropylacrylamide) (PVLA- b -PNIPAAm) was prepared through two steps of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The prepared copolymer brushes were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, gel permeation chromatography, contact angle measurements, and fluorescence labeled-fibronectin and -lectin adsorption assays. These characterizations showed that the smooth block copolymer layer was successfully modified by ATRP. The feasibility of using the prepared polymer brush-grafted glass as a hepatocyte sheet fabrication dish was investigated using primary rat hepatocytes. The PVLA- b -PNIPAAm brushes exhibited hepatocyte adhesion and proliferation without FBS precoating. By reducing the temperature from 37 °C to 20 °C, the hepatocyte sheet was recovered from the copolymer brush. These results indicated that the prepared PVLA- b -PNIPAAm brushes can be utilized for effective hepatocyte sheet fabrication without the need for FBS precoating.},

They could improve the integration and reliability of solar-blind photodetectors, and serve as a viable substitute for photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in deep ultraviolet signal detection. We have previously demonstrated that the n-Barrier-n (nBn) structure, composed of Ga 2 O 3 /MgO/Nb:SrTiO 3 heterostructure, can efficiently reduce the dark current and enhance the reverse breakdown voltage due to the increased conduction band offsets. The barrier layer is a key factor in determining the device performance in the nBn heterostructure. Hence, we further optimize the study by varying the thickness of the barrier layer MgO to examine its effect on the devices. This modulation can affect the avalanche multiplication process, and thus enable the tuning of APDs’ performance. In this paper, we present the optimized thin film growth process, and the systematic investigation of the responsivity and gain of the device with different barrier layer thicknesses. The optimal performance was achieved with 25 nm MgO thickness. We also explore the underlying mechanism to elucidate the role of the barrier layer. Our results provide insights into the influence of barrier layer thickness in the nBn structure.},

The microgels are biocompatible, and biodegradable, and have a hierarchical nanofibrous structure, mimicking the structural feature of extracellular matrix (ECM) to facilitate cell attachment and proliferation. Additionally, β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) nanoparticles are incorporated in the microgels not only to promote the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), but also to facilitate the loading of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1). For reconstructing OC defects, pure microgels are implanted at the bottom layer of the OC defects in rat knee joints to promote osteogenesis, while the microgels loaded with TGF-β1 are implanted at the top layer of the OC defects to promote cartilage regeneration. This modular microgel system results in simultaneous regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone in OC defects, which is expected as a promising way for repairing other complex tissue defects in the field of tissue engineering.},

Therefore, it’s urgently required to develop the innovative wound dressings with both antibacterial property and healing-promoting function. In this study, a series of novel hydrogel dressings constructed with polyasparthydrazide (PAHy) nanofibers and different concentrations of in-situ synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were designed and prepared. It was found that all the PAHy nanofiber hydrogel mats without or with AgNPs exhibited uniform and bead-free nanofibrous structure, and the AgNPs-contained PAHy nanofiber hydrogel mats showed obviously decreased fiber diameters compared with pure PAHy nanofiber hydrogel mat. The mechanical properties of all as-prepared PAHy/AgNPs nanofiber hydrogel mats in the dry condition were significantly larger than those in the wet condition, and appropriate addition of AgNPs could improve the mechanical properties to some extent. The water swelling ratio of different PAHy/AgNPs hydrogel mats were found to be decreased with the increasing of AgNPs content. The nanofiber hydrogel mat prepared with polysuccinimide (PSI) with 0.5 wt% silver nitrate (AgNO 3 ), named as PAHy/AgNPs-0.5 hydrogel mat, displayed a higher cumulative silver release rate (9.4 ± 1.1  %) after 72 h, and it was demonstrated to possess excellent antibacterial rates against E. coli (99.99 %) and S. aureus (99.99 %), and clear inhibition zones with the diameter of 1.0 ± 0.1 mm for E. coli and 5.8 ± 0.3 mm for S. aureus . Importantly, the animal studies showed that the PAHy/AgNPs-0.5 nanofiber hydrogel mat could significantly accelerate the wound healing process by promoting the re-epithelialization and collagen deposition of wound site, which possessed huge potential for serving as advanced dressing materials for the infected wound treatment.},

This study introduces a triple-layered multi-functional membrane (MFM), with each layer serving a specific release profile and function.

The MFM was meticulously designed to ensure sustained drug release kinetics and improved bone regeneration. The membrane morphology was analyzed via SEM, and its mechanical properties were measured via stress–strain curves. In vitro studies confirmed the controlled release of the agents for 21 days. These findings indicate significant enhancements needed for GBR, as supported by in vitro results. The synergy of the membrane&#39;s components contributes to a greater therapeutic impact. Furthermore, in vivo results further supported the exceptional performance of MFM in GBR. Within 5 days of implantation, notable improvements in revascularization were observed. After 1 month, micro-CT scans displayed accelerated bone regeneration, while the membrane effectively prevented bacterial growth within 3 days.

  abstract     = {Celastrol (CEL) has garnered significant interest for its anti-tumour properties and potential for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. However, its clinical use is constrained by its limited bioavailability and potential toxicity. Herein, a biotin-decorated CEL nano-drug delivery system using a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) as a carrier was synthesized, named CEL@ZIF-8@BIO. It exhibits excellent water solubility, efficient loading of CEL, and a high release rate in acidic environments. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CEL@ZIF-8@BIO inhibited proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, increased ROS production and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in CRC cells. RNA-Seq analysis indicated that the anticancer mechanism of CEL@ZIF-8@BIO may be linked to ferroptosis as indicated by a significant increase in Fe 2 + levels, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in CRC cells. Furthermore, these effects could be reversed by ferroptosis inhibitor. In vivo research revealed that CEL@ZIF-8@BIO significantly inhibited the growth of CRC tumours and reduced the toxicity associated with CEL treatment. Taken together, the CEL@ZIF-8@BIO nano-drug delivery system shows great promise for CRC therapy due to its improved efficacy and reduced toxicity.},

In this study, monoglyceride solid lipid nanoparticles (MG SLNs) were wrapped with the B16-F10 cell membrane (B16 CM) for the fabrication of B16@MG. B16@MG had low toxicity and specifically targeted B16-F10 cells. B16-F10 tumor–bearing mouse model showed that indocyanine green (ICG) -loaded B16@MG achieved long-term accumulation in the tumor and facilitated the localization of the tumor boundary. MG SLNs were encapsulated with methyl 5-aminolevulinate (MLA) and desferrioxamine (DFO), and B16 CM was wrapped around their surfaces to obtain B16@MG–MLA–DFO.MLA was metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the cells and DFO reduced the content of iron ion in the cells, blocked the biotransformation of PpIX, and promoted the accumulation of PpIX in the cells. The results of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane potential detection showed that PpIX enhanced the generation of ROS, caused DNA and mitochondrial damage, and led to the apoptosis of tumor cells under radiotherapy. In B16-F10 tumor–bearing mice, B16@MG–MLA–DFO can improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and allow the integration of diagnosis and treatment.},

Developing wound dressings that effectively combat bacterial infection and promote tissue regeneration is clinically significant. Herein, we present a near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive multifunctional hydrogel system (PDA/Mup@DA-HA) consisting of mupirocin-loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) and dopamine-modified hyaluronic acid (DA-HA) hydrogel to accelerate bacteria-infected wound healing. The hybrid hydrogel has good adhesion and three-dimensional porous structure, which can adapt to the shape of the wound for adequate hemostasis and provide a suitable microenvironment for wound healing. The polydopamine nanoparticles doped inside the hydrogel are uniformly distributed and have the functions of loading antibacterial drugs and photothermal therapy. Therefore, the excellent adhesion of hydrogel can quickly attach to infected wounds and generate controllable local hyperthermia under near-infrared light irradiation, induce the destruction of bacterial integrity, and increase the effective release of the antibacterial drug mupirocin, thereby synergistically leading to bacterial inactivation. Notably, the animal model indicates that the hybrid hydrogel can significantly accelerate wound healing caused by bacterial infections under near-infrared light irradiation by reducing inflammatory reactions and promoting vascular reconstruction. The multifunctional hydrogel dressing provides a reliable tool for treating bacterial-infected wounds in clinical applications.},

In the present study, GALA-PFD-Lip were constructed to reduce lung inflammation, reduce lung oxidative stress, inhibit endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and reduce early pulmonary fibrosis. We found that GALA-PFD-Lip have efficacious lung targeting activity and biosafety, and the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of GALA-PFD-Lip are superior to those of pure PFD.

Then, the photo-crosslinking HSA was applied to produce homogenized microspheres (HMS) through the nitrogen elution-assisted microfluidic technique and ultraviolet light. Effective loading of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was achieved by utilizing the adsorption of HSA onto zinc ions and their crosslinking with His-tagged VEGF. The prepared HMS-Zn@VEGF exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and simultaneously exerted proangiogenic effects in vitro , effectively promoting the healing of infected wounds in rats. In vivo experiments using rats showed that HMS-Zn@VEGF promoted the deposition of collagen around the wound, improved the local inflammatory response, and promoted angiogenesis.

  abstract     = {With the clinical prevalence of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, developing non-antibiotic strategies to treat multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections is urgent yet challenging. Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death that can overcome drug resistance. Emerging evidence shows the potential of triggering ferroptosis-like for anti-infection therapy, but the direct delivery of iron species is inefficient and may cause detrimental effects. Herein, CuFeS 2 nanozyme is revealed as a ferroptosis-like initiator to eradicate bacterial infections for effective anti-infection therapy. Upon activating by visible light irradiation or hydrogen peroxide, the as-prepared CuFeS 2 nanozyme can significantly expedite reactive oxygen species generation, deplete intracellular glutathione, and interfere with respiratory metabolisms, resulting in lipid peroxidation-driven ferroptotic damage. Additionally, the CuFeS 2 displays good photothermal conversion capacity under near-infrared light irradiation, further augmenting the antibacterial efficiency. Accordingly, the CuFeS 2 nanozyme shows potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in vitro . Moreover, it shows excellent biocompatibility and robust anti-infection effects in MRSA-infected wounds in vivo . This ferroptosis-like antibacterial strategy may open up new insights into the treatment of drug-resistant pathogen infection.},

The research probed into the complex interactions between crystalline phase, chemical composition, and surface morphology in modulating osteoblast behavior. The resultant coating displayed an open, porous structure, characterized by surface porosities ranging from 19.3 % to 39.8 % and a roughness distribution spanning 22.9 to 37.9 nm. XRD and XPS analyses confirmed a hydroxyapatite crystal structure within the coatings. Elemental quantification revealed Ca/P ratios from 1.49 to 2.44, aligning closely with the physiological bone ratio of 1.67. Under the synergistic effects of hyperglycemia and advanced glycation end-products (AGES), Ca and P ion release from the MAO coating was expedited, thereby inducing osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. In addition, the Ca 2+ released from the coating would complex with AGES, reducing its inhibitory effect on cell growth and thus promoting cell proliferation. Cellular experiments showed that higher coating porosity and its beneficial ions release facilitated the growth environment and promoted cell proliferation and differentiation. This study utilized coating design and corrosion phenomena to provide a theoretical basis for titanium alloys in clinical applications.},

This organism exhibits a bending behavior in response to adverse environmental conditions. We used bimetal, a smart material composed of two layers with distinct expansion coefficients, providing a bending behavior triggered by heat, mimicking the organism&#39;s natural response. Following the A. arenaria ’s morphology, we applied creases on the bimetal&#39;s active layer. These creases influence the movement behavior of the bimetal, causing it to open when heated and close when cooled (opposite to the behavior observed in the material without creases). This study focuses on investigating the behavior of creases on the bimetal to propose a kinetic façade module responsive to changes in environmental temperature — the Bimetal Biomodule. We conducted exploratory studies to introduce creases on the bimetal surface, employing both handmade creases and 3D-printed matrix for stamping. We evaluated the response of the biomodule samples to temperature variations. Our findings indicate that interspersed creasing patterns, associated with the absence of creases at the material edges, influence the bimetal&#39;s behavior, offering control over material responsiveness beyond its properties. Prototypes and tests demonstrated the biomodules’ potential for self-shading applications on façades without electrical power or any mechanical device.},

Their apoptosis and polarization toward M2 phenotype play crucial roles in anti-inflammation. Herein, we developed three kinds of biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs) derived from different cells for dual-targeting to inflamed site and M1 macrophages. These NPs were aimed to induce M1 macrophages apoptosis and re-polarization for efficient RA therapy via dually targeting drug delivery to inflamed joints and M1 macrophages. Results demonstrated that the NPs had a massive accumulation at inflamed site and high internalization efficiency in M1 macrophages. After loading methotrexate, the NPs substantially suppressed the viability of activated macrophages and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, they dramatically promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and induced M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages. In an adjuvant-induced arthritis mouse model, the NPs efficiently reduced the number of inflammatory macrophages, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and destruction of cartilage or bone tissues. Additionally, the swelling of paw and ankle joint was significantly alleviated by the NPs after 17 days treatment, especially the activated macrophage-derived NPs. The findings highlight the potential of NPs with dual-targeting ability in the treatment of RA by apoptosis and re-polarization of M1 macrophages.},

Nanozymes with peroxidase (POD)-like and catalase (CAT)-like activities serve as promising antimicrobial agents since they avoid the damage caused by high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) while providing sufficient oxygen (O 2 ). Herein, we report hybrid composites of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on two-dimensional or three-dimensional (2D/3D) Zn-based metal organic frameworks (Zn-MOFs) via free amino groups. Specifically, the formed 3D Zn-MOF@Au, which combines the advantages of AuNPs and stabilized 3D MOFs, exhibits more significant POD-like activity in terms of decomposing H 2 O 2 into toxic hydroxyl radicals than 2D Zn-MOF@Au while being able to supply sufficient O 2 . We performed systematic antimicrobial tests against bacteria using this composite nanomaterial with different dimensions, and the results showed that the 3D Zn-MOF@Au composite had better antibacterial effects against gram-positive (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , MRSA ) and gram-negative ( Escherichia coli , E. coli ) bacteria with the addition of a low dose of H 2 O 2 . Animal experiments showed that this hybrid composite effectively accelerated bacteria-infected wound healing with excellent biocompatibility.

The proposed strategy demonstrated effectiveness in estimation of 3D textile architectures. The designed system was able to operate within 10% error for stiffness properties prediction. The main benefit of the proposed approach over conventional modelling is its computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Semi-flexible pavement (SFP) material is a composite comprising cement, coarse aggregates and asphalt mortar, which has complex mechanical properties. Traditional experimental methods struggle to accurately quantify the effect of each phase and their interfaces on the SFP&#39;s mechanical properties. Micromechanical modelling based on finite element method offers a promising solution. In this study, a new micromechanical model for SFP is proposed, idealizing the material by representative volume elements. SFP mesostructure is represented as a simplified five element composite consisting of cement, asphalt mortar, aggregate, pore and cement-asphalt mortar interface. Periodic boundary conditions are used to simulate an infinite repetitive structure within a finite computational domain. The resulting model allows evaluating the stiffness and damage resistance of SFP in a computationally efficient manner. This model is utilized to explore the mechanical properties of SFPs and the results are compared with the experimental findings. The results show that the model captures the uniaxial compressive strength and stiffness for all materials examined. The model is further used to evaluate the effect of properties of individual elements of SFP on its stiffness and strength. The feasibility of using the proposed modelling approach to optimize the material design of SFP is discussed.},

This methodology is shown to be more efficient than the so-called Bo ¯ - Md ¯ Bo¯-Md¯ approach, achieving 82% prediction accuracy while the Bo-Md approach leads to 52% correct predictions on the same dataset. In addition, four new alloy compositions were produced to verify the model validity. Specific cases where the present model disagreed with the Bo-Md predictions were chosen to increase the benefits of the produced results. The plasticity mechanisms of the four alloys experimentally confirmed the validity of the ML model. This approach particularly helps the design of specific Ti alloys exhibiting a high work hardening rate owing to the simultaneous activations of the Transformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) and mechanical twinning (TWIP) effects. Indeed, the class corresponding to the combination of TRIP and TWIP effects reach a prediction accuracy of 88%.},

The correlation between extinction spectrum of the nanoparticle coating and the LFS process parameters was studied. The spectra consisted of two partly overlapping peaks: one centered in the UV region and the other in the visible light region. The visible light peak redshifted as either the silver mass concentration in the precursor solution or the precursor solution feed rate was increased, which also correlated with growing primary particle size. However, simultaneous correlation with photocatalytic activity of the decorated TiO 2 surfaces was not observed, which was attributed to particle sintering on the surface. Instead, the photocatalytic activity was seen to change as the surface coverage of silver nanoparticles was varied. When the surface coverage was raised from ∼10 % to roughly 30 %, the activity, and then decreased as the loading was further raised. The increase was assumed to originate from plasmonic activation, and the decrease was attributed to the excessive amount of silver either blocking reactive area of the TiO 2 or absorbing/scattering too much of the incoming light, which hindered the photocatalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {This study provides a comprehensive analysis of a Ti‑42Nb alloy produced via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) with varying post-heat treatment durations within the α + β phase range at 723 K. Synchrotron XRD analysis revealed the formation of the metastable orthorhombic α iso &#39; &#39; αiso&#39;&#39; phase during heat treatment, acting as an intermediate to the stable α  phase. With prolonged heat treatment, the α iso &#39; &#39; αiso&#39;&#39; phase fraction increased, reaching approximately 25 % after 108.0 ks. SEM analysis identified β grain boundaries as primary sites for early α iso &#39;&#39; αiso&#39;&#39; precipitation, while intragranular α i s o &#39; &#39; αiso&#39;&#39; precipitation was delayed. Up to 28.8 ks, volume fraction and size of intragranular precipitates exhibited notable variations due to minor Nb content fluctuations from LPBF processing, resulting in an increased spread of hardness and Young&#39;s modulus on the micro scale. Tensile tests revealed significant strength enhancement through post-heat treatment for 108 ks compared to the as-built state, achieving a yield strength of around 1060 MPa (50 % increase) and ultimate tensile strength of 1125 MPa (55 % increase). Extended growth of the α i s o &#39; &#39; αiso&#39;&#39; phase led to an increased Young&#39;s modulus, reaching 87 GPa after 108.0 ks. These findings provide valuable insights for developing post-heat treatment strategies for LPBF-produced Ti‑42Nb implants, including both bulk materials and lattice structures.},

  abstract     = {Despite the fact that body-centered cubic high entropy alloys (BCC HEAs) exhibit exceptional strengthening mechanisms over a wide temperature range, their application is often hindered by poor room temperature ductility. Consequently, the accurate prediction of BCC HEA s ′ HEAs′ ductility becomes critical in alloy design but is challenged by the intricate nature of these alloy systems. In this study, a comprehensive machine learning (ML) strategy with integrated material knowledge is proposed to address this problem. By referring to plasticity theories, thermodynamics as well as atomic properties, we develop a set of cost-effective material descriptors with various mathematical forms such as averaging, mismatching, maximum-minimum ranging and averaging as binary pairs for HEAs. These descriptors are proved to effectively incorporate material knowledge into ML modelling. They also offer potential alternatives to those obtained from costly first principles calculations. Classification and regression tasks are conducted to predict the ductility of BCC HEAs, and Gradient boosting algorithm exhibiting the best performance for both tasks is eventually selected. The established optimized models achieve high predictive accuracies exceeding 0.85. Through feature engineering, five key features related to valence electron concentration ( VEC ) and atomic size are screened out. These features lay the foundation for explicit formulae developed via Symbolic Classification, enabling the straightforward numerical prediction of BCC HEA s ′ HEAs′ ductility. These key features are further analyzed by an interpretable ML method and compared against experimental and computational plasticity factors, elucidating their influences on various plasticity mechanisms. An in-depth exploration of why the proposed ML models outperform conventional plasticity criteria for HEAs is also presented. This study highlights an effective knowledge-integrated ML approach in predicting material properties resulting from complex mechanisms, with a particular focus on HEAs that often exhibit sparse data.},

  abstract     = {In the pursuit of simultaneously improving the yield strength and plasticity of austenitic stainless steel, a new austenitic stainless steel was fabricated by induction smelting using a pure N 2 atmosphere, hot forging, cryogenic rolling, and annealing. The material was characterized by microstructures with 3–4 μm uniform finer grains, fine precipitates, high thermal stability austenite, and extensive high-angle grain boundaries. The elongation after fracture, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength of the samples reached 53.5 %, 707 MPa, and 1020 MPa, respectively, as well as 61 %, 600 MPa, and 977 MPa, respectively, at the same time. Moreover, a high strain hardening rate was achieved in the new stainless steel. The appropriate uniform finer grains not only played a role in grain-refined strengthening but also provided intragranular spaces and sufficient mean free available paths for dislocation accumulation and movement. Precipitates, which were coherent or semi-coherent with the matrix, provided interfaces for dislocation accumulation and obstructions for dislocation movement. Extensive high-angle grain boundaries with appropriate finer grains served as another important factor for excellent ductility due to the inhabitation and resulting deviation of crack propagation. In addition, strain-induced mechanical twinning in the current austenitic stainless steel contributed to excellent ductility and high strength.},

  abstract     = {Digital concrete technologies, such as 3D concrete printing, have the potential to be game changers in the construction industry by reducing material consumption and offering a high level of automation. This not only provides a solution to the shortage of qualified workers but also makes construction sites more attractive workplaces. However, a significant challenge lies in integrating reinforcement, as traditional methods quickly reach their limits, particularly in geometrically complex, material-minimized structures. A potential solution is the use of mineral-impregnated carbon fibers (MCF) reinforcement, which offers high flexibility for 3D printing and better bonding to concrete compared to polymer coating, among other advantages. This article presents the integration of both freshly impregnated and cured MCF into two different concretes in the context of digital fabrication: 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) and self-compacting concrete (SCC). A particular focus was on the mechanical performance of MCF and MCF-reinforced concrete, as well as on the bond behavior between MCF and concrete. The second focus was on the production method. Therefore, samples were conventionally cast with SCC, while layered pouring or printing were used for producing specimens with 3DPC. It was found that the cured MCF exhibited a notably better bond, enhanced by 50%, to both 3DPC and SCC compared to freshly impregnated yarns. Subsequently, when subjected to uniaxial tensile loading, a significantly higher crack density and more uniform crack distribution could be observed in composites with cured MCF using digital image correlation (DIC). This effect was particularly pronounced in printed specimens and confirmed with computed tomography (CT) and environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) images.},

We have developed a novel bilayer system with multiscale induced behavior called ChitoSand, made primarily of a sand matrix, incorporating chitosan biopolymer as a microstructural binder, short flax fibers to boost tensile capacity at the mesoscale, and citric acid to increase plasticity, which is then underlaid by a sewn burlap fabric base layer to raise the bending capacity at the macroscale. This produces a fully biodegradable material system that we paired with anticlastic geometry calculations to enhance effective material use and structural form. We then developed an earthen construction workflow that uses reusable pneumatic formwork holding the ChitoSand bilayer composite during hardening in ambient conditions.

  abstract     = {Recent research has focused on the ultrafast laser welding of metal and glass due to its diverse applications in aerospace, medicine, and optical sensing. However, the significant material property differences between metals and glass, along with strict surface requirements, pose challenges to the development of metal-glass welding and limit its industrial utility. Utilizing high-pulse-energy lasers has proven effective in mitigating these challenges. This study comprehensively analyzes a millijoule (mJ)-level femtosecond pulse laser welding technique applied to aluminum alloy and fused silica, with a primary emphasis on understanding the characteristics and mechanism of joint. During the welding process, aluminum and fused silica mutually diffuse, leading to the formation of five distinct zones at the joint&#39;s cross-section. Within the aluminum molten pool in rapid cooling, aluminum grains undergo continuous growth along a temperature gradient and then transform into smaller epitaxial grains with altered grain orientations and HAGBs. An amorphous Al 2 O 3 phase coexists with aluminum, forming a lamellar structure. Besides, silicon nanoparticles and transitional γ-Al 2 O 3 precipitate near the center of the weld. This study examines the underlying causes of these phenomena and provides a detailed discussion of the associated strengthening mechanisms, ultimately resulting in a maximum shear strength of 8.94 MPa.},

  abstract     = {Inconel 718 is one type of nickel-based alloy used for a large range of applications, including gas turbines and aeroengines components. Although mechanical and thermodynamic properties of this material have been deeply studied in the past years, a method able to investigate local properties of the thin white layer formed on the alloy surface after machining remains challenging. Here, a 90 nm X-ray beam is used to probe the local strain, crystal orientation, and chemical composition of grains in the white layer. Data reveals mosaicity induced by the tool during machining. The high spatial resolution, combined with crystal lattice sensitivity, shows that the average grain size is around 30 nm throughout the white layer, while the strain is anisotropic nearest to the surface. Results provide new insights on the basic properties of the white layer in super alloys, revealing important information about the impact of finish machining which might help to explain fatigue and cracking formation on these materials during their usage phase.},

  abstract     = {Metallic powder for Additive Manufacturing (AM) typically varies between different batches, while being supplied to achieve the same customer specification. In order to reduce this variation and minimise waste, batches are often mixed together in both their virgin and used form. However, the properties of bulk components must have limited variance in order to be reliably used in an industrial setting. This manuscript is focused on the analysis of Grade 5 Ti6Al4V powders (3 virgin, plus 2 blends) and the associated mechanical properties of Electron Beam Melted (EBM) AM specimens. Measurements were performed in accordance with the principles defined in the MMPDS Handbook, ESDU database, and ASTM F2924. The tensile, and fatigue properties of the EBM specimens were found to be superior when compared with Ti6Al4V properties within these standards. This demonstrated that these powders are suitable for a wide range of commercial applications, and that these blended powders (including used powders) are able to achieve these requirements. Additionally, the results provide a systematic route for powder verification and highlight the importance of adhering to standardised principles and specifications to ensure quality and reliability in metallic AM materials.},

The electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy substantiate the successful formation of a GNS layer, surpassing 200 µm in thickness, on the M50 bearing steel treated by Ultrasonic shot peening (USP) technology. The severe plastic deformation (SPD) induced by the USP process resulted in a significant refinement of the martensite in M50 bearing steel, leading to a remarkable 32.25 % increase in surface hardness compared to its untreated coarse-grained (CG) counterpart. Pin-on-Disk wear tests were conducted at an elevated temperature of 300 °C on both the as-received CG-M50 and USP-treated M50 bearing steel samples to evaluate the impact of USP treatment on the wear resistance of M50 bearing steel. Experimental results reveal that the volume loss of the USP-treated M50 bearing steel is 94.9 % less than that of the untreated CG-M50 bearing steel after 4 h of wear tests. The improved wear resistance of the USP-treated M50 bearing steel can be attributed to the creation of an ultrastrong and stable GNS layer facilitated by USP.},

In addition, electron work function (w) and cohesive energy (Ec) have similar relationships with hardness, which indicated that these electronic features should be excluded for hardness prediction.

  abstract     = {The existence of a coarse and non-uniform grain structure poses a substantial obstacle to achieving a decrease in surface roughness on the reflective mirror subsequent to single-point diamond turning. The grain refinement mechanism of 6061 aluminum alloy during multi-directional forging was analyzed across a temperature range from −196 °C, 25℃, to 510 °C in this study. The interrelationship between the microstructure of the aluminum alloy mirror after single-point diamond turning and its surface roughness was revealed. Dynamic recrystallization occurred at a deformation temperature of 510℃ with an average grain size of about 30um. At a deformation temperature of −196℃, more dense dislocation cells were formed along with smaller regions exhibiting different orientation differences. Additionally, as the temperature decreased, the adjacent area with poor orientation also decreased. When the range of adjacent orientation difference is less than the feed per blade, material anisotropy counteracts some mechanical response during processing resulting in an overall increase in average effect. This leads to reduced feedback response from the material to the tool and improved stability on cutting plane. Consequently, surface deviation from equilibrium surface reduced from ranging between5 and 8 nm to2-4 nm while roughness Ra decreases significantly from 13.7 nm to 1.3 nm.},

The work builds upon recent studies of such composites where a novel combinatorial approach was used to investigate the effect of rGO arrangements on electrical conductivity and porosity. This approach considers explicitly the discrete structure of the composite and represents it as a collection of entities of different dimensions - grains, grain boundaries, triple junctions, and quadruple points. Here, the combinatorial approach is developed further by considering the effects of rGO agglomerations, stress concentrators and adhesion energies on intergranular cracking. The results show that the fracture networks can be effectively controlled by the local ordering of rGO inclusions to allow for a concurrent increase in the strength and conductivity of the ceramic composites. It is shown that the ratio of local stress concentrators related to rGO inclusions and cracks is the most significant factor affecting the nano-crack network topology. The local spatial arrangement of rGO inclusions becomes an effective tool for controlling nano-crack network topology only when this ratio approaches one. It is anticipated that these results will inform future design of toughness-enhanced composites.},

Further, novel developments in emulsion templating techniques are used to generate composite structures and their mechanical properties are investigated. The most appropriate composite for nerve tissue repair had a compressive and tensile Young’s modulus of 0.168 MPa and 0.694 MPa respectively, much closer to that of native nerve tissue than previously used polymers. SEM images revealed high porosity/interconnectivity of NGCs, important for the diffusion of nutrients to further aid nerve regeneration. FITC-Dextran (150 kDa) effectively diffused through conduit walls. Histological analysis demonstrated the small pore size successfully prevented infiltration of fibroblasts. In vitro studies indicated that the NGCs were cytocompatible. E x vivo analysis showed that neurons of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglia grew on the surface of the conduits, and Schwann cells migrated effectively along the lumen.

  abstract     = {Far-infrared (FIR) therapy has been extensively studied because of its numerous benefits in improving human health. A planar heating element device was designed to assess the in vitro efficacy of FIR therapy by using a flexible carbon fiber composite sheet (CFS) with versatile designs and shapes. The physical properties were optimized for in vitro assays, and low hygroscopicity and stable thermal performance were obtained through thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) lamination. The CFS evenly released FIR at temperatures ranging from 25 to 80 °C. There was no significant effect on cell viability under most conditions. However, the FIR emitted from the CFS at 70 and 80 °C for 2 h increased apoptotic cell death. The FIR irradiation between 60 and 80 °C for 1 h or less effectively induced osteogenesis of the tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) without inducing cytotoxicity. The most significant osteogenic induction occurred at 60 and 70 °C, as evidenced by increased calcium mineralization and osteogenic markers.

  abstract     = {Periodontitis is characterized by local inflammatory response and the resultant alveolar bone resorption. The elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level not only aggravates local inflammation but also prohibits osteogenesis. Hence, simultaneously scavenging ROS and triggering the activity of osteoblasts may produce synergism in periodontium regeneration. Herein, we developed an injectable hydrogel system, CC-B-CAPE@CY-NPs, for periodontitis treatment, in which caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a naturally-occurring anti-inflammatory ingredient, was caged by aryl borate for ROS-responsive release. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles incorporating Chrysin (CY), another natural product with osteogenetic property, were also coated in the hydrogel. In vitro, the hydrogel was capable of scavenging the excessive ROS and modulating the polarization of M1 macrophages, highlighting its anti-inflammatory potency. In addition, its osteogenetic effect was verified by the increased ALP activity in the hydrogel-treated periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). Our studies revealed the anti-inflammatory stemmed from its ablation of NF-κB signaling, while the activation of Wnt/β-catenin cascade accounted for its osteogenetic potency. In a rat periodontitis model, the capability of reducing ROS levels, modulating macrophage polarization, and promoting osteogenesis was transformed into the recovery of destructed alveolar bone. All above, the hydrogel possesses great potential as a promising remedy for periodontitis.},

  abstract     = {Architected strut-based metamaterials fabricated via three-dimensional printing exhibit a wide range of geometric and material heterogeneity, including variations in strut size, surface roughness, embedded micro-cracks and disconnected struts. The locations and severity of these defects are highly variable; combined with the complexity of the structure itself, it is exceedingly difficult to identify critical defects that limit performance and inform qualification protocols. To address this challenge, we consider the impact of distributions of defects for various strut-based lattice topologies. The role of defects is analyzed using Weibull distributions of strut failure strains. We relate the statistical distributions of strut properties to macroscopic stress-strain performance, using high through-put finite element predictions in thousands of virtual tests. Increasing the prevalence of defects decreases macroscopic strength; however, this has the complementary effect of introducing apparent ductility, i.e. load capacity even after the onset of strut failures. Hence, there is a trade-off between achieving high strength and gradual loss of stiffness that is desirable for thermal loading or lattice cores. Predictions of average strength as a function of Weibull modulus provide knock-down factors relative to the defect-free strength. In turn, these clearly identify quantitative processing targets to mitigate the impact of defects.},

Correlative mechanical microscopy and data science were used to overcome the shortcomings associated with the lack of an inclusive solution that combines the metadata from both techniques. A modular methodology is presented, which involves routines for exploiting structural and mechanical data via reproducible Machine Learning models (code and data are shared). The approach is structured to facilitate reuse by research community for correlating characterization mapping data, not limited to nanoindentation and EBSD. Gaussian mixture models are adopted to extract mechanical phases utilizing the nanomechanical properties. The K-means++ method is used for the first time to mine information from Inverse Polar Figure (IPF) mapping about anisotropy and to extract the knowledge from images for each grain, including grain coordinates and size. Moreover, k-nearest-neighbours regression was used to perform data imputation to fill in the values of descriptors related to missing coordinates relative to those of nanoindentation, grain boundary, EBSD phase, and EBSD anisotropy maps.},

But sapphire has almost no plasticity at room temperature, making its surface finishing a formidable challenge. Realizing the plasticity of sapphire and revealing its plastic deformation mechanism are crucial for the micro-nano and ultra-precision machining of sapphire. In this work, the deformation behavior of sapphire during indentation is revisited using molecular dynamics simulation. It finds that sapphire possesses a diverse plastic deformation behavior during the nanoindentation. Systematical investigation into the evolution of dislocation confirms that sapphire realizes plasticity during indentation through alternate activation-annihilation of dislocation. In light of these results, it is reasonable to believe that an improved machining quality can be obtained by precisely controlling the machining depth to keep sapphire in the dislocation activation stage. Furthermore, our simulations provide a possible physical essence of the ductile–brittle transition during material removal observed in experiments.},

The bulb flat steel with a yield strength of 1292 MPa, elongation of 18.5 % and an impact energy of 53 J at − 196 °C is obtained by quenching and tempering process. In order to reveal the tempering response and strengthening mechanism during the quenching and tempering process of bulb flat steel, multi-scale characterization is carried out to explore the microstructural evolution and nano-precipitation behavior of the ultralow temperature bulb flat steel under different tempering processes. The results indicate that the preferential precipitation of (V, Nb)(C, N) causes dislocation multiplication, and the higher dislocation density in the matrix provides more nucleation sites for M 2 C. The slower diffusion rate of Mo effectively suppresses the rapid coarsening of M 2 C, which keep a good coherent relationship between the M 2 C and the α-Fe matrix. Strain concentration is avoided by synergizing the (V, Nb)(C, N) precipitation and the M 2 C precipitation of the coherent lattice, thus enabling the ultralow temperature resistant bulb flat steel to maintain ultra-high strength with good plasticity and toughness.},

As compared to the dislocation-dominated deformation along the extrusion direction (ED), the hardening along the transverse direction (TD) is significantly improved due to the activation of twinning. We quantified the specific contributions of twinning and dislocations to the net hardening effect through cyclic stress relaxation and calculations. Interestingly, the dominant hardening mechanism is always related to dislocations, even though the twin volume faction reaches ∼40 %. This work furthers our understanding of the deformation behavior of lean Mg alloys and indicates that the strain hardening of Mg alloys can be improved if the twin morphology is properly controlled.},

The model accurately captures the growth behavior of individual nuclei across varying length scales, and allows efficient one grid point nucleation without modifying the high driving force equation. To accommodate nanoscale nucleation within a mesoscale phase-field framework, the model incorporates an analytical subscale step accounting for critical nucleus growth to one grid point. The model was applied to the β to α transformation in extra pure titanium, for which a material-specific input parameter study was performed. Simulation results were compared to experimental results on the cooling rate dependence of transformation temperatures and mean grain sizes obtained through an Electron Backscatter Diffraction analysis of furnace-, air-, and water-cooled samples.

The deformation behavior was examined by using directionally solidified crystal. As expected, kink bands formed in alloys but two different kink-band formation mechanisms were identified. One is a classical mechanism which involves the formation of an array of dislocations perpendicularly aligned with their slip planes. The other is a new mechanism which has never been reported in any materials before, and a prior {11 2 ¯ 2¯ 2} pyramidal slip in the Zn matrix phase acts as the source, with dissociation of the dislocation supplying the dislocation for kink-band formation. The latter newly found mechanism introduces fine kink bands uniformly into the specimen, which effectively causes kink-band strengthening during subsequent deformation compared to kink bands introduced by conventional formation mechanism.

  abstract     = {Balancing strength and ductility proves challenging in high-strength wrought Al-Cu-Li alloys, particularly in extruded rods. The abundance of subgrain structures hinders dislocation movement, inevitably sacrificing the ductility. Herein, an effective strategy for enhancing the strength-ductility synergy in an extruded Al-3.7Cu-1Li-0.40Mg-0.75Ag alloy was reported by developing a novel combinatorial pretreatment (CPT), including pre-ageing after solution treatment, followed by pre-stretching. Subsequently, the CPT alloys undergo artificial ageing at 150 °C. Desirable comprehensive mechanical properties (YS = 668 MPa, UTS = 700 MPa, and EL = 12.5 %) were obtained through pre-ageing at 110 °C before 4 % pre-stretching. Notably, the elongation showed a remarkable improvement of 60.3 % compared to the non-CPT sample, without sacrificing the yield strength. Microstructure analysis indicates that the interactions between the GP zones and dislocations facilitated energy dissipation during pre-stretching, effectively mitigating local stress concentration. Consequently, promoted ductility was realized through a more uniform dislocation distribution. Furthermore, the dense GP zones formed during pre-ageing served as the heterogeneous nucleation sites for precipitates, increasing the volume fraction of θ′ phases. This adjustment in dislocation motion further contributed to ductility improvements. Our approach offers new insights into developing high-performance extruded Al-Cu-Li alloys with both high strength and desirable ductility.},

  abstract     = {A recently developed healable Al-Mg 2 Si designed by the programmed damage and repair (PDR) strategy is studied considering the role microstructural defects play on precipitation, damage, and healing. The alloy incorporates sacrificial Mg 2 Si particles that precipitate after friction stir processing (FSP). They act as damage localization sites and are healable based on the solid-state diffusion of Al-matrix. A combination of different transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging techniques enabled the visualization and quantification of various crystallographic defects and the spatial distribution of Mg 2 Si precipitates. Intragrain nucleation is found to be the dominant mechanism for precipitation during FSP whereas grain boundaries and subgrain boundaries mainly lead to coarsening of the precipitates. The statistical and spatial analyses of the damaged particles have shown particle fracture as the dominant damage mechanism which is strongly dependent on the size and aspect ratio of the particles whereas the damage was not found to depend on the location of the precipitates within the matrix. The damaged particles are associated with dislocations accumulated around them. The interplay of these dislocations is directly visualized during healing based on in situ TEM heating which revealed recovery in the matrix as an operative mechanism during the diffusion healing of the PDR alloy.},

  abstract     = {To breakthrough the long-term contradictory issue of high yield strength and low yield ratio for titanium alloys, and achieving the superior balance between these two key mechanical parameters. We have proposed an efficient “Quenching → Cold deformation → Recrystallization annealing” (QCR) strategy, which realizes the high yield strength (900 MPa) and low yield ratio (0.74) synergy for a model Ti6Al4V5.5Cu (wt.%) alloy which characterized with the unique multi-scale heterogeneous structure. The developed QCR processing route is based on the subtle utilization of orthorhombic α ″ martensite, which plays the various roles in each processing step. By elaborately manipulating the recrystallization degree, chemical stability, effective domain of β phase and α t nano-precipitates in β phase, the stress-induced α ″ martensite transformation (SIM α ″) can be controlled effectively and even postponed until after yielding induced by dislocation mechanisms, thus leading to substantially improvement of yield strength. After yielding, abundant proliferation of SIM α ″which assisted by multi-scale α phases and their interactions are the fundamental reasons for achieving higher work-hardening ability, tensile strength (1215 MPa) and uniform elongation (11%). Thus, the core strategy to realize the excellent combination of high yield strength and low yield ratio is manipulating the activation sequence of the plastic deformation carriers.},

The inclination is calculated using a linear smoothing approach developed by the authors. In bicrystal simulations with a shrinking grain, the grain changes shape to prefer low energy GB inclinations. However, in polycrystal simulations the preferred inclinations depend on the approach used to assign the triple junction (TJ) energies. Approaches that produce unimodal TJ energy distributions result in the expected behavior of preferring low energy GB inclinations. However, approaches that produce bimodal TJ energy distributions result in medium energy or even high energy inclinations being preferred.

Experimentally measured yield strengths (σ y ) and ductility were taken from the open literature and were compared against liquidus, solidus and solvus temperatures, elastic properties (Young’s, shear and bulk moduli), density (ρ), surface energy (γ) and valence electron concentration (VEC). If not publicly available, the thermodynamic properties were calculated using CALPHAD while the other properties listed above were estimated using a rule-of-mixtures average of the constituent element properties. This analysis emphasized tensile ductility. Based on the identified correlations, useful criteria for selecting possibly ductile RCCA compositions with good high-temperature strength were proposed, a few ductile and strong RCCAs were made and properties of some of them were reported in this paper. Additionally, multivariate linear regression (MLR) was used to identify new insights from the high dimensional space of the present study by modeling the influence of composition and the input thermodynamic and physical properties on the high-temperature strength and room temperature ductility. Equal concentrations of Mo and Nb in RCCAs were found to give a good balance of strength and ductility.

In order to reveal the mechanism of the effect of remelting time intervals, this study employed a dual-laser powder bed fusion equipment to ensure precise and controllable time intervals of remelting. The effects of intervals (2 ms, 5 ms, and 50 ms) on substructure morphology, microstructure and mechanical properties of 316L were analyzed. The results indicate that the grain size ranged from 13.03 μm to 26.55 μm due to the influence of initial temperature at different remelting intervals on grain size. Additionally, the composition ratio between columnar and cellular substructure varies with the time interval, which greatly influences mechanical properties. Longer intervals favor columnar substructures in high-temperature gradients, and dislocation motion is impeded, leading to an increased strength of up to 689.6 MPa. Shorter intervals promote cellular substructures in low-temperature gradients, and dislocations move smoothly along the boundaries of substructure, leading to an elongation of up to 49.3 %. Therefore, a novel method for controlling microstructure and properties is provided in this study utilizing the precise controllable remelting time intervals of dual-laser powder bed fusion.},

  abstract     = {Owing to efficient thermoelectric conversion, non-toxicity, low density and cost, Mg 2 (Si,Sn)-based solid solutions hold potential for mid-to-high temperature waste heat recovery. Yet, challenges arise from n-Mg 2 (Si,Sn) degradation at ≥400 °C caused by Mg loss and charge carrier reduction, particularly in Sn-rich compositions. To build a thermoelectric generator (TEG) stable up to 400 °C, we propose binary Mg 2 Si as the n-type leg. Using Ni 45 Cu 55 and Ni yields low electrical contact resistance (&lt;5 µΩ.cm 2 ) without altering the thermoelectric properties of n-Mg 2 Si. We fabricated two 2×2 leg TE modules with the same electrode/TE combination for the p-type legs and with Ni or Ni 45 Cu 55 for their n-type legs and tested up to 400 °C, allowing for a direct comparison between these two electrodes for n-Mg 2 Si at the device level. Ni 45 Cu 55 outperformed Ni, resulting in a peak power density of 0.79 W/cm 2 at ΔT ∼375 K and an efficiency competitive to Mg 2 (Si,Sn)-only TEG. Comparative simulations using a constant property model revealed a strong reduction of internal losses when using Ni 45 Cu 55 as the electrode for n-Mg 2 Si as the main reason for the high performance. The presented design overcame challenges such as Mg sublimation at targeted application temperature or electrode induced defect formation, resulting in a stable TEG.},

However, existing infill toolpath for CFRPCs-AM are primarily designed for 2D planar structures and do not account for 3D shell structures with complex shapes or load path dependent characteristics. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an explicit streamline tracing method to convert the stress field into adaptive infill toolpaths for CFRPCs-AM. The method leverages principal stress direction and value fields to control toolpath density and distribution while considering the minimum allowable bead width constraint. Additionally, the geodesic distance is employed to precisely represent the distance between adjacent infill toolpaths on shell structures. Experimental validation on 2D and 3D complex structures under varying conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, which significantly improves stiffness and strength by 200–300% compared to traditional uniform toolpaths for CFRPCs-AM.},

The fracture surface of the specimens, examined using scanning electron microscopy, revealed that the Cr coatings in both samples remained strongly adherent to the substrates through the completion of the tensile test. Both elastic and plastic deformation mechanisms during tensile deformation were quantified using detailed X-ray line profile analysis. High dislocation density with a unique distribution of edge and screw fractions and non-zero lattice strain was determined to be present in the cold spray Cr coating due to high strain-rate deformation during cold spray deposition. The annealing treatment reduced both residual lattice strain and dislocation density (with preferentially higher reduction in edge fractions) in the Cr coating. This led to a heterogeneous distribution of dislocation density and character among different grains, that enhanced resistance to crack propagation in the annealed Cr coating. The mechanical properties of the Zr-alloy in both specimens were not significantly altered by the presence of the cold sprayed Cr coating on the surface.},

The precipitation of large-sized M3W3C (M = Fe, Co) type carbides at the WC-11Co/matrix interface is well controlled. A favorable reaction layer is formed between WC-11Co and the matrix. Nano-precipitates are pinned within the reaction layer, exhibiting a high degree of coherence with the iron matrix. The stress field at the interface is complex due to thermal stress, phase transformation stress, and microstress. The stress state between WC-11Co and the matrix consists of compressive residual stress-tensile residual stress-compressive residual stress, with compressive residual stress far exceeding tensile residual stress. The WC-11Co/Fe0.35C5CrMn composite exhibits outstanding compressive strength of 2.18 GPa and a fracture strain of approximately 24.6 %. Moreover, the composite demonstrates excellent wear resistance, with a threefold improvement compared to the matrix under severe wear conditions.

The deformation mechanism was mainly governed by nano-scale defect heterogeneity of stacking faults (SFs), deformation twins and dislocations. The improved strength-ductility synergy is attributed to the formation of multiple SFs, deformation twining, dislocation cells, and nano-sized NbC precipitation. Moreover, the TEM observation elucidates the presence of chemical short-range order (SRO) domain in the studied HEA, which also has a major contribution in strength and ductility increment.

  abstract     = {Characterising the structure of cellular metals is a difficult task. The internal structure of cellular metals can be determined using micro-computed tomography (mCT). However, mCT scanning provides digital images in greyscale with various problematic artefacts. In addition, the grey intensity of cellular metals usually varies greatly due to the internal porosity of the material. Therefore, binary image segmentation to extract material segments from digital images is quite difficult. Our contribution can be summarised as follows. A comprehensive evaluation of various mixture models that have been shown in the literature to be useful for tomography, but for the purpose of binary image segmentation of cellular metals and internal porosity assessment. We propose a novel merging technique to merge different components of the mixture model for the purpose of binary image segmentation of cellular metals. Finally, to enforce spatial regularisation and further improve the binary image segmentation, we combine the obtained two-segment mixture model (material-void mixture model) with Markov random fields and evaluate the effects of different strengths of spatial regularisation. Our proposals are thoroughly investigated using five different types of cellular metals. The reported results are promising and competitive and speak in favour of the relevance of our proposals.},

  abstract     = {Vertical bone augmentation remains a significant challenge in implant dentistry and orofacial surgery, which is aimed at regenerating bone extraskeletal. This study conducts a proof-of-concept investigation into the effects of additively manufactured bioceramic scaffolds featuring bioinspired 3D architectures (trabecular, open channel, and layered) on vertical bone augmentation from the perspectives of osteogenesis and biomechanics. The experimental scaffold design was categorized into 4 Groups. Compression tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were conducted to assess the mechanical properties of scaffolds, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was employed to evaluate permeability and wall shear stress in scaffolds. Subsequently, the osteogenesis and biomechanical properties of these scaffolds were systematically evaluated in vivo using a rabbit calvarium model. The results illustrated that compression strength for all groups was within the typical range of trabecular bone. Remarkable bone neoformation was observed around the lower half of the scaffold, establishing a strong osseointegration effect with both the calvaria bone and scaffolds, and the highest osteogenic growth (approximately 4 mm) was observed at the interface between the titanium screw and the scaffold. This study scientifically proves that DLP-based bioceramic scaffolds effectively fulfill the osteogenic and biomechanical prerequisites for vertical bone augmentation, thereby providing preliminary validation of this concept.},

  abstract     = {Rotational head motion is one of the major contributors to brain tissue strain during head impacts, which damages axons and vessels and leads to traumatic brain injury. Helmet technologies have come to market promising enhanced protection against such rotational head motion. We recently introduced novel air-filled viscoelastic cell arrays and showed that their shear response under oblique impacts can be tailored through altering the cell wall curvature. We found that concave cells provide shear stiffness that is a few folds larger than that of convex cells. Here we test whether altering the cell curvature can reduce head rotational kinematics and brain strain and whether the viscoelastic cell arrays outperform the reference EPS foam-based liner. To test these hypotheses, we incorporate the viscoelastic cell arrays in a bicycle helmet liner. We use validated finite element models of the helmet and replace the liner with validated finite element models of the cellular cell arrays. We simulate oblique impacts at different locations to represent a wide range of real-world bicycle head impacts. In all cases, the head kinematics and brain deformation metrics indicate significant improvements with the novel cell arrays over the conventional EPS liner. We show that the shear-compliant cell arrays can reduce head rotational acceleration by as much as 64 % and brain strain by 69 %, but not in all impact locations. Cell arrays with similar axial stiffness yet lower shear stiffness often bottomed out, indicating that a considerable amount of energy is dissipated via cell shearing around the impact zone. Our results show that placement of cells with varying amounts of shear stiffness should be optimised, with the most shear-compliant cells near the crown and the least near the temples. This study shows the promising performance of viscoelastic cell arrays in protecting the head and brain under oblique impacts and provides avenues for optimising the distribution of their compressive-shear properties.},

  abstract     = {In the pursue of environmentally-friendly binders for the construction industry, metakaolin (MK) has emerged as promising material, with its hardening performance primarily driven by pozzolanic reactions. However, in systems containing MK and calcium hydroxide (CH), transformation reactions from metastable to stable phases, particularly in excessive CH conditions, can adversely affect material properties. To anticipate these processes, this study introduces a stoichiometry-based reaction modeling approach for pozzolanic MK reactions, encompassing both short-term kinetics and long-term transformation processes. The primary pozzolanic reactions of MK are briefly outlined, highlighting two sequential, partially overlapping reactions forming C 4 AH 13 and C 2 ASH 8 . Short-term reaction kinetics are modeled using isothermal calorimetry measurements and deconvoluting the two reaction peaks. The model is in good agreement with experimental quantitative X–ray diffraction (qXRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and helium pycnometer (density, i.e. solid volume) results. Model limitations are discussed based on qualitative scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) analysis. Leveraging the proposed model, the temperature dependency of pozzolanic MK reactions is analyzed, revealing an activation energy for the primary reaction of 84 kJ/mol. The model is intended to lay a foundation for designing innovative binder systems based on metakaolin, while paving the way for sustainable construction in the future.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogels have found wide applications in various fields, but further advances in hydrogel-based applications hinge upon overcoming the challenge of generating complex structures. Although three-dimensional (3D) printing enables customized designs, it remains challenging to print hydrogel structures directly without using supporting materials or incorporating polymeric or solid thickeners due to the low printability of hydrogel precursor solutions. Here, we demonstrate that direct 3D printing of sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel structures can be achieved by introducing ethanol into the SA solution. On the one hand, ethanol enables a sol-to-gel transition to occur by lowering the temperature. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the gelation occurs due to disrupted hydrogen bonding interaction among SA chains and water. On the other hand, the presence of ethanol notably increases the viscosity, yield stress, and shear-thinning feature of SA solution, making it an ideal 3D printing ink. An isotropic shrinkage of the printed structures is observed after further gelation with Ca 2+ ions and the removal of ethanol. Our study provides an effective approach for direct printing of SA hydrogels with enhanced printing resolution (&gt;10 %), paving the way for more advanced hydrogel-based applications in various fields.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in the fabrication of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) via laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) is undesirable crystal phase formation, which usually deteriorates the mechanical properties of the BMG fabricated parts. Understanding the crystallization process therefore helps to manufacture parts with desirable properties. In this study, partially crystallized Zr-based BMG (AMZ4) samples were fabricated via laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF). Samples with a different time delay between each adjacent laser tracks were produced to vary the thermal history during the manufacturing process. Two characteristic thermal effects were decoupled, a global one and a local one. The global thermal effect originates from heat accumulation in the whole sample, increasing the overall sample temperature, reducing local cooling rates from the melt and changing thermal cycles in the heat-affected zones (HAZs). The local thermal effect refers to the contribution of each individual laser-track pass, happening even in the absence of the global effect. As the time delay is increased, the sample has more time to dissipate heat, which implies a reduced influence of the global thermal effects, and therefore lower crystalline fractions. The experiments were designed such as to allow for detailed validations of the thermal fields predicted by a Finite Element (FEM) model of the LPBF process. These were indeed used as an input to predict the crystallized fraction in each AMZ4 sample, using previously measured TTT diagrams. For the first time, quantitative predictions with a numerical model could be made over a wide range of crystallized fractions, and were in good agreement with those measured by DSC. To validate the model, a 0 % crystallized fraction was also simulated, corresponding to optimized printing conditions despite the high oxygen content (&gt;1000 ppm) of the AMZ4 chosen for the experiments. It therefore represents a reliable tool for finding optimal processing parameters of BMGs known to be challenging to print.},

Moreover, the electrical and thermal conductivity coefficients of the AM sample were found to be consistent with industry standards as 5.52 × 10 7 S/m and 361 W/mK, respectively. Additionally, the potentiodynamic polarization corrosion test results of the AM sample further exhibited superior corrosion resistance in terms of the corrosion potential particularly in a 3.5 % NaCl environment. Advanced electron microscopy techniques were used to investigate the differences in the properties of the AM and cast samples and further shed light on the superior properties of the LPBF counterpart.

A negative correlation between d t - Z r O 2 dt-ZrO2 and phase transition temperature ( M s ) was also established based on strain energy and chemical free energy in ZrO 2 /TiO 2 ceramic coatings. Interestingly, t-ZrO 2 grains lost toughening effects when the d t - Z r O 2 dt-ZrO2 reaches the critical size (20 nm) even under cooling and stress. This is attributed to the number of dislocations per unit volume increases 1.5 times with the d t - Z r O 2 dt-ZrO2 decreases from 40 nm to 20 nm, which aggravates the lattice distortion and dislocation tangle and leads to the fracture toughness increases by 32.5% at 203.15 K. Therefore, the interfacial cohesion of the semi-coherent interface between (0 1 1) t-ZrO 2 and (1 1 0) TiO 2 was enhanced and t-ZrO 2 was completely stabilized when d t - Z r O 2 dt-ZrO2 reaches critical size.

The use of liquid ionic electrolyte systems has become a well-established method for electrodeposition, with the vast body of literature dedicated to this system, reflecting the depth and breadth of research. While metal deposition in liquid ionic electrolytes appears to have reached its performance limits, there is potential for further improvements by exploring alternative electrolytes, such as solid ionic electrolytes. Ice ionic electrolytes represent a promising subset of ionic solid electrolytes, readily obtained by freezing liquid ionic electrolytes, leveraging the liquid-to-solid phase transition at freezing temperatures. Hence, we propose the utilization of an ice ionic electrolyte to investigate metal electrodeposition behavior within the ionic solid electrolyte framework. Here we froze a CuSO 4 solution to create the ice ionic electrolyte. Remarkably, this ice ionic electrolyte exhibited excellent conductivity for electrodeposition, resulting in the formation of dense copper deposits with exceptional mechanical properties. Furthermore, we observed and analyzed unique behaviors involving cathode deposition, anode dissolution, and hydrogen evolution through microscopic examinations. This research contributes to our understanding of metal electrodeposition in ice ionic electrolytes and offers valuable insights for exploring novel avenues in electrodeposition studies.},

Nevertheless, the quantity of data and the initial data distribution are paramount for the discovery of highly efficient photonic devices. These devices often require simulated data ranging from thousands to several hundred thousand data points. This issue has consistently posed a major hurdle in machine learning-based photonic design problems. Therefore, we propose a new data augmentation algorithm grounded in the adjoint method, capable of generating more than 300 times the amount of original data while enhancing device efficiency. The adjoint method forecasts changes in the figure of merit (FoM) resulting from structural perturbations, requiring only two full-wave Maxwell simulations for this prediction. By leveraging the adjoint gradient values, we can augment and label several thousand new data points without any additional computations. Furthermore, the augmented data generated by the proposed algorithm displays significantly improved FoMs. We apply this algorithm to a multi-layered metalens design problem and demonstrate that it consequently exhibits a 343-fold increase in data generation efficiency. After incorporating the proposed algorithm into a generative adversarial network, the optimized metalens exhibits a maximum focusing efficiency of 92.93%, comparable to the theoretical upper bound.},

  abstract     = {Asthma is a heterogeneous respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation occurring in the bronchus. Direct delivery of targeted treatments to the bronchus for asthma has the potential to optimize therapeutic efficacy. Inhaled corticosteroids are cornerstone therapy for persistent asthma, however, there remain challenges in designing effective formulations for the inhaled route and minimizing long-term corticosteroid side effects. Here, a nanogel delivery system with good bio-adhesion based on alginate crosslinked with zinc ions was designed. The prepared alginate nanogel particles (ALG-NPs) effectively delivered icariin (ICA) which possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, to the bronchus through ultrasonic aerosol inhalation, thereby ameliorating asthmatic symptoms and attenuating bronchial inflammation. The ALG-NPs exhibited favorable biological safety and could be deposited in the bronchus to control the release of ICA, enabling targeted treatment of asthma. In addition, ICA loaded ALG-NPs significantly reduced airway inflammation by modulating key targets associated with asthm (Th1 transcription factor and Th2 transcription factor) while also inducing eosinophilic apoptosis by regulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio expression. This study suggests that the ultrasonic aerosol inhalation of ICA loaded ALG-NPs was a promising strategy of treating asthma.},

  abstract     = {Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a widely utilized technique for alveolar bone augmentation and the GBR membrane plays a crucial role in this procedure. However, developing a membrane that possesses both mechanical property and biodegradability still remains a challenge. In this study, MgNH 4 PO 4 ·6H 2 O (MNP) and polycaprolactone (PCL) were utilized to prepare a novel MNP-PCL composite GBR membrane via 3D printing method, and five different radios of MNP were included (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 wt%). All samples were well prepared into 25 mm × 25 mm square membranes with a thickness of about 0.8 mm. The membranes exhibited promising interconnected network structure with great distribution uniformity, mechanical properties, and biodegradability. Additionally, the membranes also possessed the capacities of sustained magnesium ions release (4 weeks at least) and weakly alkaline environment maintainance (pH 8.0–––8.5), which might be beneficial for promoting bone formation, this hypothesis was then confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies that the adhesion, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 and new bone formation were signicantly enhanced on 10 % and 15 % MNP-PCL surfaces. In summary, the MNP-PCL membrane may providing a new approach for the development of GBR membranes in the future.},

As a typical way to consolidate Ta powder, powder sintering solves the consolidation difficulty of refractory metal like Ta, while the temperature that required are still high which means high energy costs. In the precent work, we tried to apply metallic glass (MG) as a glue to bond the Ta powder at a low temperature (513 k) and successfully obtained the MG-Ta composite due to the excellent thermoplasty of MG. The bonding mechanism between MG and Ta powder was then investigated and the results showed that the MG and Ta were well combined with each other. Moreover, the MG-Ta composite exhibits high performance enhancement with 57 % increased of specific capacitance and 32 % increased of mechanical property than pure Ta. In addition, the specific capacitance of the composite can be improved via acid etching and the mechanism was investigated. Our results provide a facile approach to consolidate the Ta powder with low cost as well as greatly enhance the performance for its application for solid Ta electrolytic capacitor.},

This is demonstrated by analysing the response to deformation of a volume element of a non-linear, n-phase random composite, used in this study as a model material. Finite Element simulations are conducted, imposing pseudo-random, multiaxial, non-proportional histories of macroscopic strain to such volume element. The corresponding predicted histories of macroscopic stresses and other variables are recorded, to form part of a training dataset for the surrogate model. Essential additional training data is obtained by recording the changes in the homogenised stiffness matrix of the volume element during the deformation, by performing a series of linear perturbation analyses. Supervised machine learning is applied to the data, proposing suitable sets of inputs and outputs and implementing a phenomenological constitutive model based on simple neural networks. This results in a data-driven model of high accuracy.},

In this context, inspired by Fresnel lenses in optics, we design a sub-wavelength acoustic metasurface (termed “Fresnel acoustic reflector”) to achieve broadband uniform diffuse reflections. To this end, an optimization strategy that combines Monte-Carlo search and other derivative-free algorithms is proposed to ensure, as far as possible, a global optimum for the objective function when dealing with the multi-peak problem encountered in complex sound fields. Numerical simulations show that the average normalized diffusion coefficient of the designed Fresnel reflector can reach up to 0.6 in the sub-wavelength frequency range 500–3400 Hz, which exhibits a better broadband diffusion performance compared to the traditional Schroeder diffusers. The simulated sound pressure field is also verified by experimental measurements. From a general perspective, the proposed optimization strategy and simulation framework can benefit the design of interior components in building acoustics.},

However, the low bioavailability and short half-life of active components in vivo limit their application. Here, we describe a class of microcapsules (MPs) for sustained GBE delivery that have gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) cores and poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) shells. The encapsulated GBE was slowly released from the solidified MPs during degradation of the polymer. In addition, the MPs showed good biocompatibility in cell experiments. When GelMa-PLGA MPs containing GBE were applied to APP/PS1 mice, amyloid deposition in the mouse brain was reduced, and cognitive impairment was improved. These results indicate that GBE-encapsulated MPs have potential clinical value in treating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

Zirconium-based metal–organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) have been applied in various antitumor treatments. However, the intrinsic role of these frameworks in pyroptosis has yet to be determined. Here, a Zr-MOF-based nanosystem (DOX@Zr-MOF) was constructed by loading Zr-MOF nanoparticles with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) to synergistically trigger cancer cell pyroptosis. We found that DOX@Zr-MOF rapidly triggered pyroptosis via activation of the canonical caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME)-dependent pathway, resulting in significant suppression of CT26 colon tumor growth in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore, DOX@Zr-MOF significantly enhanced the systemic antitumor immune response by reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In addition, the combination of DOX@Zr-MOF with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immunotherapy strongly improved the antitumor efficacy of CT26 colon tumors. Overall, this work provides a promising strategy for pyroptosis-mediated anticancer treatment, which may efficiently improve checkpoint blockade-related cancer immunotherapy.},

The microstructural evolution and concomitant changes in mechanical properties after 5 MeV Fe ++ ion irradiation were studied comprehensively via transmission electron microscopy and nanoindentation. AFSD-processed 316 SS led to a fine-grained and ultrafine-grained microstructure that resulted in a simultaneous increase in strength, ductility, toughness, irradiation resistance, and corrosion resistance. The AFSD samples did not exhibit voids even at 100 dpa dose at 600 °C. The enhanced radiation tolerance as compared to conventional SS was reasoned to be due to the high density of grain boundaries that act as irradiation-induced defect sinks.},

Layers are grown using a hybrid high-power impulse and dc magnetron co-sputtering employing two target configurations (AlB 2 -HiPIMS/TiB 2 -DCMS and TiB 2 -HiPIMS/AlB 2 -DCMS) and no external substrate heating. Near-stoichiometric B content are achieved by co-sputtering two diboride targets. Time-resolved ion mass spectrometry analyses reveal that the ionization of the DCMS flux (Al) is much higher during TiB 2 -HiPIMS/AlB 2 -DCMS. The effect is caused by the difference in the first ionization potentials and the ionization probabilities of sputtered metals and results in lower B/metal ratios in films grown in this configuration. The B/metal ratio in the single-phase Ti 1-x Al x B y decreases with increasing Al content, which is explained by the change between angular distribution of Ti and Al atoms. Alloying with Al improves the high-temperature oxidation resistance : the thickness of the oxide-scale forming after 1 h anneal at 800 °C decreases more than 15 times upon increasing x from 0.36 to 0.74. Ti 1-x Al x B y films with 0.58 ≤ x ≤ 0.67 offer the best compromise between high-temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties with an average oxide scale thickness 90–180 nm and the hardness of 34–38 GPa.},

  abstract     = {Refractory alloys can be difficult to fabricate by laser-based manufacturing methods due to their high melting temperatures, high interstitial solubility, and propensity for low temperature brittleness. Laser-based processes, such as welding and additive manufacturing (AM), yield similar populations of defects, including microsegregation and solidification and solid-state cracking. Given the extreme challenges and cost associated with the production of refractory powders, this research aimed to develop a rapid screening methodology that combines predictive defect formation metrics with single track melting experiments. A flexible single laser track melting platform was designed to perform screening experiments on conventional and multi-principal element refractory alloys across a wide range of laser energy inputs. The platform was employed to investigate laser melting on solid substrates, or on a substrate with a single layer of powder feedstock, and is demonstrated with the highly fabricable Nb-base alloy C103. Preliminary investigations are performed on refractory multi-principal element alloys in the Hf-Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti family, and significant differences in cracking resistance and solidification morphology are observed. Implications for future alloy design and processing strategies for defect-resistant refractory alloys for AM are discussed.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach to 4D printing tailored structures with reversible two-way shape-memory effect (SME) through material extrusion technology. To this aim, methacrylated poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was synthesized and evaluated from a rheological perspective to determine its suitability for extrusion-based printing. Following a printability assessment, an optimal set of parameters was identified to fabricate 3D structures, UV-crosslinked during printing. Subsequently, a physical and thermo-mechanical characterization of the printed structures was conducted to deepen the understanding of the fabrication process and properties of the obtained structures. To assess the shape-memory properties of the printed structures, both the one-way and two-way SME under load were investigated. Overall, this study opens the floodgates to implementing 4D printing via material extrusion technology, specifically targeting PCL-based semi-crystalline chemically crosslinked polymer networks with two-way SME. Because of its cost-effectiveness, versatility, and user-friendly nature, extrusion-based printing offers noteworthy advantages over other additive manufacturing approaches when reversible behavior of the printed structures is needed. Lastly, a glimpse of potential 4D printed structures from PCL-based semi-crystalline chemically crosslinked polymer networks is presented. The approach described holds significant promise across multiple research and industrial domains, including but not limited to smart actuators, soft robotics, and medical devices.},

It is shown to be independent of the Curie temperature, as demonstrated by temperature-dependent magnetic moment measurements. CoCrFeNi alloy is chosen for detailed characterization; potential reasons for the K-state effect such as texture, recrystallization, and second-phase precipitation are ruled out. An examination of the electronic structure indicates the formation of a pseudo-gap in the Density of States, which suggests a specific chemical interaction between Ni and Cr atoms upon alloying. Hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamic (MC/MD) simulations indicate the presence of non-negligible chemical short-range order (CSRO). Local lattice distortions are shown to be negligible, although deviations around Cr and Ni elements from those expected in a fully disordered structure are experimentally observed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The determined bonding distances are in good agreement with MC/MD calculations. A mechanism is proposed to explain the anomalies and calorimetric experiments and their results are used to validate the mechanism.},

Here, the XRD, EBSD, ECCI and TEM were used to study the RS distribution and martensite behaviors in a GNS SS304 fabricated by ultrasonic surface nanocrystallization modification. We found the non-linear relationship between the magnitude of RS and the fraction of α′-martensite due to the role of α′-martensite in the development of type II intergranular RS. The maximum compressive RS of about 1,244 MPa was obtained as the γ-austenite and α′-martensite phases were each at approximately 50 %. Otherwise, the RS would decrease with the second phase fraction. The developed maximum compressive RS arises from the α′-martensite that formed directly from the γ-austenite. By contrast, the RS from other deformation structures, i.e., α′-martensite produced by γ → ε → α′, ε-martensite, nanotwin and dislocations, is relatively low. The current study classified the correlation of RS and the role of martensite for the first time, which may inspire new approaches for improving the fatigue properties of materials by controlling the phase fraction.},

In this paper, PtSe 2 thin films with controllable size and thickness are directly grown on MoS 2 nanosheet by sputtering-selenization two-step growth method. The photodetector with PtSe 2 /MoS 2 heterojunction exhibits a type-I band alignment and leads to an impressive broadband spectral photoresponse (405 to 1550 nm). It can achieve responsivity as high as 5.42 A/W, a detectivity of 2.52 × 10 10 Jones, and a fast response rate (92/112 μs for rise/fall time respectively). In addition, the device has excellent stability in the air atmosphere and keeps its photoresponse after even six months. The in-situ growth method provides a new scheme to construct heterojunctions of 2DTMDs and develop energy-efficient photodetectors with enhanced performance. It also supplements the practical production and application of large-scale broadband detectors.},

  abstract     = {Using arc-directed energy deposition (ADED) to manufacture parts with cross-structures is common in the aviation field. Inter-layer hammering with lower load demand has proved to be a promising technology to improve the microstructure and mechanical properties. At present, the residual stress (RS) evolution mechanism during inter-layer hammering hybrid ADED of the crosse-structures is not clear. In this study, a finite element model for inter-layer hammering hybrid ADED is developed to simulate two distinct hybrid manufacturing strategies for cross-structure: Alternating Inter-layer Hammering (AIH) and Complete Inter-layer Hammering (CIH). The accuracy of the hybrid model has been validated through assessments of thermal history, residual stress (RS), and warping. The hammering-introduced tensile plastic strain mitigates the compressive plastic strain caused by the cross-structure shrinkage during the deposition process and then reduces the tensile stress. The “Stress self-relief” helps to reduce the magnitude of stress under the CIH. Compared to the cross-structure manufactured by ADED alone, the stress at the cross-position is reduced to 79 Mpa and 39 Mpa under AIH and CIH strategies, respectively, from an initial 164 Mpa. Additionally, both of the two hammering strategies eliminate warping in the crosse-structure.},

Meanwhile, the biobase adenine endowed the hydrogel dressing with self-healing ability. Under 808 nm wavelength irradiation, the hydrogel was able to elevate to a mild temperature (∼48 °C) and release NO on demand, which efficiently kills E. coli and S. aureus , realizing highly efficient and mild photothermal antimicrobial therapy (PTAT). In addition, full-thickness skin wound modeling demonstrated that Gel-APB hydrogel dressing accelerated tissue regeneration, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition in S. aureus infected wounds in vivo, achieving rapid wound healing.

The success of the signal transmission investigation depends on the methods and materials used. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new approach and system for studying detecting cell–cell communication. In this work, we suggest the system of hydroxyapatite patterns demonstrating piezoresponse in conjunction with fiber-based biosensors for detection of electrical signaling in cellular communities. Our system does not disrupt the integrity of cell membrane. The cells are located on self-assembled hydroxyapatite patterns forming the tissue patterns and communicating via spatially propagating waves of calcium, sodium, and potassium ions. These waves result from positive feedback caused by the activation of Ca 2+ channels. The fiber-based ion-selective microelectrodes fixed above the patterns are used to detect the sodium, potassium, calcium ion currents in the extracellular space. We use norepinephrine to activate the Ca 2+ channels result in intracellular Ca 2+ release between the cell communities on different patterns. This system could be perspective as an efficient platform to lab-on-a-chip study as well as fundamental understanding of cellular communication during regeneration.},

However, there lacks a delivery patch mimicking nanofibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix while facilitating the in situ delivery of exosomes, thereby minimizing dissipation of exosomes and accelerating the process of wound healing. In this study, we devised a controllable GelMA hydrogel-combined Melt Electrowriting (MEW)-PCL scaffold for in situ 3D-exosome release. We showed that biocompatible scaffolds prepared by MEW have a simulated extracellular matrix with a highly controllable arrangement of nanofibers that can support cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Through cell proliferation, scratch assay, and tube formation experiments, we verified that 3D exosomes could effectively stimulate cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, with dose-dependent effects. In vivo outcomes exhibited accelerated re-epithelialization, improved collagen maturation, and enhanced angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that 3D-cultured exosomes within the scaffold significantly enhance wound repair.

Herein, we report a dual-component polymer network hydrogel (FPFG) based on gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly (ferulic acid)-F127- poly (ferulic acid) (FPF). The FPFG hydrogel exhibited injectability, antioxidative properties, good biocompatibility, and biodegradability. FPFG hydrogel could efficiently suppress the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and metallomatrix proteinase in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors in macrophages and enhance the extracellular matrix formation. The rat puncture model revealed that the FPFG hydrogel effectively restored disc height, maintained disc hydration, and preserved tissue structure. By exerting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, the FPFG hydrogel successfully ameliorated the hostile microenvironment commonly found in degenerated disc tissue.

In vivo imaging revealed the ability of the preparation to cross the BBB, and oxidative stress studies revealed the redox properties of the carrier material. The drug release data indicated that the amount of drug released from the drug-loaded samples (PMMSN-PTX) in medium at pH 5.0 was 84.1 ± 1.62 % after 10 h, whereas it was 53.7 ± 1.53 % in pH 7.4 medium after 24 h. These findings demonstrated that the drug was pH sensitive and released slowly. In vitro cell-based assays, including cellular uptake, flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining, showed that PMMSN-PTX facilitated drug delivery across the BBB and promoted tumor cell apoptosis. These in vivo antitumor effects further demonstrated that it significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation.

  abstract     = {Among the fabrication methods, 3D printing due to excellent accuracy, reproducibility and customizability as well as electrospinning due to the ability to mimic the extracellular matrix structure have received many attentions. Herein, we used the combination of both mentioned techniques to produce a biomimetic bilayer scaffold for skin tissue regeneration. The upper layer of the scaffold was made of 3D printed dextran-vascular endothelial growth factor (Dex-VEGF) to stimulate angiogenesis and cell migration, and the bottom layer was made of electrospun gelatin-keratin (Gel-Kr) nanofibers to induce cell attachment. The tensile strength and elastic modulus of the scaffolds were measured in the range of 0.26 – 0.33 MPa and 5.8 – 7.2 MPa, respectively. The investigations revealed that the release of VEGF lasted up to 7 days. The bilayer VEGF-loaded scaffold demonstrated the best cellular behaviour. Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay confirmed the highest angiogenic potential in the presence of the bilayer VEGF-loaded scaffold. Also, based on in vivo animal studies and histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations, the highest wound healing rate was related to the bilayer VEGF-loaded scaffold within 14 days. The obtained promising results introduce the prepared bilayer scaffold as a perfect construct to accelerate wound healing.},

  abstract     = {Aluminum alloy sheets with higher isotropy and finer grains possess larger post-formability and better mechanical properties. However, it is extremely difficult to simultaneously realize the isotropy improvement and grain refinement by conventional plastic deformation process. In this paper, a multidirectional rotary forging (MRF) process was applied to tune the isotropy degree and grain structure of Al7075 sheets. The isotropy behaviors of microstructure and mechanical property along different testing directions were investigated, and the grain refinement behaviors were studied. The microstructure analysis indicates that initial anisotropic textures firstly transform to different single textures individually, and then the lattice orientations of all these different single textures strongly rotate along 〈1 1 0〉 crystal direction to form the same multiple textures along 〈1 1 0〉//normal fiber, i.e. isotropic τ-fiber. The mechanical property analysis indicates that isotropic yield strength and tensile strength were obtained by MRF deformation, which was mainly attributed to the combined effect of texture isotropy and dislocation density isotropy. Strong grain refinement was achieved under the deformation amount of 70 %, and the final grain size was ∼ 0.8 μm, which were mainly contributed to the interaction effects of strong lattice rotation, complex slip system activation and dislocation gliding.},

The F m Fm of the three alloys were two-staged with notable temperature dependence. In this context, Q1 exhibited the lowest absolute slope of 2.97 (Q2: 3.44, Q3: 3.46) in the second stage. Furthermore, the E sp Esp value of Q3 was the lowest at room temperature (RT, 298 K) and the highest at high temperatures (873 K and 1023 K) among the three alloys.

  abstract     = {The influence of prefabricated dislocation features induced by rate dependent prestrain on the post-cyclic process in 7075 aluminum alloy exhibits significant variations, which are of great importance in terms of concerns, designs, and discoveries. Considering strain rate dependent prestrain provides diversified hardening stimuli for the subsequent cyclic process. The maximum cyclic stress in the post-cyclic stage was maintained at the same level as the prestress with strain rates ranging from 10 -4 s −1 to 10 -1 s −1 . Subsequently, by adjusting post-cycling stress amplitude, research was conducted on quasi-plastic amplitude cycle (QPC) and low plasticity amplitude cycle (LPC) loading conditions. Through experimental mechanism analysis, as well as verification through molecular dynamics and crystal plasticity simulations, prestrain induced by rapid strain rates enhanced the hardening during QPC, stemming from the effects of matrix reconstruction strengthening and wavy structured grain boundaries. However, prestrain induced by slow strain rates promoted the hardening during LPC, primarily arising from the non-uniform crystal structures within individual grains, which was achieved through the complex sub-crystal clusters at grain boundaries, along with intracrystal orderly slipping lattice. These findings offer new insights for the optimization of microstructural design through dislocation engineering.},

The five better strut-based designs based on [1] , are considered here. All printed specimens have been fabricated from photopolymer resin to ensure manufacturability in a digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer. Firstly, the resin and structural characteristics have been examined. Simultaneously, the lattice core is divided into three regions based on the von Mises stress distribution and tensile and compression responses in finite element analysis (FEA). Based on the mechanical responses of the beam-based structures, these topologies have been applied in each region in an optimal fixed relative density distribution, considering different steps and types. This proposed technique is numerically investigated and experimentally validated using a three-point bending test. As a result, the optimized core demonstrated a 96% increase in maximum fracture force and a 174% increase in stiffness compared to the homogeneous body. Additionally, it exhibited a different deformation mode than the single morphology under similar conditions. These significant findings indicate that this approach provides a new perspective on a high-strength design involving more than three morphologies, and it is faster than computational topology optimization processes.},

  abstract     = {In traditional noise and vibration control problems, researchers typically concentrate on a single type of sound insulation, sound absorption, or vibration reduction. It is not enough for noise control in complex environments. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a broadband noise and vibration reduction metamaterial (BNVRM) that integrates sound insulation, sound absorption, and vibration reduction into one multi-functional system. The composite structures consist of a spindle-shaped phononic crystal plate, Fabry-Perot sound absorption channels, and a micro-perforated plate. Firstly, based on the finite element method, the vibro-acoustic model of the BNVRM is established. Subsequently, each structure is studied separately as a single variable to investigate in-depth the vibro-acoustic mechanisms and parametric influence laws of different materials or structures. Finally, a material and structure optimisation design of the BNVRM is conducted based on specific frequency and noise reduction requirements. The results demonstrate that compared to a same mass homogeneous plate, the total noise reduction effect of the BNVRM is improved by 3.5 dB(A). After optimising the structural parameters, the noise reduction performance can be further improved to 7.4 dB(A). These findings provide a scientific reference and basis for the design of multi-functional noise and vibration reduction materials or structures in complex vibro-acoustic environments.},

  abstract     = {Many stiff biological materials exhibiting outstanding compressive strength/weight ratio are characterized by high porosity, spanning different size-scales, typical examples being bone and wood. A successful bio-mimicking of these materials is provided by a recently obtained apatite , directly produced through a biomorphic transformation of natural wood and thus inheriting its highly hierarchical structure. This unique apatite (but also wood and bone) is characterized by two major distinct populations of differently-sized cylindrical voids, a porosity shown in the present paper to influence failure, both in terms of damage growth and fracture nucleation and propagation. This statement follows from failure analysis, developed through in-silico generation of artificial samples (reproducing the two-scale porosity of the material) and subsequent finite element modelling of damage, implemented with phase-field treatment for fracture growth. It is found that small voids promote damage nucleation and enhance bridging of macro-pores by micro-crack formation, while macro-pores influence the overall material response and drive the propagation of large fractures. Our results explain the important role of multiscale porosity characterizing stiff biological materials and lead to a new design paradigm, by introducing an in-silico tool to implement bio-mimicking in new artificial materials with brittle behaviour, such as carbide or ceramic foams .},

In addition, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) was employed to characterize the interface morphology of the fiber cords/rubber composites.

The predominant pore framework in the leached materials was found to be capillary pores. Furthermore, the elastic modulus and micro-hardness of AAS decreased after 28 days of leaching, as evidenced by micro-indentation. The water permeability of AASs exhibited an exponential rise with the increase in porosity, both before and after leaching, as a consequence of the changes in microstructure.

By replacing the mass components in the macroscopic metamaterial vibration absorber with a composite mass body filled with microscopic particle materials, a multi-scale structure/material integrated design between the macroscopic oscillator and microscopic particle is realized. The macroscopic oscillator absorbs low-frequency vibration, while the microscopic particle cluster absorbs medium–high frequency vibration, thereby achieving a broadband vibration absorption covering the low-medium–high ranges. Based on the band gap theory and the multiphase flow theory of gas-particle, this paper systematically analyzes the band gap effect of multi-scale metamaterials and the dissipation capacity of medium–high frequency caused by particle damping. The structure exhibits commendable vibration damping performance. The multi-scale integrated vibration damper retains the lightweight and sub-wavelength characteristics of the traditional local resonance unit cells, while greatly broadening the working bandwidth, and having potential applications in low-frequency broadband vibration reduction of various mechanical equipment.},

However, conventional splint designing strategies lack consideration of biomechanical interaction with wrist joints, resulting in mechanical failure of splints or causing patient injuries. A novel design and optimisation method of customised functional wrist splints is needed clinically. In this study, we proposed a splint design method combining topology optimisation and additive manufacturing, based on the biomechanical analysis, to enable advanced customisation regarding functionality, comfort and ventilation. Three prototypes were fabricated via fused filament fabrication (FFF) horizontal printing, FFF vertical printing, and powder bed fusion (PBF). Finite element analysis was used to simulate the displacements of splints under the maximum loading provided by patients, with the results validated by physical tests. The stiffness and functionality of splints fabricated by different techniques were evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate that the developed splint is compatible with patients&#39; functional and biomechanical needs, limiting 95.7% sagittal movement, 89.8% coronal movement, and 18.7% maximum grip strength. Moreover, among the three manufacturing methods, FFF vertical printing is recommended for general clinical use considering the safety, functionality, surface quality and cost.},

However, representative solution micro-perforated panels have limitations, including narrow effective sound absorption bands at low frequencies and excessive thickness. In this study, we design a novel Archimedean spiral channel-based acoustic metasurface (ASCBAM) founded on the theories of the coiling up space and perforated panel with extended tube. An analytical model is developed to formulate the sound absorption coefficient of the proposed ASCBAM. The sound absorption properties of the proposed ASCBAM are investigated by using analytical, computational and experimental methods. The corresponding sound absorption mechanism are revealed. A structural design optimization strategy is subsequently proposed to improve sound absorption performance in wide frequency range. Results suggest that the optimized ASCBAM can effectively achieve the sound absorption in the frequency range of 347–500 Hz at a deep sub-wavelength scale with a thickness-to-wavelength ratio of approximately 1/31.6. We finally apply the concept of the proposed ASCBAM to reduce the noise of actual composite flexible machining equipment, verifying its excellent low-frequency sound absorption capacity and confirming its strong ability to solve real-world engineering problems. The proposed acoustic metasurface offers unprecedented capabilities for low-frequency noise suppression in engineering fields with lightweight requirements.},

  abstract     = {During operation in environments containing hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), such as in offshore and coastal environments, sintered nanoCu in power electronics is susceptible to degradation caused by corrosion. In this study, experimental and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses were conducted to investigate the evolution and mechanism of H 2 S-induced corrosion of sintered nanoCu, and bulk Cu was used as the reference. The following results are obtained: (1) Both sintered nanoCu and bulk Cu reacted with O 2 prior to reacting with H 2 S, forming Cu 2 O, Cu 2 S, CuO, and CuS. In addition, sintered nanoCu exhibited more severe corrosion. (2) For both sintered nanoCu and bulk Cu, H 2 S-induced corrosion resulted in the deterioration of electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and sintered nanoCu experienced a greater extent of deterioration. (3) As was ascertained through Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) MD simulations, the penetration of H 2 S and O 2 combined with the upward migration of Cu resulted in the formation of a corrosion film. In addition, compared to bulk Cu, the H 2 S and O 2 penetration in the sintered nanoCu structure was observed to occur to a greater depth, accounting for the more pronounced performance degradation.},

  abstract     = {The additive manufacturing (AM) of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) microarchitectures with sub-micrometer precision via two-photon lithography (TPL), utilizing custom photoresin containing zirconium and yttrium monomers is investigated. YSZ 3D microarchitectures can be formed at low temperatures (600 °C). The low-temperature phase stabilization of ZrO 2 doped with Y 2 O 3 demonstrates that doping ZrO 2 with ≈ 10 mol% Y 2 O 3 stabilizes the c -ZrO 2 phase. The approach does not utilize YSZ particles as additives. Instead, the crystallization of the YSZ phase is initiated after printing, i.e., during thermal processing in the air at 600 °C – 1200 °C for one and two hours. The YSZ microarchitectures are characterized in detail. This includes understanding the role of defect chemistry, which has been overlooked in TPL-enabled micro-ceramics. Upon UV excitation, defect-related yellowish-green emission is observed from YSZ microarchitectures associated with intrinsic and extrinsic centers, correlated with the charge compensation due to Y 3+ doping. The mechanical properties of the microarchitectures are assessed with manufactured micropillars. Micropillar compression yields the intrinsic mechanical strength of YSZ. The highest strength is observed for micropillars annealed at 600 °C, and this characteristic decreased with an increase in the annealing temperature. The deformation behavior gradually changes from ductile to brittle-like, correlating with the Hall–Petch strengthening mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Recently, grid composites have drawn considerable attention in various engineering applications due to their customizable mechanical properties, stemming from a wide spectrum of available configurations. Advanced additive manufacturing techniques have made the production of these configurations more feasible. While much research has focused on optimizing for stiffness and strength, there has been a relative lack of studies targeting toughness optimization, mainly due to the intricate unpredictability arising from the complexity of crack propagation mechanisms. This study seeks to fill that gap by leveraging a hierarchical deep neural network (DNN) model, integrated with finite element method (FEM) simulations, to maximize grid composite toughness. DNN model incorporates both structural configuration and stress field data, improving prediction accuracy for unseen domains. Using a genetic algorithm informed by the DNN model, a substantial 60% increase in toughness was achieved while investigating only 3.5% of the original dataset. Subsequent analyses of the stress field and crack phase field elucidated the mechanisms contributing to this increased toughness. Finally, the optimized configuration was experimentally validated by fabricating specimens using a polyjet 3D printer. The results represent a significant advancement in maximizing energy absorption, offering a substantial contribution to the field of composite material optimization.},

This review delves into the state-of-the-art experimental findings of the morphology of C-S-H and comprehensively analyses the various influencing factors. The focus here is to address the long-standing debate: whether there are fundamental structural units, either fractural globule or nano sheet, that assemble to form diverse C-S-H microstructures. We critically assess that C-S-H formation involves the structured assembly of layered nanostructure with an approximate size of 4–10 nm, rather than occurring randomly. Such nanostructure may have substantial heterogeneity and deformability, often blurring the distinction between the globular and sheet models. Finally, this paper offers perspectives on future research directions aimed at further unravelling the intricate structure of C-S-H.},

Parallel gap resistance welding is a solderless micro-joining process that favors the reliability of joints between stranded Ag-plated Cu conductors and Ag interconnectors. It was found the interfacial microstructure presented diversity and complexity while mechanical and electrical properties showed unusual nonlinear variations with welding voltage. This study aims to clarify the interfacial microstructure evolution and its effects on the joint properties while elucidating the microstructure formation mechanisms. A shift in the bonding mechanism at interfaces from solid-state diffusion to brazing was found as welding voltage reached a critical value (1.5 V). It eliminated micro gaps and built nano-scale interlocking structures, resulting in substantial improvement in mechanical properties. Increasing the welding voltage from 1.2 V to 1.4 V improved electrical conductivity due to the enlarged bonding area at interfaces. However, high welding voltage (1.6 V) led to degradation in the electrical conductivity of joints due to excessive Ag-Cu solid solution formed at interfaces. The key to fabricating high-strength and high-conductivity joints lies in achieving appropriate interfacial melting while reducing alloying by controlling peak temperature and shortening the duration above the Ag-Cu eutectic point.},

  abstract     = {The effective design of metallic metamaterials, characterized by interconnected struts or &#39;lattices,&#39; hinges on the ability to predict strut and strut intersection (&#39;node&#39;) responses. This is critical for predicting the macroscopic properties of structures comprised of thousands of struts. Computationally efficient beam descriptions, defined by strut properties like cross-sectional area, modulus, and yield stress, can significantly expedite the prediction of lattice structures and ultimately enable topology optimization. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the properties of electron-beam melted three-dimensional printed struts and their &#39;nodes&#39;—four intersecting struts. The findings elucidate the efficacy of various strategies for defining effective properties that accurately capture mechanical response. The study reveals that using a single set of effective properties can introduce inconsistencies between strut stiffness, peak load, and critical displacement. Stiffness correlates with averaged cross-sectional areas, while the peak load capacity correlates more closely with minimum inscribed cross-sectional areas. Analysis of nodes indicates that the interaction of surface defects and heterogeneity within the node strongly influences multi-strut response. Data from CT scans, EBSD scans, and nanoindentation maps highlight spatial variations comparable to the strut diameter, posing a significant challenge in defining effective homogenized properties. This study emphasizes the need for future efforts to integrate statistical property distributions with high throughput simulations to overcome the difficulty in defining a representative volume element (RVE) at the strut scale.},

The presence of ε-PL confers bactericidal properties while promoting epithelial and fibroblast adhesion, proliferation, and migration, confirming its cell selectivity. The clinical importance of the ANFDs was then demonstrated in a mice model of full-thickness diabetic wounds. The results confirm that ANFD treatment resulted in a higher rate of wound closure in the linear range of wound closure than wounds treated with silver dressings.

  abstract     = {Local oxidative stress induced by surgical trauma has been recognized as one of pathogenesis for postsurgical adhesion tissue formation. Herein, tannic acid (TA) based metal-phenolic networks (MPNs) was assembled via chelating with Fe 3+ , and acted as a novel bio-filler for nanofibrous polycaprolactone (PCL) barrier membrane to endow it with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity. By chelating with Fe 3+ , the release of TA could last for more than 20 days, rendering the membrane with continuous ROS scavenging capacity. The modified membrane could effectively inhibit fibroblasts adhesion and proliferation, as well as immune cells recruitment, infiltration, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, a complete prevention of peritoneal adhesion formation was obtained in a rat model of sidewall defect-cecum abrasion, far better than commercial Poly lactic acid (PLA) membrane. Systematic biological mechanism investigations revealed that the enhanced anti-adhesion function was mainly ascribed to its robust ROS scavenging capacity, through which the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was blocked, leading to repress of downstream NF-κB-TGFβ1-SMAD signaling pathway, finally inhibiting the bioactivity of fibroblasts and immune cells. This work provided a new strategy for the design of advanced barrier membrane, demonstrated its efficacy and mechanism on preventing postoperative adhesion, holding great promise for future clinical application.},

  abstract     = {Efficient density evolution during sintering of the as-printed component is vital to reach full densification and required properties of binder jet (BJT) components. However, due to the high porosity and brittle nature of the green compact, analysis of the microstructure development during sintering is very difficult, resulting in lack of understanding of the densification process. Density development from green state (57 ± 1.6 %) up to full density (99 ± 0.3 %) was characterized by high-resolution synchrotron X-Ray computed tomography (SXCT) on BJT 316L samples from ex-situ interrupted sintering tests. Periodicity of density fluctuations along the building direction was revealed for the first time and was related to the layer thickness of ∼ 42 µm during printing that decreased down to ∼ 33 µm during sintering. Sintering simulations, utilizing a continuum sintering model developed for BJT, allowed to replicate the density evolution during sintering with a mean error of 2 % and its fluctuation evolution from green (1.66 %) to sintered (0.56 %) state. Additionally, simulation of extreme particle size segregation (1 µm to 130 µm) suggested that non-optimized printing could lead to undesirable density fluctuation amplitude rapid increase (∼10 %) during sintering. This might trigger the nucleation of defects (e.g., layer delamination, cracking, or excessive residual porosity) during the sintering process.},

  abstract     = {Implant associated infections are a serious threat to the well-being of patients, which can be mitigated by taking effective disinfection/sterilization (D/S) methods into account. Nanogels (nGel) are stimuli sensitive polymeric hydrogel particles, which have provided numerous innovative applications in the biomedical field to enhance antifouling, antibacterial properties, or drug delivery, or they can be employed as imaging modalities or can be applied as a coating on biomaterials (implants). Prior to translating their application towards clinical use, nGel-based coated implant materials must undergo an intermediary, pre-requisite process of cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization, in sequence. The interplay among the three crucial pillars- the implant material, the nGel coating (with specific function), and the applied D/S processes influence the fate (success or failure) of medical implant in the host body. In this study, we investigated a previously developed NIPAM- co -APMA core shell nGel coating on various clinically-relevant polymeric and inorganic implant materials and tested them on a diverse range of D/S techniques to assess the retention of the coating quality and antifouling function. The stability and integrity of the nGel coating was analyzed by performing Atomic Force Microscopy and the retention of the antifouling function of the nGel-coating after sterilization was studied by Colony forming units against S. aureus RN4220. Among all the materials that were coated, polymeric materials- polypropylene and polyetheretherketone exhibited exceptional coating stability, post-sterilization while also demonstrating a considerable reduction in bacterial attachment with respect to their ‘uncoated, sterilized’ and ‘coated, non-sterilized’ controls. Although often overlooked, sterilization is an indispensable part of clinical translation, therefore research in this domain is of utmost importance when considering clinical translatability.},

Nowadays, extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) offer a potential strategy for chronic wound healing, whereas the rapid diffusion and degradation of MSC-EVs hampers the efficacy of wound repair. Herein, we proposed a novel MOF-based hydrogel by cross-linking hyaluronic acid (HA) with UiO-66-NH 2 (U6N). The HA-U6N hydrogel could be prepared rapidly with stable character, while the EVs affinity property of U6N was maintained well. This hydrogel allowed us enriching EVs conveniently and rapidly from cell supernatant. The U6N-based hyaluronic acid hydrogel with enriched EVs (HA-U6N-EVs) could markedly accelerate diabetic wound healing efficacy in rats attributing to the sustained release of EVs. Besides, we further showed the miRNAs in MSC-EVs involving in wound healing remained high abundance over 10 days, also demonstrating the superb sustained EVs delivery of HA-U6N hydrogels.},

To fabricate novel hybrid scaffolds containing beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and zirconia (ZrO 2 ), 3D printing was combined with Freeze Foaming to achieve a certain porosity, mimicking cancellous bone. The aim was to characterize the differentiation capacity of human pre-osteoblasts on the hybrid scaffolds. Although a good biocompatibility was demonstrated for the tested components of the hybrid scaffold, pure β-TCP foams showed the best results regarding osteogenic differentiation and pro-inflammatory processes. To enhance the osteoinductive properties of the β-TCP foam, the structures were also biofunctionalized with bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP–2) and its effect was analyzed either on single cell cultures of pre-osteoblasts or pre-osteoblasts directly co-cultured with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The latter served to analyze the induction of bone remodelling processes. The immobilization of BMP-2 on scaffolds and its biological accessibility could be demonstrated, however, the biofunctionalization did not result in an enhanced differentiation capacity and bone remodeling processes of either pre-osteoblasts or directly co-cultured pre-osteoblasts and PBMCs.},

However, deep-sea extreme pressure significantly alters the structure and properties of robot materials, affecting their detectability. In this study, to ensure soft robots maintain excellent performance even in such extreme environments, meticulous attention is devoted to these pressure-induced changes before designing them. The results demonstrate that applying pressure (416.67 MPa) can induce the glass transition in silicone rubber (SR) even at room temperature. Unlike the traditional realization mechanism (cooling material to its glass transition temperature (Tg)), the realization mechanism through pressurizing is reported that adjusting the Tg of target material to approach a specific temperature. Furthermore, the different transition mechanisms under the two realizations are also revealed. Based the dynamic analysis of SR under extremely low temperature and high pressure, the glass transition pressure (Pg) is proposed, and the glass transition strategy by jointly regulating temperature and pressure to construct equivalent extreme pressure environment is also investigated. This study, taking SR as the case study, holds significant importance for the future development of extreme pressure-resistant soft robots for extreme environment exploration.},

The design of on-demand tunable metamaterials requires a higher-level understanding of the relationship between the properties of the metamaterials and the geometrical parameters, which in many cases are complicated and implicit. With the advancement of machine learning and evolutionary methods, it becomes possible to design on-demand tunable metamaterials. This paper designs on-demand tunable acoustic metamaterials for noise attenuation at varying frequencies by employing a genetic algorithm based neural network method. The C-shaped acoustic metamaterials with slidable shells are combined with the specifically designed tri-stable origami-inspired metamaterials to realize the on-demand tunable structure. Experiments were conducted and showed that the designed tunable metamaterials exhibited desired characteristics in different targeting frequency ranges. The present general methodology is expected to provide a route for on-demand tunable design while exploring more possibilities for the application of metamaterials.},

During part manufacturing in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing several such complex physical phenomena arise leading to unstable melt pool behavior and part porosity. Correlating processing parameters with melt pool quantities and eventually part properties such as porosity computationally efficiently can enable real-time build failure detection and process adaption leading to zero scrap rates in additive manufacturing . The efficient and reliable process-property correlation for dense materials is an ongoing field of research, whereas architected cellular and lattice structures, which are becoming more and more relevant in the context of additive manufacturing are rarely considered in this regard. In this contribution, a dimensionless number and the corresponding scaling law are derived to describe the correlation between porosity and process parameters for components manufactured by laser powder bed fusion . The scaling law is tested and validated for the commonly used alloys Ti-6Al-4V and AlSi10Mg on both dense and lattice structures regarding its suitability to predict the type and amount of porosity in additively manufactured components. The objective of this work is to foster reliable and predictable part quality and enable quality-driven build rate optimization.},

Chemical ordering has significant hardening effect on elastic properties of Mg-Sc alloys, the C&#39; is increased by 21% for Mg 76 Sc 24 alloy, and the elastic hardening due to ordering can properly explain the increase in Vickers hardness observed in experiment. The quasi-harmonic Debye-Grüneisen model simulated the order–disorder transition temperature reasonably. The vibrational entropy increase due to elastic softening induced by disordering contributes considerably in driving the order–disorder transition. Mg-Sc alloys in ordered phase shows better thermoelastic stability over well-known commercial Mg alloys, therefore, ordering treatment of Mg-Sc are beneficial for structural application of this family of alloys. The Sc atoms (Mg atoms either) in bcc nearest neighboring lattice repel each other to form a B 2 -type ordered phase, and resultantly, the s - d and p - d hybridization between nearest neighboring Mg and Sc atoms is the main electronic reason for elastic hardening. The findings in current article not only give insight into understanding the strengthening mechanism during the ordering process of Mg-Sc alloys, but also provides a useful reference for the future development and modification of their shape memory effects.},

The group of dislocations that creates strain gradients , known as geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs), also deterministically contributes to strain hardening, micron-scale size effects , fatigue, and Bauschinger effect . During bending large strain gradients naturally emerge which makes this deformation mode exceptionally suitable to study the evolution of GNDs. Here we present bi-directional bending experiment of a Cu single crystalline microcantilever with in situ characterisation of the dislocation microstructure in terms of high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD). The experiments are complemented with dislocation density modelling to provide physical understanding of the collective dislocation phenomena. We find that dislocation pile-ups form around the neutral zone during initial bending, however, these do not dissolve upon reversed loading, rather they contribute to the development of a much more complex GND dominated microstructure. This irreversible process is analysed in detail in terms of the involved Burgers vectors and slip systems. We conclude that at this scale the most dominant role in the Bauschinger effect and corresponding strain hardening is played by short-range dislocation interactions . The in-depth understanding of these phenomena will aid the design of microscopic metallic components with increased performance and reliability.},

Prototypes of the proposed NPT were fabricated, and experimental test confirmed the fidelity of the FE model. To reveal the impact mechanism of design parameters on the mechanical properties of the proposed NPT, we used the Taguchi method for parametric analysis.

After characterizing the defect population, the critical defect size of each specimen is defined, and an empirical formulation for the stress intensity factors on this material is obtained. The ultrasonic tensile test, with a loading frequency of 20 kHz, is simulated with finite element analyses, to estimate with an optimization process the material properties that reproduce the experimental displacements. Evidence of negligible fatigue damage is verified to further support the validity of the ultrasonic tensile test as a method capable of providing a good estimate for the quasi-static tensile strength. The analysed alumina resulted in a density of 3969 kg/m 3 and an elastic modulus of 371.2 GPa. All specimens failed in 100 cycles or less, with tensile strength values ranging from 79.5 MPa to 322.6 MPa. The reason for this large experimental variability is attributed to the dispersion of imperfection sizes, with critical sizes ranging from 92 μm to 3443 μm, proving the importance of combining the information on the defect population with the assessed tensile strength.},

Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction data confirmed the high purity of the samples. The crystal structure of the prepared β-TCP was determined and the refined unit cell parameters agreed well with the reference values. From infrared and Raman spectral analyses, the characteristics of β-TCP were observed and discussed in details. Furthermore, the morphology and elemental composition of the products were examined and found to be homogenous and impurity free. The reproducibility of the material was scrutinized and showed no significant data variations.

  abstract     = {Glucose from plants or food industry wastes is a cost-effective hole scavenger for photocatalytic water splitting, but the related H 2 evolution rate is always restricted by the fast recombination of photo electron-hole pairs and the poor intrinsic activity of traditional Pt cocatalysts. Herein, we fabricated Au-Pt heterostructure cocatalyst that consist of one ∼3 nm Au core and several ∼1 nm Pt islands on ultrathin g-C 3 N 4 through one-pot photo-deposition. The heterostructure exhibited superior H 2 evolution activity to monometallic Au or Pt nanoparticles. Our experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the enhanced activity was caused by the synergistic effect between Au and Pt, rather than the well-known plasmonic effect of Au. The heterostructure not only favored the trapping of photo electrons from g-C 3 N 4 , but also had suitable adsorption strength of H*, exhibiting high intrinsic activity towards H 2 evolution. Our research provides a strategy to boost photocatalytic H 2 evolution by regulating the synergy of bimetallic cocatalysts.},

Interfaces in such composites play a paramount role in determining mechanical performance. This study delves into the crucial role of interfaces, employing VeroWhite and Agilus30Black materials to scrutinize the tensile and shear properties of stiff-soft interfaces. By applying these layers strategically, composites with multi-oriented interfaces were created, revealing the impact of soft material thickness and orientation on stiffness and strength. We identified columnar and non-columnar fracture mechanisms, shedding light on their correlation with interface hardening. Nanoindentation tests unveil the local interface properties, emphasizing the gradient change in elastic modulus when printed on the x -axis and the sharp drop on the z -axis. These findings offer valuable insights into material selection and interface optimization, providing a roadmap for achieving tailored mechanical properties in complex interface composites.},

However, few studies have investigated AM of non-equiatomic HEAs, although this type of HEAs showing excellent mechanical properties. In this paper, we additively manufactured a novel non-equiatomic FeCoCrNi HEA via in-situ alloying 316L stainless steel and CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy. Besides the fine grain size (9 μm) and high dislocation density (3.8 × 10 14 m −2 ), we observed unexpected high-intensity of hybrid crystal-amorphous precipitates, which have never been reported in NiCoCr-based alloys made by AM. These unique microstructures led to exceptional combination of strength (561 MPa) and elongation (41 %) exceeding those of additively manufactured equiatomic FeCoCrNi HEAs. Our observation from EBSD, TEM and atomistic simulations reveals a group of deformation mechanisms of stacking faults, deformation twins, TB-dislocation and dislocation-precipitates interactions. Our findings not only provide new insights into AM of non-equiatomic HEAs via in situ alloying, also shed lights on understanding the microstructure-properties relationship of non-equiatomic HEAs fabricated by AM.},

However, limited by the properties of existing printable resins, the mechanical properties of 3D-printed propellants make it difficult to meet the requirements for use. This study deals with the structural design, synthesis, and properties of an unsaturated polyurethane resin (PUA). A photoinitiator was added to this polyurethane resin and a photo-curable elastomer was successfully prepared under UV irradiation with tensile strength and elongation at break of 21.06 MPa and 1119 %, respectively. Then, the resin was mixed with active diluent, initiator, NH 4 ClO 4 , and Al particles to prepare the propellant slurry, and the rheological properties of the slurry were investigated. The results show that the propellant pastes have good flowability at 40 °C and are suitable for 3D printing. Finally, solid propellant and insulation samples with complex structures were effectively generated using UV-curable 3D printing technology, in which the tensile strength and elongation at break of the propellant samples were 0.923 MPa and 63.2 %, respectively. The fabrication of the grains with high precision and performance demonstrated the feasibility of the PUA binder in the 3D-printed propellant.},

However, the high energy consumption of conventional thermal sintering is a challenge for energy-scarce lunars. The cold sintering process (CSP), which densifies ceramics with the assistance of transient solvent, offers a solution to overcome the aforementioned problems. Utilizing the CSP at 150 °C, 200 MPa, and 15 wt% 10 mol NaOH for 90 min, the density and compressive strength of the samples reached 2.44 g/cm 3 and 207 MPa, respectively. The energy consumption of CSP equipment is only 0.86 kW·h, which is 6.66 times lower than that of conventional thermal sintering (5.73 kW·h). Furthermore, the compressive strength of the samples after three cool-heat cycles temperature between −196 °C and 150 °C was 205 MPa, indicating that the samples maintained high reliability in a simulated lunar environment. This excellent performance is attributed to the NaOH solution dissolving the oxide clusters on the particle surface, and the precipitation-generated glass phase connecting adjacent particles, making the particles consolidated and densified. Therefore, the cold sintering process presents promising prospects for the energy-efficient fabrication of lunar construction materials with excellent mechanical strength and durability.},

Experimental results concurred with the calculations and validated Cr as a γ phase-forming element in Co-Ni-Al-Ta-based alloys. The incorporation of Cr in the alloy helps mitigate lattice misfit, coarsening rate, and alloy density, while enhancing microstructural stability. A certain amount of Cr led to the development of a superalloy with both high mechanical performance γ′ solvus and low density. Moreover, the oxidation resistance of the Co-Ni-Al-Ta-based high-temperature alloy can be substantially elevated by the introduction of Cr. At 1000 °C, the Co-30Ni-10Al-6Ta-10Cr alloy displayed comparatively low oxidation weight gain, which signifies its excellent oxidation resistance.

Using finite element simulations, we observe the effects of boundary conditions on the estimate of Poisson&#39;s ratio using the combination of Time-Average Scanning Digital Holography and Cornu&#39;s method. First, we introduce the abstraction of the span-to-width ratio to an effective antinode region. This abstraction enables us to extend the direct estimation technique to plates with various boundary conditions. Second, for long and thin enough plates, the effects of boundary conditions become negligible and Cornu&#39;s method is sufficient for direct estimation of the true value of Poisson&#39;s ratio from an out-of-plane bending mode shape. We note that for many situations, the necessary plate dimensions could be a limitation. Therefore, as a third concept, we discuss the behavior of the direct estimate of Poisson&#39;s ratio with respect to each type of boundary condition. Ultimately, this research initiates a path forward for a common processing technique for making a direct estimate of Poisson&#39;s ratio across different types of opposing boundary conditions for thin plates.},

Here, the mechanical performance of bio-inspired sinusoidally architected concrete is investigated in comparison to monolithic, cast counterparts. A robotic additive manufacturing process was utilized to fabricate sinusoidal architectures in three orientations (denoted X, Y, and Z) and two rectilinear architectures and compared to conventionally cast specimens of equivalent geometries. Single-edge bend and single-edge-notched bend experiments were performed to test the strength and fracture toughness, respectively. Unlike rectilinear architectures, the X and Z-Sinusoidal architected concrete elicited a flexural strength and fracture toughness statistically equivalent to cast counterparts, whereas the Y-Sinusoidal architecture exhibited a 71 % increase in flexural strength as compared to the cast counterparts. Finite element simulations were carried out to evaluate the effect of sinusoidal frequency and amplitude on stress distribution through the test specimens. In addition, a theoretical analysis of stress concentration was conducted to understand the role of sinusoidal perturbation from surface to core. The sinusoidal architectures were observed to produce stress concentrations and non-uniform stress profiles (depending on two design variables, i.e., amplitude , A, and wavelength, λ λ ), which led to outperforming rectilinear additively manufactured and cast counterparts.},

Existing methods predominantly address macroscopic aspects, failing to unveil the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, experimental determination of shear strength parameters is time-consuming, but there is a lack of simple prediction methods. This study explores correlations between macroscopic parameters (friction angle and cohesion) and key mesoscopic shear-related factors in Porous Asphalt Mixtures (PAMs) using multiscale triaxial compressive tests, dynamic shear rheometer tests, and sessile drop tests. The research reveals that PAM is influenced not only by aggregate interlock but also by stiff mastic, resulting in a reduced friction angle at a lower temperature. Regression analyses establish a prediction formula for PAMs, incorporating the friction angle of the aggregate skeleton and the complex modulus of the mastic. A correlation function, inspired by Griffith&#39;s fracture theory, was also proposed to link PAM&#39;s cohesion with the complex modulus and the work of cohesion of mastic, and the friction angle of PAMs. Predictions for PAM&#39;s friction angle and cohesion align well with macro-level experimental results, with all the coefficients of determination of over 0.94.

Additionally, the microstructure and mechanical properties resulting from the droplet transfer mode were examined based on the variations in the transfer conditions of the molten slag.

One promising new class of high temperature materials are NiAl-based alloys. Within this study, the microstructure and microhardness of NiAl-Ta-Cr alloys with varying Cr and Ta content were investigated. Graded specimens were fabricated by laser-based directed energy deposition utilizing an in situ alloying approach by mixing elemental Ta and Cr as well as pre-alloyed NiAl powder. Thermodynamic calculations were performed to design the alloy compositions beforehand. Inductive preheating of the substrate was used to counter the challenge of cracking due to the high brittleness. The results show that the cracking decreases with increasing preheating temperature. However, even at 700 °C, the cracking cannot be fully eliminated. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction revealed the formation of the phases B2-NiAl, A2-Cr and C14-NiAlTa within NiAl-Ta and NiAl-Cr alloys. For NiAl-Ta-Cr compositions, deviations regarding the phase formation between calculation and experiment were observed. Maximum hardness values were achieved within the NiAl-Ta and NiAl-Ta-Cr systems for the eutectic compositions at 14 at.-% Ta with maximum values above 900 HV0.1.},

  abstract     = {Unconventional double-peak age strengthening phenomenon has occasionally been observed in some alloys, yet the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon are still unclear. Here, we for the first time report the double-peak age strengthening phenomenon in the Cu–Be–Ni–Co alloys and try to unveil the underlying mechanism. Both the theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the strong coherency strengthening effect of tiny nanoprecipitates (&lt;1 nm) contributes significantly to the appearance of first peak, whereas the order-to-Orowan strengthening transformation accounts for the appearance of second peak. Moreover, the precipitate evolution processes of the alloys are identified as Guinier–Preston (GP) zones → γ′′→ γ′ and the light-mass Be atoms in the γ′ phase are directly made out by using integrated differential phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) technology. Our work may provide new insights into the coherency strengthening effects and demonstrates a powerful strategy for designing high performance via double-peak behavior.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies on intermetallic glasses challenged the conventional cognition that the glass formability would be deteriorated by the presence of intermetallics. To reveal the vitrification mechanism of intermetallics, three binary metallic alloys with multiple intermetallics and wide glass forming region are focused. The thermodynamics and dynamics of the intermetallics are studied by combining experiments and simulations, revealing that the glass forming systems can be featured by low melting entropy, low diffusion coefficient, and low formation enthalpy. Close inspection emphasizes the critical influence of the melting entropy in glass formation of intermetallics, and intermetallics with low melting entropy are of enhanced glass formability. In addition, for the glass forming intermetallics, the melting entropy shows close connection to the dynamics such as diffusion coefficients or viscosity of the liquids at melting temperature, with which a basic reference to design metallic glasses is substantiated.},

The functional and supporting layers of the hierarchical porous backbones are initially reconstructed by synchrotron X-ray micro- and nano-holotomography, respectively. A particle-based model was then built to numerically infiltrate the scaffold walls with hemispherical nanoparticles. The electrode microstructural properties are evaluated on the artificially impregnated electrodes as function of the catalyst loading. A parametric investigation on the effect of the nanoparticle size is performed to analyse the evolution of the electrode characteristics. It has been shown that the volume fraction of the infiltrated phase necessary to reach the percolating threshold is increased while increasing the nanoparticle size. The density of active sites presents a maximum as function of the catalyst loading that depends on the particle size. The volume fraction of infiltrated phase required to reach the percolating threshold in the diffusion layer is one order of magnitude lower than in the functional layer (∼1 vol% compared to 3–8 vol%, respectively). The analyses contained in this paper aim at guiding the manufacturing process to the shaping of innovative electrodes microstructures combining both high activation and mass transfer properties.},

The different deformation modes, i.e., slip, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and transformation induced twinning (TWIP), were seen to initiate at different loading stresses and then to overlap. Quantitative microstructural characterization, which included the evolution of the phase fraction, stress partitioning, dislocation density, c/a ratio and lattice strain for different planes, was performed to elucidate the role of each phase on the macroscopic mechanical response of the metastable high entropy alloy. Furthermore, the magnitude of the different strengthening contributions has been quantified for the first time.},

  abstract     = {Glass is a representative of fragile material. But it can be used as a good protective cover when strengthened. As a method of such strengthening, so-called “physical tempering” is widely used for large glass plates. In this method, heated glass is rapidly quenched so that the outside part of the glass is frozen while the inside cools slowly. Such difference in frozen temperatures causes the excessive shrinkage of the inside than the outside, which generates surface compressive stress. Thus, for better strengthening, higher thermal expansion can be expected. In this research, we investigate glass which has similar expansion coefficient while it is in glassy state but is much larger when they are in the supercooled liquid state. We successfully found that the borosilicate glass system possesses systematically controllable thermal expansion at high temperatures while keeping that at a temperature below glass transition to be similar. It was available due to the systematic but drastic change in configurational entropy related to the alkali-assisted-Si-O-B bonding in the series of borosilicate glasses. Two types of tempering demonstrations show that the developed glass can be strengthened more than twice as large as that of the window glass when applied to a similar strengthening condition.},

In this study, a methodological approach is introduced to concurrently reduce costs and optimize performance via virtual product development and tailored material customization . The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated using an antenna strut in the context of space applications as an illustrative example. Moreover, strategies are proposed for the integration of pre-existing simulation models. Relevant diagrams are provided for CMC customization, alongside the introduction of a cost model based on the cost-performance ratio in contrast to a reference product. As a result, the study significantly enhances the competitiveness of CMC components compared to conventional materials, ultimately expanding their market potential.},

There is an urgent need for multifunctional materials that can address this multi-physics field coupling problem. Herein, a hierarchical multifunctional chiral metamaterial (HMCM) is proposed for damage-resistance and low-frequency broadband sound-absorption capabilities fabricated by means of laser powder bed fusion technology. Cavity resonators with internally extended tubes with hierarchical chiral configuration were selected as primary units. The damage-resistance performance of the HMCM was investigated systematically through experimental, numerical, and theoretical methods. Crashworthiness design and optimization on the multifunctional chiral metamaterial were implemented to explore the effect of geometrical parameters including distance ratio and wall thickness distribution on crushing resistance. It was determined that specific configurations in these parameters significantly enhance mechanism for dissipating energy of the HMCM. Furthermore, the designed metamaterial has been experimentally, numerically, and theoretically proven to possess quasi-perfect broadband sound absorption in the target range of 425 Hz to 553 Hz with an average sound absorption coefficient exceeding 0.9. Overall, this work not only offers a promising solution for designing multifunctional metamaterials but also highlights the potential of additive manufacturing techniques in the development of such sophisticated materials.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the mechanical properties of hot-rolled 7Mn steel are significantly sensitive to the short-time isothermal holding after ultrafast heating (UFH). These samples also exhibited significant disparities in sensitivity of mechanical properties to subsequent low-temperature tempering. Through a combination of multi-scale experimental characterization, calculations of yield strength, and numerical simulations of elemental diffusion, we discussed the sensitivities described above. The results indicate that mechanical properties of the samples subjected to ultra-fast heating is not sensitive to subsequent low-temperature tempering. This due to the preferential segregation of C atoms at dislocation sites during the ultra-fast heating, leading to less noticeable C atoms segregation during low-temperature tempering. Short-time isothermal holding after ultrafast heating results in the precipitation of numerous nanoscale carbides within the martensite, thereby reducing solid solution strengthening and significantly decreasing the yield strength. Simultaneously, the low-temperature tempering process induces the segregation of C atoms towards dislocations, grain boundaries, or phase interfaces. This significantly mitigates the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect in the sample, increasing the elongation rate of the steel from about 10% to 19%. Additionally, the combined effects of strengthening induced by Cottrell atmosphere and phase boundary segregation contribute to an elevation in yield strength.},

More importantly, the strong adhesion of the coating can provide an anchor between bone implant materials and drugs to achieve functional modification of the implant surface to enhance bone regeneration. In this review, the different effects of dopamine derivatives and their polymerization in current research were summarized. The mechanisms underlying the effects of PDA in promoting bone regeneration have also discussed in detail, providing a theoretical basis for the clinical application of PDA.

  abstract     = {The effect of configuration entropy (Δ S conf ) on thermal properties and magnetocaloric effects (MCE) of metallic glasses (MGs) remains vague. In this work, Tb 55 Co 17.5 Al 27.5 low-, (Gd 0.5 Tb 0.5 ) 55 Co 17.5 Al 27.5 medium-, and (Gd 1/3 Tb 1/3 Dy 1/3 ) 55 Co 17.5 Al 27.5 high-entropy (LE, ME, and HE) MGs with critical diameters more than 5 mm were successfully fabricated. Systematic investigations into their thermodynamic behaviors suggest that high Δ S conf might deteriorate glass forming ability (GFA) along with reduced viscosity. Simultaneously, an improved thermal stability was observed in ME and HE MGs for their high activation energies for glass transition, crystal nucleation and growth, while the notable ordered structure in HE MG could accelerate glass transition and crystal growth by reducing activation energies. Studies of MCE indicate that the distinguished spin glass behaviors and higher structural order in HE MGs comprehensively contribute to an enhanced relative cooling power and a broader magnetic-transition temperature range, whereas the change of Curie temperature and maximum magnetic entropy more depends on the de Gennes factor rather than Δ S conf . All three designed MGs manifesting the competitive GFA and MCE could be candidates for magnetic refrigeration. Our studies show that entropy tailoring seems to play a dominant role in determining thermodynamic behaviors, which could help to design more stable MCE MGs.},

However, only few studies have focused on the effect of these geometries on the properties of the material fabricated using this technology. In this work, we studied the impact of wall thicknesses below 1 mm on microstructure formation and mechanical properties in 316L parts fabricated by L-PBF. The size and geometry of melt pools varied significantly between different wall thicknesses due to powder denudation and local preheating, resulting in non-symmetrical melt pools for thicker samples. Furthermore, in the sub-grain microstructure, the thinnest samples consisted of solidification cells oriented almost parallel to the building direction. In the thicker walls, side branching and slender columnar grains were observed in the center lines of the melt pools. On the grain size scale, the thinnest samples consisted of finer grains with a more pronounced texture 〈100〉, while large grains growing parallel to the build direction and texture 〈101〉 were found for the thicker samples. Mechanical tests showed that the strength and ductility were higher in thicker samples, which was attributed to finer solidification cells.},

  abstract     = {Half-metallic chromium dioxide (CrO 2 ) is a promising candidate in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) devices due to its nearly full spin polarization and ultralow Gilbert damping at room temperature. In this study, we succeeded in fabricating (1 1 0) and (1 0 0)-oriented RuO 2 /CrO 2 bilayers with different thicknesses of CrO 2 film using two-step method. The CrO 2 film epitaxially grown on a RuO 2 layer exhibits a perfect in-plane magnetic uniaxial anisotropy. The magnetic relaxation of CrO 2 films can be strongly modulated via the proximity to RuO 2 layer, which may relate to the enhancement of the two-magnon scattering due to effects of antiferromagnetic order in RuO 2 film. In addition, electronic transport measurements indicate that the electronic characteristic is strongly related to the film growth orientation, and a linear magnetoresistance is observed stemming from intergrain tunneling magnetoresistance and double-exchange mechanism. Angle-dependent ferromagnetic resonance measurements indicates that the uniaxial anisotropy in CrO 2 film is strongly related to the strain effect, which is consistent with reciprocal space mapping results. This work lays a foundation for current-drive MRAM based on RuO 2 /CrO 2 bilayer and provides a feasible damping modulation method for CrO 2 film.},

The limited range of suitable components means that chemical modification does not fully address inherent brittleness. This study introduces a novel coaxial 3D printing method to create tooth enamel biomimetic composites using stiff silicate and flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as strengthening and toughening agents, respectively. Unlike standard silicate composites, this method produces an interpenetrated microstructure in which silicate and PVA maintain geometric continuity. This biomimetic structure, regulated internal stress, and crack propagation inhibition contribute to the silicate–PVA composites considerably enhanced mechanical properties, including flexural strength (10.3 MPa), ductility (4.68 %), and fracture energy (1.5±0.9×10 4 N/m), beyond the inherent brittleness of pure silicate blocks. In situ characterization and multiscale simulation of stress distribution and deformation behavior further validated multiple toughening mechanisms. These mechanisms include silicate bridge fracture, interface detachment, and PVA rupture, along with complex cracking patterns. The significantly strengthened and toughened biomimetic silicate–PVA composite suggests promising potential for use as a structural material in engineering resilient structures.},

However, the adverse inflammatory and immunological reactions due to the PEEK surface after implantation often cause poor osseointegration and thereby hinder its clinical utility. To improve osseointegration and enhance the success rate of PEEK implants, the surface can be biofunctionalized to be immunomodulatory. Consequently, in this study, lithium-doped bioglass nanospheres (Li/BGs) was coated on the sulfonated PEEK surface. Furthermore, we assessed the anti-inflammatory potential of the biofunctionalized PEEK implants and their impact on osteogenesis. In our study, it was observed that the in vitro biofunctionalized PEEK surface exhibited enhanced osteogenesis and immunomodulatory osteogenesis properties, while also effectively suppressing the acute inflammatory response initiated by macrophages. Furthermore, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the biofunctionalized PEEK surface contributed to improved osteogenesis properties and mitigated the formation of fibrous capsules. Therefore, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that PEEK surface modification with Li/BGs not only changed the disadvantage of being bioinert on the surface but also endowed it with osteoimmunomodulatory regulation and bone-promoting properties. Thus, the biofunctionalized PEEK may be a promising candidate for use as an orthopedic implant in clinical settings.},

Natural polyphenols are well documented for their excellent antioxidant properties and have obvious advantages in the strategy of anti-oxidation treatment of UC. However, the poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and unstable nature have hindered their clinical application. Therefore, we efficiently encapsulated bioactive polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) via reliable intermolecular hydrogen-bonded interactions, and conjugated polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate (CS) with excellent gastrointestinal stability and CD44 active targeting capability onto the surface to achieve targeted delivery (EPC). The obtained EPC system showed an average diameter of 54 nm, monodisperse size distribution, and negatively charged surface. In vitro studies demonstrated the obvious reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging and anti-inflammatory abilities of the EPC system. After oral administration, EPC system localized in the inflamed colon and effectively alleviated the symptoms in dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced UC mice. Specifically, the EPC system down-regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, up-regulated the expression of tight junction-associated proteins to restore intestinal barrier, and modulated the gut microbiota. This oral drug delivery system with a simple self-assembling process may pave new strategy for polyphenol-based therapy in UC.},

However, due to the non-equilibrium solidification characteristics during the laser melting process, the commercial Al alloys with high performance and laser formability face several bottlenecks in alloy composition design and preparation. This paper employs a material genetic design method to develop a novel laser cladding Al 14 Mg 9 Zn 6 Cu 2 Mn 0.5 Si 0.6 Er 0.4 Zr alloy, which exhibits excellent laser formability and better strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance under an optimized laser energy density of 1157 J/mm 3 . Specifically, an in-situ generated T-AlMgZnCuZrEr genetic phase with internal cell-like α-Al was first discovered, which significantly improves the properties of the alloy. The alloy sample demonstrates a remarkable compressive strength of 663 MPa along with a deformation of 15 %. The compressive strength and deformation product of the laser cladding sample reaches 9.9 GPa%, which is 13.44 % higher than that of the high-strength AlZnMgCu alloy prepared by other subtractive manufacturing processes. The mechanisms of matching strength-toughness and corrosion resistance of the alloy have been elucidated. This study provides a feasible material design and preparation pathway for laser additive manufacturing of high-performance and lightweight Al alloy high-speed train brake discs.},

Identification of novel nanocarbon materials such as graphene or carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offers great potential as a reinforcement material in metal matrix composites (MMCs) due to their superior strength and electrical properties. However, challenges exist in achieving uniform dispersion of graphene during manufacturing. Traditional methods and advanced techniques like chemical vapor deposition or spark plasma sintering have limitations in terms of cost and scale of production. In this research, a friction-stir based novel SolidStir® Extrusion (SSE) technique was used for the in situ synthesis of Al-graphene MMC cables. Key factors and phenomena driving the exfoliation process that leads to graphite → graphene conversion during SSE were studied by comprehensive characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A constitutive Raman analysis revealed that SSE led to the exfoliation of graphite into multilayered graphene. Furthermore, mechanical property characterization and electrical conductivity (EC) tests conducted on SSE-processed Al-graphene MMC cables demonstrated a favorable synergy between strength and EC. The findings of this study provide a benchmark to understand the SSE capabilities to produce next-generation conductive cables for energy and power sectors.},

We collected 179 OIHPs with a variety of organic cations and screened out 6 features from 10,622 descriptors. Subsequently, a decision tree model was created to predict the dimensionality of OIHPs, achieving a LOOCV accuracy of 0.94 and a test accuracy of 0.89, respectively. Then, one candidate from a virtual space with 8256 samples was successfully synthesized, which was consistent with the prediction of the model. Finally, three rules were produced by visualization of the tree structure to generally discriminate 2D from non-2D OIHPs. It is believed that the diagrammatic model has reliability in identifying 2D OIHPs and will serve further property studies of OIHPs in the future.},

The impact of the particle size of the powders and the volume fraction (v.f.) of the composites on the effective dielectric permittivity has been systematically investigated. The Nicolson-Ross-Weir (NRW) conversion and the Birchak dielectric mixing model were employed. Optimal absorption conditions predicted by RL simulations were validated through experimental waveguide measurements for mono/bi-slab systems of paraffin-carbon composite samples. The mono-slabs with a particle size of 3.5 μm showed the best versatility for tailoring the RL in the X-band through v.f. variations while maintaining a fixed thickness of 2 mm. In addition, a bi-slab system (powder-paraffin/paraffin) for such powder size, at 18.0 % of v.f., showed an enhanced RL with a bandwidth of 2.6 GHz and a minimum of − 40 dB (at 11 GHz). Other dielectrics based on resin:paint mixtures were tested to replace the paraffin-matrix, revealing a strong powder-matrix interaction capable of modulating the effective dielectric permittivity.

Conventional topical use of antibiotics is not effective due to the skin barrier and oral administration can adversely affect the intestinal flora. Microneedle is a novel type of localized drug delivery system that noninvasively breaks through the stratum corneum barrier and effectively enhances the transdermal absorption of drugs. Here, Bletilla striata polysaccharide (BSP)/Hyaluronic acid (HA) loaded Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was used as the microneedle body to easily penetrate the epidermis and enhance antibacterial ability. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Diatomaceous earth (DE) are used as the microneedle backing to absorb pus and bacterial debris, prevent re-infection of bacteria and promote skin healing. Compared to traditional antibiotics, the excellent skin permeability of EGCG@BSP/HA MNs studied here can improve the efficacy and solve side effects and drug resistance. In vivo studies in mice models induced by P. acnes showed that this microneedle could effectively reduce skin swelling, inhibit bacterial growth and reduce the levels of TNF-α, IL-8 and MMP-2.

  abstract     = {Critical limb ischemia (CLI) remains a significant clinical challenge with high morbidity and mortality. Considering the critical role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) in hypoxic site to induce angiogenesis by regulating the expression of growth factors, we prepared a cooperative composite (P-F-HKUST-1) by mixing thermo-responsive hydrogel (PPCN) with folic acid modified copper-based MOFs (F-HKUST-1) for the hindlimb ischemia therapy. The gelation of P-F-HKUST-1 in hindlimb muscle generated a more serious ischemia environment and subsequently induced the expression of HIF-1α, while the slowly released Cu 2+ from P-F-HKUST-1 increased HIF-1α stability by inactivating the factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (FIH-1), which synergistically induced the productions of downstream growth factors and finally restored the blood perfusion rapidly. In addition, P-F-HKUST-1 hydrogel exhibited a long in vivo retention time, which endowed the sustaining action on HIF-1α to reduce the frequency of administration. The rapid blood flow recovery, together with the good biocompatibility suggested that P-F-HKUST-1 could be a potential novel combined therapy (HIF-1α stimulation and stabilization) for critical limb ischemia.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of power modules demands more reliable insulating circuit substrates. Traditional substrates, comprising Cu and Si 3 N 4 , are produced using active metal brazing (AMB). However, AMB substrates have reliability concerns owing to electrochemical migration and void formation from brazing filler metals. This study introduces a quasi-direct Cu–Si 3 N 4 bonding technique using a Ti/Al bilayer active metal deposition at the bonding interface. A sputtered Ti/Al bilayer was formed on the Si 3 N 4 surface, then heated and pressurized the sputtered Si 3 N 4 substrate with Cu sheets in vacuum to bond each other without voids or delamination . The Ti/Al layers reacted with Si 3 N 4 and Cu, forming a 300 nm intermediate layer. TEM observations show this layer contains segregated Ti–N and Cu–Al phases, with a good lattice match to Si 3 N 4 and Cu–Al. Temperature-cycling tests on the Cu/Si 3 N 4 /Cu substrate revealed delamination caused by increased tensile stress at the periphery of the bonding area due to asymmetrical Cu patterns. This novel quasi-direct Cu–Si 3 N 4 bonding technique addresses issues of electrochemical migration and void formation seen in AMB substrates, offering a reliable bonding interface for power electronic substrates.},

Our approach involves the development and utilization of a novel nanobrush structure of carbon nanofiber within the mortar matrix. The high number of nanostructures in the nanobrush, particularly near the electrodes, results in a greater number of nanogaps, leading to a substantial improvement in sensitivity. We are able to detect forces as small as 1 N using this sensor. The carbon nanofiber brush (CNFB) provides a well-defined conductive path for the piezoresistive functioning of the super-sensitive carbon nanofiber aggregate (SSCNFA) with significantly reduced cost. The influence of scanning frequency in impedance is rigorously investigated with alternating current (AC) based on two methods. SSCNFAs are tested in uniaxial compression to determine the highly sensitive face of cube sensor. An SSCNFA (0.05 % CNFs, dense electrodes) and a CNFA (0.5 % CNFs, wide-spaced electrodes) were tested in a sweep-frequency test under parallel compression to compare the super-sensitive performance of the new sensor. The gauge factors at various frequencies were determined. The electrical impedance measured at various frequencies provides versatility to the SSCNFA for stress monitoring. Four fixed-frequency tests were conducted to determine the resolution under uniaxial compression and examine repeatability.},

Discovering new HEAs with desirable properties is crucial, but traditional design methods are laborious and time-consuming. Fortunately, the emerging Machine Learning (ML) offers an efficient solution. In this study, composition-microhardness data pairs from various alloy systems were collected and expanded using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). These data pairs were converted into empirical parameter-microhardness pairs. Then Active Learning (AL) was employed to screen the Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni system and identify the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as the optimal ML master model. Millions of data training iterations employing the XGBoost sub-model and accuracy evaluations using the Expected Improvement ( EI ) algorithm establish the relationship between HEA compositions and microhardness. The proposed sub-model aligns well with experimental data, wherein four Al-rich compositions exhibit ultra-high microhardness (&gt;740 HV, with a maximum of ∼780.3 HV) and low density (&lt;5.9 g/cm 3 ) in the as-cast bulk state. The hardening increment originates from the precipitation of disordered BCC nanoparticles in the ordered AlCo-rich B2 matrix compared to the dilute B2 AlCo intermetallics. This lightweight, high-performance alloy shows potential for engineering applications as thin films or coatings.},

  abstract     = {This study delves into the dynamics of molten metal deposition (MMD)-based drop-on-demand (DoD) printing, focusing on the interaction between aluminum droplets and substrates. Nozzle-to-substrate distances below 20 mm prevent droplet pinch-off, while distances exceeding 40 mm result in no droplet-substrate adhesion. Operating within the substrate temperature range of 350–550 °C is crucial, avoiding delamination, and shrinkage pits at lower temperatures, and substrate deformation and heightened oxidation at higher temperatures. Droplet adhesion is impeded at nozzle temperatures below 700 °C. Impact-driven and inviscid, DoD-MMD exhibits spreading outpacing overall solidification, particularly at higher temperatures. Surface tension forces dominate, influencing droplet spreading and leading to underdamped interfacial oscillations. Weak droplet-substrate adherence, facilitated by Van der Waals forces, allows easy droplet detachment, beneficial for successive drop-on-drop deposition. Unique to DoD-MMD, ridges along the droplet periphery act as solidification paths, influenced by thermal contraction and surface tension. The spherical pancake shape of the droplet, characterized by a solidification angle &gt;90°, is elucidated through Weber and Freezing numbers. The final deposited droplet width to initial diameter ratio increases with the droplet temperature and deposition height. In contrast to other metal DoD studies, the spreading factor decreases with a rise in substrate temperature, attributed to intensified oxidation at higher substrate temperatures.},

However, it is difficult to fabricate advanced ceramic parts with desired performance for structural and functional applications using this technology, because numerous binders used in ceramic SLAM must be removed by thermal debinding (TD), resulting in various defects generation and long processing period. In this review, we first focus on the raw materials used to create photocurable ceramic suspensions that greatly affect the TD process. We then highlight three important issues related to the TD process: TD mechanism, characterization method, and TD procedure design. Besides, this review summarizes the basis and principles for designing reasonable TD profiles for various practical applications. Finally, this review presents the challenges and future perspective for TD of ceramic SLAM. This review provides an overview of the crucial TD process for advanced ceramic components fabricated using SLAM approach, thus providing valuable reference information and helping readers grasp the theoretical foundation for the targeted design of TD schemes to stimulate the development of advanced ceramic parts manufactured by SLAM in both academia and industry.},

It is essential to understand the damage initiation and damage growth in these high strength steels and further shed light on improving mechanical properties. In this work, two DP800 dual phase grades are investigated, which exhibit identical ultimate tensile stress but significantly different elongation in the uniaxial tensile test. To explain the difference in ductility, particularly described by uniform elongation, we investigate the damage initiation and growth mechanisms by analyzing microstructural changes upon deformation, such as voids, dislocation structures and the grain morphology. Furthermore, ferrite micropillars in pre-strained samples are tested in situ to capture the strain hardening capability of ferrite. We found that the DP steel with harder martensite and softer ferrite exhibits more damage initiation sites after deforming to an identical strain. However, void growth is much slower compared to the DP steel grade with fewer initiation sites. We explain the suppressed void growth by significant strain-hardening of ferrite surrounding the voids, which is observed in the micropillar compression experiments. The improved strain hardening of ferrite originates primarily from the difference in chromium content considering the negligible influence of dispersed particles.},

In 316L, high stored energy inherited from the high cooling rates of laser processing creates strong crystallographic textures and stable cellular walls, which challenges the possibility of inducing fast recrystallization. In a first step, we perform here a laser heat treatment on a highly deformed 316L steel, and show that in-situ X-ray Diffraction (XRD) is a viable tool for the monitoring of fast recrystallization. The evolution of Bragg peak width over time is connected to the evolution of dislocation density and grain size, thanks to Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) characterization. X-ray signals are shown to reveal different stages of recrystallization, in particular the development of dislocation cells and the onset of nucleation.

Despite extensive investigations into the microstructure of MPP-based carbon fibers, the influence of these factors on deformation mechanisms under tension remains unclear. This study employs the continuous defective graphene nanoribbons (dGNR) atomistic structure model for molecular dynamics simulations to explore the tensile failure mechanisms of MPP-based carbon fibers. In the simulation model, the structure of the defective region was generated through high-temperature annealing, and a transition region was introduced to prevent distortion and damage to the active graphene edges. The simulation reveals the evolutionary process of the microstructure of MPP-based carbon fibers under tension and achieves Young’s modulus predictions with greater accuracy than theoretical models. Additionally, the study shows that different strengths of interactions between adjacent graphene nanoribbons can lead to two distinct failure modes. Models with larger crystallite dimensions along the fiber axis and lower average defective concentrations exhibit geometric deformation coordination between adjacent nanoribbons, potentially elucidating the increasing strength trend in MPP-based carbon fibers with rising graphitization levels. Our simulations provide insights into the tensile failure mechanisms of MPP-based carbon fibers, offering valuable guidance for regulating their microstructure to enhance mechanical performance.},

Currently, wound dressings with immunoregulation is necessary to overcome the complicated interventions, high-cost treatments and uncontrolled release behaviors. In this study, a novel Cu and Zn loaded nanofiber dressing (FM-Cu-Zn) with immunoregulation and controllable release without external intervention was prepared by electrospinning. The dressing is composed of ZnCl 2 , CuS nano particles, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate (P34HB). Where Zn 2+ is the “promoter” of immunotherapeutic activity by reducing the environmental pH to trigger H 2 S and Cu 2+ releasing from CuS. Then, H 2 S and Cu 2+ can regulate the inflammatory response and accelerate wound healing. The results in vivo indicated the FM-Cu-Zn nanofiber dressing showed better anti-inflammatory and wound healing ability, the wound healing rate was upto 95 % after 11 days treatment by the obtianed dressing, which was much higher compared to control groups. Notably, the dressing can promote macrophage polarization toward a pro-regenerative M2 phenotype without any external intervention. Therefore, the FM-Cu-Zn nanofiber with the immunomodulatory property can serve as a promising dressing in wound healing field.},

  abstract     = {SARS-CoV-2 has been causing severe impacts on all aspects of society for more than three years. Antigen immunoassay is the main detection method of SARS-CoV-2 at present. Here, a magnetic photonic crystal microsphere with a Janus structure is designed for synchronous detection of SARS-CoV-2-associated antigens. One hemisphere of the Janus microsphere is a photonic crystal assembled by silica nanoparticles, where the structural color serves as the encoding basis for multiplex detection and the surface is functionalized with the capture antibodies. The other hemisphere of the Janus microsphere is assembled by magnetic nanoparticles, allowing the controlled movement of the microspheres in a magnetic field, thereby enhancing antigen capture efficiency. It is demonstrated that this ingeniously designed detection platform can rapidly and simultaneously detect spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 based on a double-antibody sandwich immunoassay strategy. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.478 ng/mL for spike protein and 0.255 ng/mL for nucleocapsid protein. Hence, the Janus photonic barcodes provide a new avenue for multiplex detection of SARS-CoV-2-associated antigens and have the potential to be utilized in the assay of other disease-related biomarkers.},

  abstract     = {In regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, the repair and replacement of damaged or lost bone tissue remains an enduring challenge. Traditional approaches often fail to achieve desired outcomes, but recent advancements in material science have introduced innovative solutions to this issue. Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), which is derived from gelatin, has a unique combination of biocompatibility and tunable physical properties for bone tissue engineering applications. In this study, a novel composite was constructed to combine the characteristics of GelMA and bioactive layered double hydroxide (LDH) loaded calcein. The GelMA-LDH-calcein (GLC) scaffold is designed to promote the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and provide a microenvironment conducive to osteogenic differentiation, ultimately increasing the osteogenic activity to support bone regeneration. Our data demonstrated that GLC promoted the osteogenic differentiation related gene (ALP, Runx2, and OPG) expression in bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) and angiogenesis of human vascular epithelial cells (HUVECs), making it particularly valuable in the application of bone regeneration in vivo . Through the design, synthesis, and optimization of GLC composites, the optimized scaffolds can provide structure supporting and biological activity for cell proliferation, which promoted bone defect regeneration and could be used for further clinical applications.},

Additionally, the development and spread of solid tumors is highly dependent on neovascularization. An RGD-modified acid-responsive peptide was designed to encapsulate the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) and the antiangiogenic drug sorafenib (SF), enabling them to self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) in a physiological environment. In an acidic environment, the release of PTX and SF was achieved when the drug-loaded experimental peptide PS/Pep1 transformed from spherical NPs into aggregates containing nanofibers, which effectively prolonged the retention of the encapsulated drug and increased drug accumulation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments provided compelling evidence of the strong inhibitory effects of PS/Pep1 on tumor growth and metastasis, as well as its effective suppression of angiogenesis. This targeted NP system that undergoes a morphological shift in the tumor microenvironment holds promise for enhancing the efficacy of the combined administration of chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic drugs to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.},

In this study, natural-based trimethyl chitosan, permanently burdened with a positive charge, was successfully distributed on the surface of melt-blown polypropylene sheets through a metal rod coating process. This surface modification was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating the surface adsorption of trimethyl chitosan without chemical bonding. Modifying polypropylene mask filters yielded a positive surface zeta potential for 10–20 g/m 2 coat weight, increasing the filtration efficiency to 55–94 % in a standard particle filtration test using paraffin oil as a liquid aerosol. The filtration efficiency remained higher than conventional non-treated mask filters even after the humidification of sheets. In addition, the filtration test against fine dust particles, such as titanium dioxide, was performed with trimethyl chitosan-modified mask filters that captured up to 100–800 µg/m 3 titanium oxide particle concentrations, showing better filtration than conventional mask filters in high fine dust events. Trimethyl chitosan-modified mask filters also exhibited potent inhibition, bactericidal, and antiviral effects against HCoV-OC43, reducing the virus infection rate by 93.69 %. Thus, trimethyl chitosan could be applied to several existing filter membranes to protect against particulate matter and dangerous airborne pathogens.},

In this work, Keggin-type phosphotungstic acid (H 3 PW 12 O 40 , PWA) is self-anchored on the three-dimensional network of BC by a simple diffusion method at room-temperature. BC fibers can protect the well-dispersed PWA with high transparency, high mechanical strength, and high stability. When PWA/BC serves as a photochromic material, the coloration time and bleaching time are only 3 min and 30 min respectively. After 6 cycles, the photochromic ability of the PWA/BC composite film almost unchanged. At the same time, we convert the coloration and bleaching degree into quantitative data including a color difference calculation of ΔE 2000 and the remaining degree of color (RC%). Within the BC system, PWA exhibits a special linear relationship between RC% and bleaching time (0–30 min). The processes of PWA/BC reduction (W 6+ →W 5+ ) and oxidation (W 5+ →W 6+ ) are analysed by photo-electrochromic, XPS and ESR characterizations. The revealed excellent photochromic properties of soft PWA/BC films highlight their potential as the photoresponsive materials.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new type of energy-absorbing hierarchical tapered structure, mimicking the hierarchical architecture of barnacle. The proposed structures are designed by iteratively incorporating sub-tapered tubes at the junctions of primary ribs aiming to enhance the crashworthiness performance. The finite element models of the proposed structures are constructed in Abaqus software and validated using experimental testing. The effects of the geometrical parameters including the number of substructures and the external-to-internal wall thickness ratio on the energy absorption characteristics of the proposed structures are investigated. The results demonstrate that as the number of substructures increases, the specific energy absorption ( SEA ) and mean crushing force of the proposed design show a significant improvement. Specially, the SEA of the proposed structures with four substructures can reach 32.78 kJ/kg, which is 85.8 % higher than the conventional tapered tube. Additionally, decreasing the ratio of external to internal wall thickness leads to enhanced performance. After optimizing the wall thickness ratio, the maximum SEA can reach 40.87 kJ/kg, which is 26.0 % higher than that before optimization. To complement the findings, a theoretical study is presented, which exhibits excellent agreement with the numerical results, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed design. This study highlights the potential of incorporating hierarchical and tapered features into tapered structures, offering promising prospects for advancements in energy absorption technology across diverse industries.},

A laser directed energy deposition, a specific type of additive manufacturing, was employed using multiple powder feeders and elemental powders. Fifty superalloys of different compositions were deposited and the heat-treated microstructure and γ&#39; solvus temperature were examined. The 43Ni–38Co–9Ti–6Al–4Mo superalloy (atomic percent composition) exhibited a uniform γ/γ&#39; microstructure and a γ&#39; solvus temperature of 1202°C. The beneficial properties of the superalloy were also found in the cast superalloy of identical composition. The cast superalloy exhibited a thermally stable γ/γ&#39; microstructure with cuboidal γ&#39; precipitates even after long-term aging heat treatments at 800°C, 900°C, and 1000°C up to 500 h. The γ&#39;-coarsening mechanism was evaluated based on the Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner model and the trans -interface diffusion-controlled model. A transition between these two mechanisms was observed with an increase in aging temperature. Atom probe tomography analyses revealed that the sluggish interface diffusion of Co and corresponding reduction of the interfacial energy induced the transition of the γ&#39;-coarsening mechanism. Moreover, the cast superalloy showed an enhanced specific yield stress attributed to its exceptionally low alloy density of 7.61 g/cm 3 .},

Due to the compact design and wide operating frequency of metalens, it becomes promising in applications like information encryption, imaging, and wireless communication fields. However, the fabrication of large-aperture metalens is still time-consuming and costly while the focusing performances are commonly tuned by introducing active materials requiring extra stimuli, such as laser and electrical pulses. In this study, five designs of metalenses with synthetic rectangular aperture are proposed and demonstrated with excellent focusing performances. By reconfiguring the synthetic aperture, focusing properties like focusing lengths, full width at half maximum values, and modulation transfer function can be tuned with great flexibility. With a polarization-dependent phase-shifting structure, the proposed metalens shows different focusing performances with incident wave under transverse magnetic field and transverse electric field modes. By utilizing spatial multiplexing, terahertz variable foci metalenses based on a stretchable single-, dual- and quad-axis synthetic rectangular optical sparse aperture are investigated to achieve tunable multifocal performances. These designs provide a novel strategy that can reconfigure the synthetic aperture with stretchable substrate to make metalens with multifunction and active tunability, which show promising applications in imaging, information encryption, and space telescope areas.},

The results showed that when maintaining a PLA: PBAT weight ratio of 7:3, high-quality porous PLA/PBAT composites were achieved, leading to a 36.25% increase in toughness and a 4.9% increase in biodegradability compared to pure PLA. Furthermore, in vivo wound healing assays suggest that composites successfully loaded can effectively promote wound healing on the 13th day.

Therefore, it&#39;s urgently required to develop one type of innovative dressing patch with appropriate microstructure and multifunctions to regulate the pathological microenvironment and promote the regeneration of diabetic wounds. In this study, novel gelatin (Gel)/poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibrous yarns loading with or without Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge-Radix Puerariae herbal compound (SRHC) are fabricated by using our modified electrospinning strategy, which are further interlaced into nanofibrous woven fabrics respectively, serving as biofunctional dressing patches for potential diabetic wound treatment application. The actual photographs and SEM images confirm that all the different nanofibrous textiles with or without SRHC exhibit a uniform interwoven structure of warp and weft, and the internal nanofibers present bead-free morphology and uniaxially oriented structure along the longitudinal axis of nanofibrous yarns. Moreover, all the different nanofibrous woven fabrics are demonstrated to possess strong mechanical properties and great surface wettability . The in vitro cell characterization shows that the addition of SRHC can significantly promote the attachment and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), and also dramatically inhibit the secretion levels of proinflammatory factors of M1 macrophages. The in vivo diabetic mouse full-thickness skin model experiments reveal that the as-developed SRHC-loaded Gel/PLLA nanofibrous textile shows the best performances referring to shorten wound healing time (100 % wound closure after 18 days of treatment) and high-quality regeneration (i.e., enhance collagen deposition, improve re-epithelialization and neovascularization, and increase hair follicles), which assuredly finds great interests serving as an innovative dressing patch for the treatment of hard-to-heal diabetic wounds.},

Herein, we designed and constructed an ultrafine gold nanoparticle (Au NPs) decorated and methylene blue (MB) embedded core–shell-satellites structured Au@Ag nanorods@SiO 2 nanocomposites (CSSNs) using a wet-chemical method. It can be found that excellent photothermal conversion performance and outstanding reactive oxygen species (ROS) production capacity were integrated on this one nonocomposites. In vitro experiments, all cancer cells were killed in nanocomposites with two laser irradiation group, which is better than that of nanocomposites without laser irradiation (12 % cancer cells were killed) and nanocomposites with one laser irradiation (660 nm laser, 84 % cancer cells were killed or 808 nm laser, 95 % cancer cells were killed). It is obviously that the synergistic effect was achieved between chemodynamic therapy (CDT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). The vivo results further confirmed that the as-prepared nanocomposites can suppress the tumor growth without obvious systemic toxicity. This work will pave a new avenue for the construction of multifunctional nanocomposites and their multimodal therapy application for cancers.},

  abstract     = {Chronic diabetic wounds seriously threaten human health due to their intractable nature in a complex pathological microenvironment that contains oxidative stress, persistent inflammatory status, hypoxia and bacterial infections, of which oxidative damage contributing the most. Applied materials that can mimic the natural intracellular antioxidant defense system are perceived to have huge therapeutic potential. Herein, we present a novel strategy to prepare a versatile nanocomposite hydrogel by incorporating the nanoenzyme (manganese dioxide (MnO 2 )) and nonenzymatic antioxidant components (polydopamine (PDA)) in a dynamic hydrogel network composed of thioctic acid and tannic acid (TA). The prepared hydrogel exhibited outstanding adhesive and injectable properties, making it adapt perfectly to wounds with different shapes and depths. More importantly, encapsulation of PDA@MnO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) conferred the hydrogel with superior antioxidant performance to effectively scavenge multiple types of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) and reduce the inflammatory response by regulating macrophage polarization. Meanwhile, the hydrogel showed high-performance catalyzing ability to transfer hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) into oxygen (O 2 ), which could further alleviate hypoxic wound environment. Moreover, the nanocomposite hydrogel exhibited excellent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal antibacterial effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that the synthesized nanocomposite hydrogel shows potential for use in a clinical setting to treat diabetic wounds.},

  abstract     = {Such is the hypoxia in solid tumor that Ⅱ-type photodynamic therapy (PDT) has not yet achieved significantly satisfactory consequences. Despite the rapid advancement in nanotechnology-based PDT for alleviating the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, several challenges persist. These include inefficient passive oxygen-supply mechanisms, low stability of oxygen-delivery nanosystems, and the complexity of their modification processes. To address these issues, we developed integrative nanoformulations (HHI NPs) by sequentially inserting biomacromolecule hemoglobin (Hb) and IR783 (photosensitizer) into hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HPB NPs) through a straightforward and gentle diffusion method. Intriguingly, the resulting hybrid nanocomposites based on hollow mesoporous structure provided stability of biomacromolecule Hb, ensuring active and efficient oxygen delivery. In these nanosystems, HHI NPs equipped with high oxygen-carrying Hb efficiently generated reactive oxygen species over HepG2 cells cultured in hypoxic condition under NIR irradiation. Additionally, HPB NPs served not only as nanocarriers but also as photothermal agents exhibiting excellent photothermal conversion effects. which were beneficial for photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer. HHI NPs co-loaded with Hb and IR783 not only actively relieved the hypoxic TME through the stable protection of the hollow structure from HPB NPs, but also achieve the significant synergistic therapy by combining PDT and PTT for tumor treatment.},

The following materials were tested before and after a 5-cycle surface disinfection : Flexfill TPE 90A, Phyton Flex (TPU) for material extrusion, Flexible (resin), Elastic 50A (resin) for vat photopolymerization and Flexa Black (TPU) material for powder bed fusion technology. Mechanical tests included tensile, compression, Charpy impact, flex resistance and stress relaxation tests, as well as Shore A hardness and volume measurements. The structure was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)and Raman spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity was assessed using a A549 cell viability assay. The results show that after disinfection, significant changes occurred mainly in the tensile and Shore A properties, such as the tensile strength of the disinfected Flexible (resin) materials was 3.44 MPa ± 0.51 MPa (ethanol) and 2.62 MPa ± 0.31 MPa compared to the native 2.02 MPa ± 0.24 MPa. Interestingly, the applied surface disinfectants can negatively affect biocompatibility. Medical devices have been designed and fabricated based on the findings.

Due to its low mechanical strength, high biodegradation rate, and difficult handling, its usage in medical interventions remains challenging. In this study, decellularized AM was covered with an ultrathin layer of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) through a spinning method, which in turn resulted in an ultrathin (less than 80 µm in thickness) bilayer corneal wound dressing membrane with improved mechanical behavior and transparency. The biomechanical, biological, and antibacterial properties of the bilayer membranes were measured both in vitro and in vivo . The optimized microsized membrane was applied on a corneal defect wound created in a rabbit model to evaluate the corneal healing. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in degradation rate, improved mechanical properties, and AM/PDMS transparency compared with AM. The corneal transparency improved until 21 days post-surgery in AM/PDMS group. Histological evaluations revealed that AM/PDMS had better epithelial delaminated cell morphology. The results of the RT-PCR showed a significant increase in MMP9, a significant decrease in Col1A1, TGF-β1, TNF-α and IL-6 in both AM and AM/PDMS compared with control wounds.

The waterproof ability, moisture permeability, mechanical property, electricity and bactericidal ability of three layers and composite fabric were studied. Results showed that the moisture permeability of coated thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) membrane reached 19854 g m 2 d −1 . The composite fabric had still excellent moisture permeability of up to 13956 g m 2 d −1 and water contact angle of 151.7°. The coated TPU membrane had good tensile strength and acid resistance. The voltage and current of composite fabric after 7 days were approximately 0.336 V and 1.4 μA. The composite fabric had a 97.5 % filtering effect for NaCl aerosols, a 99 % bacteriostatic rate, and the ability to withstand the Phy-X174 phage with a diameter of 0.027 μm. This composite fabric based on the principle of moisture permeability and weak electric field could be used in protective clothing, which would be of theoretical significance and guiding practical production.},

The design of traditional metasurfaces often requires professional designers. Consequently, design work has become difficult and time-consuming with the increase in the complexity of metasurface design. The introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in metasurface design work has resulted in its rapid development and simplification. Furthermore, metasurfaces have begun to play the role of hidden layers in optical neural networks, and their intelligent properties are gradually being identified.

The concentration of ZRA in the initial slurry is critical in controlling the final structure of the composites. The composites’ bending strength, compressive strength, and crack-initiation fracture toughness K Ic improve with increasing ZRA concentration in the initial slurry. Interestingly, the crack-extension fracture toughness K Jc demonstrates an initial decrease followed by subsequent improvement. In addition, the relationship between cracking mode and structural features in the composites is elucidated to explain the underlying strengthening and toughening mechanisms.

For thixoforming route of semi-solid processing (SSP), the semi-solid billet preparation by semi-solid isothermal heat treatment (SSIT) is one of the most important process steps. This work focuses on the microstructure evolution during SSIT of a semi-solid Al 0.8 Co 0.5 Cr 1.5 CuFeNi HEA with dual globules for thixoforming application. This semi-solid HEA contains BCC(B2), FCC globules and Cu-rich liquid film. Solidified liquid follows K-S, epitaxial orientation relationship with neighboring BCC(B2) and FCC globules. Solutionizing point for B2 phase is higher than roughly 1175 °C, and complete disordering of BCC(B2) globule occurs at 1225 °C. While, FCC globule persists stable disordered solid solution . Solid-liquid phase transition of globules provides liquid film proliferation. CALPHAD simulation on the “hypothetical” alloy system corresponding to component constitution of individual globule successfully forecasted solid–liquid phase transition. Coupling coarsening inhibition effects, including sluggish diffusion in globules, Cu-rich liquid film as inhibitory barrier, heterogeneous globule as obstacle, account for extremely sluggish microstructural coarsening (coarsening rate is only 2.44–11.25 μm 3 /s). Finally, through forming of exemplar component, intriguing potential for SSP application in component manufacturing was verified.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the use of a Gaussian neighborhood mode filter for predicting grain growth in a manner similar to the solutions obtained by a Monte Carlo Potts model . This flexible grain growth model can quickly utilize modern, computationally optimized data science strategies on graphics processing units to simulate grain growth up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art, publicly available Monte Carlo Potts model. We show that, given the correct neighborhood, the mode filter can replicate normal grain growth in two or three dimensions. In addition, the paper briefly demonstrates the ability to model limited anisotropic in grain boundary energy and mobility. Anisotropic grain boundary energy is modeled by defining a weighted mode filter operation. Anisotropic grain boundary mobility is modeled by scaling and orienting the Gaussian neighborhood in a particular direction.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge representation in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) domain is a vast and multi-faceted challenge: Overlap, ambiguity, and inconsistency in terminology are common. Invariant (consistent) and variant (context-specific) knowledge are difficult to align cross-domain. Generic top-level semantic terminology often is too abstract, while MSE domain terminology often is too specific. In this paper, an approach how to maintain a comprehensive MSE-centric terminology composing a mid-level ontology–the Platform MaterialDigital Core Ontology (PMDco)–via MSE community-based curation procedures is presented. The illustrated findings show how the PMDco bridges semantic gaps between high-level, MSE-specific, and other science domain semantics. Additionally, it demonstrates how the PMDco lowers development and integration thresholds. Moreover, the research highlights how to fuel it with real-world data sources ranging from manually conducted experiments and simulations with continuously automated industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {The unique thermokinetics of laser-powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (L-PBFAM) has been exploited for development of a novel high-strength Al-Ni-Ti-Zr-Mn alloy. The addition of 0.5 wt% Mn leads to extraordinary improvement in ultimate tensile strength (502 MPa) and work hardening due to the activation of two Mn-induced strengthening mechanisms. First, by a bimodal particle strengthening effect due to Al 31 Mn 6 Ni 12 nano-quasi-crystal particles rejected in inter-dendritic spaces and fibrous Al 3 Ni eutectic dendritic channels, which predominately contributes to the strength improvement, and second by solid solution strengthening from remaining Mn entrapped in Al. These mechanisms supplement the particle strengthening effect imparted by coherent and incoherent Al 3 (Ti,Zr) co-precipitates present at melt pool boundaries, dislocation strengthening due to solidification induced strain, and Hall-Petch and backstress strengthening effect due to heterogenous grain size distribution occurring at various length scales. The solidification dynamics and hierarchical heat distribution that are associated with L-PBFAM resulted in complex spatial variations in these strengthening phenomena and were investigated via a high-throughput multiscale structure–property correlation that involved thermokinetic simulation, X-ray diffraction, high-resolution nanoindentation mapping, and site-specific transmission electron microscopy of the alloy.},

The strength , ductility, and work hardening capacity of two alloys increase with decreasing deformation temperature . Plastic deformation of AA6063-T4 is accompanied by adiabatic flow stress instabilities at 4 K and the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect at 298 K. The alloy shows a better synergy of flow stress and work hardening than the T6 condition, determined by the underlying microstructure. The limited ability of dislocation storage in T6 alloy arises from shearing β ″ β″ particles and the enhanced dislocation annihilation occurring in pure Al matrix . The failure of the alloys is promoted by void nucleation at intermetallic particles before the Considére criterion is fulfilled. AA6063-T6 exhibits positive strain rate sensitivity (SRS) at three temperatures. Dislocations- β ″ β″ particle interactions determine its SRS and are a rate-controlling process at 298 K. AA6063-T4 shows negative strain rate sensitivity (nSRS) at 298 K controlled by dislocation-solute interactions. Data for SRS and thermodynamic deformation parameters characterizing different mechanisms in T4 and T6 alloys between 4 K and 298 K are discussed. The results indicate that plastic deformation produces vacancies by jogs&#39; dragging at 298 K, but this process does not occur at 78 K and 4 K.},

  abstract     = {Due to the randomness of hard and brittle material damage evolution, assessing damage and interpreting mechanisms is challenging. This study focuses on analyzing material damage mechanisms by employing extensive multi-source heterogeneous data to extract quantitative information. A machine vision-based method for detecting and assessing defects in ceramics was proposed, achieving 98 % accuracy. Leveraging this method in scratching experiments, the progression of damage and micro-failure mechanisms in Si3N4 was investigated through the analysis of defect area distribution, force and acoustical signals. Results revealed that the distribution of defect areas conforms to a three-parameter Weibull distribution. At scratch depths of 0.01, 0.02 mm, approximately 90 % of damage accumulated within 1e2–1e4 μm 2 ; conversely, 0.03–0.06 mm led to a decrease to 30 – 40 %. Extensive crack propagation occurs within 0.02–0.03 mm, resulting in the intersecting formation of spalling blocks. Damage evolution occurs in three stages: shallow and small cracks with scattered spalling blocks in the first stage, deep and long cracks with continuous and irregularly shaped spalling blocks in the second stage, and nearly no cracks with continuous and regularly shaped blocks in the third stage. This study not only proposes an efficient method to detect and evaluate ceramic defects, but also deeply understands the evolution process of material damage mechanism. Considering defect distribution and statistical trends, this research not only provide guidance for the optimization of machining parameters, especially in the scene of specific precision and high removal rate. At the same time, the damage evolution and failure mechanism of Si 3 N 4 provide useful experimental basis and data support for deepening the understanding of material behavior during ultra-precision grinding.},

However, the electro-thermal energy conversion involved in the WEDM process inevitably introduces some surface defects including bulges, discharge craters, and recast materials on the WEDMed MG surface, which significantly impedes its practical application. Here, an emerging automated polishing technology, laser polishing (LP), was performed in the nitrogen-rich environment to simultaneously improve the surface quality and hardness of the WEDMed Zr-based MG surface. The detailed effects of LP parameters on the surface roughness and morphology were systematically investigated. The morphology evolution and temperature distribution of the molten pool during LP were analyzed by simulation analysis. The experimental results indicated that after single LP of four representative WEDMed Zr-based MG surfaces using the optimized laser parameters, the surface roughness (Sa) was remarkably reduced from 1.27, 2.10, 3.49, and 4.58 μm to 0.09, 0.14, 0.17, and 0.21 μm, respectively, accompanied by an increase in surface hardness from 6.30 GPa to 7.39, 7.67, 8.51 and 8.99 GPa. This study demonstrated that LP could effectively achieve simultaneous enhancement of the quality and hardness of WEDMed MG surfaces, which would contribute to expanding the application prospects of MGs.},

The interconnected carbon fiber skeleton and porous conductive Co 9 S 8 nanosheets can not only provide abundant electron/ion-transport channels, but also offer adequate void to accommodate volume expansion of sulfur, thus ensuring high sulfur utilization and remarkable cycle stability of electrode. Meanwhile, the abundant adsorption and catalytic sites provided by Co 9 S 8 nanosheets can effectively inhibit dissolution of polysulfides and improve conversion kinetics of polysulfides, effectively suppressing “shuttle effect”.

Alloying elements such as Si dramatically modify the steel surface, forming an oxide layer during pre-annealing, which suppresses the desired interfacial interaction. Progress is impossible without understanding the phases&#39; interplay at the steel-coating interface. We investigated this area in high-Si (1.49 wt%) galvanized AHSS at different annealing times via TEM and revealed that while hot-dip galvanizing at 460 °C the surface oxide prevents the desired Fe-Al reaction and liquid Zn penetrating gaps in the oxide membrane forms a δ phase layer underneath. Located between the steel substrate and the oxide layer, the δ phase can grow during subsequent annealing due to incoming liquid Zn, while Fe diffusion into the coating is suppressed. The oxide film remains stable even after long-term annealing (120 s at 480 °C) separating the coating from the reaction zone. The growing δ layer interacting with the steel substrate consumes dissolved Si. Reaching a certain threshold concentration, supersaturated δ decomposes forming a δ matrix with Fe-Si-Al-based nanoprecipitates. Using EDX data, phase configuration was refined via Thermo-Calc by the Fe–Zn–Si–Al system simulation suggesting that nanoprecipitates are based on Al- and Si-rich type of α-Fe.},

The setup performance is demonstrated for the pyrochlore oxide terbium titanate and the longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities agree with the literature. We show that the transverse temperature difference is proportional to the product of magnetic field times heating power for fields up to , enabling improved statistics compared to individual sweeps analysis. We conduct an analysis of uncertainties in the transverse thermal conductivity, considering various thermometer calibrations for extracting temperature differences.

  abstract     = {Ultrasonic flowmeters face unique challenges since, in addition to withstanding high fluid pressures, they have to avoid crosstalk , which is the interaction of the signals traveling through the fluid and the solid pipe. To avoid the crosstalk, which leads to poor accuracy or complete loss of the required signal, we develop a mounting mechanism based on phononic crystals (PnCs), which are artificial periodic materials possessing band gaps (BGs) due to Bragg scattering. These PnC structures should also possess high mechanical strength to sustain the fluid pressure. Designing PnCs for such applications is challenging as the BG width and the resistance to mechanical loading are conflicting objectives. To circumvent this, we propose a step-by-step design procedure to optimize both mechanical strength and wave attenuation performance of a single-phase 3D PnC waveguide using parametric sweeping and sensitivity analysis. We use finite element analysis (FEA) to characterize the behavior of the periodic unit cell and the waveguide . Since accurate dynamic FEA at high frequencies is computationally demanding, we develop surrogate models at different levels of the design process. We also consider additive manufacturing aspects in the design procedure, which we validate by 3D-printing the final design and measuring the parameters via computer tomography .},

  abstract     = {The dimensional stability of paper during printing is crucial for ensuring production quality and runnability. However, inkjet printing faces inherent challenges due to the hygroscopic nature of paper and the use of water-based inks. Despite freshly printed sheets are flat, a considerable development of paper curl is often observed during storage. In this study, we establish the link between the migration of ink co-solvents and the long-term curl development of printed paper. A4 paper sheets were sprayed with a water-glycerol model ink and changes in the sheet&#39;s curvature were monitored using a 2D-laser sensor. We also investigated glycerol migration by splitting the sheets into layers and determining the glycerol distribution using high-performance liquid chromatography. Our results demonstrate the development of curl during storage as well as glycerol migration in thickness direction of the sheet, both on a comparable timescale. We thus propose that long term curl in inkjet printing can be caused by z-directional migration of the co-solvent (glycerol) over time. This study enhances understanding of the physical mechanisms that drive the long-term curl phenomenon in inkjet-printed sheets. The results can be used to optimize printing processes, allowing for the production of higher quality printed products with greater dimensional stability.},

Since crack-bridging and crack-deflection were observed to be the dominant toughening mechanisms, they were modeled using fracture mechanics approaches. Crack-bridging was shown to dominate the toughening at lower weight fractions of laterite (0–20 wt%). However, as the laterite content increases (20–40 wt%), a combination of crack-bridging and crack-deflection was observed. Finally, at higher laterite weight fractions (&gt;40 wt%), crack-tip shielding occurred primarily via crack deflection. The fracture mechanics predictions of resistance-curve behavior are shown to be consistent with the experimental measurements. The results suggest that mycelium-based and mycelium-laterite composites can be engineered with tunable fracture toughness. The implications of the results are also discussed for the development of sustainable building materials.},

  abstract     = {During grinding complex components with difficult-to-machine materials, compliance grinding tools often experience shortened life and weakened performance due to intense temperature rise. This paper presents a novel solution strategy of preparing crystal-structured compliance tools using multi jet fusion (MJF), and five structures were selected to evaluates its feasibility and grinding performance. The macro and micro elastic deformation of the tools were analyzed by combining finite element and experiment. The results show that the crystal structure provides similar macroscopic stiffness of the tools and introduces microscopic compliance anisotropy. The crystal structure resulted in a reduction of the grit pull-out ratio by more than 82.60 %, while also alleviating the adhesion of flexible substrates adhesion and the prevention of abrasive layer fall-off, leading to prolonged tool life. Furthermore, compliant grinding tools with a crystal structure achieved comparable material removal capacity, lower surface roughness, and higher energy efficiency. In addition, they used only 29.06 % to 36.22 % of the material consumed in manufacturing. Notably, the material removal rate (MMR) of the star-structure tool can reached 94.72 % of the solid-structure tool. The diamond-structure tool exhibited the lowest ground Ra, accompanied by a reduction in grinding temperature of 19.4 °C.},

  abstract     = {Conventional hinge actuators often face limitations including excessive weight, large size and unpleasant noise. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) offer a solution to address these issues due to their favorable characteristics, such as lightweight, high actuation force and small form factor. However, most existing SMA-based hinge actuators rely on the tension loading mode. Achieving an ideal actuation angle thereby necessitates the inclusion of long SMA wires, which inadvertently constrains the actuator size. Notably, the full potential of SMAs’ deformation capacities, encompassing torsion and bending, remains largely untapped and underutilized. In this research, a reversible torsion SMA hinge actuator is studied, which can reversibly open 60° during heating and cooling. The actuator weighs 2 g, and can produce actuation forces of up to 5 N. The mechanical performances of nitinol at different temperatures are measured. Based on the measurements, a model which can predict the opening and closing angle is proposed, with deviations of 13.5 ± 8.2 %. Gripper and butterfly demonstrators constructed by the hinge actuators are given as application examples. The actuators hold potential in many fields like soft robotics, aerospace and medical instruments.},

The evolved microstructures were studied by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy to understand the Y- and Ho– doping effects on thermal stability and oxidation behavior. A three-layered microstructure developed in both annealed films. A fully oxidized layer formed at the top surface consisting of cubic fluorite Hf(Y/Ho)O 2 nanoparticles embedded in an amorphous SiO x -based matrix. The oxide layer is about 36 % thinner compared to undoped films with similar composition [1] . A recrystallized structure formed at the bottom of both films composed mainly of Hf(Y/Ho)N and α-/β-Si 3 N 4 . All Hf(Y/Ho)N in the middle layer was oxidized producing vertically oriented Hf(Y/Ho)O 2 nanocolumns surrounded by Si 3 N 4 nanocrystalline. The Y- and Ho– doping found to stabilize the cubic fluoride oxide structure and promoted its (1 1 1) columnar texture. The oxidation mechanism of Si 3 N 4 nanodomains occurs via formation of β-SiO 2 first followed by its transformation to amorphous SiO x . It is suggested that substitution of Hf 4+ with Y 3+ and Ho 3+ ions within the Hf(Y/Ho)O 2 formed an anion vacancy defect structure to preserve charge neutrality affecting the oxidation mechanism in the doped films.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic actuation has emerged as a prominent method in soft robots due to its charming advantages on diverse magnetization designs, which heavily rely on the microstructures formed by hard magnetic particles (NdFeB) inside the robot. However, the contradiction between the need for multiple orientations of the particles and the issue of particle agglomeration caused by repeated orientation during fabrication has not been effectively resolved. This limitation prevents additive manufacturing of high-performance magnetic soft robots and hinders further diversification of robot magnetization structures. In this study, we proposed a method that utilizes a dynamic magnetic field to re-disperse agglomerated particles. This method is able to effectively disperse the agglomerates uniformly and enhance the re-oriented particle chains in multiple aspects, including compactness, orientation (∼200 %), and maintenance time (&gt;120 min). Furthermore, this method was utilized to improve the magneto-induced deformation (from 7 . 71 ° 7.71° to 13 . 89 ° 13.89° ) of the Magneto-Rheological Elastomer (MRE) samples, which were fabricated with repeatedly orientated magnetizations using magnetic field-assisted Stereo-lithography (SLA). Overall, the proposed method lays the groundwork for the structural complexity of magnetic soft robots and holds significant potential for broadening the fabrication methods of magnetic soft robots.},

  abstract     = {The self-healing mechanism has been newly applied in Ni superalloys to extend the creep lifetime during service. Quantitative selection criteria are proposed to screen the potential self-healing elements in Ni alloying system. Ti atoms and η-Ni 3 Ti precipitates are thus selected as the candidate healing atoms and the healing agent, respectively. The ideal composition interval for Ti to achieve the effective healing effects is computationally calculated as 0.076–0.1 mol fraction. On this basis, SHNi (self-healing Ni alloy) has been developed and compared with nSHNi (no self-healing Ni alloy). The creep lifetimes of SHNi alloys are observed 8–10 times higher than that of nSHNi alloys. Microstructure characterizations have shown that η-Ni 3 Ti healing agents in SHNi alloys can form site-specifically at the cavity sites during service. Meanwhile, the creep cavities in SHNi alloys present much smaller average sizes during creep, and the cavity growth rates are generally one magnitude lower compared to that of nSHNi alloys. The excellent creep properties of SHNi alloys can be well ascribed to their creep cavitation resistance brought by the self-healing behavior. The effectiveness of self-healing mechanism in improving the creep properties has proposed a new strategy in developing novel Ni superalloys.},

In this study, the interdiffusion behavior in the gradient MCrAlY/superalloy system was investigated at 1080 °C/1200 °C after cyclic oxidation. To exclude the effect of aluminization on diffusion behavior, interdiffusion behavior between MCrAlY coatings and nickel-based superalloys was also studied at 1080 °C/1200 °C under oxygen-free condition. Based on experiment and thermodynamic calculation, temperature-dependent interdiffusion relationships between Al and Cr were established. The results showed that the diffusion fluxes of Al and Cr were close at 1080 °C. The diffusion flux of Cr could exceed that of Al at 1200 °C, resulting in the formation of the Cr-rich γ phase. The secondary γ&#39; phases precipitated during the cooling of Cr-rich γ phase from 1200 °C. Furthermore, the calculations indicated that increasing Cr in the substrate reduced the diffusion driving force of Al from coating to substrate. This study clarified the role of Cr in interdiffusion and proposed a strategy to reduce the precipitation of TCP phases in gradient MCrAlY/superalloy system at 1200 °C by designing a wide Cr-rich γ phase zone.},

The objective of this study is to reveal a thorough understanding of the effect of B on LME behaviour, where the welding test results indicated substantial improvement even at relatively low B concentration. Here, we adopted the strategy of identifying LME-sensitive grain boundaries, followed by characterizing grain boundary chemistry. EBSD measurements and prior austenite grain (PAG) reconstruction provided strong evidence of intergranular LME crack propagation via PAGBs. Further transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy investigations demonstrated an asymmetric Mn profile along the PAGB in B-free steel. Therefore, we propose that B addition and consequently, lower grain boundary energy appears to prevent Mn segregation. Based on our observation, we conclude that B seems to have the similar desired effect on Zn diffusion along the PAGBs and eventually mitigates Zn-assisted LME.},

However, recent experimental studies have revealed that the Mg-Y-Nd-Zr-Gd series alloy displays a weak texture after undergoing 60% compression at 500 °C. The overall deformation texture is similar to that of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) subsets, and the (0001) pole figure of the deformed grain subsets does not concentrate entirely in the compression direction due to the activation of non-basal slip systems. It should be noted that DRX and non-basal slip systems cannot independently account for the final deformation texture. In this case, continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) occurs, where the segregation of rare earth (RE) elements at grain boundaries (GB) impedes the movement of existing GBs and prevents the occurrence of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX). Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGB), which are subject to local strain-regulated distribution, continue to absorb dislocations and produce new CDRXed grains. Notably, non-basal slip systems play a role in the generation and subsequent orientation behavior of DRXed grains. As DRX progresses, complex crystal rotations occur on both sides of the newly formed DRX interfaces, causing the orientation of the DRXed grains to gradually deviate from that of the deformed parent grains.},

The formation of TCP phases causes detrimental effects on the mechanical properties of SCs. Therefore, it is crucial to study the formation mechanism and control factors of TCP phases to develop new-generation Ni-based SCs. Different alloying elements influence the TCP phase nucleation by adjusting the chemical driving force. The interface structure determined by interface energy and strain energy mainly affects the growth mechanism and morphology of the TCP phase. Various temperature determines the driving force for TCP nucleation and diffusion rates of elements during TCP phase growth. Holding time is also crucial to the growth and evolution of TCP phases. Applied stress also has an impact on the precipitation of TCP phases. Evolution between different types of TCP phases depends on the temperature, composition and crystal structure of TCP phases. TCP phases damage the mechanical properties mainly by causing stress concentration and weak interface strength. The review aims to establish a link among TCP phase formation, alloy design and microstructure from the macroscopic view to the microscopic view, providing some perspectives for future research.},

Therefore, bonding interfaces with excellent strength and ductility are attractive for application in welding structural components. However, increasing strength usually comes at the expense of ductility, which is known as strength-ductility trade-off. In this work, we explored a novel interface design strategy by introducing multi-scale grains into the bonding interface of the Ti 2 AlNb-based alloy using a heterogeneous refractory high entropy alloy . The interface was composed of the multi-sized grains, which successfully eliminated the brittle defects. Through this approach, the strength and ductility of the joint synergistically improved to 877 MPa and 11.54 %, respectively. Both strength and ductility exceeded 98 % of the mechanical performances of the base metal. The exceptional strength-ductility combination was benefiting from cooperative strain hardening mechanisms, which increased the interfacial hardening capability via in situ refinement of free path of dislocations motion . This hetero-interface strategy could expand the design ideas for the bonding interface of intermetallic compound-based alloys, and provides a new approach to synergistically increase the mechanical performance.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the issue of a significant amount of unmelted powder adhering to the surface of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) porous titanium alloy scaffolds, and the current inability of existing technologies to effectively handle such surface defects. Porous titanium alloy scaffolds with a triple periodical minimal surface (TPMS) Gyroid structure were prepared using powder bed fusion technology for dynamic chemical polishing. The spatial and surface morphology, as well as the mechanical properties of the scaffolds, were evaluated before and after treatment. Concurrently, fluid finite element simulation was employed to analyze the flow state of the solution inside the porous scaffold during dynamic chemical polishing. Cell culture samples were prepared and subjected to dynamic chemical polishing to study the specific effects of scaffold surface morphology on cell activity. The results indicate that the surface treatment effect, internal and external homogeneity, and dynamic and static mechanical properties of the porous scaffolds with a Gyroid structure are significantly improved after dynamic chemical polishing. Additionally, it was found that dynamic chemical polishing could effectively reduce the micrometer roughness and increase the nanometer roughness of the sample surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation activities of Human Bone Mesenchymal Stem cells.},

  abstract     = {Poly-silsesquioxanes have been numerously used to produce SiO 2 or Si x O y C z ceramics through pyrolysis under different atmospheres. In this study, crosslinking and pyrolysis behavior of a commercial methyl-silsesquioxane, was examined using thermogravimetry analysis and a lower SiO 2 yield was observed after pyrolysis at low heating rates of 0.3 and 0.6 K/min under air atmosphere, namely 69.1 and 75.0 wt%, respectively. Using ceramic thermoplastic shaping techniques, a low heating rate, below 2 K/min, is usually required to remove processing additive (e.g., binders) gradually and avoid failures like blisters, pores, and cracks. A mixture of SILRES® MK and γ-Al 2 O 3 was prepared to produce a mullite ceramic with Al 2 O 3 / SiO 2 ratio of 60/40 wt%. As expected, the stoichiometric ratio of alumina to silica was altered using a heating rate of 0.6 K/min and mullite ceramic with 61.70/37.70 wt% of Al 2 O 3 / SiO 2 ratio was obtained. By mixing above the crosslinking temperature of SILRES® MK, a constant ratio of alumina to silica could be achieved successfully, even at low heating rates. In addition, microstructure indicated the growth of needle-like mullite crystals with some amount of SiO 2 -rich ternary amorphous phase (MgO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 ) between the needle grains. Elemental analysis revealed that MgO sintering additive was mainly in the amorphous SiO 2 -rich phase.},

Unlike the conventional filler materials with melting point depressants of B and Si, the Ni-Cr-Ta filler material was free of B and Si, and thus the resulting joints contained no B-rich and Si-rich compounds and eutectics with low melting points, which enhanced the brazed joint performance.

The influence of IP content and alumina particle size on the cut and puncture resistance of the resulting SRUS textile was systematically investigated. Furthermore, the anti-puncture and anti-cutting mechanisms of the SRUS textile were comprehensively evaluated based on the analysis of damage morphology and process. The experimental results demonstrated a significant enhancement in the puncture and cut resistance of the SRUS textile upon the incorporation of IP. Moreover, the cut/puncture resistance of the SRUS textile increased with an increase in IP content and the size of Al 2 O 3 , and the optimal cut/puncture resistance was observed at 60 mesh-50 wt.%. Additionally, the anti-puncture mechanism of the SRUS textile was attributed to the presence of hard passivation at the EIPB, as well as friction self-locking at the gaps. The anti-cutting mechanism was ascribed to the reverse cutting action exerted by the hard particles on the blade, preventing further penetration. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its enhanced protective performance.},

Flexible poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) CWR implants, consisting of rib components with elliptical cross-section and costal cartilage components featuring wavy structures, were developed with adjustable design parameters that allow quantitative restoration of respiratory function. During the design process, the equivalent elastic moduli of the rib and costal cartilage components were parametrically adjusted in a validated finite element (FE) model of the chest wall to maximise chest wall deformation during respiration, while considering mechanical safety as the boundary condition. The optimal equivalent elastic moduli were then translated into design parameters for the rib and costal cartilage components, based on a database relating the equivalent elastic modulus to the design parameters of the components with elliptical cross-section and wavy structures. The flexible PEEK CWR implant increased the difference in chest circumference during respiration by 12.2% compared to rigid PEEK implant in a clinical case-based study. This study presents a strategy to address the reduced respiratory function in 3D printed CWR implants, providing a pathway for quantitative restoration of respiratory function through parameterised optimisation.},

In order to improve the wear resistance of diamond cutting tools, in the diamond-graphite strong covalent structure prepared by laser induced solid-phase diffusion, carbon nanosheets (CNS) can be obtained by electrochemical stripping of the graphite layer onto the diamond matrix, which provides a new way to improve the limitations of diamond tools in application. After 14,400 cycles of reciprocating sliding against the GCr15 ball at a normal load of 2–8 N, friction was reduced by 45.9 %–65.6 % with high durability. The oxygen content is reduced by an order of magnitude during this process, suggesting that the CNS can prevent oxidation behavior at the sliding interface. The bare diamond had a relative wear rate of 4.1–15.4 times that of the CNS. It showed competitive inhibition of mechanochemical wear. Our work provides a convenient and green method of preparing in-situ CNS covalently bonded on a diamond surface, extending the way for the prospect of carbon materials.},

Four types of ACCs incorporating reinforcement with different auxetic mechanisms were prepared: “re-entrant” (RE), “rotating-square” (RS), “chiral” (CR) and “missing-rib” (MR). Experiments and finite element models were used to study the compressive behavior of the ACCs. The results indicate that all ACCs have high compressive ductility. Specifically, the RE shows the highest ductility, manifested by 853% and 708% higher energy absorption than the reference mortar and the auxetic structure itself, respectively. In addition, the RE and RS are found to exhibit stronger crack-arresting effect under compression. Therefore, they achieved comparable compressive strength to the reference mortar, which is considerably higher than CR and MR. Furthermore, decreasing the volumetric ratio of the auxetic structure by half, the ductility of the RS reduces by 32.2%, while decreasing the water-to-binder ratio of the cementitious matrix from 0.4 to 0.3 only increases the compressive strength by 18.5%. Moreover, the two-dimensional finite element analyses used herein show a good match with experiments but become less accurate at high strain levels, due to their inability to capture the out-of-plane failure of the ACCs.},

The phase separation in styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) -modified asphalt during high-temperature storage has not been solved due to the lack of fundamental understanding of intermolecular interaction. This study aims to reveal the formation of molecular nano-micelles and endogenous π-π interaction in the SBS-modified asphalt. Molecular simulation indicates that incorporating more than 7 % SBS into bitumen forms SBS self-aggregates that entangle with asphaltenes, causing a reorganization of the colloidal structure. The SBS aggregation is dominated by the π – π conjugate interactions and steric hindrance of confused aromatic. In low-content SBS-modified asphalt (7%), SBS interlocks parallel benzene rings and selectively adsorbs maltene from neat bitumen. High concentrations of SBS in the modified asphalt increase inter-SBS attraction but decrease asphaltene-SBS interaction, causing SBS self-aggregation and segregation from asphaltene-rich phase. Atomic force microscope and fluorescence microscope tests demonstrate the selective maltene adsorption and phase migration in high-content SBS-modified asphalt, and macro performance exhibits severe phase separation and degradation. This study provides a new perspective on improving the storage stability of high-content SBS-modified asphalt.},

Further, oral delivery demands significantly large dosage of drugs. To address these twin challenges, we have fabricated open cell porous scaffolds capable of sustained dual drug delivery. Drug delivery from open cell porous Ti6Al4V implants is a promising approach for in situ delivery in orthopedic and dental implant applications. In this study, selective laser melting technology was used to fabricate open cell porous Ti6Al4V ELI scaffolds of 50 % volume fractions with Neovius architecture (NOCL). Electrochemical anodization was used to create micro and nano scale surface features for efficient drug loading. The two payloads: an osteogenic agent (Baicalein) and an anti-cancerous drug (Paclitaxel) were then loaded to different levels for differential release. An osteogenic agent was loaded in the nano reservoirs while paclitaxel was mixed with poloxamer and coated over the scaffold. The mechanical stiffness of the designed NOCL lattices is approximately 1.29 ± 0.05 GPa, which is comparable to the human bone. This helps to reduce stress shielding effect. The scaffolds loaded with baicalein and paclitaxel yielded a sustained drug release profiles, releasing 57 % and 79 % of the pharmaceuticals over a 7-day period, respectively. Additionally, the baicalein-loaded nano reservoirs promote osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells. As a result, bio-inspired 3D-printed open cell porous titanium scaffolds loaded with dual drugs offer a workable solution to the problems associated with orthopedic implants.},

When the scaffold was doped with 10 wt% β-TCP, its mechanical properties remained in the range of those of cancellous bone. In terms of osteogenic differentiation, the P-T-GDYO composite scaffold promoted adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, as well as effectively promoting endogenous bone regeneration of rabbit femoral condyle bone defects in osteogenesis experiments in vivo .

However, it remains a challenge to completely eradicate tumors via monotherapy. Herein, a copper-doped BiSe x (CBS) nanozyme was developed to boost αPD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) via synergetic apoptosis/cuproptosis-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD). The defect-engineered CBS nanozyme exhibits strong peroxidase-mimicking activities and generates abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) production causing cell apoptosis, which could be further augmented by NIR photoirradiation. Meanwhile, the CBS could cause mitochondrial lipoylated protein aggregation, leading to cell cuproptosis. The photothermal/catalytic/cuproprosis synergistic therapy triggered by CBS nanozyme combined with αPD-L1 antibody effectively inhibits the growth of primary tumors and distant tumors in prostate cancer model. Furthermore, CBS nanozyme exhibited significant germicidal effect in wound infection.

  abstract     = {Excessive biofluid around wounds can cause infection and prevent healing. In this study, an anisotropic quaternized chitosan (QC)/sodium alginate (AL)-based aerogel wound dressing was prepared via a directional freeze-drying technique inspired by the channel structure used for water transport in trees. The aligned channels provided the dressing with self-pumping ability, allowing it to rapidly and completely remove biofluids and absorb biofluids up to 1292.5 % of its own weight. To enhance the strength of the dressing, a double cross-linked network was constructed based on the QC-AL electrostatic attraction and AL-Ca 2+ chelation interaction. The axial compressive strength of the double cross-linked dressing reached 207.3 kPa (ε = 50 %). In addition, the dressing exhibited strong conductive properties (conductivity = 13.0 S/m), antioxidant activities [reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability = 88.0 %], and hemostatic characteristics (blood coagulation index = 1.8 %). The dressing also exhibited powerful antibacterial performance, exhibiting over 98.0 % inhibition of E. coli and S. aureus . Experiments on diabetic mouse models revealed that the dressing considerably promoted wound healing. On day 3, the wound healing rate was 96.7 % faster in the QAC group than in the gauze group. Therefore, the developed dressing may have great potential for chronic wound care.},

  abstract     = {The excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage the mitochondrial membrane and induce apoptosis, causing endoplasmic reticulum stress and triggering immunogenic cell death. Therefore, the combination of apoptosis and immunogenic death by the dual-targeted ROS generator has great potential to address inefficient cancer treatment. A near-infrared photosensitizer was developed for efficient ROS production and dual-targeted cancer treatment. Due to the modulation of electron structure, the reduced transition energy barrier affords TCy5-I-3F the highest efficiency to produce ROS. TCy5-I-3F has excellent mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum targeting ability, causing cell apoptosis and stress of the endoplasmic reticulum for destroying cancer cells. In the dual-targeted mode, high expression of GRP780, activation of heat shock protein (HSP70), the outflow of high mobility group protein B1, efflux of Calreticulin, and massive efflux of adenosine triphosphate are evaluated in the pharmacological experiments. In vivo experiments, the maturation of dendritic cells (DC, CD80 + , CD86 + ), CD8 + T cells and CD3 + T cells also highlights the effectiveness. The tumors of mice treated with TCy5-I-3F and near-infrared (NIR) light are significantly inhibited. The multifunctional targeting design and corresponding mechanisms prove a new insight for exploring efficient photodynamic therapy drugs.},

Therefore, achieving comparisons between studies utilizing identical materials can prove arduous, as variations in material concentrations, sample preparation techniques, and laboratory conditions significantly influence the physicochemical characteristics of hydrogel systems. To ensure their promotion for clinical purposes, stable variables are crucial. In this regard, we have created an amalgamated and simplified device to assist in hydrogel-based systems using hyaluronic acid and alginate-loaded exosomes for regenerative medicine. The objective of this study is to examine the porosity, injectability, release of loaded exosomes, mechanical properties, and the rate of dissolution and degradation of well-known biomaterials, including alginate and hyaluronic acid, at different concentrations in a stable and controlled setting provided by a simplified integrated device.

However, the development of cancer multidrug resistance and inevitable surgical residual lesions lead to high rates of cancer recurrence and mortality. Meanwhile, systemic drug toxic side effects and surgical bleeding complications seriously reduce the quality of life of patients. To avoid cancer multidrug resistance and comprehensively optimize cancer treatment, this work provides a novel injectable cell penetrating peptide octa-arginine (R8)-modified RADA16 (RR) self-assembling peptide nanofiber hydrogel as an anticancer drug carrier for multidrug-resistant cancer therapy. In RR hydrogel, highly compatible RADA16 functions as the β-sheet-based self-assembling backbone which tightly adheres to cancer tissue, prevents postoperative bleeding, and sustainedly releases anticancer drugs for long-term effects. The introduced R8 motifs endow RR hydrogel with the capacity to selectively kill cancer cells and reverse cancer multidrug resistance, which minimally impact normal tissue cells. Specifically, R8 motifs on the hydrogel scaffold selectively interfere with cancer cell membranes, increase drug uptake and penetration into cancer cells and tissues by enhancing multiple internalization pathways, and reduce drug efflux by inhibiting P-gp and BCRP multidrug-resistant transporters. Therefore, this study provides a multifunctional hydrogel material with strong potential for multidrug-resistant cancer clinical translation.},

Hence, we present a novel approach to address this issue by developing sulfated methacrylate hyaluronic acid hydrogels (SMeHA@CM) doped with alendronate (ALN), calcium ions (Ca 2+ ), and magnesium ions (Mg 2+ ). This hydrogel system incorporates sequential physical and chemical crosslinking to facilitate the treatment of bone defects. Physical crosslinks form between the SO 3 2− , ALN, and Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ ions, resulting in nanocluster crosslinking and complete filling of irregular bone defects. Subsequently, the methacrylate groups within the polymer chain undergo polymerization under ultraviolet light irradiation, forming the second stage of chemical crosslinking in the SMeHA@CM hydrogel. These chemical crosslinks contribute strong chemical bonds, enhancing biomechanical strength, and stable support for bone regeneration. The SMeHA@CM hydrogel exhibits remarkable osteogenic capacity, primarily attributed to the cooperative action of SO 3 2− and Mg 2+ ions, which promote the recruitment of bone marrow stem cells and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the sustained release of SO 3 2− -ALN-Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ nanoclusters from the hydrogel system offers additional benefits for bone regeneration. Moreover, both in-vitro and in-vivo assessments confirm the significant potential of the newly developed SMeHA@CM hydrogel for applications in BTE.},

Here, methyltransferase DNMT1 was identified as a key factor mediating PTX resistance for TNBC. Decitabine (DEC), an inhibitor of DNMT1, can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC cells and reverse PTX resistance. In this study, we reported a new delivery system (DEC/PTX NPs@αPD-L1) co-loaded with DEC and PTX modified by anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (αPD-L1), which can overcome drug resistance and metastasis through multi-mode synergistic effect. αPD-L1 increases the enrichment of nanoparticles in tumor tissue through active targeting effect, and blocks PD-L1 on the surface of TNBC cells, thereby activating anti-tumor immune while enhancing internalization of nanoparticles by tumor cells. Inside tumor cells, DEC inhibits EMT process and cancer stem cells to overcome PTX resistance and metastasis. PTX can not only exerts direct tumor killing effect, but also inhibit Treg cells from remodeling immune microenvironment, and induces efficient immunogenic death in cooperation with DEC. This delivery system, realizing tumor-specific synchronized chemoimmunotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic platform for TNBC.},

A wall thickness of only a few hatching spaces can be fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). However, the unmachined surface quality and subsurface defects in the low-thickness wall put the load-bearing capacity of the manufactured part under scrutiny. This study aimed to determine the fatigue and quasi-static strengths of nominally 0.5-mm thick tubular specimens of LPBF 18Ni300 maraging steel with respect to the aging temperature (AT). The experimental tests were conducted on six batches of unmachined specimens: non-aged and age-hardened for 6 h at different temperatures, i.e., 450, 470, 490, 530, and 585 °C. The void distribution and specimen surface were characterized using X-ray micro-computed tomography. The heterogeneous effect of AT on fatigue life was recognized by a novel application of the Gaussian process for regression. The mechanical properties of a 0.5-mm thick tubular specimen were equal to or higher than those of a full cross-section specimen. Furthermore, the optimal AT to obtain the highest fatigue strength was 520 °C for low-cycle fatigue, decreasing to 480 °C for high-cycle fatigue.},

A concurrent optimization of these two material properties is essential to efficiently develop high temperature alloys that can withstand harsh environments increasingly required for carbon–neutral energy technologies. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of directed energy deposition (DED) to manufacture a dual-corrosion resistant Ni-based alloy (Hastelloy N and Haynes 282), that meets the high temperature operation requirements of a molten-salts\supercritical-CO 2 (sCO 2 ) heat exchanger. A combination of multiscale characterization techniques and computational thermodynamics was employed to evaluate the cracking susceptibilities during fabrication and predict the microstructural stability of the material. Very good agreement was achieved between the observed and predicted phases and phase fractions of the as-printed material. A careful characterization of the transition zone between the two terminal alloy chemistries revealed potential precipitation strengthening (γ′) on the Hastelloy N side while columnar-shaped M 23 C 6 and γ′ precipitates that formed at grain boundaries (GBs) of the transition zone likely minimized the local interfacial energies. Both these mechanisms are believed to increase the interfacial stability but their performance at high temperatures requires further investigation.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additively manufactured (AM) 316L stainless steels (SS) possess much more complex surfaces than their wrought counterparts which affects the corrosion behavior. Surface roughness, a typical metric for assessing corrosion of conventionally manufactured metals, is often ineffective as an independent parameter in characterizing corrosion of the AM metals for their higher surface roughness ranging from 5 to 50 µm. This study experimentally shows that the true active surface area (A TA ) is a proper parameter for quick assessment of localized corrosion response of AM 316L SS. Through the potentiodynamic polarization testing on surrogates under full immersion in 0.6 M NaCl solution, the pitting corrosion susceptibility was evaluated. While no consistent correlation to surface roughness was displayed, the pitting breakdown potential (E p ) showed a clear statistical trend at 1 / A T A 0.5 1/ATA0.5 . In addition, normalization of the polarization resistance with the A TA reveals the corresponding surface roughness did not significantly affect the change in open-circuit corrosion phenomenon. This correlation fits well with a previously reported stochastic pitting model on metal surfaces. The results suggest that the importance of A TA as a predictor for predisposition to corrosion in AM 316L SS extends far beyond what has been established for wrought materials.},

Every year, around 380 million tonnes of plastic are produced, with only 9% being recycled, leading to widespread pollution. Similarly, waste biomass generation from agricultural and forestry sectors accounts for 140 billion metric tonnes, in addition to 2.01 billion tonnes from municipal solid waste. This review paper addresses the gap regarding the integration of 3D printing , upcycling of recycled plastics, and the utilization of waste biomass in sustainable composites. 3D printed parts from recycled plastic have shown comparable mechanical properties compared to virgin materials, which have been further improved by the addition of waste biomass-derived fillers. The paper acknowledges that different printing parameters have substantial influence on the strength, ductility, crystallinity, and dimensional accuracy of printed parts. Therefore, optimizing these parameters becomes crucial for achieving improved mechanical performance. Moreover, incorporating reinforcing agents, stabilizers, chain extenders, compatibilizers, and surface modifiers in plastic recycling and 3D printing presents an excellent opportunity to enhance mechanical properties, thermal stability, adhesion, and dimensional stability. Additionally, the review identifies research gaps and proposes the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence for enhanced process control and material development, further expanding the possibilities in this field.},

  abstract     = {Copper-graphene composites show remarkable electrical performance surpassing traditional copper conductors albeit at a micron scale; there are several challenges in demonstrating similar performance at the bulk scale. In this study, we used shear assisted processing and extrusion (ShAPE) to synthesize macro-scale copper-graphene composites with a simultaneously lower temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and improved electrical conductivity over copper-only samples. We showed that the addition of 18 ppm of graphene decreased the TCR of C11000 alloy by nearly 11 %. A suite of characterization tools involving scanning and transmission electron microscopy along with atom probe tomography were used to characterize the grain size, crystallographic orientation, structure, and composition of copper grains and graphene additives in the feedstock and processed samples. We posit that the shear extrusion process may have transformed some of the feedstock graphene additives into higher defect-density agglomerates while retaining the structure of others as mono-to-tri-layer flakes with lower defect density. The combination of these additives with heterogeneous structures may have been responsible for the simultaneous decrease in TCR and enhanced electrical conductivity of the copper-graphene ShAPE composites.},

The pantographic block, which is the subject of the present paper, has been printed using a Powder Bed Fusion technology and its hinges may be modeled as perfect ones. In the reported in situ 3-point flexural test, the predictions obtained by second gradient models for its mechanical response are shown to be experimentally consistent thanks to measurements via Digital Volume Correlation . The deformation applied by the upper central support is almost entirely shielded by the pantographic block, namely, the specimen barely crosses through the reference bottom plane defined by the lower lateral supports, even when subjected to very large deformations . The mathematical model employed herein captures this observation in terms of a nonlinear ‘arching’ effect activated in the beams of the pantographic structure, provided elastic locking is introduced to prevent pantographic zero-energy modes.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale sputter-deposition of hard protective coatings has not been prevalent as the large dimensions of the industrial targets posed an enormous technological challenge: only relatively low power (and plasma) densities could be achieved, resulting ultimately in poor performance of such coatings. Here, we introduce a novel sputtering technology allowing to reach high power densities for industrial tubular targets. This is realised on the principle of a longitudinal movement of a reduced-size magnetron inside the target. In doing so, peak power densities of 840 W/cm 2 have been achieved for the overall power of 25 kW and the target dimensions of Ø110 × 510 mm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution, we produced a series of cubic (Al,Cr)N coatings by sputtering an Al 60 Cr 40 target. Most of the coatings have a stoichiometric composition, smooth surface and a moderate amount of growth defects. Significant improvements through recipe optimisation could be achieved resulting in mechanical properties (hardness, fracture toughness, wear resistance) being equal to and even exceeding those of the benchmark coatings produced by means of conventional sputtering and cathodic arc evaporation. Our results open up great potential of this novel sputtering technique for the coating industry.},

  abstract     = {Metal matrix composites (MMCs) offer unique advantageous mechanical properties by strengthening a ductile metal matrix with a ceramic reinforcement (e.g., Ti6Al-4 V/SiC f ). However, their heterogeneous composition poses machining challenges including fibre pullout, matrix cracking, and increased tool wear. Whilst pre-heating via laser-assisted machining (LAM) shows promise for improving machinability, traditional LAM implementations with a fixed laser spot size and straight laser path prevent uniform heating. By introducing spatially and temporally controlled LAM that generates homogeneous heating by varying the laser scanning velocity, a technique called fully inverse LAM can be applied for MMCs. This involves calculating separate temperature fields for the matrix and reinforcement to minimise thermal mismatch stresses. The fully inverse LAM decreases subsurface cracks and delamination resulting from conventional milling, whilst localised matrix softening reduces cutting forces by over 62 %. Flank tool wear is also diminished, increasing tool life by 120 %. Material analysis reveals reduced machined surface damage, lower surface roughness, and less formation of intermetallic compounds (Ti 2 C) compared to traditional LAM.},

This study puts forward a new cellular architecture of the coil and examines the feasibility of addressing the problem of field uniformity. The geometrical parameters of the coil were examined in concurrent modelling and experimental work, aiming at reducing the effect of field cancellation in neighbouring cells and maximising both the coil efficiency and the field uniformity. The paper demonstrates good potential of the new coil designed with significantly improved uniformity of temperature field compared to traditional commercially available coils. This result has been further optimised with parametric finite element analysis to reduce the standard deviation in surface temperature by a further 37%.},

Designing such systems is particularly challenging due to the unclear design-performance relationship as well as the heavy computational burden. In this work, we aim to control the time domain response patterns of finite MM arrays and introduce a data-driven design approach that addresses the current challenges. A high-fidelity reduced order modeling (ROM) method is incorporated with statistical learning approaches to realize data generation and physics validation with minimal effort. A variational autoencoder (VAE) is trained to learn the design-performance relation and is used to retrieve classes of design configurations associated with a desired performance. An example application for impact mitigation is shown, and the designed MM arrays exhibit superior protection performance. The combined ROM-VAE approach presents a systematic toolset for designing graded MM arrays with modulated responses, capable of a broad spectrum of tasks such as fast prototyping , inverse generation, and design principle identification.},

  abstract     = {High-strength metallic materials with low hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility have always been regarded as ideal commercial materials in the hydrogen energy field. This work proposed a low-cost laminated metal composite (LMC-CS) consisting of austenitic stainless steel (ASS) layer and martensitic steel (MART) layer, which simultaneously achieved high mechanical strength with excellent HE resistance. The ASS layers provide additional strain-hardening capability and the MART layer contributes high strength to LMC-CS after H-charging. Additionally, the composite interface displays semi-coherent characteristics, and the atomic arrangement on both sides follows the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship with ( 1 1 ¯ 0 11¯0 ) α-Fe // ( 1 ¯ 1 1 ¯ 1¯11¯ ) γ-Fe and [1 1 1] α-Fe // [1 1 0] γ-Fe and the Nishiyama–Wassermann orientation relationship with ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 1¯1¯0 ) α-Fe // ( 1 ¯ 11 1¯11 ) γ-Fe and [0 0 1] α-Fe // [ 01 1 ¯ 011¯ ] γ-Fe ., which coordinates deformation between layers and hinders hydrogen-induced cracks initiation at the interface. The as-designed LMC-CS achieves an ultimate tensile strength of 1102 MPa and an elongation loss of 14.8% after long-time hydrogen charging with sides sealed, outperforming a wide range of metallic materials. This work provides a fresh perspective on developing commercial materials with high strength and superior HE resistance for application in severe hydrogen environments.},

  abstract     = {Variable-stiffness materials have a unique ability to change their stiffness reversibly in response to external stimuli or conditions. However, achieving ultrahigh stiffness change is often constrained by the geometric organization of the microstructures in most materials that exhibit variable stiffness. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we introduce a metamaterial design inspired by triply periodic minimal surfaces for fabricating multiphase metamaterials. The specific geometric features of minimal surface designs facilitate interlocking bi- or tri-continuous interpenetrating phases such as air, resin, and alloy within a single multiphase metamaterial. These multiphase metamaterials are constructed by injecting a low-melting-point alloy (LMPA) into a 3D-printed elastic resin mold. The thermally-induced solid-liquid phase transition of the LMPA governs the stiffness change in multiphase metamaterials, ranging from Kilopascals to Gigapascals. Further contributing to this phenomenon, the superior resilience of the elastic resin enhances the shape-memory effect of the multiphase metamaterials. Applications of these materials in origami and deployable structures have been successfully demonstrated, highlighting their reconfigurability and volume compressibility . This innovative design strategy provides the foundation for crafting other metamaterials with intricately arranged internal phases. In conclusion, the proposed multiphase metamaterials have promising potential for various engineering applications where adaptability and morphing capabilities are essential.},

Herein we demonstrate that liquid metal jetting (LMJ), an emerging metal-AM technique, can address this need by controlling the microstructure evolution during printing of bronze alloy C95400 (Cu-Al-Fe-Mn). We probed several solid-state phase transformations upon cooling by printing single-tracks onto a heated baseplate ranging from 50 °C to 600 °C surface temperature, which led to significant variation in the α-Cu and δ-Fe phase distribution, grain morphology, and chemical distribution within the deposited single-tracks. The printed microstructures exhibited as much as 80% difference in α-Cu grain size and nearly 30 % difference in α-Cu phase fraction due to baseplate temperature variation, indicating a wide range of available microstructures and properties achievable. Greater than 92% dense multi-layer samples were fabricated with fine grain structure and 27–34% higher hardness values compared to the barstock in the as-printed condition, demonstrating the applicability of this printing approach for multi-layer part fabrication. Our results highlight a unique microstructure tailoring capability for metal-AM parts that can be leveraged by manufacturers and end-users of AM technologies.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) allows for the creation of novel complex structures previously impossible using traditional subtractive methods; however, there is a need for new design approaches to fully exploit this potential. Metal lattice structures have attracted attention for their broad customisable range of configurations and potential properties, and to take advantage of these possibilities there is a need for intelligent design tools to optimise the lattice according to the desired application and properties. This study presents and demonstrates a method to automatically design lattice structures which achieve a desired compressive stress–strain curve and satisfy user-defined manufacturing limits. A genetic algorithm iterates selected design variables (unit cell aspect ratio, strut taper, and thickness gradient) and minimises the error between the target stress–strain curve and predicted curve which is determined via automated finite element (FE) modelling of each lattice design. The optimised design is validated through manufacture and compression testing of 17-4PH stainless steel lattice structures, and micro-CT imaging to assess build quality. The tool&#39;s versatility is demonstrated by successfully designing lattices to fit a range of target curves. This work demonstrates the potential of this smart inverse design tool to exploit AM and optimise lattice design based on desired performance. The custom written design tool presented in this study is available open source at https://github.com/I-Form/LiDOT.},

  abstract     = {ZnO, a potential optoelectronic material, is attracting significant attention in ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors. However, low photoelectric conversion efficiency is a shortcoming because of its surface defect. In this paper, a plasmonic enhanced high speed UV photodetector was fabricated by ZnO-Pt@AlN core shell nanowires arrays using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and magnetron sputtering methods. As shown in experiment results, the core shell nanowire arrays exhibit 3.7 times enhancement of UV emission and inhibition of visible emission by surface defect. In addition, compared to the pure ZnO nanorod array detector, the introduction of Pt nanoparticles and AlN shell layer resulted in a device with faster rising and falling edges (from 5.67 s to 3.09 s; from 41.18 to 0.32 s) as well as higher bright-to-dark current ratio (from 6.6 to 310.5). As shown in simulation results, the optical field would be localized in the shell of ZnO nanorods, and the ZnO-Pt@AlN core–shell structure can effectively improve the absorption of 365 nm UV light. In one word, this paper employs two general methods to improve the optoelectronic performance of ZnO, and obtains plasmonic enhanced high speed UV photodetector fabricated by ZnO-Pt@AlN core shell nanowires array as well as the mechanism of enhancement is explained.},

A difference in physical properties between these two materials creates cracks at their interface where were fully explored using metallographic examination and numerical simulation. It is found cracks easily occur at their interface near nickel side due to alternate thermal cycles that lead to a variation in residual stress and microstructure, including grain orientation, texture strength, dislocation density and Schmid factors.

  abstract     = {The long-term goal of this work is to predict and control the microstructure evolution in metal additive manufacturing processes. In pursuit of this goal, we developed and applied an approach which combines physics-based thermal modeling with machine learning to predict two important microstructure-related characteristics, namely, the meltpool depth and primary dendritic arm spacing in Nickel Alloy 718 parts made using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Microstructure characteristics are critical determinants of functional physical properties, e.g., yield strength and fatigue life. Currently, the microstructure of LPBF parts is optimized through a cumbersome build-and-characterize empirical approach. Rapid and accurate models for predicting microstructure evolution are therefore valuable to reduce process development time and achieve consistent properties. However, owing to their computational complexity, existing physics-based models for predicting the microstructure evolution are limited to a few layers, and are challenging to scale to practical parts. This paper addresses the aforementioned research gap via a novel physics and data integrated modeling approach. The approach consists of two steps. First, a rapid, part-level computational thermal model was used to predict the temperature distribution and cooling rate in the entire part before it was printed. Second, the foregoing physics-based thermal history quantifiers were used as inputs to a simple machine learning model (support vector machine) trained to predict the meltpool depth and primary dendritic arm spacing based on empirical materials characterization data. As an example of its efficacy, when tested on a separate set of samples from a different build, the approach predicted the primary dendritic arm spacing with root mean squared error ≈ 110 nm. This work thus presents an avenue for future physics-based optimization and control of microstructure evolution in LPBF.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) has emerged as an additive manufacturing technique that offers unprecedented design freedom. Besides being capable of producing complex and near net shape objects, L-PBF can impact tremendously the engineering materials community due to the possibility of locally manipulating metallic microstructures. Here we exploit the latter potentiality of L-PBF, to produce site-specifically tailored stainless steel components, in terms of their crystallographic texture. The tailored materials are tested and exhibit superior energy dissipation capabilities under bending deformation compared to uniformly textured materials. This is enabled by the strong dependence of the secondary hardening mechanisms, namely the deformation twinning and/or martensite formation, of these materials on the locally tuned microstructures. With the aid of finite element simulations, it is possible to identify the stress state and hence, the crystallographic orientations that facilitate twinning or martensite formation. Then, by engineering favorable crystallographic textures, matched to the complex stress state during bending, enhanced work hardening behavior is obtained. This site-specific microstructure design enabled by L-PBF provides a new pathway for the design of “smart” components that exhibit superior mechanical response under complex stress states.},

In the present work, a CET map was established to explain the effect of the laser energy density (LED) on the CET of the LDED fabricated single tracks of the CoCrNi MEA. The results show that the CET observed in single tracks is related to the morphological transformation of cellular substructure, which is governed by constitutional undercooling. With the increase of LED, the maximum value of the constitutional undercooling exceeds the critical nucleation undercooling earlier, which facilitates the heterogeneous nucleation and inhibits the epitaxial growth of rod-like cells, and finally causes a promoted CET. The correlation among the average cell size, geometrically necessary dislocation density, and average hardness of single tracks was also discussed. The present work not only uncovers the mechanism of the CET and grain growth in the LDED-fabricated CoCrNi MEA but also provides theoretical guidance for fabricating other MEAs with ideal microstructure and performance.},

  abstract     = {Abrasion-resistant materials for rock-facing applications typically display low fracture toughness. For materials selection, available fracture data are limited, due to the cost of testing. To address this shortage, a new type of fracture test, denoted the ball mill edge chipping test (BMECT), has been designed. The device is derived from the ball mill abrasion test (BMAT) [37] . It uses simple block or ball specimens with machined edges. Specimens of multiple materials are tested simultaneously. Collisions promote multiple small-scale fracture events at the exposed edges, causing progressive volume loss. The reciprocal of volume loss indicates relative fracture resistance. This paper analyses the BMECT’s relevance to service, and explores its capacity to generate data at low cost. Several data sets are presented, illustrating its application to investigate factors affecting fracture resistance among common abrasion-resistant materials. The results demonstrate multiple advantages over traditional fracture tests — including low cost, high sensitivity to differentiate between materials, and close replication of in-service damage modes. It represents a fundamentally new approach to fracture resistance assessment. Whereas traditional tests are regarded as deterministic, the BMECT is stochastic , providing potential for superior statistical data quality.},

The harvesting process, facilitated by the elastic deformation of TENG, mitigates the impact of ocean waves on both protective layer and the concrete. Importantly, this process concurrently generates electrical energy, subsequently utilized to support a cathodic protection system, thereby providing an additional layer of defense for the rebar. A systematical investigation into the performance of the self-charging protective layer is conducted, revealing crucial insights and design guidelines for the implementation of this self-charging protective layer. The self-driven cathodic protection system proves highly effective in safeguarding the rebar, including a substantial drop in the open current potential (OCP) of rebar from − 584 mV ( vs .

Despite promising outcomes, a comprehensive understanding of these distinctions remains incomplete. One notable observation in the μ-LPBF samples in this study was the presence of a weaker 〈1 0 0〉 texture along the build direction. Additionally, these samples exhibited smaller grain sizes, a higher density of low-angle grain boundaries, and the presence of geometrically necessary dislocations. Significantly, μ-LPBF demonstrates the potential to produce IN718 with exceptional isotropic mechanical properties, primarily attributed to its capacity to generate refined microstructures and facilitate distinct solidification behaviors. Of particular significance was the remarkable 39.1 % increase in yield strength observed along the building direction by μ-LPBF. Furthermore, the differences in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength between various directions are notably reduced to 7 and 41 MPa, respectively, with a minimal total elongation variation of only 1.8 %. To gain deeper insights into the solidification behavior, Computational fluid dynamics were conducted in conjunction with the discrete element method.},

In this study, we introduced an optimized lozenge-chiral auxetic metamaterial (oLCAM) with the dual objectives of balancing the auxeticity and stiffness and achieving tunable properties concurrently. The mechanical performance of the proposed oLCAM was first compared with that of conventional lozenge auxetic metamaterial (cLAM) through both experimental and numerical studies. Herein, the transition stiffness ( E trans Etrans ) was initially proposed as the typical metric evaluating the overall structural stiffness. Subsequently, the study proceeded to investigate the impact of crucial design parameters, specifically the angle of inclination and the radius of the circular core. The design method of oLCAM with tunable auxeticity and stiffness was finally established based on a multi-objective optimization model, achieving the balance between the auxeticity and stiffness of oLCAM. The results revealed the proposed oLCAM obtained a more stable deformation mode than cLAM. Two geometric parameters verified their significance on the above mechanical properties of oLCAM. The resulting optimal oLCAM structure has been proven to obtain both comparatively prominent auxeticity and stiffness. The established design method may have the potential to broaden the possibilities for metamaterial design and performance tuning.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotube (CNT)-graphene foam (GF) composites (CGFCs) have garnered considerable attention due to their unique properties. However, the factors and mechanisms influencing their tensile strength and toughness remain unclear. Here, the influence of graphene stiffness, CNT length, and CNT number on the tensile strength and toughness of pure GF and CGFC was investigated using coarse-grained molecular dynamics. It shows that CGFC exhibits improved strength (66.5 MPa) and toughness (34.4 MJ/m 3 ) compared to pure GF (18.0 MPa and 11.2 MJ/m 3 ) due to enhanced interconnectivity among graphene flakes through additional graphene-CNT-graphene contacts. Notably, the effect of graphene stiffness on the tensile properties reveals an interesting observation: lower stiffness of the graphene correlates with higher strength and toughness of the foam. This phenomenon arises from the increased deformability of softer graphene, promoting the formation of more graphene-graphene and graphene-CNT-graphene contacts. As a result, the interconnectivity is significantly enhanced, leading to improved strength and toughness. Furthermore, greater CNT length and number contribute to the increased strength and toughness. This effect can predominantly be attributed to the growing number of graphene-CNT-graphene contacts, which enhances the connectivity between graphene. These insights inform the design of high-strength and tough materials using CNTs and graphene.},

  abstract     = {Hot cracking is a major challenge in the additive manufacturing of Ni-base superalloys. Most cracking indicators only consider the alloy composition and its effects on solidification behavior, strength, and ductility. We propose a new model that extends these classical cracking indicators by additionally incorporating the transient thermo-mechanical state during melting and solidification. The model is derived from insights into the cracking of thin layers and is mainly based on the elastic strain energy available to drive crack opening in a critical temperature interval. The underlying thermo-mechanical process simulations are implemented in a custom computational framework designed to efficiently model powder bed fusion. The model predictions are validated against experimentally measured crack densities in CMSX-4 processed by electron beam powder bed fusion . The proposed model allows for rationalizing the dependence of cracking susceptibility on the thermal history, which is controlled by scan speed and beam power. Finally, the model is applied to develop a crack mitigation strategy by reducing the built-up strain energy density. This is achieved by heating the melting area to a high temperature before melting, thereby reducing the temperature gradient.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic riveting (EMR) has been widely used in aerospace field, but the riveting gun is heavy and its cost is high. In this paper, the reduction of cost and weight for rivet gun were investigated from the optimization of concentric-ring slave coil. For the lack of accuracy of the traditional genetic algorithm coupled with artificial neuron network (GA-ANN), an improved computational framework was proposed. In the framework, a genetic-drop sampling strategy enhanced the accuracy of GA-ANN and helped ANN to generalize to the optimal. The prototype was manufactured in a case study to verify the riveting quality of the optimized EMR gun. Besides, coils of different sizes proved the generalization ability. The proposed method has the potential to significantly reduce the prediction error by 62% and effectively decrease the number of numerical model calculations by 73%. Optimization for EMR gun led to a 51% reduction in weight, a 73% increase in material utilization and little effect on riveting quality. Meanwhile, the algorithm was still accurate on coils of different sizes. The proposed computational framework could improve efficiency in the design of EMR gun in industry.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a double hollow cylinder with a joint region, representative of nozzles, pipe systems, valves, or pressure regulators, was chosen to measure and simulate its 3D residual stress (RS) distribution. The part was printed by Laser-Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) using commercial 316L steel powders, and a mapping of residual stress along the joint cross-section was measured at three geometrical sample directions. The distribution of RS in the printed part was not homogeneous, showing important gradients of about ±1200 με from the inner to the outer surface of the wall, as well as along the building direction, translated into an equivalent Von Mises stress gradient up to 400 MPa towards the inner surface. After heat treatment only axial strains are significantly affected and relieved 200 με in average, but not necessarily in a homogeneous manner. The comparison of the Von Mises equivalent stress against available simulation tools based on mechanical and thermomechanical models concluded that although these models succeeded in the benchmarking of total macroscopic distortion of components, they do not capture the asymmetric distribution of RS within the bulk in end-use complex geometries and/or joints and those should be implemented from the microstructural level.},

  abstract     = {Piezoelectric poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) fibers, exhibiting high molecular chain orientation, are promising for biomedical applications. Chain orientation decreases due to fast relaxation during melt-spinning process, which implies that a second process to induce piezoelectric chain morphology is usually necessary. This work introduces a one-step melt-spinning process of piezoelectric PLLA fibers, spun directly from the melt, employing a rheological guidance for the selection of the PLLA type and process parameters, based on Rouse&#39;s relaxation time. The chain orientation and the relaxation time increased with the optical purity and average molecular weight of PLLA. The reduction of extrusion temperature from 180 °C to 150 °C facilitated in a significant way the preservation of chain orientation, and the impact of the elongation rate was as well intensified. Combining high elongation rates of ≤ 29 s −1 and reduced extrusion temperature of 150 °C led to flow-induced crystallization of oriented crystals directly from melt in a single step. This fiber exhibited piezoelectric properties in form of a deflection of 1.9 ± 0.3 µm when applying an open-circuit voltage of 210 V. The piezoelectric response was similar to that of a fiber, melt-spun at high extrusion temperature of 180 °C, with additional post-annealing in a second step.},

Geometrically tailored pyramidal lattices with micro-scale features are 3D printed using the Digital Light Processing (DLP) technique, and their effective elastic modulus, collapse strength and energy absorption capacity are experimentally evaluated under quasi-static compressive loading. Furthermore, detailed non-linear finite element (FE) calculations are performed to examine underlying collapse mechanisms and explore the vast design space offered by the proposed geometrical tailoring scheme. Both the experimental and numerical results show that the geometrically tailored lattice structures outperform conventional pyramidal lattices of equal weight in terms of elastic modulus (+24 %), collapse strength (+21 %) and energy absorption (+68 %). Notably, these strength improvements are attributed to lateral buckling that prompts the I-shaped struts to bend sideways during collapse. Specific cross-sectional designs demonstrate remarkable enhancements in strength and energy absorption, reaching up to 93 % and 161 %, respectively, differentiating them significantly from conventional designs.},

There is currently however a lack of fundamental experimental data on the material and structural performance of such elements. Towards addressing this limitation, the tensile behaviour of WAAM high strength steel produced using different printing strategies is the focus of the present study. WAAM steel plates and tubular tension members manufactured with different interpass temperatures and toolpaths using ER110S-G welding wire were examined. A total of 60 tensile coupons, consisting of 40 as-built and 20 machined specimens, and 8 as-built circular hollow section (CHS) tension members, were tested. The examined WAAM materials were found to exhibit very little anisotropy, corroborated by a nearly homogeneous crystallographic texture observed by microstructural analysis , while the inherent surface undulations were shown to result in a varying degree of reduction in the material stiffness , strength and ductility at different angles to the print layer orientation. The different printing strategies led to varying surface geometries; combined with different interpass temperatures, they also resulted in different thermal histories and thus different mechanical properties. The tension members showed good structural resistance, but a considerable reduction in ductility compared to the coupon tests, due to the greater geometric variability and manufacturing defects.},

In this study, we present a tri-conversion strategy, inspired by superhydrophobicity, photothermal conversion, and electrothermal conversion, to develop an all-weather, high-efficiency, and low-energy rotor leading edge anti-icing and de-icing patch. The experimental samples not only possess stable superhydrophobic photothermal conversion capabilities but also achieve a 610-second delay in droplet icing, a 1-second nitrogen blow for frost, and a low ice adhesion strength of 11.6 KPa. Under one sun illumination, it can achieve a stable 54-second static melt and 37-second dynamic melt. With a connection to a 24 V DC stabilized power supply, it showcases an excellent 146-second de-icing capability. The synergistic action of multiple barriers enhances the anti-icing and de-icing performance. This work not only provides rational design principles for high-energy consumption de-icing but also offers insights into harnessing the power of nature for photothermal conversion de-icing.},

  abstract     = {The iris is an ocular organ that actively controls the size of the pupil-aperture in response to external light, thereby regulating the amount of light reaching the retina for better visual acquisition. Herein, we propose a light-adaptive pupil-scalable artificial iris for addressing human iris defects with biomimetic self-regulating light control similar to human iris actuation, which is realized by a radially gradient and reversible photoswitching of photochromic dyes doped within a biocompatible hydrogel matrix. The radial photochromic switching of light transmissions was achieved by the gradient patterning of the crosslinking density of the hydrogel matrix using a near-infrared light-absorbing photomask that generated radially thermal gradience during hydrogel matrix polymerization. With the effective pupil-aperture control, the proposed artificial iris exhibited a variation in the visible-light transmittance from ∼82 % at the ultraviolet light (UV) intensity of 0.5 mW/cm 2 to ∼43 % at 3.0 mW/cm 2 representing the transparent and colored states, respectively. The switching times for the transitions to the colored and transparent states were 27.42 and 112.25 s, respectively, at a UV intensity of 3.0 mW/cm 2 , which can be faster under the hydrated state. The artificial iris demonstrated potential in biomedical applications by offering reliable light-adaptive attenuation control through human-like pupil-aperture adjustments.},
