  abstract     = {A useful property of independent samples is that their correlation remains the same after applying marginal transforms. This invariance property plays a fundamental role in statistical inference, but does not hold in general for dependent samples. In this paper, we study this invariance property on the Pearson correlation coefficient and its applications. A multivariate random vector is said to have an invariant correlation if its pairwise correlation coefficients remain unchanged under any common marginal transforms. For a bivariate case, we characterize all models of such a random vector via a certain combination of comonotonicity—the strongest form of positive dependence—and independence. In particular, we show that the class of exchangeable copulas with invariant correlation is precisely described by what we call positive Fréchet copulas. In the general multivariate case, we characterize the set of all invariant correlation matrices via the clique partition polytope. We also propose a positive regression dependent model that admits any prescribed invariant correlation matrix. Finally, we show that all our characterization results of invariant correlation, except one special case, remain the same if the common marginal transforms are confined to the set of increasing ones.},

It can be used for screening individual features as well as grouped features. The proposed procedure possesses several appealing properties. It is model-free. No model specification is needed. It holds the sure independence screening property and the ranking consistency property. The proposed screening method can also deal with the case that the response has divergent number of categories. We conduct several Monte Carlo simulation studies to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed screening procedure. Real data analysis for two real life datasets are illustrated.},

  abstract     = {A Bayesian covariance structure model (BCSM) is proposed for interval-censored multi-way nested survival data. This flexible modeling framework generalizes mixed effects survival models by allowing positive and negative associations among clustered observations. Conjugate shifted-inverse gamma priors are proposed for the covariance parameters, implying inverse gamma priors for the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, which ensures a positive definite covariance matrix under posterior analysis. A numerically efficient Gibbs sampling procedure is defined for balanced nested designs. This requires sampling latent variables from their marginal full conditional distributions, which are derived through a recursive formula. This makes the estimation procedure suitable for interval-censored data with large cluster sizes. For unbalanced nested designs, a novel (balancing) data augmentation procedure is introduced to improve the efficiency of the Gibbs sampler. The Gibbs sampling procedure is validated in two simulation studies. The linear transformation BCSM (LT-BCSM) was applied to two-way nested interval-censored event times to analyze differences in adverse events between three groups of patients, who were randomly allocated to treatment with different stents (BIO-RESORT). The parameters of the structured covariance matrix represented unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects and were examined to detect differential treatment effects. A comparison was made with inference results under a random effects linear transformation model. It was concluded that the LT-BCSM led to inferences with higher posterior credibility, a more profound way of quantifying evidence for risk equivalence of the three treatments, and it was more robust to prior specifications.},

A data-splitting strategy is required to find the projection directions that reduce the data from high dimensional space to low dimensional space which can well solve the issue of “the curse of dimensionality”. As long as both samples are randomly split once, two correlated cross projection statistics can be established according to the CPT development mechanism, which is similar to all constructed test statistics that exist the correlation caused by multiple random splits. To deal with this issue and improve the performance of empirical powers by eliminating the randomness of data-splitting, we further utilize a powerful Cauchy combination test algorithm based on multiple data-splitting. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic property of the proposed test statistic. Furthermore, for the sparse alternative case, we apply the power enhancement technique to the ensemble Cauchy combination test-based algorithm in marginal screening for the full data. Numerical studies through Monte Carlo simulations and two real data examples are conducted simultaneously to illustrate the utility of our proposed ensemble algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The family of multivariate unified skew-normal (SUN) distributions has been recently shown to possess fundamental conjugacy properties. When used as priors for the vector of coefficients in probit, tobit, and multinomial probit models, these distributions yield posteriors that still belong to the SUN family. Although this result has led to important advancements in Bayesian inference and computation, its applicability beyond likelihoods associated with fully-observed, discretized, or censored realizations from multivariate Gaussian models remains yet unexplored. This article covers such a gap by proving that the wider family of multivariate unified skew-elliptical (SUE) distributions, which extends SUNs to more general perturbations of elliptical densities, guarantees conjugacy for broader classes of models, beyond those relying on fully-observed, discretized or censored Gaussians. Such a result leverages the closure under linear combinations, conditioning and marginalization of SUE to prove that this family is conjugate to the likelihood induced by regression models for fully-observed, censored or dichotomized realizations from skew-elliptical distributions. This key advancement enlarges the set of models that enable conjugate Bayesian inference to general formulations arising from elliptical and skew-elliptical families, including the multivariate Student’s t t and skew- t t , among others.},

However, PLS and predictor envelope both target at a space that contains the regression coefficients and therefore they may sometimes be too conservative to reduce the dimension of the predictors. In this paper, we propose a new method that may improve the estimation efficiency of regression coefficients when both PLS and predictor envelope fail to do so. Specifically, our method results in the largest reducing subspace of predictors’ covariance that is contained in the coefficient matrix space. Interestingly, the moment based algorithm of our proposed method can be achieved by changing the max in PLS to min. We define the modified PLS as the inner PLS and the resulting space as the inner predictor envelope space. We provide the theoretical properties of our proposed methods as well as demonstrate their use in China Health and Nutrition Survey.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of the mean and covariance parameters for functional data is a critical task, with local linear smoothing being a popular choice. In recent years, many scientific domains are producing multivariate functional data for which p p , the number of curves per subject, is often much larger than the sample size n n . In this setting of high-dimensional functional data, much of developed methodology relies on preliminary estimates of the unknown mean functions and the auto- and cross-covariance functions. This paper investigates the convergence rates of local linear estimators in terms of the maximal error across components and pairs of components for mean and covariance functions, respectively, in both L 2 L2 and uniform metrics. The local linear estimators utilize a generic weighting scheme that can adjust for differing numbers of discrete observations N i j Nij across curves j j and subjects i i , where the N i j Nij vary with n n . Particular attention is given to the equal weight per observation (OBS) and equal weight per subject (SUBJ) weighting schemes. The theoretical results utilize novel applications of concentration inequalities for functional data and demonstrate that, similar to univariate functional data, the order of the N i j Nij relative to p p and n n divides high-dimensional functional data into three regimes (sparse, dense, and ultra-dense), with the high-dimensional parametric convergence rate of log ( p ) / n 1 / 2 log(p)/n1/2 being attainable in the latter two.},

Several tests have been proposed but they are either too liberal or too conservative when the required assumptions are not satisfied which attests that they are not always applicable in real data analysis. To overcome this difficulty, a normal-reference test is proposed and studied in this paper. It is shown that under some regularity conditions and the null hypothesis, the proposed test statistic and a chi-squared-type mixture have the same limiting distribution. It is then justified to approximate the null distribution of the proposed test statistic using that of the chi-squared-type mixture. The distribution of the chi-squared-type mixture can be well approximated using a three-cumulant matched chi-squared-approximation with its approximation parameters consistently estimated from the data. The asymptotic power of the proposed test under a local alternative is also established. Simulation studies and a real data example demonstrate that the proposed test works well in general scenarios and outperforms the existing competitors substantially in terms of size control.},

This study proposes three composite-type ER estimators to improve estimation accuracy. The proposed ER estimators include the composite estimator, which minimizes the composite expectile objective function across expectiles; the weighted expectile average estimator, which takes the weighted average of expectile-specific estimators; and the weighted composite estimator, which minimizes the weighted composite expectile objective function across expectiles. Under certain regularity conditions, we derive the convergence rate of the slope function, obtain the mean squared prediction error, and establish the asymptotic normality of the slope vector. Simulations are conducted to assess the empirical performances of various estimators. An application to the analysis of capital bike share data is presented. The numerical evidence endorses our theoretical results and confirm the superiority of the composite-type ER estimators to the conventional least squares and single ER estimators.},

  abstract     = {Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher opened many new areas in Multivariate Analysis, and the one which we will consider is discriminant analysis. Several papers by Fisher and others followed from his seminal paper in 1936 where he coined the name discrimination function. Historically, his four papers on discriminant analysis during 1936–1940 connect to the contemporaneous pioneering work of Hotelling and Mahalanobis. We revisit the famous iris data which Fisher used in his 1936 paper and in particular, test the hypothesis of multivariate normality for the data which he assumed. Fisher constructed his genetic discriminant motivated by this application and we provide a deeper insight into this construction; however, this construction has not been well understood as far as we know. We also indicate how the subject has developed along with the computer revolution, noting newer methods to carry out discriminant analysis, such as kernel classifiers, classification trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning. Overall, with computational power, the whole subject of Multivariate Analysis has changed its emphasis but the impact of this Fisher’s pioneering work continues as an integral part of supervised learning in Artificial Intelligence (AI).},

We show that these models have appealing dependence properties including tail dependence at short distances and independence at long distances. We further consider max-convolutions between such processes and processes with tail independence, in order to separately control the bulk and tail dependence behaviors, and to increase flexibility of the model at longer distances, in particular, to capture intermediate tail dependence. We show how parameters can be estimated using a weighted pairwise likelihood approach, and we conduct an extensive simulation study to show that the proposed inference approach is feasible in relatively high dimensions and it yields accurate parameter estimates in most cases. We apply the proposed methodology to analyze daily temperature maxima measured at 100 monitoring stations in the state of Oklahoma, US. Our results indicate that our proposed model provides a good fit to the data, and that it captures both the bulk and the tail dependence structures accurately.},

By virtue of the idea of group selection in the classical linear regression framework, we propose an LRTR method for adaptive selection of grouped variables in this article, which is formulated as a group SLOPE penalized low-rank, orthogonally decomposable tensor optimization problem. Moreover, we introduce the notion of tensor group false discovery rate (TgFDR) to measure the group selection performance. The proposed regression method provably controls TgFDR and achieves the asymptotically minimax estimate under the assumption that variable groups are orthogonal to each other. Finally, an alternating minimization algorithm is developed for efficient problem resolution. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method in group selection and low-rank estimation through simulation studies and real dataset analysis.},

Standard estimators are generally based on rotationally symmetric kernel functions such as the von Mises kernel function. Unfortunately, their mean integrated squared error does not have root- n n consistency and increasing the dimension slows its convergence rate. Therefore, this study aims to improve its accuracy by correcting this bias. It proposes bias correction methods by applying the generalized jackknifing method that can be generated from the von Mises kernel function. We also obtain the asymptotic mean integrated squared errors of the proposed estimators. We find that the convergence rates of the proposed estimators are higher than those of previous estimators. Further, a numerical experiment shows that the proposed estimators perform better than the von Mises kernel density estimators in finite samples in scenarios that are mixtures of von Mises densities.},

In this paper, we describe an approach based on a penalization technique that helps us recover the signed support of the tensor parameter with high probability, assuming that no entry of the true tensor is too close to zero. The method is based on an ℓ 1 ℓ1 -regularized node-wise logistic regression, that recovers the signed neighborhood of each node with high probability. Our analysis is carried out in the high-dimensional regime, that allows the dimension p p of the Ising model, as well as the interaction factor k k to potentially grow to ∞ ∞ with the sample size n n . We show that if the minimum interaction strength is not too small, then consistent recovery of the entire signed support is possible if one takes n = Ω ( ( k ! ) 8 d 3 log p − 1 k − 1 ) n=Ω((k!)8d3logp−1k−1) samples, where d d denotes the maximum degree of the hypernetwork in question. Our results are validated in two simulation settings, and applied on a real neurobiological dataset consisting of multi-array electro-physiological recordings from the mouse visual cortex, to model higher-order interactions between the brain regions.},

Although several studies have developed distribution-to-distribution regression models for univariate variables, the multivariate scenario remains under-explored due to technical complexities. In this study, we introduce models for regression from one Gaussian distribution to another, using the Wasserstein metric. These models are constructed using the geometry of the Wasserstein space, which enables the transformation of Gaussian distributions into components of a linear matrix space. Owing to their linear regression frameworks, our models are intuitively understandable, and their implementation is simplified because of the optimal transport problem’s analytical solution between Gaussian distributions. We also explore a generalization of our models to encompass non-Gaussian scenarios. We establish the convergence rates of in-sample prediction errors for the empirical risk minimizations in our models. In comparative simulation experiments, our models demonstrate superior performance over a simpler alternative method that transforms Gaussian distributions into matrices. We present an application of our methodology using weather data for illustration purposes.},

In addition, all layers can be partitioned into groups with the same community structures, although the layers in the same group may have different matrices of block connection probabilities. To the best of our knowledge, the DIMPLE model, introduced in Pensky and Wang (2021), presents the most broad SBM-equipped binary multilayer network model on the same set of nodes and, thus, generalizes a multitude of papers that study more restrictive settings. Under the DIMPLE model, the main task is to identify the groups of layers with the same community structures since the matrices of block connection probabilities act as nuisance parameters under the DIMPLE paradigm. The main contribution of the paper is achieving the strongly consistent between-layer clustering by using Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), the well-developed technique in computer vision. In addition, SSC allows to handle much larger networks than spectral clustering, and is perfectly suitable for application of parallel computing. Moreover, our paper is the first one to obtain precision guarantees for SSC when it is applied to binary data.},

On general anisotropic Sobolev classes, the estimator adapts to the regularity of the unknown density but also achieves directional adaptivity. More precisely, the estimator is able to reach the convergence rate induced by the best Sobolev regularity of the density of A X AX , where A A belongs to a class of invertible matrices describing all the possible directions. The estimator is easy to implement and numerically efficient.

  abstract     = {Model-based clustering is a commonly-used technique to partition heterogeneous data into homogeneous groups. When the analysis is to be conducted with a large number of features, analysts face simultaneous challenges in model interpretability, clustering accuracy, and computational efficiency. Several Bayesian and penalization methods have been proposed to select important features for model-based clustering. However, the performance of those methods relies on a careful algorithmic tuning, which can be time-consuming for high-dimensional cases. In this paper, we propose a new sparse clustering method based on alternating hard-thresholding. The new method is conceptually simple and tuning-free. With a user-specified sparsity level, it efficiently detects a set of key features by eliminating a large number of features that are less useful for clustering. Based on the selected key features, one can readily obtain an effective clustering of the original high-dimensional data under a general sparse covariance structure. Under mild conditions, we show that the new method leads to clusters with a misclassification rate consistent to the optimal rate as if the underlying true model were used. The promising performance of the new method is supported by both simulated and real data examples.},

  abstract     = {Mixed data comprise measurements of different types, with both categorical and continuous variables, and can be found in various areas, such as in life science or industrial processes. Inferring conditional independencies from the data is crucial to understand how these variables relate to each other. To this end, graphical models provide an effective framework, which adopts a graph-based representation of the joint distribution to encode such dependence relations. This framework has been extensively studied in the Gaussian and categorical settings separately; on the other hand, the literature addressing this problem in presence of mixed data is still narrow. We propose a Bayesian model for the analysis of mixed data based on the notion of Conditional Gaussian (CG) distribution. Our method is based on a canonical parameterization of the CG distribution, which allows for posterior inference of parameters indexing the (marginal) distributions of continuous and categorical variables, as well as expressing the interactions between the two types of variables. We derive the limiting Gaussian distributions, centered on the correct unknown value and with vanishing variance, for the Bayesian estimators of the canonical parameters expressing continuous, discrete and mixed interactions. In addition, we implement the proposed method for structure learning purposes, namely to infer the underlying graph of conditional independencies. When compared to alternative frequentist methods, our approach shows favorable results both in a simulation setting and in real-data applications, besides allowing for a coherent uncertainty quantification around parameter estimates.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new family of directional dependence measures for multivariate distributions. The family of dependence measures is indexed by α ≥ 1 α≥1 . When α = 1 α=1 , they measure the strength of dependence along different paths to the joint upper or lower orthant. For α α large, they become tail-weighted dependence measures that put more weight in the joint upper or lower tails of the distribution. As α → ∞ α→∞ , we show the convergence of the directional dependence measures to the multivariate tail dependence function and characterize the convergence pattern with an asymptotic expansion. This expansion leads to a method to estimate the multivariate tail dependence function using weighted least square regression. We develop rank-based sample estimators for the tail-weighted dependence measures and establish their asymptotic distributions. The practical utility of the tail-weighted dependence measures in multivariate tail inference is further demonstrated through their application to a financial dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a nonparametric method for the general two-sample problem involving functional random variables modeled as elements of a separable Hilbert space H H . First, we present a general recipe based on linear projections to construct a measure of dissimilarity between two probability distributions on H H . In particular, we consider a measure based on the energy statistic and present some of its nice theoretical properties. A plug-in estimator of this measure is used as the test statistic to construct a general two-sample test. Large sample distribution of this statistic is derived both under null and alternative hypotheses. However, since the quantiles of the limiting null distribution are analytically intractable, the test is calibrated using the permutation method. We prove the large sample consistency of the resulting permutation test under fairly general assumptions. We also study the efficiency of the proposed test by establishing a new local asymptotic normality result for functional random variables. Using that result, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the permuted test statistic and the asymptotic power of the permutation test under local contiguous alternatives. This establishes that the permutation test is statistically efficient in the Pitman sense. Extensive simulation studies are carried out and a real data set is analyzed to compare the performance of our proposed test with some state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The Laplace approximation has been proposed as a method for approximating the marginal likelihood of statistical models with latent variables. However, the approximate maximum likelihood estimators derived from the Laplace approximation are often biased for binary or temporally and/or spatially correlated data. Additionally, the corresponding Hessian matrix tends to underestimates the standard errors of these approximate maximum likelihood estimators. While higher-order approximations have been suggested, they are not applicable to complex models, such as correlated random effects models, and fail to provide consistent variance estimators. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Laplace approximation that provides the true maximum likelihood estimator and its consistent variance estimator. We study its relationship with the variational Bayes method. We also define a new restricted maximum likelihood estimator for estimating dispersion parameters and study their asymptotic properties. Enhanced Laplace approximation generally demonstrates how to obtain the true restricted maximum likelihood estimators and their variance estimators. Our numerical studies indicate that the enhanced Laplace approximation provides a satisfactory maximum likelihood estimator and restricted maximum likelihood estimator, as well as their variance estimators in the frequentist perspective. The maximum likelihood estimator and restricted maximum likelihood estimator can be also interpreted as the posterior mode and marginal posterior mode under flat priors, respectively. Furthermore, we present some comparisons with Bayesian procedures under different priors.},

To test whether two samples are independent, a so-called HSIC (Hilbert–Schmidt Independence Criterion)-based test has been proposed. Its null distribution is approximated either by permutation or a Gamma approximation. In this paper, a new HSIC-based test is proposed. Its asymptotic null and alternative distributions are established. It is shown that the proposed test is root- n n consistent. A three-cumulant matched chi-squared-approximation is adopted to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. By choosing a proper reproducing kernel, the proposed test can be applied to many different types of data including multivariate, high-dimensional, and functional data. Three simulation studies and two real data applications show that in terms of level accuracy, power, and computational cost, the proposed test outperforms several existing tests for multivariate, high-dimensional, and functional data.},

Specifically, we apply a uniform variant of the kernel trick which involves the supremum within a class of kernel-based distances. We obtain the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null and alternative hypotheses. The proofs rely on empirical processes theory, combined with the delta method and Hadamard directional differentiability techniques, and functional Karhunen–Loève-type expansions of the underlying processes. This methodology has some advantages over other standard approaches in the literature. We also give some experimental insight into the performance of our proposal compared to other kernel-based approaches (the original proposal by Borgwardt et al.

Kernel-based learning methods have been proven to be quite successful in dealing with nonlinearity in the data and multivariate optimization. In this paper we present a class of kernel-based online gradient descent algorithm for addressing regression problems, which generates sparse estimators in an iterative way to reduce the algorithmic complexity for training streaming datasets and model selection in large-scale learning scenarios. In the setting of support vector regression (SVR), we design the sparse online learning algorithm by introducing a sequence of insensitive distance-based loss functions. We prove consistency and error bounds quantifying the generalization performance of such algorithms under mild conditions. The theoretical results demonstrate the interplay between statistical accuracy and sparsity property during learning processes. We show that the insensitive parameter plays a crucial role in providing sparsity as well as fast convergence rates. The numerical experiments also support our theoretical results.},

In this work, we propose an efficient calibration procedure for multivariate output within restricted correlation. First, we construct an estimator of the discrepancy function between the true process and the computer model by the local linear approximation, then obtain an estimator of the calibration parameter by the weighted profile least squares and establish its asymptotic properties. In addition, we also develop an estimator of the calibration parameter in a special situation, whose asymptotic normality has been derived.

A transformation of both random elements into a new separable Hilbert space is considered so that the equality of expectations of the transformed random elements is equivalent to the equality of distributions. Thus, a bootstrap test procedure to check the equality of means can be used in order to solve the original problem. It will be shown that both the asymptotic and bootstrap approaches proposed are asymptotically correct and consistent. The results can be applied, for example, in functional data analysis. In practice, the test can be solved with simple operations in the original space without applying the mentioned transformation, which is used only to guarantee the theoretical results.

For univariate distributions, we construct the universal kernel using the Wasserstein distance, while for multivariate distributions, we resort to the sliced Wasserstein distance. The sliced Wasserstein distance ensures that the metric space possesses similar topological properties to the Wasserstein space, while also offering significant computation benefits.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel strategy for multivariate extreme value index estimation. In applications such as finance, volatility and risk of multivariate time series are often driven by the same underlying factors. To estimate the latent risks, we apply a two-stage procedure. First, a set of independent latent series is estimated using a method of latent variable analysis. Then, univariate risk measures are estimated individually for the latent series. We provide conditions under which the effect of the latent model estimation to the asymptotic behavior of the risk estimators is negligible. Simulations illustrate the theory under both i.i.d. and dependent data, and an application into currency exchange rate data shows that the method is able to discover extreme behavior not found by component-wise analysis of the original series.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate regression models have been broadly used in analyzing data having multi-dimensional response variables. The use of such models is, however, impeded by the presence of measurement error and spurious variables. While data with such features are common in applications, there has been little work available concerning these features jointly. In this article, we consider variable selection under multivariate regression models with covariates subject to measurement error. To gain flexibility, we allow the dimensions of the covariate and response variables to be either fixed or diverging as the sample size increases. A new regularized method is proposed to handle both variable selection and measurement error effects for error-contaminated data. Our proposed penalized bias-corrected least squares method offers flexibility in selecting the penalty function from a class of functions with different features. Importantly, our method does not require full distributional assumptions for the associated variables, thereby broadening its applicability. We rigorously establish theoretical results and describe a computationally efficient procedure for the proposed method. Numerical studies confirm the satisfactory performance of the proposed method under finite settings, and also demonstrate deleterious effects of ignoring measurement error in inferential procedures.},

  abstract     = {Network estimation has been a critical component of high-dimensional data analysis and can provide an understanding of the underlying complex dependence structures. Among the existing studies, Gaussian graphical models have been highly popular. However, they still have limitations due to the homogeneous distribution assumption and the fact that they are only applicable to small-scale data. For example, cancers have various levels of unknown heterogeneity, and biological networks, which include thousands of molecular components, often differ across subgroups while also sharing some commonalities. In this article, we propose a new joint estimation approach for multiple networks with unknown sample heterogeneity, by decomposing the Gaussian graphical model (GGM) into a collection of sparse regression problems. A reparameterization technique and a composite minimax concave penalty are introduced to effectively accommodate the specific and common information across the networks of multiple subgroups, making the proposed estimator significantly advancing from the existing heterogeneity network analysis based on the regularized likelihood of GGM directly and enjoying scale-invariant, tuning-insensitive, and optimization convexity properties. The proposed analysis can be effectively realized using parallel computing. The estimation and selection consistency properties are rigorously established. The proposed approach allows the theoretical studies to focus on independent network estimation only and has the significant advantage of being both theoretically and computationally applicable to large-scale data. Extensive numerical experiments with simulated data and the TCGA breast cancer data demonstrate the prominent performance of the proposed approach in both subgroup and network identifications.},

Combining the likelihood of a multivariate robust linear regression model with a standard improper prior distribution yields an analytically intractable posterior distribution that can be sampled using a data augmentation algorithm. When the response matrix has missing entries, there are unique challenges to the application and analysis of the convergence properties of the algorithm. Conditions for geometric ergodicity are provided when the incomplete data have a “monotone” structure. In the absence of a monotone structure, an intermediate imputation step is necessary for implementing the algorithm. In this case, we provide sufficient conditions for the algorithm to be Harris ergodic. Finally, we show that, when there is a monotone structure and intermediate imputation is unnecessary, intermediate imputation slows the convergence of the underlying Monte Carlo Markov chain , while post hoc imputation does not.

Then the inference is based on a minimization algorithm of gradient descent type, coupled with consistent kernel estimations of our key statistical quantities such as conditional quantiles , conditional tail index and conditional tail dependence functions. The method is valid for equivalently heavy-tailed marginals and under a multivariate regular variation condition on the underlying unknown random vector with arbitrary dependence structure . Our main result establishes the consistency in probability of the optimum approximated solution vectors with a speed rate.

Whereas, if the dimension of the vector of regression coefficients is greater than 1 and the residuals are dependent, the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), which includes the information of the covariance matrix Γ Γ of residual process has a better performance than LSE in the sense of mean square error . As we know the unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible, Senda and Taniguchi (2006) introduced a James–Stein type shrinkage estimator for the regression coefficients based on LSE, where the residual process is a Gaussian stationary process, and provides sufficient conditions such that the James–Stein type shrinkage estimator improves LSE. In this paper, we propose a shrinkage estimator based on BLUE. Sufficient conditions for this shrinkage estimator to improve BLUE are also given. Furthermore, since Γ Γ is infeasible, assuming that Γ Γ has a form of Γ = Γ ( θ ) Γ=Γ(θ) , we introduce a feasible version of that shrinkage estimator with replacing Γ ( θ ) Γ(θ) by Γ ( θ ˆ ) Γ(θˆ) which is introduced in Toyooka (1986). Additionally, we give the sufficient conditions where the feasible version improves BLUE. Besides, the results of a numerical studies confirm our approach.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian copula is a powerful tool that has been widely used to model spatial and/or temporal correlated data with arbitrary marginal distributions. However, this kind of model can potentially be too restrictive since it expresses a reflection symmetric dependence. In this paper, we propose a new spatial copula model that makes it possible to obtain random fields with arbitrary marginal distributions with a type of dependence that can be reflection symmetric or not. Particularly, we propose a new random field with uniform marginal distributions that can be viewed as a spatial generalization of the classical Clayton copula model. It is obtained through a power transformation of a specific instance of a beta random field which in turn is obtained using a transformation of two independent Gamma random fields. For the proposed random field, we study the second-order properties and we provide analytic expressions for the bivariate distribution and its correlation. Finally, in the reflection symmetric case, we study the associated geometrical properties. As an application of the proposed model we focus on spatial modeling of data with bounded support. Specifically, we focus on spatial regression models with marginal distribution of the beta type. In a simulation study, we investigate the use of the weighted pairwise composite likelihood method for the estimation of this model. Finally, the effectiveness of our methodology is illustrated by analyzing point-referenced vegetation index data using the Gaussian copula as benchmark. Our developments have been implemented in an open-source package for the R statistical environment.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a dependent competing risks model with the distribution of one risk being a semiparametric proportional hazards model , whereas the model for the other risks and the degree of risk dependence of an Archimedean copula are unknown. Identifiability is shown when there is at least one covariate with at least two values. Estimation is done by means of a n n -consistent semiparametric two-step procedure. Applicability and attractive finite sample performance are demonstrated with the help of simulations. An application to unemployment duration confirms the importance of estimating rather than assuming risk dependence.},

  abstract     = {The present paper derives an explicit expression for (a version of) every uni- and multivariate conditional distribution (i.e., Markov kernel) of Archimedean copulas and uses this representation to generalize a recently established result, saying that in the class of multivariate Archimedean copulas standard uniform convergence implies weak convergence of almost all univariate Markov kernels, to arbitrary multivariate Markov kernels. Moreover, it is proved that an Archimedean copula is singular if, and only if, almost all uni- and multivariate Markov kernels are singular. These results are then applied to conditional Archimedean copulas which are reintroduced largely from a Markov kernel perspective and it is shown that convergence, singularity and conditional increasingness carry over from Archimedean copulas to their conditional copulas. As a consequence, the surprising fact is established that estimating (the generator of) an Archimedean copula directly yields an estimator of (the generator of) its conditional copula. Building upon that, we sketch the use and estimation of a conditional version of a recently introduced dependence measure as alternative to well-known conditional versions of association measures in order to study the dependence behavior of Archimedean models when fixing covariate values .},

While most of these methods are based on the cdf of W = F X ( X ) W=FX(X) , this paper introduces the weighted characteristic function (WCf) of W W . A sample version of the WCf of W W based on pseudo-observations is proposed and its weak limit in a space of complex functions is formally established. This result can be used to define test statistics for multivariate independence and goodness-of-fit in copula models, whose asymptotic behaviour comes from the weak convergence of the empirical WCf process. Simulations show the good sampling properties of these new tests, and an illustration is given on the multivariate Cook and Johnson dataset.},

Among them, the one that satisfies given constraints on expectation and is closest to being an independent distribution in the sense of Kullback–Leibler divergence is called the minimum information bivariate copula. The density function of the minimum information copula contains a set of functions called the normalizing functions, which are often difficult to compute. Although a number of proper scoring rules for probability distributions having normalizing constants such as exponential families have been proposed, these scores are not applicable to the minimum information copulas due to the normalizing functions. In this paper, we propose the conditional Kullback–Leibler score, which avoids computation of the normalizing functions. The main idea of its construction is to use pairs of observations. We show that the proposed score is strictly proper in the space of copula density functions and therefore the estimator derived from it has asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, the score is convex with respect to the parameters and can be easily optimized by the gradient methods.},

We develop a consistent and powerful estimator, called fastMI , that does not incur any parameter tuning. Based on a copula formulation, fastMI estimates M I MI by leveraging Fast Fourier transform-based estimation of the underlying density. Extensive simulation studies reveal that fastMI outperforms state-of-the-art estimators with improved estimation accuracy and reduced run time for large data sets. fastMI provides a powerful test for independence that exhibits satisfactory type I error control. Anticipating that it will be a powerful tool in estimating mutual information in a broad range of data, we develop an R package fastMI for broader dissemination.},

In the present paper, we identify and investigate the dependence structure underlying this dimension reduction principle, provide a strongly consistent estimator for it, and demonstrate its broad applicability. For that purpose, we define a bivariate copula capturing the scale-invariant extent of dependence of an endogenous random variable Y Y on a set of d ≥ 1 d≥1 exogenous random variables X = ( X 1 , … , X d ) X=(X1,…,Xd) , and containing the information whether Y Y is completely dependent on X X , and whether Y Y and X X are independent. The dimension reduction principle becomes apparent insofar as the introduced bivariate copula can be viewed as the distribution function of two random variables Y Y and Y ′ Y′ sharing the same conditional distribution and being conditionally independent given X X . Evaluating this copula uniformly along the diagonal, i.e., calculating Spearman’s footrule, leads to an unconditional version of Azadkia and Chatterjee’s ‘simple measure of conditional dependence’ T T . On the other hand, evaluating this copula uniformly over the unit square, i.e., calculating Spearman’s rho, leads to a distribution-free coefficient of determination (also known as ‘copula correlation’). Several real data examples illustrate the importance of the introduced methodology.},

When only the standard axioms of measures of concordance are required, it is not always clear which transformed rank correlation is most suitable to use. To address this question, we compare measures of concordance in terms of their best and worst asymptotic variances of some canonical estimators over a certain set of dependence structures . A simple criterion derived from this approach is that concordance-inducing distributions with smaller fourth moment are more preferable. In particular, we show that Blomqvist’s beta is the optimal transformed rank correlation in this sense, and Spearman’s rho outperforms van der Waerden’s coefficient. Moreover, we find that Kendall’s tau, although it is not a transformed rank correlation of that nature, shares a certain optimal structure with Blomqvist’s beta.},

These results extend and strengthen previous ordering results from the literature concerning certain classes of mixture models as mixtures of multivariate normals , multivariate elliptic and exchangeable models to general factor models. For the main results, we first strengthen some known orthant ordering results for the multivariate -product of the specifications, which represents the copula of the factor model, to the stronger notion of the supermodular ordering. The stronger comparison results are based on classical rearrangement results and in particular are rendered possible by some involved constructions of transfers as arising from mass transfer theory. The ordering results for -products are then extended to factor models with general conditional dependencies. As a consequence of the ordering results, we derive worst case scenarios in relevant classes of factor models allowing, in particular, interesting applications to deriving sharp bounds in financial and insurance risk models. The results and methods of this paper are a further indication of the particular effectiveness of Sklar‘s copula notion.},

In Gaussian 1-factor and structural factor models (such as bi-factor and oblique factor) and their factor copula counterparts, factor scores or proxies are defined as conditional expectations of latent variables given the observed variables. With mild assumptions, the proxies are consistent for corresponding latent variables as the sample size and the number of observed variables linked to each latent variable go to infinity. When the bivariate copulas linking observed variables to latent variables are not assumed in advance, sequential procedures are used for latent variables estimation, copula family selection and parameter estimation. The use of proxy variables for factor copulas means that approximate log-likelihoods can be used to estimate copula parameters with less computational effort for numerical integration.},

  abstract     = {We propose an approach to construct a new family of generalized Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (GFGM) copulas that naturally scales to high dimensions . A GFGM copula can model moderate positive and negative dependence, cover different types of asymmetries, and admits exact expressions for many quantities of interest such as measures of association or risk measures in actuarial science or quantitative risk management. More importantly, this paper presents a new method to construct high-dimensional copulas based on mixtures of power functions and may be adapted to more general contexts to construct broader families of copulas. We construct a family of copulas through a stochastic representation based on multivariate Bernoulli distributions and Coxian-2 distributions. This paper will cover the construction of a GFGM copula and study its measures of multivariate association and dependence properties. We explain how to sample random vectors from the new family of copulas in high dimensions. Then, we study the bivariate case in detail and find that our construction leads to an asymmetric modified Huang–Kotz FGM copula. Finally, we study the exchangeable case and provide insights into the most negative dependence structure within this new class of high-dimensional copulas.},

  abstract     = {A novel positive dependence property is introduced, called positive measure inducing (PMI for short), being fulfilled by numerous copula classes, including Gaussian , Student t t , Fréchet, Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern and Frank copulas; it is conjectured that even all positive quadrant dependent Archimedean copulas meet this property. From a geometric viewpoint, a PMI copula concentrates more mass near the main diagonal than in the opposite diagonal. A striking feature of PMI copulas is that they impose an ordering on a certain class of copula-induced measures of concordance, the latter originating in Edwards et al. (2004) and including Spearman’s rho ρ ρ and Gini’s gamma γ γ , leading to numerous new inequalities such as 3 γ ≥ 2 ρ 3γ≥2ρ . The measures of concordance within this class are estimated using (classical) empirical copulas and the intrinsic construction via empirical checkerboard copulas, and the estimators’ asymptotic behavior is determined. Building upon the presented inequalities, asymptotic tests are constructed having the potential of being used for detecting whether the underlying dependence structure of a given sample is PMI, which in turn can be used for excluding certain copula families from model building. The excellent performance of the tests is demonstrated in a simulation study and by means of a real-data example.},

  abstract     = {Testing for homogeneity of two random vectors is a fundamental problem in statistics . In the past two decades, numerous efforts have been made to detect heterogeneity when the random vectors are multivariate or even high dimensional. Due to the “curse of dimensionality”, existing tests based on Euclidean distance may fail to capture the overall homogeneity in high-dimensional settings while can only capture the moment discrepancy. To address this issue, we propose a fully nonparametric test for homogeneity of two random vectors. Our method involves randomly selecting two subspaces consisting of components of the vectors, projecting the subspaces onto one-dimensional spaces, respectively, and constructing the test statistic using the Cramér–von Mises distance of the projections. To enhance the performance, we repeatedly implement this procedure to construct the final test statistic. Theoretically, if the replication time tends to infinity, we can avoid potential power loss caused by lousy directions. Owing to the U -statistic theory, the asymptotic null distribution of our proposed test is standard normal, regardless of the parent distributions of the random samples and the relationship between data dimensions and sample sizes. As a result, no re-sampling procedure is needed to determine critical values. The empirical size and power of the proposed test are demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

The rates are stated in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the estimation problem, which is, roughly speaking, the dimension of the smallest subspace that contains the true coefficient. Previously, convex regularized tensor regression has been studied with a least squares loss , Gaussian tensorial predictors and Gaussian errors, with rates that depend on the Gaussian width of a convex set. Our results extend the previous work to nonsmooth quantile loss. To deal with the non-Gaussian setting, we use the concept of Rademacher complexity with appropriate concentration inequalities instead of the Gaussian width. For the multi-linear nuclear norm penalty, our Orlicz norm bound for the operator norm of a random matrix may be of independent interest. We validate the theoretical guarantees in numerical experiments. We also demonstrate advantage of quantile regression over mean regression, and compare the performance of convex regularization method and nonconvex decomposition method in solving quantile tensor regression problem in simulation studies.},

  abstract     = {The maximum depth estimator (aka depth median) ( β R D ∗ βRD∗ ) induced from regression depth (RD) of Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999) is one of the most prevailing estimators in regression. It possesses outstanding robustness similar to the univariate location counterpart. Indeed, β R D ∗ βRD∗ can, asymptotically, resist up to 33% contamination without breakdown, in contrast to the 0% for the traditional (least squares and least absolute deviations) estimators (see Van Aelst and Rousseeuw (2000)). The results from Van Aelst and Rousseeuw (2000) are pioneering, yet they are limited to regression-symmetric populations (with a strictly positive density), the ϵ ϵ -contamination, maximum-bias model, and in asymptotical sense. With a fixed finite-sample size practice, the most prevailing measure of robustness for estimators is the finite-sample breakdown point (FSBP) (Donoho and Huber, 1983). Despite many attempts made in the literature, only sporadic partial results on FSBP for β R D ∗ βRD∗ were obtained whereas an exact FSBP for β R D ∗ βRD∗ remained open in the last twenty-plus years. Furthermore, is the asymptotic breakdown value 1 / 3 1/3 (the limit of an increasing sequence of finite-sample breakdown values) relevant in the finite-sample practice? (Or what is the difference between the finite-sample and the limit breakdown values?). Such discussions are yet to be given in the literature. This article addresses the above issues, revealing an intrinsic connection between the regression depth of β R D ∗ βRD∗ and the newly obtained exact FSBP. It justifies the employment of β R D ∗ βRD∗ as a robust alternative to the traditional estimators and demonstrates the necessity and the merit of using the FSBP in finite-sample real practice.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with testing conditional independence under a factor model setting. We propose a novel multivariate test for non-Gaussian data based on the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Theoretically, we investigate the convergence of our test statistic under both the null and the alternative hypotheses, and devise a bootstrap scheme to approximate its null distribution, showing that its consistency is justified. Methodologically, we generalize the HSIC-based independence test approach to a situation where data follow a factor model structure. Our test requires no nonparametric smoothing estimation of functional forms including conditional probability density functions , conditional cumulative distribution functions and conditional characteristic functions under the null or alternative, is computationally efficient and is dimension-free in the sense that the dimension of the conditioning variable is allowed to be large but finite. Further extension to nonlinear, non-Gaussian structure equation models is also described in detail and asymptotic properties are rigorously justified. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed test relative to that of several existing tests.},

  abstract     = {Standard high-dimensional factor models assume that the comovements in a large set of variables could be modeled using a small number of latent factors that affect all variables. In many relevant applications in economics and finance, heterogeneous comovements specific to some known groups of variables naturally arise, and reflect distinct cyclical movements within those groups. This paper develops two new statistical tests that can be used to investigate whether there is evidence supporting group-specific heterogeneity in the data. The paper also proposes and proves the validity of a permutation approach for approximating the asymptotic distributions of the two test statistics.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, we tackle the problem of testing H 0 q : λ q &gt; λ q + 1 = ⋯ = λ p H0q:λq&amp;gt;λq+1=⋯=λp , where λ 1 , … , λ p λ1,…,λp are the scatter matrix eigenvalues of an elliptical distribution on R p Rp . This is a classical problem in multivariate analysis which is very useful in dimension reduction. We analyse the problem using the Le Cam asymptotic theory of experiments and show that contrary to the testing problems on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a scatter matrix tackled in Hallin et al. (2010), the non-specification of nuisance parameters has an asymptotic cost for testing H 0 q H0q . We moreover derive signed-rank tests for the problem that enjoy the property of being asymptotically distribution-free under ellipticity. The van der Waerden rank test uniformly dominates the classical pseudo-Gaussian procedure for the problem. Numerical illustrations show the nice finite-sample properties of our tests.},
