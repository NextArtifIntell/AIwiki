  abstract     = {The future green hydrogen economy requires reliable and affordable composite pressure vessels. These vessels are expensive to manufacture, for a large part due to the high cost of carbon fibers in the composite layup. This study minimizes the thickness (and cost) of a composite pressure vessel layup without a reduction of its reliability. The study applies a multiphysics and multiscale uncertainty quantification framework that predicts the nondeterministic vessel burst pressure. A thermomechanical curing simulation accounts for cure-induced stress. It shows a good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. A previously validated nondeterministic mechanical burst simulation accounts for experimentally measured spatial material variability of fiber misalignment, fiber volume fraction, and fiber strength. The workflow is coupled with a global optimization strategy that minimizes the layup thickness and retains the same 1% probability of failure pressure as a baseline pressure vessel. The optimization varies the number of layers in the layup, and their winding angle. A 27.3% thickness reduction is achieved.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel decoupled framework for reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) that aims to find optimal material configurations while meeting local stiffness and strength constraints. To effectively address the nonlinear displacement and stress reliability constraints, the proposed framework replaces the conventional first-order reliability method (FORM) with the more accurate Local Radial Point Interpolation Method (LRPIM). This substitution overcomes the limitations of FORM in approximating high-dimensional nonlinear problems. The framework includes the qp-relaxation criterion and a global stress aggregation technique to avoid stress singularities. For multi-constrained optimization, the adjoint vector method is used for design sensitivity analysis, followed by a gradient-based algorithm to solve the structural optimization problem. Numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RBTO methodology, demonstrating its superiority in both accuracy and reliability compared to the Sequential Optimization and Reliability Assessment (SORA) method. The comparative analysis highlights the efficiency and precision of the proposed method across different reliability approaches, making it a robust tool for addressing complex engineering challenges.},

  abstract     = {In many applications, domains of interest are geometrically complex containing numerous small features. These features are typically removed in a manual process to facilitate a conventional element-based meshing process. This manual defeaturing process is dependent upon the goals of the simulation and typically involves subjective heuristics. To provide a flexible and easily adaptable discretization process of the governing equations that is independent of the domain discretization, an element-free Galerkin method is proposed in which a fine-scale triangulation is used to first discretize the fully featured domain, but then a coarse-scale element-free discretization is used to approximate the solution of the governing equations. The fine-scale triangulation can be of poor quality and extremely refined since it is not used directly to approximate the solution of the governing equations. The coarse-scale element-free basis has local support and can be adapted through refinement or coarsening without the need to alter the fine-scale triangulation or other geometric considerations. The element-free basis functions are constructed using a conventional moving-least-squares procedure, but the initial weight functions are constructed using manifold geodesics for general applicability to non-convex domains. The weak form of the governing equations is integrated using a secondary coarse-scale element-free basis and a gradient projection technique. The projected-gradient methodology ensures the necessary consistency properties to pass the patch test and obtain optimal rates of convergence. The overall method is termed quasi-meshfree since both meshfree and mesh-based concepts are used. Several verification problems and nonlinear application examples are presented to demonstrate the overall method.},

We exploit the method’s capability of training and testing on different mesh sizes in an autoencoder-based reduction strategy for parameterised partial differential equations. We show that this extension comes with provable guarantees on the performance via error bounds. The capabilities of the proposed methodology are tested on three challenging benchmarks, including advection-dominated phenomena and problems with a high-dimensional parameter space.

  abstract     = {In the present study, a new exploration of the mesoscopic structure is proposed for the nonlocal macro‑meso-scale consistent damage (NMMD) model, and the definition from mesoscopic damage to macroscopic damage in the original NMMD model is expanded. In the proposed model, material points are divided into two types: macroscopic and mesoscopic. For each macroscopic material point, there are mesoscopic material points within its influence domain, and every two different mesoscopic material points form a material point pair. The macroscopic damage at a macroscopic material point is also evaluated as the weighted average of mesoscale damage over material point pairs in the influence domain. However, compared with the original NMMD model, the mesoscale damage of material point pairs is determined by the motion of mesoscopic material points, rather than macroscopic material points. The macroscopic material points in the proposed model only represent the nonlocal effect and the macroscopic damage. Moreover, the shape of the influence domain and the arrangement of material point pairs are arbitrary and not fixed, i.e., the unified mesoscopic structure is abstract. To verify the proposed model, a specific mesoscopic structure is generated for quasi-brittle materials without considering the randomness of material properties. In this mesoscopic structure, the shape of the influence domain is a circle, and the mesoscopic material points are generated by the tangent sphere method. The numerical results indicate that the proposed model can accurately capture the crack patterns of quasi-brittle materials and exhibits excellent numerical robustness. Meanwhile, through a mode-I failure example, it is demonstrated that the computational efficiency of the proposed model is not lower than the original NMMD model. More importantly, the framework of mesoscopic structure modeling provides a new feasible approach for the extension of other models, e.g., virtual internal bond model and peridynamics. The urgent work within the NMMD model framework is to extend the proposed model to anisotropic, composite materials and dynamic crack simulation of large structures in the future.},

  abstract     = {PLoM (Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds) is a method introduced in 2016 for handling small training datasets by projecting an Itô equation from a stochastic dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical system, acting as the MCMC generator, for which the KDE-estimated probability measure with the training dataset is the invariant measure. PLoM performs a projection on a reduced-order vector basis related to the training dataset, using the diffusion maps (DMAPS) basis constructed with a time-independent isotropic kernel. In this paper, we propose a new ISDE projection vector basis built from a transient anisotropic kernel, providing an alternative to the DMAPS basis to improve statistical surrogates for stochastic manifolds with heterogeneous data. The construction ensures that for times near the initial time, the DMAPS basis coincides with the transient basis. For larger times, the differences between the two bases are characterized by the angle of their spanned vector subspaces. The optimal instant yielding the optimal transient basis is determined using an estimation of mutual information from Information Theory, which is normalized by the entropy estimation to account for the effects of the number of realizations used in the estimations. Consequently, this new vector basis better represents statistical dependencies in the learned probability measure for any dimension. Three applications with varying levels of statistical complexity and data heterogeneity validate the proposed theory, showing that the transient anisotropic kernel improves the learned probability measure.},

  abstract     = {Decomposition algorithms and surrogate model methods are frequently employed to address large-scale, intricate optimization challenges. However, the iterative resolution phase inherent to decomposition algorithms can potentially alter the background vector, leading to the repetitive evaluation of samples across disparate iteration cycles. This phenomenon significantly diminishes the computational efficiency of optimization. Accordingly, a novel approach, designated the Sample Point Transformation Algorithm (SPTA), is put forth in this paper as a means of enhancing efficiency through a process of mathematical deduction. The mathematical deduction reveals that the difference between sample points in each iteration loop is a simple function related to the inter-group dependent variables. Consequently, the SPTA method achieves the comprehensive transformation of the sample set by establishing a surrogate model of the difference between the sample sets of two cycles with a limited number of sample points, as opposed to conducting a substantial number of repeated samplings. This SPTA is employed to substitute the most time-consuming step of direct calculation in the classical optimization process. To validate the calculation efficiency, a series of numerical examples were conducted, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 75 % while maintaining optimal accuracy. This illustrates the advantage of the SPTA in addressing large-scale and complex optimization problems.},

By extending classical convex analysis and convex programming to discrete point-set functions, the discrete convex analysis and discrete steepest descent (DSD) algorithm are introduced. To overcome combinatorial complexity of the DSD algorithm, we employ the sequential approximate integer programming (SAIP) to explicitly and linearly approximate the implicit objective and constraint functions. Considering the multiple potential changed directions for multi-valued design variables, the random discrete steepest descent (RDSD) algorithm is proposed, where a random strategy is implemented to select a definitive direction of change. To analytically calculate multi-material discrete variable sensitivities, topological derivatives with material contrast is applied. In all, the MVIP is finally transferred as the linear 0–1 programming that can be efficiently solved by the canonical relaxation algorithm (CRA). Explicit nonlinear examples demonstrate that the RDSD algorithm owns nearly three orders of magnitude improvement compared with the commercial software (GUROBI). The proposed approach, without using any continuous variable relaxation and interpolation penalization schemes, successfully solves the minimum compliance problem, strength-related problem, and frequency-related optimization problems. Given the algorithm efficiency, mathematical generality and merits over other algorithms, the proposed RDSD algorithm is meaningful for other structural and topology optimization problems involving multi-valued discrete design variables.},

  abstract     = {Fractional and tempered fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) are effective models of long-range interactions, anomalous diffusion, and non-local effects. Traditional numerical methods for these problems are mesh-based, thus struggling with the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution due to their universal approximation, generalization ability, and mesh-free training. In principle, Monte Carlo fractional PINN (MC-fPINN) estimates fractional derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and thus could lift CoD. However, this may cause significant variance and errors, hence affecting convergence; in addition, MC-fPINN is sensitive to hyperparameters. In general, numerical methods and specifically PINNs for tempered fractional PDEs are under-developed. Herein, we extend MC-fPINN to tempered fractional PDEs to address these issues, resulting in the Monte Carlo tempered fractional PINN (MC-tfPINN). To reduce possible high variance and errors from Monte Carlo sampling, we replace the one-dimensional (1D) Monte Carlo with 1D Gaussian quadrature, applicable to both MC-fPINN and MC-tfPINN. We validate our methods on various forward and inverse problems of fractional and tempered fractional PDEs, scaling up to 100,000 dimensions. Our improved MC-fPINN/MC-tfPINN using quadrature consistently outperforms the original versions in accuracy and convergence speed in very high dimensions.

  abstract     = {We propose an ensemble score filter (EnSF) for solving high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems with superior accuracy. A major drawback of existing filtering methods, e.g., particle filters or ensemble Kalman filters, is the low accuracy in handling high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems. EnSF addresses this challenge by exploiting the score-based diffusion model, defined in a pseudo-temporal domain, to characterize the evolution of the filtering density. EnSF stores the information of the recursively updated filtering density function in the score function, instead of storing the information in a set of finite Monte Carlo samples (used in particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters). Unlike existing diffusion models that train neural networks to approximate the score function, we develop a training-free score estimation method that uses a mini-batch-based Monte Carlo estimator to directly approximate the score function at any pseudo-spatial–temporal location, which provides sufficient accuracy in solving high-dimensional nonlinear problems while also saving a tremendous amount of time spent on training neural networks. High-dimensional Lorenz-96 systems are used to demonstrate the performance of our method. EnSF provides superior performance, compared with the state-of-the-art Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter, in reliably and efficiently tracking extremely high-dimensional Lorenz systems (up to 1,000,000 dimensions) with highly nonlinear observation processes.},

Particles are modeled using a polyhedral representation with arbitrary shapes, and contact behavior is governed by an energy-conserving contact model based on contact volumes. The efficacy of the machine learning-enabled 3D DEM is evaluated through comparative analyses of computational time and simulation results across individual contact as well as whole DEM simulations against those obtained from the conventional DEM. The findings indicate that the machine learning-enabled approach adeptly identifies and resolves contacts among 3D irregular-shaped particles while accurately reproducing the mechanical characteristics of densely contacting particle assemblies. The computational issues and challenges associated with the machine learning-enabled DEM are also discussed.

  abstract     = {The accuracy of finite element solutions is closely tied to the mesh quality. In particular, geometrically nonlinear problems involving large and strongly localized deformations often result in prohibitively large element distortions. In this work, we propose a novel mesh regularization approach allowing to restore a non-distorted high-quality mesh in an adaptive manner without the need for expensive re-meshing procedures. The core idea of this approach lies in the definition of a finite element distortion potential considering contributions from different distortion modes such as skewness and aspect ratio of the elements. The regularized mesh is found by minimization of this potential. Moreover, based on the concept of spatial localization functions, the method allows to specify tailored requirements on mesh resolution and quality for regions with strongly localized mechanical deformation and mesh distortion. In addition, while existing mesh regularization schemes often keep the boundary nodes of the discretization fixed, we propose a mesh-sliding algorithm based on variationally consistent mortar methods allowing for an unrestricted tangential motion of nodes along the problem boundary. Especially for problems involving significant surface deformation (e.g., frictional contact), this approach allows for an improved mesh relaxation as compared to schemes with fixed boundary nodes. To transfer data such as tensor-valued history variables of the material model from the old (distorted) to the new (regularized) mesh, a structure-preserving invariant interpolation scheme for second-order tensors is employed, which has been proposed in our previous work and is designed to preserve important properties of tensor-valued data such as objectivity and positive definiteness. As a practically relevant application scenario, we consider the thermo-mechanical expansion of materials such as foams involving extreme volume changes by up to two orders of magnitude along with large and strongly localized strains as well as thermo-mechanical contact interaction. For this scenario, it is demonstrated that the proposed regularization approach preserves a high mesh quality at small computational costs. In contrast, simulations without mesh adaption are shown to lead to significant mesh distortion, deteriorating result quality, and, eventually, to non-convergence of the numerical solution scheme.},

Inspired by AI-generated content, this paper proposes a novel inverse design framework for energy-absorbing metamaterial using diffusion model called DiffMat, which can be customized to generate microstructures given desired stress–strain curves. DiffMat learns the conditional distribution of microstructure given mechanical properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from properties to geometries. Numerical simulations and experimental validations demonstrate the capability of DiffMat to generate a diverse array of microstructures based on given mechanical properties. This indicates the validity and high accuracy of DiffMat in generating metamaterials that meet the desired mechanical properties. The successful demonstration of the proposed inverse design framework highlights its potential to revolutionize the development of energy-absorbing metamaterials and underscores the broader impact of integrating AI-inspired methodologies into metamaterial design and engineering.},

In this paper, a new dynamic topology optimization method for structures with frequency-dependent material properties is proposed to achieve the vibration reduction design in the prescribed frequency forbidden band. First, a dynamic topology optimization model is established for the problem studied in this paper. This model integrates the solution method for frequency-dependent problem, dynamic isolated structures elimination method and the formulation of prescribed frequency forbidden band constraints, which are based on the research results previously developed by the authors. Additionally, different interpolation schemes are used for different number of material designs. The above optimization model is intended to consider nonlinear terms and design several frequency-dependent structures with prescribed frequency forbidden bands that are more in line with practical engineering problems, so that they can accurately avoid the operating frequency range, thus improving the service life of engineering equipment. Finally, to address common numerical problems, the &quot;bound formulation&quot; and &quot;robust formulation&quot; are employed, enhancing the applicability and robustness of the method for the application in topology optimization. The effectiveness of the developed method is supported by two types optimization problems, including single-material and bi-material examples. The cross-check results reveal that when considering frequency-dependent terms, the design results are better and closer to the practical engineering problem compared to linear structures.},

In this work, we explore the application of peridynamics (PD) in the optimization of structures against brittle fracture. A fracture resistance topology optimization scheme under the PD-based analysis framework is proposed, where two fracture-based strategies are adopted to improve the structural fracture behavior. The first one sets the conventional fracture energy as a constraint. While the second constraint is the bond stretch established on the unique concept “bond” of the PD framework, which smoothly transfers the energy-based fracture resistance control to an intuitive and mathematically tractable geometric expression. The topology optimization is carried out under the SIMP framework, where densities are assigned to the bonds via material points to represent the topology changes and crack generation. Numerical examples and experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategies can guarantee the safety of the optimized structure against the occurrence of fracture failure.},

  abstract     = {Simulating the flow of two fluid phases in porous media is a challenging task, especially when fractures are included in the simulation. Fractures may have highly heterogeneous properties compared to the surrounding rock matrix, significantly affecting fluid flow, and at the same time hydraulic apertures that are much smaller than any other characteristic sizes in the domain. Generally, flow simulators face difficulties with counter-current flow, generated by gravity and pressure gradients, which hinders the convergence of non-linear solvers (Newton). In this work, we model the fracture geometry with a mixed-dimensional discrete fracture network, thus lightening the computational burden associated to an equi-dimensional representation. We address the issue of counter-current flows with appropriate spatial discretization of the advective fluid fluxes, with the aim of improving the convergence speed of the non-linear solver. In particular, the extension of the hybrid upwinding to the mixed-dimensional framework, with the use of a phase potential upstreaming at the interfaces of subdomains. We test the method across several cases with different flow regimes and fracture network geometries. Results show robustness of the chosen discretization and a consistent improvements, in terms of Newton iterations, compared to using phase potential upstreaming everywhere.},

  abstract     = {Computational methods, such as finite elements, are indispensable for modeling the mechanical compliance of elastic solids. However, as the size and geometric complexity of the domain increases, the cost of simulations becomes prohibitive. One example is the microstructure of a porous material, such as a piece of rock or bone sample, captured by an X-ray μ CT image. The solid geometry consists of numerous grains, cavities, and/or channels, with the domain large enough to allow inferring statistically converged macroscale properties. The pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) was recently proposed by the authors to reduce the associated computational cost through a divide-and-conquer strategy. The domain is decomposed into subdomains via watershed segmentation, and local basis and correction functions are built numerically, then assembled to obtain an approximate solution. However, PLMM is limited to domains corresponding to microscale porous media, incurs large errors when modeling loading conditions that generate significant bending/twisting moments locally, and it is equipped with only one mechanism to control approximation errors during a simulation. Here, we generalize PLMM into a high-order variant, called hPLMM, that removes these drawbacks. In hPLMM, appropriate mortar spaces are defined at subdomain interfaces that allow improving the boundary conditions used to solve local problems on the subdomains, thus the accuracy of the approximation. Moreover, errors can be reduced by a second mechanism wherein an upfront cost is paid prior to a simulation, useful if basis functions can be reused many times, e.g., across loading steps. Finally, the method applies not just to pore-scale, but also Darcy-scale and non-porous domains. We validate hPLMM against a range of complex 2D/3D geometries and discuss its convergence and algorithmic complexity. Implications for modeling failure and nonlinear problems are discussed.},

The novel ideas include a proposition of a phase field coupled multi-invariants dependent yield function by including the Hosford equivalent stress in the Drucker–Prager yield function in order to accurately predict the ductile response of the material prior to initiation of the failure and the postulation of the threshold energy in the phase field evolution equation defining a measure of the ductility of materials. The measure of ductility is reported in the form of damage initiation surface in terms of threshold plastic energy as a function of stress triaxiality and normalized Lode angle parameters using the Mohr–Coulomb fracture initiation criterion. The model parameters are calibrated based on the available experimental results in the literature considering the stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameters dependent responses of different specimens. The crack initiation and propagation paths predicted by the proposed model under the different states of stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameters, such as axisymmetric tension, plane strain condition, and axisymmetric compression, match with those predicted experimentally in the literature.},

When dealing with high dimensional problems, by LOOCV, the calculation of RBF matrix between candidate points and the training points, and the prediction of the sub-models at candidate points will be very time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a matrix-operation method for RBF matrix calculation and a matrix-operation method for sub-model prediction. Such a matrix-operation RBF model significantly reduces the computation time of LOOCV and makes active learning mechanism possible. On this basis, we propose a novel learning function according to the prediction information of RBF model. In addition, the error-monitor mechanism is introduced to timely terminate the learning process.

  abstract     = {The assessment of masonry constructions and, in general, of only-compression structures requires accurate modelling of stress patterns activated by external loads and boundary settlements. To this aim, previous research introduced the continuous Airy-based stress singularities (CASS) method, a convex optimisation strategy that selects the solution of the boundary value problem in the space of admissible Airy-based stress states. In this sense, the stress tensor solution is evaluated as the curvature of the Airy stress potential. However, the CASS application range was limited to only rectangular elements. This paper reformulates the CASS method to analyse domains with curved geometries, thus enabling the modelling of curved structures largely present in architectural heritage. Specifically, a novel approach to evaluating curvature in non-rectangular finite elements is introduced. Several benchmarks are proposed to validate the novel computational approach. First, the numerical strategy is validated against analytical solutions on a masonry panel subjected to lateral loads. In particular, the method’s accuracy is assessed by comparing the regular and irregular finite elements. After that, the method is benchmarked on a semicircular arch against well-known solutions represented by the minimum and maximum thrust conditions and the minimum thickness problem. Finally, its robustness and potential are showcased in a real case study represented by the church of Santa Maria Immacolatella della Pietà dei Turchini in Naples, Italy.},

Instead, one may only have information about the PDF of the maximum or minimum values of such processes for given sample length(s) or duration(s). This paper leverages a relationship between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) describing maximum/minimum values of a random process and the length or duration of the sample, in order to provide an estimate of the maximum/minimum value CDF of the process associated with one given length/duration, based solely on the data associated with other sample lengths/durations. This way, detailed information about the underlying random process is not required. The results are verified using Monte Carlo simulation, and the approach is applied to data on fiber strength.},

  abstract     = {The critical time step in explicit time integration methods depends on the highest natural angular frequency of the discretized problem. For shear deformable beam, plate and shell formulations, efficiency is therefore typically limited by the highest transverse shear frequencies, which are mostly of minor importance for the structural response. Direct parametrization using transverse shear variables within hierarchic structural element formulations allows a selective scaling of transverse shear frequencies in a simple manner, while bending frequencies remain practically unaffected. In particular, the novel concept of intrinsically selective mass scaling (ISMS) results in an efficient method that features high accuracy and preserves both linear and angular momentum for both consistent and lumped mass matrices. In addition, ISMS preserves the diagonal structure of lumped mass matrices. Similar to the underlying intrinsically locking-free, hierarchic concept for shear deformable structural element formulations, ISMS retains its beneficial properties for any smooth discretization scheme. In this contribution, we extend recent research on ISMS for beam formulations to the case of shear deformable plate formulations. We test our novel concept with respect to accuracy and efficiency by means of selected numerical experiments. We study both frequency spectra and the transient behavior in explicit time integration. To demonstrate the generality of ISMS, exemplarily both isogeometric discretizations based on B-splines and meshfree discretizations using local maximum-entropy approximants are investigated.},

  abstract     = {The Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (CFish) is an innovative meta-heuristic approach that draws inspiration from the movements and behaviors of crayfish. CFish exhibits strong performance across many test sets and optimization issues, but it faces challenges with sluggish convergence, an uneven distribution between exploration and exploitation, and inadequate accuracy due to high-dimensional tasks. To tackle these concerns, this study presents an evolved version named QICFish, which integrates multiple sophisticated strategies to optimize performance. The CFish algorithm improves its population initialization by using the Halton sequence, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the exploration phase and an increase in population variety. Furthermore, the implementation of the adaptive quadratic interpolation approach enhances the algorithm&#39;s capacity to exploit its surroundings by eliminating individuals of worse quality and expediting the creation of solutions of superior quality. Furthermore, an adaptive mutation method is employed to improve the process of exploration and effectively locate more favorable areas inside the search space. Finally, the adaptive piecewise neighborhood strategy, enhances the pace of convergence and maintains a balanced transition between exploration and exploitation. Then, QICFish outperforms other cutting-edge algorithms across several dimensions of the CEC’17 and CEC’20 test sets, as shown by experimental comparisons. Furthermore, the efficacy and feasibility of the solution are confirmed by successfully addressing six intricate engineering problems and two truss topology optimization problems. The simulation findings demonstrate that QICFish exhibits robust competitive capabilities and shows great potential for engineering optimization challenges. Therefore, QICFish is a very efficient meta-heuristic approach for solving engineering optimization problems.},

This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method, including an iterative method “Iterative-QLS” that suppresses error in quantum linear solver, and a subspace method to scale the solution to a larger size. We implement our method on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than 0.2%, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimensional matrix.

  abstract     = {Since deformable granular materials with arbitrary morphologies constructed by different dilated non-spherical models in complex structures remain challenging for numerical simulations using the discrete element method (DEM), a unified Minkowski sum model was proposed for calculating collision forces and large deformations of arbitrarily shaped granular materials and structures. In this model, dilated superquadric equations, dilated spherical harmonic functions, and dilated polyhedrons were developed to construct arbitrarily shaped particles, and Fibonacci and automatic mesh simplification algorithms were established to determine the surface meshes of the particles with controlled accuracy. Subsequently, the Minkowski sum model based on chain-linked meshes and granular skeletons was proposed to calculate collision forces and large deformations of rigid and deformable granular materials. To investigate the conservation, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed model, six sets of numerical examples were conducted and compared with the theoretical and finite element results, which included the static analysis of a deformable granular skeleton, the mechanical analysis of a single deformable structure, a single deformable particle impacting a rigid wall, the collision between two rigid and deformable particles, the accumulation of multiple rigid particles on a deformable structure, and compression of multiple deformable particles within a deformable structure. The corresponding numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical and finite element results, which verifies that the present DEM model can accurately predict the large deformation characteristics of different dilated DEM models and can be extensively applied to the dynamic flows and deformation behaviors of arbitrarily shaped granular materials involving multiple DEM models in deformable structures.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud representations of three-dimensional objects have remained indispensable across a diverse array of applications, given their ability to represent complex real-world geometry with just a set of points. The high fidelity and versatility of point clouds have been utilized in directly performing numerical analysis for engineering applications, bypassing the labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks of creating analysis-suitable CAD models. However, point clouds exhibit various levels of quality, often containing defects such as holes, noise, and sparse regions, leading to sub-optimal geometry representation that can impact the stability and accuracy of any analysis study. This paper aims to overcome such challenges by proposing a novel method that expands upon our recently developed direct point cloud-to-CFD approach based on immersogeometric analysis. The proposed method features a mesh-driven resampling technique to fill any unintended gaps and regularize the point cloud, making it suitable for CFD analysis. Additionally, ghost penalty stabilization is employed for incompressible flow to improve the conditioning and stability compromised by the small cut elements in immersed methods. The developed method is validated against standard benchmark geometries and real-world point clouds obtained in-house with photogrammetry. Results demonstrate the proposed framework’s robustness in facilitating CFD simulations directly on point clouds of varying quality, underscoring its potential for practical applications in analyzing real-world structures.},

We determine the respective posterior probability density and parameters of the posited statistical model using variational Bayes. The non-Gaussian posterior is approximated by a Gaussian trial density with free variational parameters and the discrepancy between them is measured using the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. We employ the stochastic gradient method to compute the variational parameters and other statistical model parameters by minimising the KL divergence.

  abstract     = {Mixed finite element formulations enable the use of simple C 0 continuous interpolation functions and standard finite element meshes for the numerical solution of (nonlocal) gradient elasticity problems. Yet, so far they are faced with the challenge of being costly due to the introduction of additional mixed solution variables. Furthermore, stability is not always observed in numerical benchmark tests, often necessitating stabilization terms. Since existing formulations lack second gradients in the weak form, consistency of the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations with the surface flux equations of the original problem is not guaranteed, which does not always enable the application of arbitrary Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions of first and second order limiting practical applications. Therefore, in the present contribution a formulation is proposed, which is shown to be consistent for any kind of boundary conditions by adding suitable additional surface integrals. Furthermore, by incorporating the strains instead of the displacement gradient as a mixed variable and using simple interpolation functions that enable the condensation of the Lagrange multiplier, we arrive at an element that has less degrees of freedom than e.g. a standard P3 element for local elasticity. In numerical tests, it is shown that e.g. Hermite elements do not converge already in a simple benchmark problem, whereas the proposed formulation does not lack convergence, independent from the value of the length scale. In addition to that, the proposed element is shown to lead to a significantly reduced computing time compared to competitive formulations while maintaining advantageous convergence rates.},

Less obvious, the microscopic eddy currents also induce a dynamic macroscopic magnetization in accordance with Lenz’ law. Conventional homogenization theories based on volume averaging of the magnetic field strength disregard this effect and thus fail to properly predict the dynamic material response. In this work, the variationally consistent homogenization framework by Larsson et al. (2010), originally developed for transient heat conduction, is transferred to the aforementioned particulate composites, in order to properly reproduce this dynamic effect. It turns out that this approach predicts the macroscopic magnetization to be the volume averaged sum of the particles’ (conventional) magnetization and a non-standard dynamic magnetization due to microscopic eddy currents. Some first numerical examples illustrate the improved predictability of the variationally consistent homogenization method with respect to experimental complex permeability data. The resulting theory is shown to exhibit a two-scale incremental potential structure, which is exploited in several ways.},

Utilizing the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis functions, the material interpolation model defined at control points is described by the NURBS surface, which is incorporated into the optimization formulation for optimal structural and vibration control design. The sensitivity results are deduced in terms of the pseudo-densities and the corresponding weights at control points from both macro and micro perspectives of structural dynamics.

  abstract     = {Bayesian analysis enables combining prior knowledge with measurement data to learn model parameters. Commonly, one resorts to computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, when only a point estimate of the parameters is of interest. We apply MAP estimation in the context of structural dynamic models, where the system response can be described by the frequency response function. To alleviate high computational demands from repeated expensive model calls, we utilize a rational polynomial chaos expansion (RPCE) surrogate model that expresses the system frequency response as a rational of two polynomials with complex coefficients. We propose an extension to an existing sparse Bayesian learning approach for RPCE based on Laplace’s approximation for the posterior distribution of the denominator coefficients. Furthermore, we introduce a Bayesian optimization approach, which allows to adaptively enrich the experimental design throughout the optimization process of MAP estimation. Thereby, we utilize the expected improvement acquisition function as a means to identify sample points in the input space that are possibly associated with large objective function values. The acquisition function is estimated through Monte Carlo sampling based on the posterior distribution of the expansion coefficients identified in the sparse Bayesian learning process. By combining the sparsity-inducing learning procedure with the sequential experimental design, we effectively reduce the number of model evaluations in the MAP estimation problem. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented methods on the parameter updating problem of an algebraic two-degree-of-freedom system and the finite element model of a cross-laminated timber plate.},

Firstly, the bond-scale constitutive formulations are enriched by incorporating the effect of shear and lateral deformations. In that process, we tackle successfully the persistent theoretical issue on the limitation of Poisson’s ratio, which appears in the form of negative shear stiffness in most bond/spring-based methods. Secondly, the property of flexible placement of quasi-bonds is found and the binding relationship between bonds and material particles is thus removed. Additionally, a quasi-bond operator is proposed to transform the Laplace operator into an integral form, thereby extending the applicability of the quasi-bond method to various physical problems. These new developments facilitate discretizing an elementary solid region into a limit number of quasi-bonds, and avoiding the use of complex material models such as anisotropic damage ones, which paves a new way to elucidate and simulate complex dissipation problems in solid materials and structures. At this stage, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are assessed through typical continuous/discontinuous problems.},

However, several computational issues have hindered their utilisation in engineering practice, such as the convergence challenge in implicit algorithms, numerical stability issues in explicit methods and significant computational costs. Aiming to providing a more efficient numerical algorithm, this work integrates the explicit integral operator with the recently developed neighbored element method, for the first time, to solve the coupled governing equations in phase field models. In addition, the damage irreversibility can be ensured automatically, avoiding the need to introduce extra history variable for the maximum driving force in traditional algorithms. Six representative fracture benchmarks with different failure modes are simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, including the multiple cracks in heterogeneous concrete at mesoscale. It is found that this semi-explicit numerical algorithm yields consistent crack profiles and load capacities for all examples to the available experimental data and literature. In particular, the computational cost is significantly reduced when compared to the traditional explicit modelling. Therefore, the presented numerical algorithm is highly attractive and promising for phase-field simulations of complicated 3D solid fractures in structural-level engineering practices.},

  abstract     = {We present a divergence-free and H d i v Hdiv -conforming hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method and a computationally efficient variant called embedded-HDG (E-HDG) for solving stationary incompressible viso-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The proposed E-HDG approach uses continuous facet unknowns for the vector-valued solutions (velocity and magnetic fields) while it uses discontinuous facet unknowns for the scalar variable (pressure and magnetic pressure). This choice of function spaces makes E-HDG computationally far more advantageous, due to the much smaller number of degrees of freedom, compared to the HDG counterpart. The benefit is even more significant for three-dimensional/high-order/fine mesh scenarios. On simplicial meshes, the proposed methods with a specific choice of approximation spaces are well-posed for linear(ized) MHD equations. For nonlinear MHD problems, we present a simple approach exploiting the proposed linear discretizations by using a Picard iteration. The beauty of this approach is that the divergence-free and H d i v Hdiv -conforming properties of the velocity and magnetic fields are automatically carried over for nonlinear MHD equations. We study the accuracy and convergence of our E-HDG method for both linear and nonlinear MHD cases through various numerical experiments, including two- and three-dimensional problems with smooth and singular solutions. The numerical examples show that the proposed methods are pressure robust, and the divergence of the resulting velocity and magnetic fields is machine zero for both smooth and singular problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first application of a symmetric interior-penalty discontinuous Galerkin isogeometric analysis (SIP-DG-IGA) spatial discretization to the self-adjoint angular flux (SAAF) form of the multi-group neutron transport equation. The penalty parameters are determined, for general element types, from a mathematically rigorous coercivity analysis of the bilinear form. The proposed scheme produces a compact spatial discretization stencil. It also yields symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices, which can be efficiently solved using pre-conditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solution algorithms. The proposed discretization scheme is verified using the method of manufactured solutions (MMS) and several nuclear reactor physics benchmark verification test cases. For sufficiently smooth elliptic problems, the proposed spatial discretization can exploit higher-order continuity, or k -refinement, of the NURBS basis to consistently yield greater numerical accuracy per degree of freedom (DoF) than standard h -refinement. Since this is a discontinuous scheme, it can also accurately model significant changes in the neutron scalar flux that may occur near the material interfaces of heterogeneous problems.},

It reveals the difficulty of guaranteeing the existence of stable flux points for an arbitrary order of accuracy. To obtain a numerical method stable for any order of accuracy and any space dimension, the present article introduces a new correction term of the flux approximation to cancel the numerical error caused by the Riemann solver exactly. This modification enables the introduction of a new family of so-called Corrected Raviart–Thomas Spectral Difference stable for any polynomial order of approximation. Stability estimates are provided for the L 2 norm and a weighted broken Sobolev norm. Numerical experiments in 2 D and 3 D are conducted for solving linear and non-linear hyperbolic equations with a polynomial order up to p = 8 for triangular elements and up to p = 5 for tetrahedral elements. They confirm the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the newly introduced numerical scheme. The new method is shown to have a computational cost similar to the Raviart–Thomas Spectral Difference with – for a given mesh – a higher accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first method to enable friction in the Third Medium Contact (TMC) method. TMC embeds a solid in a highly compliant medium, which becomes infinitely stiff under ultimate compression, thus allowing forces to be transferred between the solids when the medium between the solids is compressed. This approach is increasingly adopted for integrating internal contact in structural design processes, owing to its continuous, fully implicit characteristics, simplicity, and its stability when applying regularisation to the third medium regions. The lack of friction has previously restricted the use of the TMC method in simulating real-world contact conditions. Here, we address this issue by (1) integrating an anisotropic term into a Neo-Hookean material model to provide shear resistance, and (2) employing a framework inspired by crystal plasticity that includes a yield criterion specifically designed to replicate the effects of Coulomb friction. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through two examples: (1) a smooth sliding contact problem and (2) a non-smooth C-shaped structure. Results demonstrate a close agreement with reference solutions obtained by a conventional Lagrange multiplier approach. While the method, for now, requires user-defined slip directions, it represents a significant advancement by enabling the integration of friction into TMC, thereby broadening its applicability to problems involving realistic frictional contact. Future research should focus on restoring the fully implicit nature of TMC in the presence of friction, and on developing automated slip direction definitions to enhance usability and expand the method’s versatility.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an innovative optimization algorithm called the Exponential-Trigonometric Optimization (ETO) algorithm, which is based on a sophisticated combination of exponential and trigonometric functions. The ETO algorithm is structured to strike a balance between two important stages: exploration and exploitation, a challenge that many other optimization algorithms have also sought to address. ETO incorporates several additional random and adaptive variables, resulting in better performance compared to existing algorithms. The algorithm&#39;s performance and potential were validated through three phases of testing. First, the ETO algorithm is evaluated against seven other meta-heuristic algorithms, including SCHO, SCA, AOA, GWO, HHO, HGS, and GJO, using 23 classical benchmark functions of varying sizes. These benchmark functions are categorized into three main groups: &quot;unimodal&quot; (F1 to F7), &quot;multi-modal&quot; (F8 to F13), and &quot;fixed-dimension&quot; (F14 to F23). Next, the ETO algorithm was tested on CEC2019 and CEC2020 functions and compared with 7 algorithms mentioned above to evaluate performance. In addition, the ETO algorithm is tested on the CEC2017 benchmark functions with dimensions of 10-D, 30-D, and 50-D. It is then compared and evaluated against other potential algorithms, such as SHADE, LSHADE, and JADE, using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, the ETO algorithm is utilized to tackle five intricate engineering problems to show its robustness, including optimizing the shape of aircraft wings to increase lift. These results have demonstrated the effectiveness and potential of the ETO algorithm, yielding outstanding results and ranking first among other algorithms. Notably, the optimization of the improved aircraft wing increased the lift force from 0.797055 to 0.951817, signaling promising prospects for advancing optimization problems in the future.

In this method, the MLS is employed to select effective samples for establishing the Kriging model while reducing the influence of samples outside the compact support region. The MPA finds optimal hyperparameters for constructing a high-precision Kriging model. The vectorial surrogate modeling method synchronously models multiple functions to ensure synergy and reduce modeling time. The hybrid collaborative sampling technique improves sampling efficiency and availability for synchronous sampling of multi-response. Moreover, the availability of the proposed MK-VSMM is validated through a numerical case (multi-response nonlinear function approximation and reliability analysis) and an engineering case (reliability evaluation of aeroengine turbine blisk considering multiple failure modes). By comparing with alternative methods, it is demonstrated that the developed MK-VSMM exhibits exceptional modeling and simulation performance.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new Gradient Enhanced Gaussian Predictor (Kriging) constitutive metamodel based on the use of principal stretches for hyperelasticity. The model further accounts for anisotropy by incorporating suitable invariants of the relevant symmetry integrity basis. The use of stretches is beneficial since it aligns to experimental practices for data gathering, removes the challenge associated with stress projections in isotropy, and increases the range of available constitutive models. This paper presents three significant novelties. The first arises from the proposed approach highlighting the need to enforce physical symmetries and resulted in the authors altering the standard Radial Basis style correlation function to incorporate invariants which naturally uphold these symmetries. The invariants used are both the commonly employed invariants of the right Cauchy–Green strain tensor and the lesser used invariants of the stretch tensor. Note that one may consider using invariants in the correlation function to be the same as using invariants for inputs to the metamodel and this would be true if Ordinary Kriging was used. But the derivatives used in the chain rule clearly result in a new formulation. Secondly, the authors compare two approaches to the infill strategies, one consisting of the error in stress and the other utilising uncertainty provided by Kriging directly. This enables Kriging to guide the user as to most efficient data to insert into the dataset. The final novelty involves the integration of calibrated constitutive metamodels into Finite Element simulations thereby showcasing the accuracy yielded even when handling highly complex deformations such as bending, wrinkling and pinching. Furthermore, the constitutive models are calibrated with data from both isotropic and anisotropic materials such as rank-one laminates, making the accuracy achieved with the small calibration sets even more impressive. The formulation is shown to perform equally well for both synthetic and experimental type of collected data.},

Immersed boundary methods involve embedding complex geometries within a background grid, which allows for great flexibility in modeling intricate shapes and features despite the simplicity of the approach. The IBCM method introduces additional layers conformal to the boundaries, allowing for the strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions and facilitating local refinement. In this study, the construction of boundary layers is combined with high-degree spline-based approximation spaces to further increase efficiency. The Nitsche method, employing non-symmetric average operators, is used to couple the boundary layers with the inner patch, while stabilizing the formulation with minimal penalty parameters. High-order quadrature rules are applied for integration over cut elements and patch interfaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed formulation, highlighting its potential for complex shell structures modeled through Kirchhoff–Love and Reissner–Mindlin theories.

Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear elasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov–Muskhelishvili representation of the solution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural network to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while automatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing the network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation functions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem guaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural networks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a new tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach, noteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem include a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the boundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of training points, and C ∞ regularity of the learned solution. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN approximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the possibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a domain-decomposition strategy.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs’ loss, the regularization terms, can only guarantee that the prediction results conform to the physical constraints in the average sense, which results in PINNs’ inability to strictly adhere to implied physical laws such as conservation laws and symmetries. This limits the optimization speed and accuracy of PINNs. Although some feature-enhanced PINNs attempt to address this issue by adding explicit constraints, their generality is limited due to specific question settings. To overcome this limitation, our study proposes the adaptive symmetry-recomposition PINN (AsPINN). By analyzing the parameter-sharing patterns of fully connected PINNs, specific network structures are developed to provide predictions with strict symmetry constraints. These structures are incorporated into diverse subnetworks to provide constrained intermediate outputs, then a specialized multi-head attention mechanism is attached to evaluate and composite them into final predictions adaptively. Thus, AsPINN maintains precise constraints while addressing the inability of individual structural subnetworks’ generality. This method is then applied to address several physically significant PDEs, including both forward and inverse problems. The numerical results demonstrates AsPINN’s mathematical consistency and generality, offering advantages in terms of optimization speed and accuracy with a reduced number of trainable parameters. The results also manifest that AsPINN mitigates the impact of ill-conditioned data.},

  abstract     = {Among several recently proposed data-driven Reduced Order Models (ROMs), the coupling of Proper Orthogonal Decompositions (POD) and deep learning-based ROMs (DL-ROMs) has proved to be a successful strategy to construct non-intrusive, highly accurate, surrogates for the real time solution of parametric nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process – that is, by making them physics-informed – to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem’s solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection–diffusion–reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier–Stokes equations for fluid flows.},

  abstract     = {The advent of quantum computers, operating on entirely different physical principles and abstractions from those of classical digital computers, sets forth a new computing paradigm that can potentially result in game-changing efficiencies and computational performance. Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of O ( ( log N ) c ) , compared to O ( N c ) in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible. We additionally provide theoretical proofs and numerical evidence confirming the anticipated O ( log N ) c complexity of the proposed solver.},

The framework of data assimilation traditionally uses data collected at sensor locations in order to bring corrections to a numerical model designed using knowledge of the physical system of interest. However, some applications do not have available data at all times, but only during an initial training phase. Hence, we suggest to combine data assimilation with statistical learning methods; namely, deep learning. More precisely, for time steps at which data is unavailable, a surrogate deep learning model runs predictions of the ‘true’ data which is then assimilated by the new model. In this paper, we also derive a priori error estimates on this statistical variational data assimilation (SVDA) approximation. Finally, we assess the method by numerical test cases.},

  abstract     = {Personalized cardiac mechanics modeling is a powerful tool for understanding the biomechanics of cardiac function in health and disease and assisting in treatment planning. However, current models are limited to using medical images acquired at a single cardiac phase, often limiting their applicability for processing dynamic image acquisitions. This study introduces an inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) framework to estimate the passive mechanical properties of cardiac tissue using time-dependent medical image data. The iFEA framework relies on a novel nested optimization scheme, in which the outer iterations utilize a traditional optimization method to best approximate material parameters that fit image data, while the inner iterations employ an augmented Sellier’s algorithm to estimate the stress-free reference configuration. With a focus on characterizing the passive mechanical behavior, the framework employs structurally-based anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive models and physiologically relevant boundary conditions to simulate myocardial mechanics. We use a stabilized variational multiscale formulation for solving the governing nonlinear elastodynamics equations, verified for cardiac mechanics applications. The framework is tested in myocardium models of biventricle and left atrium derived from cardiac phase-resolved computed tomographic (CT) images of a healthy subject and three patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The impact of the choice of optimization methods and other numerical settings, including fiber direction parameters, mesh size, initial parameters for optimization, and perturbations to optimal material parameters, is assessed using a rigorous sensitivity analysis. The performance of the current iFEA is compared against an assumed power-law-based pressure–volume relation, typically used for single-phase image acquisition.},

  abstract     = {In isogeometric analysis, isogeometric function spaces are employed for accurately representing the solution to a partial differential equation (PDE) on a parameterized domain. They are generated from a tensor-product spline space by composing the basis functions with the inverse of the parameterization. Depending on the geometry of the domain and on the data of the PDE, the solution might not have maximum Sobolev regularity, leading to a reduced convergence rate. In this case it is necessary to reduce the local mesh size close to the singularities. The classical approach is to perform adaptive h -refinement, which either leads to an unnecessarily large number of degrees of freedom or to a spline space that does not possess a tensor-product structure. Based on the concept of r -adaptivity we present a novel approach for finding a suitable isogeometric function space for a given PDE without sacrificing the tensor-product structure of the underlying spline space. In particular, we use the fact that different reparameterizations of the same computational domain lead to different isogeometric function spaces while preserving the geometry. Starting from a multi-patch domain consisting of bilinearly parameterized patches, we aim to find the biquadratic multi-patch parameterization that leads to the isogeometric function space with the smallest best approximation error of the solution. In order to estimate the location of the optimal control points, we employ a trained residual neural network that is applied to the graph surfaces of the approximated solution and its derivatives. In our experimental results, we observe that our new method results in a vast improvement of the approximation error for different PDE problems on multi-patch domains.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear optimization of the composite laminate possesses a prohibitive computational cost due to the frequent and time-consuming nonlinear analysis. To address this issue, the geometrically nonlinear analysis is completely surrogated by the attention-based Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model in this work. Specifically, the model maps its inputs, consisting of lamination parameters (LP) and the linear analysis results, into a sequence of deformation states in the equilibrium path, replacing the nonlinear analysis for various designs of a composite structure with different LP. To evaluate the strength failure of the structure with large deformation, the strength failure criterion is formulated in terms of nonlinear strains for the isogeometric continuum shell element. Whereafter, the failure load is maximized by globally searching the feasible domain of LP with the constrained genetic-algorithm optimizer. The efficiency and reliability of the proposed approach are validated by comparing the existing deep learning method in the numerical tests on two laminated shell structures. In the two tests, the absolute percentage errors of the failure load obtained from the Seq2Seq prediction are 2.77% and 0.96% respectively, and the time costs of performing the Seq2Seq-based optimization are merely 3.5% and 8.3% of the existing deep learning method. After the strength optimization process, the failure loads of the optimal laminates fulfill a nearly 1.5-time improvement in contrast to their quasi-isotropic cases.},

  abstract     = {Fluid–structure-interaction (FSI) phenomena are widely concerned in engineering practice and challenge current numerical methods. In this article, the finite element method is strongly coupled with the multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (MMALE) method to develop a monolithic FSI method named the immersed multi-material arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian finite element method (IALEFEM). By immersing the finite elements in the MMALE computational grid, the fluid–solid interface is directly tracked by the element boundary with accurate normal directions. The fluid–structure-interaction is implicitly implemented by assembling the nodal variables and updating the Lagrangian momentum equation on the MMALE grid. Combining the advantages of both MMALE and FEM with the immersed boundary method, the IALEFEM is effective for solving complicated FSI problems with multi-material fluid flow. A slip fluid–structure-interaction method is also proposed to enhance the computational accuracy in simulating FSI problems with significantly different velocity fields. The accuracy and effectiveness of the IALEFEM are verified and validated by several benchmark numerical examples including the shock-cylinder obstacle interaction, flexible panel deformation induced by shock wave, dam break problem with large structural deformation, water entry of a wedge, fragmentation of a cylinder shell induced by blast, response of elastic plate subjected to spherical near-field explosion and structural damage of open-frame building under blast loading.},

The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework’s ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schrödinger equation, and the Allen–Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.},

HBEM uses perturbation expansions up to order M of the free-surface and wavemaker motions, yielding, at each time step, a sequence of boundary-value problems (BVPs) for each perturbed velocity potential defined for a fixed domain for the problem. The BVPs are solved with a quadratic boundary-element method accelerated by a pre-Corrected Fast Fourier Transform (pFFT) scheme, which reduces the computational effort from O ( N 2 ∼ 3 ) to O ( N log N ) , where N is the number of collocation points used to discretize the boundary of the fluid domain. At each order, the BVPs require the calculation of successive higher-order normal derivatives. We obtain numerical accuracy and convergence with M by solving for the high-order derivatives through recursive use of Green’s third identity, while imposing C 1 continuity on the velocity potential at the intersection between the free-surface and wavemaker to suppress known weakly singular solutions. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of HBEM for a number of nonlinear example problems. These include the generation of monochromatic waves, third-order Peregrine soliton, 2D and 3D wave focusing. The (arbitrary) high-order capability, robustness and O ( N log N ) computational efficiency of HBEM render it a useful tool for simulation of broad classes of nonlinear wave-body interaction problems involving complex geometries.},

However, it is also numerically observed that such superconvergent quadrature rules may not consistently lead to the expected accuracy. The reason underlying this inconsistency is related to the failure of quadrature rules to meet the condition of variational integration consistency. Meanwhile, by means of the tensor product nature of isogeometric basis functions and quadrature rules, it is theoretically proved that in one- as well as multi-dimensional scenarios, the variational integration consistency of the isogeometric weak formulation necessitates the quadrature rules be exact through 2( p - m )th degree polynomials, where p is the complete degree of multi-dimensional basis functions or the degree of their correspondent one-dimensional basis functions, m is the order of differentiation in Galerkin weak form. A synchronous consistent superconvergent quadrature rule ensuring frequency superconvergence should simultaneously fulfill both the constraint of frequency error measure and the condition of variational integration consistency. Subsequently, the issues associated with certain quadrature rules that violate the variational integration consistency are examined for both second- and fourth-order problems, and the corresponding synchronous consistent quadrature rules are particularly elaborated.},

The focus lies in establishing the foundational kinematical links across scales and achieving seamless homogenisation of the traction vector through rigorous duality arguments. Two distinct families of contact homogenisation models are formulated: surface–surface and surface–volume models. These families emerge from the virtual power balance established between the target macroscopic surface and the corresponding microscopic contact surface or volume. They not only represent fundamental kinematical entities at each scale but also enable the replacement of the heterogeneous contact traction distribution with a smooth, homogenised version. Microscale equilibrium problems and homogenisation relations, along with the relevant macro- and microscale quantities, are derived by means of straightforward variational arguments. Furthermore, potential finite size effects are addressed in the homogenised response, enhancing the reliability and applicability of the strategy across diverse scenarios. Promising submodels have been identified within both families, broadening the understanding of multiscale contact phenomena and including existing models as particular cases. The proposed continuum-based variational families of models naturally lead to generic finite element-based frameworks for contact homogenisation of heterogeneous solids, as described in a forthcoming paper.},

  abstract     = {While performing explicit dynamic analyses in a finite element context, engineers must often balance the accuracy and robustness of a model against the computational savings offered by the common choice of a diagonal mass matrix. Owing to the nodal quadrature technique, the spectral element method in the time domain offers an optimal solution in this sense, however, this approach is restricted to conforming discretizations. This has led to intensive research of mass lumping strategies for cut (a.k.a. virtual domain, or immersed) finite element methods, which still remain an open issue. For finite elements enriched via the partition of unity method, Schweitzer proposed a variationally consistent approach, which could replace heuristics. We propose an extended Bernstein finite element method with strictly positive shape functions, which make this approach viable. Alternatively, the need for mass lumping in this context can be overcome by the use of an implicit–explicit solver, which enables to selectively factorize the consistent mass matrix of cut or enriched elements during time integration. In this contribution, we systematically study, develop, and cross-compare such schemes in light of recently developed moment-fitted mass lumping methods for cut and enriched elements. We show that, as long as the dimensions of the implicit region are contained, the implicit–explicit solution approach delivers an excellent means to preserving the convergence properties of the method while providing good computational performance.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing and reducing uncertainty in estimating failure probability has always been a crucial part of reliability analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. This paper employs Bayesian inference to capture uncertainty within Subset Simulation (SuS), with a specific emphasis on constructing the posterior distribution of failure probability. Two types of Bayesian models are discussed. The first type is based on the distribution form of the failure probability estimator from the SuS, where the Log-normal and Beta distributions are compared and analyzed. The second type is based on the distribution of statistics in Bernoulli trials in SuS, involving models such as the Beta-Binomial and Uniform-Bernoulli trials with Sequential Dependence. After evaluating all models among two types, the Log-normal distribution-based model was selected as the optimal solution due to its consideration of sample correlation and closed form of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP). Further exploration of this model reveals that its MAP estimation can provide less bias and deviation compared to mean estimation when SuS is run multiple times. Additionally, when compared to the point estimation of failure probability in conventional SuS, the posterior distribution of failure probability provides a more comprehensive overview, capturing the effects of sample size and MCMC algorithms.},

The scheme is based on a velocity–pressure splitting resembling a Uzawa approach combined with a grad-div stabilizing term. We establish the validity, convergence and a priori estimates for this strategy. A simpler mixed approach is also presented and studied. Numerical tests using a manufactured solution are provided, giving estimates for the accuracy order and sensitivity to the stabilizing coefficient.

Our model couples the fluid field, surface concentration field representing chemical species on the membrane, and vesicle dynamics, while enforcing global area and volume constraints through a Lagrange multiplier method. Specifically, we employ full Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid field, the Cahn–Hilliard equations for the species concentration on the membrane, a nonlinear advection–diffusion equation to describe the evolution of the vesicle membrane, and an additional equation to enforce local inextensibility. We utilize a residual-based variational multiscale method for the Navier–Stokes equations and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The PDEs are solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized- α time integration method. We extend previous models for homogeneous vesicles (Aland et al., 2014; Valizadeh and Rabczuk, 2022) to multicomponent vesicles, introducing Cahn–Hilliard equations while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Additionally, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA) for higher accuracy. We present a variety of two-dimensional numerical examples, including multicomponent vesicles in shear flow and Poiseuille flow with and without obstructions, using the resistive immersed surface method to handle obstructions. Furthermore, we provide three-dimensional simulations of multicomponent vesicles in Poiseuille flow.},

The flow involves sediment-laden fresh water overlying salt water, which is described by Navier–Stokes equations coupled with sediment concentration and salinity transport equations. Two cases are investigated: one where the training data contains the salinity and sediment concentration fields, and another where it contains the velocity field. For both cases, we investigate several flow regimes and show that the model is capable of inferring the unknown parameter and reconstructing the hydrodynamic field of the flow. The quality of the model inference is assessed by comparing it with numerical simulations from a high-fidelity semi-Lagrangian solver. We demonstrate the model’s robustness to noise by training it with data corrupted by noise of varying magnitudes, highlighting the potential of PINNs for real-world applications.},

A large number of performance function calls are usually necessary for each reliability analysis, and it involves with the repeated reliability analysis at different design pints, leading to potentially prohibitive computational cost when dealing with challenging performance function evaluations. In order to overcome the issues caused by repeated reliability analysis, this paper proposes an RBDO method through instance-based transfer learning. The proposed method converts repeated reliability analysis at different design points into a serial of different target domain tasks through transfer learning, which provides a new perspective for solving RBDO problems. Firstly, it carries out the repeated reliability analysis with high accuracy by transferring the reliability knowledge from the source domain to the target domains. Subsequently, the gradient information is obtained using the first-order score function method and design point is updated. The method utilizes instance-based transfer learning to achieve repeated reliability analysis, enhancing the performance of RBDO methods, particularly in computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through three numerical examples and one engineering application.},

However, there still lacks a mesoscopic model to predict the microstructure evolution during MFA-SLS process. Herein, we develop a thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal phase-field model (PFM) to investigate the microstructure evolution during MFA-SLS process. The PFM is consistently derived from a thermodynamic framework invoking the microforce theory and Coleman–Noll procedure. The SLS temperature gradient effect is incorporated not only in the temperature-dependent parameters of PFM free energy, but also in the modified Cahn–Hilliard equation with an explicit temperature-gradient term. A magnetic field-related energy term for PFM is constructed to consider the interaction of differently oriented grains with the external magnetic field. PFM simulations of grain boundary (GB) migration in a prototypical non-magnetic material bismuth under a magnetic field are carried out. It is found that GB migration direction and velocity is significantly affected by the magnetic field and temperature gradient. It is also revealed that the external magnetic field in MFA-SLS can readily control the grain size distribution of the powder bed. The proposed PFM could provide a basis for the mesoscopic simulation of microstructure evolution in MFA-SLS.},

Considering only the positive part of the strain energy in the variational formulation, we obtain a membrane with zero compressive stiffness. By adding the negative strain energy multiplied with a very small factor, we further obtain a residual compressive stiffness, which improves stability and allows handling also states of slackening. Comparison with results from analytical, numerical and experimental examples from the literature on membrane wrinkling problems demonstrate the great performance and capability of the proposed approach, which is also compatible with commercial finite element software.},

This paper builds upon our previous work (Donello et al., 2023) on solving nonlinear matrix differential equations on low-rank matrix manifolds using CUR decompositions. The methodology we present offers multiple advantages: (i) It delivers near-optimal computational savings both in terms of memory and floating-point operations by leveraging cross algorithms based on the discrete empirical interpolation method to strategically sample sparse entries of the time-discrete TDEs to advance the solution in low-rank form. (ii) Numerical demonstrations show that the time integration is robust in the presence of small singular values. (iii) High-order explicit Runge–Kutta time integration schemes are developed. (iv) The algorithm is easy to implement, as it requires the evaluation of the full-order model at strategically selected entries and does not use tangent space projections, whose efficient implementation is intrusive. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented algorithm for several test cases, including a nonlinear 100-dimensional TDE for the evolution of a tensor of size 7 0 100 ≈ 3 . 2 × 1 0 184 and a stochastic advection–diffusion–reaction equation with a tensor of size 4 . 7 × 1 0 9 .},

Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators.

Thus, the typical intergranular crack growth is modeled by avoiding refined finite element grain discretizations with relevant computational cost saving. Results of numerical simulations are presented and discussed. First, some benchmarks show the reliability of the proposed modeling strategy. Then, the response of Alumina/Zirconia representative volume elements, whose size is selected on the basis of results of a statistical homogenization procedure tailored for random composites, is investigated by analyzing the effect of the variation of the metallic phase volume fraction and the shape of grains composing the microstructure.},

The article puts special emphasis on the stabilisation technique used, which becomes crucial in the resolution of the generalised eigenvalue problem. In particular, we prove that using a variational multiscale method assuming the sub-grid scales to lie in the finite element space orthogonal to that of the approximation, namely the Orthogonal Sub-Grid Scales (OSGS), results in a convenient linear and symmetric generalised eigenvalue problem.

  abstract     = {As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters, which is typically the second phase in a common bi-level optimization procedure for minimizing the weight of composite structures. To adapt stacking sequence retrieval for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed numerical state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. For the DMRG algorithm, we derived a matrix product operator representation of the loss function Hamiltonian and the penalty terms. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.},

When dealing with advanced complex materials, these descriptions are sometimes not a priori available or not even known. Using sparsity-promoting techniques one can extract macroscopic dynamic models directly from particle-based simulations. In this work, we showcase such an approach on a simple fluid and test its robustness. We introduce a novel measure for automatic macroscopic model selection that combines stability and accuracy of a model. Using this measure and employing only a few physics-based assumptions, we are able to infer both the mass continuity equation and an equation for the conservation of linear momentum. Moreover, the extracted phenomenological and non-phenomenological parameters agree well with their numerically measured values and the well-known semi-empirical estimates.

  abstract     = {Natural materials, through the multiscale architected organisms they contain, can evolve and control anisotropic properties to enhance their functionality and performance, thereby improving their adaptability to external environments. Similarly, recent studies have demonstrated engineered porous materials with multiscale architected structures and tunable anisotropy can achieve superior performance compared to commonly used isotropic porous materials. In this work, by locally tessellating varied-shaped Voronoi structures with modified Riemannian metric, we develop a novel bio-inspired design framework for multiscale porous structures, which can possess tunable orientation, porosity and anisotropic property. The effective mechanical properties of multiscale varied-shaped Voronoi tessellated (VSVT) porous structures are evaluated using a numerical homogenization technique, and finally expressed as a function of design parameters, i.e., anisotropy ratio, relative density, and material direction. A gradient-based, multi-scale, multi-component optimization workflow is applied to design and optimize porous materials and structures that mimic natural patterns. Typical design cases, such as Messerschmitt–Bölkow–Blohm beams with global or local volume constraints, have been carried out to verify the proposed VSVT method. The obtained geometry models from the de-homogenization procedure not only demonstrate high computational accuracy and improved compliance performance, but also exhibit flexible biofunctional compatibility like tailored specific surface area. This implies that the proposed VSVT design method for multiscale porous materials and structures have strong potentials for engineering applications, such as, implants, architecture, energy storage, and etc.},

  abstract     = {The parametric probability-box model, often abbreviated as “p-box” is frequently used to characterize epistemic uncertainties. However, structural reliability analysis with p-box uncertainties can often be computationally intensive. This paper presents an efficient method to accurately compute the bounds of failure probabilities within this context. The method’s key innovation lies in its ability to achieve high efficiency with only a single round of model evaluations. First, the Fractional Exponential Moments-based Maximum Entropy Method (FEM-MEM) with Bivariate Dimension Reduction Method (BDRM) is employed for precise reliability assessment, where a single-round of model evaluations are carried out. Subsequently, Bayesian Updating (BU) is applied to adjust the weights obtained from BDRM in response to changes in input variables, while ensuring the invariance of integration points. Following this adjustment, the FEM-MEM is once again employed to compute the failure probability after the information change, without necessitating additional model evaluations. To compute the bounds of failure probabilities, a Kriging model is employed to construct a surrogate relationship between the interval variables and failure probabilities. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical examples, with comparisons made against pertinent double-loop method.},

To the best of our knowledge, it extends the locking-free enriched Galerkin space in Yi et al. (2022) to high orders for the first time. Compared to the continuous Galerkin method, the proposed method is locking-free with only k d − 1 kd−1 additional degree of freedom on each element. The parameter-free property of our method is realized by integrating the enriched Galerkin space into the framework of the modified weak Galerkin method. We rigorously establish the well-posedness of the method and provide optimal error estimates for the compressible case. Extensive numerical examples confirm both the accuracy and the locking-free property of the proposed method.},

Numerical examples indicates that the proposed adaptive IITO method is superior to both traditional IITOs with adaptive Gaussian quadrature rule and successive global refinement, and achieves a sound balance between optimization accuracy and computation efficiency, irrespectively of the physical dimension and boundary conditions as well as geometry shape of design domain. Moreover, an object-oriented IITO engineering software is developed by C++ language and can be applied in engineering topology optimization design problems effectively, which show the superiorities of our IITO system.

A wide range of approaches perform well with sufficiently measured data but their performance is problematic for sparse data. To address this issue, this study proposes an active learning based multi-fidelity residual Gaussian process (AL-MR-GP) modelling framework. A low-fidelity (LF) prediction model is first trained using extensive LF data collected from worldwide sites to generate preliminary estimations. Subsequent training employs active learning to prioritize high-fidelity data from the specific site of interest with larger information gain for calibrating the LF model to make ultimate predictions. The compression index of clays is selected as an example to examine the capability of the proposed framework. The results indicate that using the same number of site-specific datasets, the compression index of clays can be well captured by AL-MR-GP, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability than models without incorporating multi-fidelity data or active learning. Based on unified LF data, the proposed framework becomes data-efficient for the model development of three sites and is significantly competitive in extrapolation, compared with site-specific models even with active learning. These promising characteristics indicate substantial potential to be extended to broader applications in geotechnical engineering.},

  abstract     = {Recent breakthroughs in advanced manufacturing capabilities have made it possible to design and print sophisticated topologies of cellular structures using diverse engineering materials such as metals, polymers, and ceramics. In these architectured materials, it is often desirable to tailor the mechanical properties by altering the unit cell topology. This necessitates an in-depth understanding of how the topology of the unit cell structure affects the macroscopic behavior of the material in both the linear and the non-linear regimes encountered under large compression. We have developed a machine learning (ML) approach capable of accelerating the prediction of the stress–strain response of a polymer-based cellular structure under uniaxial confined compression. As part of generating the training data for ML, 60,000 mesostructures were generated using a relatively novel approach based on cellular automata, and their corresponding stress–strain responses were obtained from the finite element simulations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the stress–strain curves. With only 20 principal components, PCA captured 99.89% of the variance in the stress–strain curves while reducing the dimensionality by 5X. ML using supervised autoencoder was able to successfully speed up the prediction of the non-linear stress–strain response of a unit cell by up to 4600X. The proposed method can serve as an efficient data generation tool and a rapid means for predicting the structure–property relationship through accelerated forward modeling of cellular materials under compaction, in cases where the macroscopic stress–strain response is governed by the unit-cell topology.},

This paper constructs a novel optimization model for generating FGMs under customized performance, employing an implicit field representation governed by tensor product B-splines. The cross-sectional profile aligns with a microstructure, and thus varying heights correspond to a sequence of microstructures. Fine-tuning the implicit field on connectable FGMs is achieved by optimizing specific properties and addressing the 2-norm problem under connectivity constraints. Therefore, these FGMs can serve as fundamental units for bottom-up multiscale infills. Additionally, we also develop a new model to investigate a more universally applicable concurrent topology optimization method without initial input restrictions. These multiscale optimization results demonstrate excellent performance under tested working conditions.},

  abstract     = {Earthquake-induced geohazards are natural disasters that have the potential to cause severe damage to infrastructure and endanger human lives. To mitigate these natural disasters, advanced computational methods capable of dealing with large deformation and failure of geomaterials have been developed for years. Among those methods, the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been demonstrated to offer great flexibility in handling a wide range of challenging geotechnical problems, involving large deformations and post-failure behaviour of geomaterials. However, despite some primary attempts, a proper SPH framework for modelling seismic responses has not yet been fully developed. One of the key reasons for this is the absence of appropriate SPH boundary conditions for wave propagation analysis in infinite porous media. To overcome this problem, this study proposed new SPH boundary conditions to enable the SPH method to efficiently analyse seismic responses of geomechanics problems with compliant-base and free-field boundary conditions, allowing successfully reproducing wave propagation and dissipation in an infinite ground domain. Comprehensive verification and validation of the SPH framework, integrated with the newly developed boundary conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness in simulating the earthquake-induced large deformations and failures of geotechnical engineering problems. This suggests that the proposed computational model offers a robust tool for predicting and understanding the seismic response and associated large deformations, thereby advancing applications in geotechnical engineering and disaster risk mitigation.},

Towards this end, the PIM mathematically unifies the concepts of the inverse finite element method and peridynamics differential operator for the first time, thus creating a fully meshless approach that relies solely on particle discretization of the physical domain to solve the inverse problem of shape sensing. Utilizing a least squares variational principle, the PIM matches experimental measurements with numerical strains derived through interactions among particles in a non-local framework. This innovative principle allows the reconstruction of continuous deformations in the physical domain (for every particle) from discrete strain data. Additionally, the PIM uses a local damage parameter for each particle, dependent on the integrity of its bonds, to monitor crack development and propagation in real time. Crucially, PIM does not require information about loading or material properties for effective shape sensing and structural health monitoring. The method is applicable even if the crack continues to propagate in the physical domain. The accuracy of PIM is validated through comparative numerical analyses on benchmark problems involving both intact and cracked isotropic plates under tension and shear. Despite the limited number of sensors, PIM demonstrates its ability to accurately map full-field deformations and monitor crack dynamics effectively, highlighting its significant potential for future experimental applications.},

Seepage conditions are non-linear boundary conditions, that can be formulated as a set of unilateral constraints on both the pressure head and the water flux at the ground surface, together with a complementarity condition: these conditions in practice require switching between Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on unknown portions on the boundary. Upon realizing the similarities of these conditions with unilateral contact problems in mechanics, we take inspiration from that literature to propose two approaches: the first method relies on a strongly consistent penalization term, whereas the second one is obtained by an hybridization approach, in which the value of the pressure on the surface is treated as a separate set of unknowns. The flow problem is discretized in mixed form with div-conforming elements so that the water mass is preserved. Numerical experiments show the validity of the proposed strategy in handling the seepage boundary conditions on geometries with increasing complexity.},

This work introduces a variational integrator for such models based on a relative-kinematic formulation, in which positions and velocities of nodes in the discretized beam are expressed relative to the respective preceding nodes in the kinematic chain. The resulting model is especially suited for applications in robotics and control, since it has a minimum number of states and possesses the same structure as rigid mechanical systems, simplifying the combined modeling of rigid–flexible systems. Moreover, this approach allows to specifically select the modeled deformation modes, avoiding numerical issues associated with stiff, high-frequency modes and greatly increasing numerical efficiency. The proposed model is derived fully variationally in the discrete mechanics framework and under consistent consideration of the underlying Lie group structure, which translates into beneficial numerical properties. We provide a detailed treatment of the inclusion of dissipation and propose two solver strategies for time integration, including a linear-time solver based on recursive rigid-body dynamics algorithms. The model is validated and analyzed in detailed simulation studies underlining its efficiency for the simulation of stiff and slender beams, where the straightforward, but exact reduction to a Kirchhoff beam in the presented frame leads to a substantial speed-up of the simulations.},

To address this, we formulate the assessment within a conditional probability framework, allowing us to capture the complexities of uncertainty in fatigue predictions. We employ advanced probabilistic methods to account for both inherent material variability and model uncertainty. We analyse fatigue data of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) tested under stress ratios of R = 0.1 and R = −1, including face-centred cubic (FCC) microstructures of CoCrFeMnNi and AlCoCrFeMnNi alloys. Based on results, we found a clear material trend which allows us more reliable predictions and informed decision-making, which is distinct than the conventional fitting. for the future alloy design. As we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework in extracting the intricate relationships between MPEA composition and the trend in fatigue behaviour, we believe that our study will pave the way for enhanced advanced material design and uncertainty quantification in future MPEA research and materials engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {The integration of topology optimization and additive manufacturing (AM) offers a transformative approach to designing and fabricating complex structures across various industries. This synergy enables engineers to produce lightweight, high-performance designs with intricate, organic geometries that push the boundaries of conventional manufacturing methods. However, printing large 3D objects that exceed the allowable build volume of an AM machine poses a significant challenge. This necessity has led to the development of methodologies such as part decomposition (PD) to fit these objects within the build volume constraint. Previous studies have contributed to solving PD problems, but several limitations, such as the use of Euler angle representation and the lack of practical decomposed designs, need to be addressed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to develop a 3D decomposition optimization methodology for topology-optimized structures by establishing a novel rotational system and modeling joint mechanical properties. The novel rotational system, using a non-unit quaternion representation, is established to eliminate the singularity issue inherent in the Euler angle representation. This approach also allows for the effective optimization of partitioning cuboids, which represent the allowable AM build volume, by removing the unit-length constraint. Additionally, the joint mechanical properties at the interface between decomposed parts are modeled using geometrically represented hollow cuboids. Furthermore, analytical sensitivity expressions with respect to new design variables, including explicit variables of partitioning cuboids and rotation variables of non-unit quaternions, are derived and numerically verified to efficiently solve the decomposition optimization problem. Through practical case studies, the 3D decomposition optimization methodology demonstrates its effectiveness under various conditions, including varying maximum allowable AM build volumes, different initial partitioning cuboid layouts, and various joint mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports a procedure to develop random fields of material properties on a mesoscale level, coarser than the microscale level of heterogeneous material microstructure. Since the anisotropy of properties at the mesoscale level is unavoidable, tensor-valued random fields (TRFs) need to be constructed. The construction satisfies three criteria: (i) the passage from the micro to mesoscale must be conducted according to micromechanics, (ii) any anisotropic properties must be grasped, and (iii) full (spatial) correlation structure must be accounted for. The construction is illustrated in the example of a linear elastic microstructure modeling a planar interpenetrating phase composite (IPC), where each phase is interconnected throughout the microstructure. The most general representation of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic correlation structure of the TRFs of stiffness and compliance is employed. Four material functions of the representation are determined through scale-dependent homogenization, which grasps any auto- and cross-correlations within/among different components of TRFs. The Gaussianity of the TRFs is also assessed with a finding that, overall, the smaller is the mesoscale and the more pronounced is the microstructural randomness, the more non-Gaussian are the mesoscale TRFs.},

The segmentation is performed in a self-supervised manner, where, in the absence of ground truth images, the predicted stress field is used as the target of the deep learning model with a novel loss function. Our surrogate modelling approach prioritises model generalisability and does not impose domain specific Dirichlet boundary conditions, unlike a conventional Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) setup for solving inverse problems for given spatial configurations. In this work, strain field and greyscale images are used as U-Nets input data, avoiding spatial coordinate constraints. Dirichlet boundary conditions are replaced by a transfer learning mechanism where the model learns the behaviour of the matrix of the composite material in a data-driven manner using a dataset consisting of pure-matrix mechanical tests, and the overall behaviour of the composite in a physics-informed manner using a composite dataset. Convolution kernels perform a finite-difference approximation of the partial differential equations. The methodology in this work is applied to simulated samples, but both the synthesised data and models were shaped with future practical applications in mind.},

The fundamental issue in adapting the mixed displacement–pressure formulations with linear and higher-order continuous elements for the pressure field is their inability to capture pressure and stress jumps across material interfaces. In this paper, for the first time in literature, we perform comprehensive studies of multimaterial problems in elasticity consisting of compressible and incompressible material models using the mixed displacement–pressure formulation to assess the performance of different element types in accurately resolving pressure fields within the domains and pressure jumps across material interfaces. In particular, inf–sup stable displacement–pressure combinations with element-wise discontinuous pressure for triangular and tetrahedral elements are considered and their performance is assessed along with the Q1/P0 element and Taylor–Hood elements using several numerical examples. The results show that Taylor–Hood elements fail to capture the stress jumps due to the continuity of DOFs across elements, the Crouzeix–Raviart (P2b/P1dc) element yields substantially poor pressure fields despite a significant increase in pressure degrees of freedom and that the P3/P1dc element produces superior quality results fields when compared with the P2b/P1dc element.},

  abstract     = {We propose a geometrically-inspired mixed variational approach for nonlinear analysis of Kirchhoff shells based on Cartan’s moving frames. We use a two-parameter family of points (the mid-surface) and a two-parameter family of orthonormal frames (Cartan’s moving frames) introduced independently. Compatibility of the mid-surface vis-á-vis the frame field is enforced by appropriately constructing a functional, namely, the Hu–Washizu (HW) functional. We use geometric interpretations of the first Piola stress and deformation gradient, the former as a co-vector valued one-form and the latter as pullback of the co-vector part of position differential to the reference configuration. Cartan’s method of moving frames is used, where the differential of frame is expressed in terms of the frame itself. Koiter’s nonlinear shell energy is adopted and expressed in terms of frames and deformation 1-forms. The proposed functional thus contains both vectors and differential forms as input arguments. Hence Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) is exploited to discretize the different fields whilst respecting the geometric nature of the differential forms. For purposes of discretization, we use linear approximation for deformation and different interpolations for the moving frame and the surface convected frame, which enables us to propose a C 0 formulation for Kirchhoff shells. The discrete extremum problem is solved numerically using Newton’s method. As evidenced through a family of numerical tests, the proposed mixed FE technique is locking free and very accurate, at least for the class of problems presently studied.},

As an extension of the established Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method that utilizes the fixed structured mesh, the proposed Colored Body-Fitted Optimization (CBFO) method adopts the body-fitted grids to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability for diverse engineering applications. Notably, incorporating body-fitted meshes with intermediate density profiles enables improved flexibility in the numerical simulations and eliminates the need for re-meshing in each iteration. The dual re-meshing strategy drastically reduces computational costs, with only two re-meshing procedures required throughout the optimization process. This approach facilitates the generation of dense mesh regions around critical boundaries to augment solution accuracy while enabling sparse mesh configurations in the low-sensitivity regions, thereby boosting computational efficiency without compromising performance. The effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the CBFO method are validated through testing on multiple standard minimum compliance and compliant mechanism problems. The proposed optimization method can converge in dozens of iterations, obtain better objective function values, and save computational costs by up to 69 % compared to the previous method using the body-fitted mesh. Additionally, a concise MATLAB script implementing the proposed method using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm is provided in the appendix and the supplementary material, complete with annotations.},

The proposed formulation uses the average strain of each polyhedral element. By employing the octree decomposition algorithm, high-resolution images and complex STL-format geometries are automatically converted to conforming and balanced octree meshes. Furthermore, the formulation is combined with the 144 unique octree cell patterns (Zhang et al., 2021) to streamline the workflow and improve the computational efficiency. The rotating, mirroring, and scaling operations on the octree cell patterns are derived for elastoplastic analysis. Moreover, the present approach is implemented in ABAQUS as a UELMAT user element to utilize the built-in material library. The accuracy, convergence rate, and computational efficiency of the formulation are investigated using four verification examples covering octree- and arbitrary-shaped scaled boundary finite elements. The results show that the proposed formulation does not suffer from volumetric-locking, and it has achieved a 4x speed up in comparison with existing method. It is also shown that its speed is comparable to the built-in elements in the ABAQUS. Lastly, an image-based compression analysis of a steel sample and a contact analysis on a human mouth structure are performed to illustrate the automatic workflow and the improvement in the computational speed.},

  abstract     = {Elastic contact in hydrodynamic environments is a complex multiphysics phenomenon and can be found in applications ranging from engineering to biological systems. Understanding the intricacies of this coupled problem requires the development of a generalized framework capable of handling topological changes and transitioning implicitly from fluid–structure interaction (FSI) conditions to solid–solid contact conditions. We propose a mono-field interface advancing method for handling multibody contact simulations in submerged environments. Given the physical demands of the problem, we adopt a phase-field based fully Eulerian approach to resolve the multiphase and multibody interactions in the system. We employ a stabilized finite element formulation and a partitioned iterative procedure to solve the unified momentum equation comprising solid and fluid dynamics coupled with the Allen-Cahn phase-field equation. The evolution of solid strain in the Eulerian reference frame is governed by the transport of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor. We introduce a contact force approach to handle smooth elastic-elastic and elastic-rigid contact based on the overlap of the diffused interfaces of two colliding bodies. We propose a novel approach to extend the model for multibody contact simulations while using a single phase-field function for all the solids. The method is based on updating the solid boundaries at every time step and checking for collisions among them. The developed approach eliminates the need to solve multiple phase field equations and multiple strain equations at every time step. This reduces the overall computational time by nearly 16% compared to a multi phase-field approach. The implemented model is verified for smooth dry contact and FSI contact scenarios. Using the proposed framework, we demonstrate the collision dynamics between multiple bodies submerged in an open liquid tank.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of crack-induced failure is of vital importance for the safety and integrity assessment of solids and structures but still challenging. Being the foremost approach, fracture mechanics is plagued by the logical inconsistency in dealing with crack and non-cracked region, and to make matters worse, it has been contradicted by the ongoing experiments that the fracture energy is not a material constant irrelevant to geometry even for the unsophisticated situations. In this paper, based on the recently proposed nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage (NMMD) model, it is demonstrated that the logical consistency of governing equations either on crack-tip or off crack-tip plays a crucial role in the complete solution of cracking problems. To this end, the central themes of fracture mechanics, including the definition of an idealized crack, the separated equilibrium laws and the cracking criteria attached to crack-tip, are firstly revisited. Then, after a concise description of NMMD model with emphasis on the geometrical transmission form micro- to macro-scale and the physical–mechanical translation from geometry to energy, it is theoretically proved that the geometry-based damage zone reproduces idealized crack as a limit when the nonlocal characteristic length, i.e., the influence radius in NMMD model, tends to zero. As a result, the separated equilibrium laws of fracture mechanics can be covered by NMMD model with a unified set of governing equations that does not distinguish between points at crack surface and at non-cracked region. This advantage permits NMMD model to be well-suited to analyze both crack-induced failure problems with and without pre-existing cracks in the absence of additional cracking criteria. In contrast, owing to its macro-meso-scale consistent feature, a new criterion for kinking angle of crack, the maximum stress intensity factor (SIF) of mode-I, can be derived from NMMD model. Some representative numerical examples are also presented to further confirm the above intrinsic link to fracture mechanics. In particular, the superiority of the NMMD model is demonstrated by capturing not only the non-constant fracture parameters (especially the fracture energy) but also the cracking initiation not from the pre-existing crack-tips, which are revealed by experimental results but contradict fracture mechanics. These investigations imply that the NMMD model could provide a potential avenue to understand when and how cracks nucleate and propagate based on a two-scale perspective.},

Upon assuming a unilateral-frictional contact law between the blocks, the equations of motions are formulated in a time-discrete impulse theorem format in the unknown block velocities and contact impulses. The variational structure of the problem to be solved at each time step is proven. On that basis, the numerical method requires at each time step to perform a collision detection that identifies antagonist contact points based on the given structural configuration, to solve a second-order conic programming problem that outputs block velocities and contact impulses, and to update the structural configuration for the solution to advance in time. As a merit of the formulation, large-scale problems can be robustly and efficiently addressed thanks to the convex setting of the time-step optimization problem. Numerical results are presented to test the computational performances of the proposed approach. Benchmark problems provide numerical evidence that the formulation is consistent with event-driven solutions based on the classical Housner impact model. The dynamic response, failure domains, and fragility functions of real-size masonry structures are then explored under ground impulse or earthquake excitation. The obtained results prove the reliability of the present computational method for the dynamic analysis and seismic assessment of historical masonry constructions of engineering interest.},

In such situations, IsoGeometric Analysis often offers improved per degree-of-freedom accuracy but building analysis-suitable representation of complex shapes is generally not obvious. This paper introduces a non-invasive, spline-based fictitious domain method using Free-Form Deformation to efficiently solve the Helmholtz equation in complex domains, such as in musical instruments. By immersing a fine FE mesh into a simple B-spline box, the approximation subspace size is significantly reduced without compromising accuracy. Accompanied by specific conditioning treatment, the method not only proves to be efficient, but also robust and easy to implement in existing FE software. Applied to an alto saxophone, the method reduces the number of degrees of freedom by over two orders of magnitude and the computation time by more than one compared to standard FE methods with comparable accuracy when compared to experimental tests.},

  abstract     = {Due to their high specific strength and stiffness, stiffened thin-walled structures are extensively utilized in aerospace applications to maintain a high load-bearing capacity in a complex thermo-mechanical coupled environment. Thermal deformation significantly impacts the intake and exhaust performances, aerodynamic profiles, and even structural safety, hence how to design a reasonable stiffener layout for thermal structures is necessary. Thermoelastic topology optimization is an efficient method. However, to reduce the thermal load and maintain stiffness, design-dependent thermal loading problems such as the grayscale issues and the material-less effect often result. Due to the high proportion of gray elements and a lower penalized element stiffness, thermal deformation magnitude is closely related to the grayscale issues. Therefore, the key challenge is to address the grayscale issues induced by the thermal load. To address this challenge, a thermoelastic topology optimization method via regional strain energy minimization (RSEM) is proposed in this study. The region here means the skin domain of stiffened thin-walled structures. To control the width size of stiffeners consisting of voxels, a maximum size constraint is established through the p-mean aggregation function, employing the Helmholtz-type anisotropic filter to calculate the solid ratio. This study compares three optimization formulations that minimize the compliance, global strain energy and regional strain energy as objective functions, respectively. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing design-dependent thermal loading problems. Compared to conventional methodologies, the proposed method can generate a clear stiffener layout and reduce the thermal deformation by 77% for an engineered thin-walled end cap structure under a thermo-mechanical coupled field.},

  abstract     = {Full-field measurements are used to calibrate material parameters. The Equilibrium Gap Method (EGM), like other identification formulations that use full-field data has the advantage of being direct for linear behavior and some nonlinearities, thereby being computationally cheaper than iterative methods. However, it has a high sensitivity to measurement uncertainties, which is detrimental when dealing with noisy data. The Reconditioned Equilibrium Gap Method (REGM) has been proposed to mitigate this sensitivity. Reconditioning is revisited in this paper from two viewpoints. First, reconditioning may be analyzed as a way of accounting for displacement uncertainties in the cost function. Second, the reconditioned formulation approximates the optimization problem associated with Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU). Based on these developments, the Sequentially Reconditioned Equilibrium Gap Method (SREGM), i.e., an intermediary between FEMU and REGM, is proposed. It uses REGM results to correct the approximation in a fixed-point scheme. Identification results on synthetic and true experiments show that considering the covariance matrix of measured displacements in the cost function is necessary to obtain good identification results. The analyses give insight into unsuccessful cases and confirm that SREGM provides results closer to FEMU than EGM or REGM.},

This is combined with a physics-aware implicit solver that consists of a much coarser, discretized version of the original PDE, which provides the requisite information bottleneck for high-dimensional problems and enables generalization in out-of-distribution settings (e.g. different boundary conditions). We demonstrate its capability in the context of random heterogeneous materials where the input parameters represent the material microstructure. We extend the framework to multiscale problems and show that a surrogate can be learned for the effective (homogenized) solution without ever solving the reference problem. We further demonstrate how the proposed framework can accommodate and generalize several existing learning objectives and architectures while yielding probabilistic surrogates that can quantify predictive uncertainty.},

Different interpolation schemes achieving this are employed in literature. The present work focuses on such diffuse interface approximation of viscous stress. It is shown, that a viscosity interpolation based on the arithmetic mean introduces large deviations from the sharp interface solution for cases, where components of the velocity gradient normal to the interface occur. In contrast, the harmonic mean is prone to deviations for cases with a transversal velocity gradient. A diffuse interface approximation based on a jump condition approach is introduced, which generally exhibits higher accuracy and coincides with the arithmetic and harmonic mean in the respective limiting case. It locally accounts for both the jump momentum balance and the Hadamard condition at all points of the diffuse interface.},

The conventional POD method is applicable only to data with the same computational grid for all snapshots. This study proposed a novel POD methodology that performs on flow snapshots, including some time-series data of flow fields around objects of different shapes and numerically computed by different computational grids. The concept of the proposed POD involved mapping the flow fields computed on different grids in computational space. Consequently, the optimal POD basis for minimizing reconstruction errors in physical space was obtained in the computational space. The proposed POD was applied to the flow around ellipses and airfoils generated via conformal mapping to a cylinder. The ROM formulated using the proposed POD bases reconstructed the flow fields around the ellipses with different aspect ratios and airfoils with varying shapes. Using the modes obtained by the proposed POD, the ROM was demonstrated to stably predict the time evolution of the flow around objects, which is not included in the snapshots. In the ROM, the difference between the frequency of the flow field in the POD snapshot and that of the reconstructed flow field resulted in a phase error owing to the time evolution. The mean squared error between the flow fields obtained via the ROM and the directly solved Navier–Stokes equations was under 1 0 − 7 10−7 when the reconstructed flow and the flow included in the snapshot had the same frequency as that of Kármán vorticities behind the objects. Based on these observations, the proposed POD is suitable for constructing an ROM to reconstruct the flow around various geometries.},

Existing Kriging-based frameworks for spatio-temporal sparse field prediction fail to meet the accuracy and inference time required for nonlinear dynamic prediction problems. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical System Prediction from Sparse Observations using Voronoi Tessellation (DSOVT) framework, an innovative methodology based on Voronoi tessellation which combines convolutional encoder–decoder (CED) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and utilizing Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). By integrating Voronoi tessellations with spatio-temporal deep learning models, DSOVT is adept at predicting dynamical systems with unstructured, sparse, and time-varying observations. CED-LSTM maps Voronoi tessellations into a low-dimensional representation for time series prediction, while ConvLSTM directly uses these tessellations in an end-to-end predictive model. Furthermore, we incorporate physics constraints during the training process for dynamical systems with explicit formulas. Compared to purely data-driven models, our physics-based approach enables the model to learn physical laws within explicitly formulated dynamics, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of rolling forecasts. Numerical experiments on real sea surface data and shallow water systems clearly demonstrate our framework’s accuracy and computational efficiency with sparse and time-varying observations.},

  abstract     = {Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the most common forms of heart disease, caused by a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries. When this buildup is extensive, it can result in obstructions in the lumen of the blood vessels (known as stenosis) that lead to insufficient delivery of essential molecules like oxygen to the heart. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), defined as the ratio of pressures distal and proximal to the stenosis, is the physiologic gold standard for assessing the severity of CAD in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and relies upon the placement of an invasive coronary wire. Despite its strong diagnostic value, invasive FFR assessment is underutilized due to its cost, time-consuming nature, technique-dependent variability, and the small potential of increased risk to the patient. In this study, an attention-based multi-fidelity machine learning model (AttMulFid) is proposed for efficient and accurate virtual FFR (vFFR) assessment, including uncertainty quantification, without the use of an invasive coronary wire. Within AttMulFid, an autoencoder is used to select geometric features from the coronary arteries, with additional attention to the stenosis region. A convolutional neural network (feature fusion U-Net) combines multi-fidelity data, geometric features, and boundary conditions to produce accurate estimates of vFFR. We present results that demonstrate the good performance of AttMulFid against CFD FFR data, as well as in vivo, invasive FFR assessment from patients. Our results also show that the selected geometric features learned by the autoencoder can accurately represent the entire geometry, with greater attention on key features such as stenosis. AttMulFid thus presents itself as a feasible approach for non-invasive, rapid, and accurate vFFR assessment.},

However, the existing TRBRDO methods have not specifically addressed the dynamic uncertainty of material degradation, and there is lack of a universal and efficient approach for this class of time-variant robust design problems. For this reason, this paper proposes three solution strategies, namely the reliability index based double-loop method, performance measure based double-loop method, and sequential single-loop method. In these approaches, the minimum reliability of each time-variant probabilistic constraint is considered by obtaining the extremum in a series system. With use of the first-order reliability analysis technique, two different single-loop multivariate optimization models are established to obtain the minimum reliabilities and minimum performance measures through sequential quadratic programming algorithm, respectively. Following this, two different double-loop models and a sequential single-loop model are developed. Furthermore, an augmented step length adjustment technique is proposed for inverse reliability analysis, which is integrated into the performance moment integration and percentile difference method to derive the robustness indicators for the design objective. Finally, three illustrative numerical examples and one engineering problem are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution strategies for reliable and robust design optimization with high computational efficiency.},

Although many techniques exist in the literature for coupling incompatible meshes, such as the widely accepted Mortar method, which solves the problem exactly, the proposed method brings two crucial advantages: first, it eliminates the need to compute complex surface integrals on the intersection of the boundary meshes (thanks to the use of techniques adapted from the existing method of localized Lagrange multipliers); and second, and more importantly, we achieve this passing the patch test with comparable accuracy to Mortar. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed coupling technique is demonstrated by comparing its results with other coupling methods and by solving various theoretical and practical examples with exact and experimental solutions in statics and dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Aligning lattice infills with the principal stress directions in loaded objects is crucial for improving stiffness. However, this principle only works for a single loading condition, where the stress field in 2D is described by two orthogonal principal stress directions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for designing and optimizing triangular lattice structures to accommodate multiple loading conditions, i.e., multiple stress fields need to be considered. Our method comprises two main steps: homogenization-based topology optimization and geometry-based de-homogenization. To ensure geometric regularity of the triangular lattices, we propose a simplified version of the general rank-3 laminate and parameterize the design domain using equilateral triangles with unique edge thickness. During optimization, edge thicknesses and orientations are adjusted based on the homogenized properties of the lattice. Our numerical findings demonstrate that this simplification introduces only a slight decrease in stiffness of less than 5% compared to using the general rank-3 laminate, and results in lattice structures with compelling geometric regularity. For geometry-based de-homogenization, we adopt a field-aligned triangulation approach to generate a globally consistent triangle mesh in which each triangle is oriented according to the optimized orientation field. Our approach for handling multiple loading conditions, akin to de-homogenization techniques for single loading conditions, yields highly detailed, optimized and spatially varying lattice structures. The method is computationally efficient, as simulations and optimizations are conducted at a low-resolution discretization of the design domain. Furthermore, since our approach is geometry-based, obtained structures are encoded into a compact geometric format that facilitates downstream operations such as editing and fabrication.},

In this work we provide neural network architectures that provide effective homogenization models of materials with anisotropic components. These models satisfy equivariance and material symmetry principles inherently through a combination of equivariant and tensor basis operations. We demonstrate them on datasets of stochastic volume elements with different textures and phases where the material undergoes elastic and plastic deformation, and show that the these network architectures provide significant performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a unified formulation of topology optimization with a finite strain nonlocal damage model using the continuous adjoint method. For the primal problem to describe the material response including deterioration, we consider the standard Neo–Hookean constitutive model and incorporate crack phase-field theory for brittle fracture within the finite strain framework. For the optimization problem, the objective function is set to accommodate multiple objectives by weighting each sub-function, and the continuous adjoint method is employed to derive the sensitivity. Thus, both the governing equations for primal and adjoint problems are written as strong forms and hold at any moment and at any location in the continuum body or on its boundary. Accordingly, the proposed formulation is independent of the requirements from numerical implementation, such as element type or discretization method. In addition, the reaction–diffusion equation is used to update the design variable in an optimizing process, by which the continuous distribution of the design variable, as well as material properties, are realized. After the basic performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with a simple numerical setup, two-material (matrix and inclusion materials) and single-material (material and null) topology optimizations are presented, and discussions are made.},

  abstract     = {Projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) play a crucial role in simplifying the complex dynamics of fluid systems. Such models are achieved by projecting the Navier-Stokes equations onto a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving essential dynamics. However, this approach requires prior knowledge of the underlying high-fidelity model, limiting its effectiveness when applied to black-box data. This article introduces a novel, non-intrusive, data-driven method–Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (GILD)–for constructing parametric fluid ROMs. Unlike traditional methods, GILD constructs models directly from data, without relying on specific high-fidelity model information. It also employs interpolation within the manifold R ∗ N × q / O q to accommodate parameter variability. Numerical experiments on various fluid dynamics scenarios, including lid-driven cavity flow, flow past a cylinder with varying Reynolds number, and Ahmed body flow with variable geometry, demonstrate GILD’s robust performance across both training and unseen parameter values. GILD’s ability to accurately capture system dynamics and its adaptability to diverse data sources highlight its potential as a powerful tool for constructing parametric reduced-order models in an easy and general way for complex fluid dynamics and beyond.},

Furthermore, addressing the latter two concurrently presents considerable difficulty. In this study, we introduce a framework aimed at mitigating all the above obstacles simultaneously . The objective is to achieve optimal configurations in a notably reduced timeframe eliminating the need for the initial trial-and-error iterations. The topology optimization approach we propose is implemented via precise structural boundary modeling utilizing a body-fitted mesh generated using a Fourier series expanded level-set method. This methodology expedites the exploration of optimal solutions. We employ the covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy to address multimodality, thereby enhancing the optimization process. The implementation of the Fourier-series-expanded level-set method reduces the number of design variables while maintaining accuracy in finite-element analyses by replacing design variables from discretized level-set functions with the coefficients of the Fourier series expansion. To facilitate the exploration of optimal solutions, a method is also introduced for handling box constraints through an adaptive penalty function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we address three distinct problems: mean compliance minimization, heat flux manipulation, and the control of electromagnetic wave scattering. Despite each system being governed by different equations, topology optimization method consistently yields notable acceleration in computational efficiency across all scenarios, and remarkably without requiring initial guesses.},

By analyzing the relationship between tensile strain energy and phase field brittle fracture, it has been found that minimizing tensile strain energy can delay fracture and enhance resistance. Capitalizing on this insight, a new topology optimization method is proposed. This method focuses on minimizing tensile strain energy to suppress the well-documented tension-dominated fracture behavior observed in phase field brittle fracture analysis. In contrast to traditional topology optimization methods based on von Mises stress, this method generates more robust structures under tension. Furthermore, the method can incorporate stress constraints to mitigate the potential for stress concentrations arising from geometric discontinuities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Using phase-field modeling, the mechanical fracture properties of the optimized structures, including peak load, failure displacement, and absorbed elastic energy before fracture, are quantified. Furthermore, experimental tests are also conducted. Both numerical simulations and experimental results are consistently show that structures designed with minimized tensile strain energy exhibit superior fracture toughness. Furthermore, the method offers significant computational efficiency compared to conventional approaches due to its reliance solely on linear elasticity analysis within the optimization process.},

However, the emerging design challenges are concurrent design updating related to sandwich topology, infill configuration and density, which is a design problem with continuous and discrete variables mathematically. In this paper, a concurrent topology optimization is proposed for sandwich structures with multi-configuration and variable-diameter lattice infill. Three design variable fields are employed to describe the fundamental topology considering sandwich structural topology, infill configuration and density simultaneously. Corresponding material interpolation model is developed by combining DSP-based shell-infill description and multi-response latent-variable surrogate model based effective material property calculation. Two-stage design model is formulated as a rough design model considering all design variables followed by a refined design model with only infill density variables, which is developed to strictly satisfy the material allowance constraint due to the mapping between discrete infill configuration variables and continuous latent configuration variables. Corresponding sensitivities of compliance and constraint with respect to the structural topology, infill configuration and density variables are derived, and the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) is employed to solve the design model efficiently. Several numerical examples are presented to systematically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

It is based on hierarchical rank-one sequences and simultaneously provides first and second derivative information essential for the calculation of mechanical stresses and the computational minimisation of discretised energies. For materials, whose microstructure can be well approximated in terms of laminates and where each laminate stage achieves energetic optimality with respect to the current stage, the approximate envelope coincides with the rank-one convex envelope. Although the proposed method provides only an upper bound for the rank-one convex hull, a careful examination of the resulting constraints shows a decent applicability in mechanical problems. Various aspects of the algorithm are discussed, including the restoration of rotational invariance, microstructure reconstruction, comparisons with other semi-convexification algorithms, and mesh independency. Overall, this paper demonstrates the efficiency of the algorithm for both, well-established mathematical benchmark problems as well as nonconvex isotropic finite-strain continuum damage models in two and three dimensions. Thereby, for the first time, a feasible concurrent numerical relaxation is established for an incremental, dissipative large-strain model with relevant applications in engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {We consider the simulation of slender structures immersed in a three-dimensional (3D) flow. By exploiting the special geometric configuration of the slender structures, this particular problem can be modeled by mixed-dimensional coupled equations. Taking advantage of the slenderness of the structure and thus considering 3D/1D coupled problems raise several challenges and difficulties. From a mathematical point of view, these include defining well-posed trace operators of co-dimension two. On the computational standpoint, the non-standard mathematical formulation makes it difficult to ensure the accuracy of the solutions obtained with the mixed-dimensional discrete formulation as compared to a fully resolved one. Here we proposed to circumvent theses issues by imposing the fluid–structure coupling conditions on the 2D fluid–structure interface but in a reduced way still taking advantage of the 1D dynamic of the slender structure. We consider the Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid and a Timoshenko beam model for the structure. We complement these models with a mixed-dimensional version of the fluid–structure interface conditions, based on the projection of kinematic coupling conditions on a finite-dimensional Fourier space on each beam cross section. Furthermore, we develop a discrete fictitious domain formulation within the framework of the finite element method, establish the energy stability of the scheme, provide extensive numerical evidence of the accuracy of the discrete formulation, notably with respect to a fully resolved (ALE based) model and a standard reduced modeling approach.},

  abstract     = {The nonlocal macro-meso damage (NMMD) model has shown promising results in simulating the fracture process of materials. However, due to the inherent limitations of the nonlocal methods, its stability depends on whether the number of elements/nodes within the nonlocal region is sufficient. This paper proposes a discrepancy-informed quadrature strategy for NMMD to address its inherent limitations. Concretely, two discrepancies are defined to evaluate the uniformity of family point distribution within the nonlocal domain, followed by the introduction of a discrepancy-informed nonlocal quadrature strategy. The proposed strategy refines this by discretizing the nonlocal integral domain into finite circles for 2D or spheres for 3D and the discrete family points are uniformly arranged in each layer. This new quadrature strategy ensures relatively uniform distribution of pair points in the nonlocal space of each real material point, thus significantly enhancing the robustness and computational efficiency of the NMMD model. Numerical examples corroborate the strategy in accurately simulating different fracture modes, achieving an average computational speedup of approximately three times. This discrepancy-informed quadrature strategy effectively addresses the element size constraints of the original NMMD quadrature strategy.},

To alleviate this issue, an approximate decoupled approach is introduced for a class of RBDO problems involving linear truss structures subjected to random excitations, with the failure event defined by compliance. This contribution aims to provide an approximate but efficient way for design exploration to facilitate decision-making during the initial design phase. Specifically, the proposed approach converts the original RBDO problem into a deterministic optimization problem through a modest number of reliability analyses by the probability density evolution method (PDEM). Once the deterministic optimization problem is obtained, the solution of the whole RBDO problem can be obtained by solving this equivalent problem without further reliability analysis, resulting in notable enhancement in terms of computational efficiency. In this way, this contribution expands the frontier of application of the operator norm theory within the RBDO framework. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of the proposed approach.},

Probabilistic (Shannon) entropy and probabilistic distance are engaged here to quantify uncertainty propagation of effective characteristics as well as their probabilistic distance to the original composite&#39;s characteristics. Probabilistic entropies fluctuations are contrasted with the traditional moments-based approach while increasing the input statistical scattering of material characteristics. According to the Maximum Entropy Principle Gaussian input parameters are tested as inducing the largest deviations in effective characteristics, but they are compared against some other symmetric distributions. The entire methodology is based upon the response random polynomials relating homogenized characteristics with material and geometrical parameters of the original composites subjected to randomization. Some series of the FEM experiments serve as the basis for the artificial neural network identification and optimization of these polynomials, whose application in conjunction with the Monte-Carlo simulation enables Shannon entropy determination.

  abstract     = {We present a framework for parallel isogeometric boundary element analysis (BEA) of elastic solids on CUDA. To deal with traction discontinuities, we propose a BEA model that supports multiple nodes and semi-discontinuous elements. The multiplicity of a node is defined by the number of regions containing any element influenced by the node. A region is a group of connected elements delimited by a closed crease curve. The default shape function of an element is determined by a linear operator applied to a set of basis functions. A BEA model is supposed to be generated from a watertight boundary representation of a solid. In this paper, we employ bicubic analysis-suitable T-splines. In this case, the shape of an element is defined by its Bézier extraction operator applied to the tensor product of Bernstein polynomials of degree 3. We describe the data structures of the BEA model and the main algorithms of the analysis pipeline on CUDA. In particular, we describe two strategies for parallel assembling of the linear system of equations. We also introduce a novel approach for inside integration based on the subdivision of the singular region in triangles with constant aspect ratio. In the T-splines context, we extend the Bézier extraction to handle unstructured T-meshes with crease edges. Moreover, we propose a scheme for embedding the influence of linked tangency handles on the shape of an element directly into the Bézier extraction operator. Such an embedding enables the removal of the corresponding nodes from the BEA model and the application of an alternative collocation method we discuss in the paper. We present several experiments to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that the GPU can be advantageously employed for parallelizing T-spline-based isogeometric analysis using boundary elements, achieving a speedup of up to 29x compared to the sequential code on a current laptop. We make the BEA code available in a prototype in MATLAB with a graphical interface that allows users to apply boundary conditions and visualize analysis results on the boundary.},

  abstract     = {In practical engineering, a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) structure generally features a significant number of correlated input parameters and output responses. Sensitivity analysis is usually adopted to select key parameters for improving the computational efficiency of structural analysis and design processes. Traditional sensitivity analysis methods based on probabilistic models for MIMO structures may not reliably and efficiently derive the sensitivity indexes of correlated input parameters with limited samples. To solve the above problems, a novel sensitivity analysis method for MIMO structures considering non-probabilistic correlations is proposed to estimate the influence of uncertainties and correlations among the parameters on the responses in a unified framework. Firstly, a multidimensional parallelepiped (MP) model is employed to quantify the uncertainties and non-probabilistic correlations among the parameters. A new non-probabilistic variance propagation equation based on the MP model is then proposed to derive the non-probabilistic variances of output responses. The non-probabilistic independent, correlated, and total sensitivity indexes of each parameter for multi-input-single-output (MISO) structures are defined according to the non-probabilistic variance contribution rates. A dimensional normalization method and a vector projection method are then adopted to extend the non-probabilistic sensitivity indexes of each parameter for MIMO structures with correlations. Two numerical examples and an experimental example are exemplified to verify the proficiency and efficiency of the currently proposed method.},

  abstract     = {An approach is proposed to accelerate multiscale simulations of heterogeneous quasi-brittle materials exhibiting an anisotropic damage response. The present technique uses unsupervised machine learning classification based on k-means clustering to select integration points in the macro mesh within an FE 2 2 strategy to track redundant micro nonlinear problems and to avoid unnecessary Representative Volume Element (RVE) calculations. More specifically, a classification vector including strains and internal damage variables is defined for each macro integration point. The macro internal damage variables are constructed using harmonic analysis of damage. At each step of the macro iterations, the integrations points are grouped into clusters and only one nonlinear problem is solved for each cluster. As a result, the computations are accelerated within an FE 2 2 scheme by reducing the total number of RVE problems to be solved. The developed algorithm includes a macro regularization and an arc-length technique to capture macro snap-back due to the softening. Applications are proposed to simulate the response of different heterogeneous quasi-brittle materials with strong anisotropic responses. speed-up factors of the order of 12 to 15 can be achieved without the need to build a database, and without reduced-order modeling approximations at the micro level. Estimates of structural strength can be obtained with Speed-up factors between 45 and 85.},

However, traditional time-stepping algorithms for solution of the corresponding dual problem run backwards-in-time, which due to additional storage requirements might become a serious drawback when an extensive number of time steps for the FEM simulation arises. In this paper, we take advantage of an end-boundary-value-problem (EBVP) associated to IBVP, with corresponding dual-problem running forwards in time. In order to obtain a unified framework for numerical approximation of primal and dual weak forms for both, IBVP and EBVP, respectively, we apply the concept of downwind and upwind approximations not only to the trial functions but also to the test functions. This results into eight different integration schemes. On this basis, as a main result of this contribution, a time-stepping algorithm is obtained, which runs forwards-in-time for the dual problem and therefore avoids the additional storage requirements of the traditional backwards-in-time stepping procedures. The presented algorithm is numerically tested and validated for a CT-specimen for elastic and elasto-plastic behavior, where the constitutive equations are written in Prandtl–Reuss type format.},

The proposed approach combines an adaptive multi-patch isogeometric analysis (MP-IGA) and length-scale insensitive PF-CZM. The formulation captures the distinct critical energy release rates for Mode-I and Mode-II fractures, which is crucial for predicting mixed-mode thermo-mechanical fracture behavior in isotropic rock-like materials. The PF-CZM governing equations are solved with isogeometric analysis based on locally refined non-uniform rational B-splines (LR NURBS), and the complex structural geometry is exactly described with multiple LR NURBS patches. The field variables, such as displacement, phase-field, and temperature at the interface of adjacent patches, are coupled using Nitsche’s method. To enhance the computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy, a refinement-correction adaptive scheme combined with the structured mesh refinement strategy is developed. The proposed framework is validated against recent numerical and experimental results in the literature, particularly in the context of capturing complex behavior of mixed-mode crack propagation in isotropic rock-like materials subjected to thermo-mechanical loading.},

  abstract     = {In the phase-field modeling of fracture, the search for a physically reasonable and computationally feasible criterion to split the elastic energy density into fractions that may or may not contribute to crack propagation has been the subject of many recent studies. Within this context, we propose an energy split – or energy decomposition – aimed at accurately representing the evolution of a crack under load reversal. To this purpose, two key assumptions are made. First, the damage gradient direction is interpreted as being representative of the normal-to-crack direction, as already assumed in previous works in the literature. The second assumption consists of considering the sign of the projection of the stress tensor onto the damage gradient direction at a point as an indicator of whether this point should behave as an opening or as a closing crack. We associate the latter case (crack closing) to both (a) a complete recovery of elastic energy density of the intact material (i.e., perfectly rough crack surfaces) and (b) a zero crack driving force at that point. The first case (crack opening) is treated classically as a damageable material point at which damage can increase. The implementation of the proposed approach turns out to be remarkably simple and computationally robust. For the evaluation of the displacements and damage gradients at nodes, the classical Z 2 Z2 technique is used, and a new effective and computationally convenient iterative strategy is implemented to guarantee convergence of the staggered scheme. Four examples are presented in order to assess the suitability of the present model by using both AT1 and AT2 regularization models. Results show the desired effect of limiting crack propagation to prevailing tensile states, as well as of recovering the initial intact stiffness upon load reversal, even when two of the most common energy splits fail.},

The key aspect of the proposed method is that it extends the solution into the fictitious domain in a way that ensures high global regularity. Continuity of the solution across the interface is enforced through a boundary Lagrange multiplier. The subdomains coupling, however, is not achieved by means of the duality pairing with the Lagrange multiplier, but through an L 2 L2 product with the H 1 H1 Riesz representative of the latter, thus avoiding gradient jumps across the interface. Thanks to the enhanced regularity, the proposed method attains an increase, with respect to standard FD methods, of up to one order of convergence in energy norm. The Finite Element formulation of the method is presented, followed by its analysis. Numerical tests on a model problem demonstrate its effectiveness and its superior accuracy compared to standard unfitted methods.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty quantification is a critical aspect of machine learning models for material property predictions. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a popular technique for capturing uncertainties, but most existing models assume homoscedastic aleatoric uncertainty (noise), which may not adequately represent the heteroscedastic behavior observed in real-world datasets. Heteroscedasticity arises from various factors, such as measurement errors and inherent variability in material properties. Ignoring heteroscedasticity can lead to lower model performance, biased uncertainty estimates, and inaccurate predictions. Existing Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression (HGPR) models often employ complicated structures to capture input-dependent noise but may lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose an HGPR approach that combines GPR with polynomial regression-based noise modeling to capture and quantify uncertainties in material property predictions while providing interpretable noise models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and physics-based simulation datasets, including mechanical properties (effective stress) of porous materials. We also introduce an approximated expected log predictive density method for model selection, which eliminates the need for retraining the model during leave-one-out cross-validation, allowing for efficient hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation. By capturing heteroscedastic behavior, enhancing interpretability, and improving model selection, our approach contributes to the development of more robust and reliable machine learning models for material property predictions, enabling informed decision-making in material design and optimization.},

Based on the strain spectral decomposition, we decompose the structural elastic strain energy into tensile and compressive portions. In the density-based topology optimization framework, we use the gradient-based method to track the interface between multiple materials. Then, we construct an interface-associated scalar field to penalize the tensile portion of the strain energy, causing a pseudo-degradation of the strain energy at the interface region. Finally, within limited material usages and by minimizing the linear weighted structural strain energy and its pseudo-degradation, multi-material topology optimization with improved interface configuration is achieved. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are investigated, by which the effectiveness and robustness of the suggested approach are fairly validated.},

  abstract     = {While shape optimization using isogeometric shells exhibits appealing features by integrating design geometries and analysis models, challenges arise when addressing computer-aided design (CAD) geometries comprised of multiple non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) patches, which are common in practice. The intractability stems from surface intersections within these CAD models. In this paper, we develop an approach for shape optimization of non-matching isogeometric shells incorporating intersection movement. Separately parametrized NURBS surfaces are modeled using Kirchhoff–Love shell theory and coupled using a penalty-based formulation. The optimization scheme allows shell patches to move without preserving relative location with other members during the shape optimization. This flexibility is achieved through an implicit state function, and analytical sensitivities are derived for the relative movement of shell patches. The introduction of differentiable intersections expands the design space and overcomes challenges associated with large mesh distortion, particularly when optimal shapes involve significant movement of patch intersections in physical space. Throughout optimization iterations, all members within the shell structures maintain the NURBS geometry representation, enabling efficient integration of analysis and design models. The optimization approach leverages the multilevel design concept by selecting a refined model for accurate analysis from a coarse design model while maintaining the same geometry. We adopt several example problems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and demonstrate its applicability to the optimization of the internal stiffeners of an aircraft wing.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel quasi-conservative arbitrary high order accurate ADER (Arbitrary-Derivative) discontinuous Galerkin method allowing to efficiently use a non-conservative form of the considered partial differential system, so that the governing equations can be solved directly in the most physically relevant set of variables. This is particularly interesting for multi-material flows with moving interfaces and steep, large magnitude contact discontinuities, as well as in presence of highly non-linear thermodynamics. However, the non-conservative formulation of course introduces a conservation error which would normally lead to a wrong approximation of shock waves. Hence, from the theoretical point of view, we give a formal definition of the conservation defect of non-conservative schemes and we analyze this defect providing a local quasi-conservation condition, which allows us to prove a modified Lax–Wendroff theorem . Within this formalism, we also reformulate classical results concerning smooth solutions, contact discontinuities and moving interfaces. Then, to deal with shock waves in practice, we exploit the framework of the so-called a posteriori subcell finite volume (FV) limiter, so that, in troubled cells appropriately detected, we can incorporate a local conservation correction. Our corrected FV update entirely removes the local conservation defect, allowing, at least formally, to fit in the hypotheses of the proposed modified Lax–Wendroff theorem. Here, the shock-triggered troubled cells are detected by combining physical admissibility criteria, a discrete maximum principle and a shock sensor inspired by Lagrangian hydrodynamics. To prove the capabilities of our novel approach, first, we show that we are able to recover the same results given by conservative schemes on classical benchmarks for the single-fluid Euler equations. We then conclude the presentation by showing the improved reliability of our scheme on the multi-fluid Euler system on examples like the interaction of a shock with a helium bubble for which we are able to avoid the development of any spurious oscillations.},

  abstract     = {We develop a model for predicting the mechanical behavior of a system of slender one-dimensional bodies (fibers or beams) interacting via frictional contact. Relying on an integral penalty-based formulation, it can robustly capture the behavior in the case of conforming contact occurring over regions of finite size. Two formulations of the model are presented and validated against fully resolved continuum finite element simulations. Overall, the proposed framework is an effective tool in exploring the mechanical behavior of fabrics, textiles as well as three-dimensional frictional architected solids, as demonstrated by the simulation of the effective response of a periodic intertwined metamaterial.},

  abstract     = {Despite advancements in predicting the constitutive relationships of composite materials, characterizing the effects of microstructural randomness on their mechanical behaviors remains challenging. In this study, we propose a data-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) to efficiently predict the stress-strain curves containing three key material features (Tensile strength, modulus, and toughness) of fiber reinforced composites. Firstly, stress-strain curves for composites with arbitrary fiber distributions were generated using experimentally validated peridynamics (PD) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then employed to learn these curves in a lower-dimensional space, reducing computational costs. Subsequently, these reduced data, along with randomly distributed microstructural features, were used to train, validate, and evaluate the CNN models. The combined CNN and PCA model accurately predicted stress-strain curves with maximum errors of 2.5 % for tensile strength, 10% for modulus, and 20 % for toughness. Furthermore, data augmentation and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a loss function significantly enhanced the model&#39;s prediction accuracy. Our findings indicated that DenseNet121 outperformed other CNN models in predicting the properties of fiber-reinforced materials, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model. This work successfully demonstrates the applicability of a data-driven CNN approach to predict stress-strain relations for engineering materials with intricate heterogeneous microstructures, paving the way for data-driven computational mechanics applied in composites.},

  abstract     = {In the finite element method framework, a fluid–structure formulation is developed by coupling an Eulerian fixed-mesh fluid approach with a Lagrangian deforming-mesh description for a flexible solid. The coupled formulation is solved using a staggered scheme during time. For the fluid solution stage, the solid walls are considered as a time-variable internal boundary. The velocity and pressure fields are obtained by solving the weak form of the fluid dynamic equations in which the solid velocity is imposed on the internal boundary via a penalization term. For the solid solution stage, the displacement field is obtained by solving the discrete solid dynamic equations which consider traction forces computed by integrating pressures and viscous stresses on the nodes belonging to the solid walls. This novel technique is firstly applied to analyze a flexible splitter under the shedding of a flow past square cylinder due to this problem is considered as a benchmark in the literature. The present solutions agree with those computed using body-fitted techniques, thus validating the proposal. Secondly, flexible splitter motions under the shedding of flow past cylinders with different cross-sections and splitter lengths are comprehensively studied. Overall, the computed results confirmed that the hydrodynamic coefficients on the cylinders were reduced because of the presence of the splitter.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stability-preserving model reduction method for an acoustic finite element model with perfectly matched layers (PMLs). PMLs are often introduced into an unbounded domain to simulate the Sommerfeld radiation condition. These layers act as anisotropic damping materials to absorb the scattered field, of which the material properties are frequency- and coordinate-dependent. The corresponding time-domain model size is often very large due to this frequency-dependent property and the number of elements needed per wavelength. Therefore, to enable efficient transient simulations, this paper proposes a two-step method to generate stable reduced order models (ROMs) of such systems. Firstly, the modified and stable version of PMLs is projected by a one-sided split basis, which gives a stable intermediate ROM. Secondly, the intermediate ROM is modified to satisfy the stability-preserving condition by applying the modal transformation. Applying any one-sided model order reduction method on this modified model leads to a stable and small ROM. This two-step method is further extended to account for the locally-conformal PML model by reformulating it in curvilinear coordinates, which works for arbitrary convex truncated domains. The proposed method is successfully verified by several numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and efficiently achieving the uncertainty quantification of engineering structures is a challenging issue. The direct probability integral method (DPIM) provides an effective pathway to address this issue. However, the key partition technique via Voronoi cell of DPIM requires a prohibitive computational burden for multi-dimensional probability space. Moreover, due to the distributed nonuniformity of representative points, the accuracy of DPIM with the partition technique via Voronoi cell (DPIM-Voronoi) for obtaining the response probability density function (PDF) of structures with multi-dimensional probability space still needs to be improved. To this end, a novel weight index-based uniform partition technique is proposed in this study. This technique can generate uniformly distributed representative points and calculate their assigned probabilities using the weight indexes of representative regions. This feature ensures that the representative points can fill the probability space in a highly uniform manner, and avoid the resource-consuming calculation process of assigned probability by Monte Carlo simulation in the original partition technique via Voronoi cell. Based on the proposed technique, DPIM with a Weight index-based Uniform partition technique (DPIM-WU) is developed. Compared to DPIM-Voronoi, the advantages of DPIM-WU include: (1) improving the computational accuracy of response PDF for structures with multi-dimensional probability space, especially in the tail region, leading to improved accuracy of the dynamic reliability; (2) remarkably reducing the computational cost, with minimal computer memory required for the partition process of multi-dimensional probability space; (3) enhancing the robustness to the number of representative points. These advantages are verified through the stochastic response and dynamic reliability analyses of four typical examples, including the 5-story buildings, dry friction system, cylinder structure, and adjacent buildings with pounding motion. Notably, in the stochastic pounding response analysis of adjacent buildings, a stochastic P-bifurcation occurs as the coefficient of variation of the structural parameters decreases.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop a novel energy-stable linear approach, which we name as auxiliary variable viscosity splitting (AVVS) method, to efficiently solve the incompressible fluid flows. Different from the projection-type methods with pressure correction, the AVVS method adopts the viscosity splitting strategy to split the original momentum equation into an intermediate momentum equation without divergence-free constraint and an advection-free momentum equation. A time-dependent auxiliary variable which has exact value 1 is introduced to construct a supplementary equation. The new model not only inherits the same dynamics of original incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, but also facilitates us to design linearly decoupled and energy-stable time-marching scheme. Comparing with the conventional projection-type schemes, the present method leads to an energy dissipation law with respect to kinetic energy instead of a modified energy including velocity and pressure gradient. In each time step, only two parabolic equations with constant coefficients and one Poisson equation need to be solved. Therefore, the numerical implementation is highly efficient. Moreover, the proposed AVVS method can be directly extended to construct linear, decoupled, and energy-stable scheme for the turbidity current system with slight modifications on the right-hand side of supplementary equation. Extensive numerical experiments are implemented to validate the accuracy, energy stability, and capability in complex fluid simulations.},

Traditional grid-based contact approaches often face issues with mesh dependency, while material point-based methods can be computationally intensive. To address these challenges, this study develops a novel mortar segment-to-segment frictional contact approach for MPM. We first introduce boundary vertices and propose an innovative kinematic update scheme for precise representation of the boundaries of the continuum media and their continuously evolving contact normals throughout the contact process. Then, we construct a weak form of contact constraints based on the mortar method to facilitate a stable segment-to-segment contact detection. To rigorously ensure the non-penetration condition, the energetic barrier method is further adopted and implemented in MPM for enforcing the contact constraints. The proposed kinematic update scheme for boundary vertices is first verified through a cantilever beam benchmark test. The verified framework is further examined through a wide range of contact scenarios, including rolling, sliding, collision of two rings, and multi-body contacts, in both small and finite deformations. The simulation results are thoroughly discussed, highlighting the significant improvements in accuracy and versatility. Potential limitations of the proposed method are also examined.},

This paper proposes a novel problem-independent machine learning enhanced high-precision stress calculation method (PIML-HPSCM) to address this challenge. As an immersed analysis method, PIML-HPSCM combines the high efficiency of fixed mesh with the accuracy of body-fitted mesh, without complex integration schemes of other immersed methods. PIML-HPSCM utilizes the extended multiscale finite element method to depict the material heterogeneity within high-resolution boundary elements. The accurate stress field can then be calculated conveniently by establishing stress evaluation matrices of high-resolution boundary elements. Moreover, the PIML is independent of problem settings and is applicable for various problems with the same governing equation type. Invoking the offline-trained neural network online can enhance stress calculation efficiency by 10–20 times. The stress-based discrete variable topology optimization, which naturally avoids singular stress phenomenon, is efficiently addressed by the sequential approximate integer programming method with PIML-HPSCM. Results from 2D and 3D examples demonstrate that the stresses calculated by PIML-HPSCM are consistent with those by body-fitted mesh, and optimized designs effectively eliminate stress concentrations of initial designs and have uniform stress distributions.},

In the current work, the critical intention is to develop a CAD-oriented parallel-computing design framework for arbitrary structures, where the Parametric Level Set Method (PLSM) is employed for shape and topology optimization. Firstly, an implicit identification model is constructed for generating a signed distance field using the vertex and normal information from the ‘STL’ file of engineering structures. The signed distance field is combined with the compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) to solve the initial level set function with a parametrization. This method is applied to present all domains, including design domains, Neumann boundary domains, Dirichlet boundary domains, and non-design domains. Secondly, the CPU parallel strategy is considered for allocating partitions of structural stiffness matrix in finite element analysis to different CPU cores for the parallel-computing to save computation costs. Thirdly, a parallel-computing design formulation is developed for performing shape and topology optimization of arbitrary structures, in which the partitioned terms of all design variables and stiffness matrix are concurrently computed on each CPU core. Finally, several classic benchmarks and the critical engineering structure of Virtual Reality (VR) glass part with extremely complex geometries, are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed design framework.},

  abstract     = {The quasi-brittle response of cohesive-frictional materials in numerical simulations is commonly represented by softening plasticity or continuum damage models, either individually or in combination. However, classical models, particularly when coupled with non-associated plasticity, often suffer from ill-posedness and a lack of objectivity in numerical simulations. Moreover, the performance of the finite element method significantly degrades in simulations involving finite strains when mesh distortion reaches excessive levels. This represents a challenge for modeling cohesive-frictional materials, given their tendency to experience strongly localized deformations, such as those occurring during shear band dominated failure. Hence, accurate modeling of the response of cohesive-frictional solids is a demanding task. To address these challenges, we present an extension of the material point method (MPM) for the unified gradient-enhanced micropolar continuum, aiming at the analysis of finite localized inelastic deformations in cohesive-frictional materials. The generalized gradient-enhanced micropolar continuum formulation is employed to tackle challenges related to localization and softening material behavior, while the MPM addresses issues arising from excessive deformations. The method utilizes a B-spline formulation for the rigid background mesh to mitigate the well-known cell crossing errors of the MPM. To demonstrate the performance of the method, 2D and 3D numerical studies on localized failure in sandstone in plane strain compression and triaxial extension tests are presented. A comparison with finite element results confirms the suitability of the formulation. Moreover, an efficient numerical implementation of the formulation is presented, and it is demonstrated that the additional MPM specific overhead is negligible.},

The DDCM approach has been extended to include strategies for recovering isotropic behaviour and local smoothing of data. These have proven to be critical in certain cases and increase accuracy in most cases. The NN approach contains certain elements to enforce principles such as material symmetry, thermodynamic consistency, and convexity. In order to provide a fair comparison between the approaches, they use the same data and solve the same numerical problems with a selection of problems highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Both the DDCM and the NNs have shown acceptable performance. The DDCM performed better when applied to cases similar to those from which the data is gathered from, albeit at the expense of generality, whereas NN models were more advantageous when applied to wider range of applications.},

  abstract     = {In the field of damage identification, traditional regularization methods neglect the impact of uncertainty factors on the selection of regularization parameters, leading to a decrease in the accuracy of damage identification. Therefore, this study proposes a damage identification based on interval truncated singular value decomposition (DI-ITSVD) method that considers the uncertainty in the selection of regularization parameter. This method treats model errors and measurement noise as interval uncertainties, and introduces the quantified uncertainties into the damage identification solutions through uncertainty propagation methods to determine the interval boundary. Uncertainty regularization parameters are selected to balance residuals and solutions using interval and generalized cross-validation methods. The key aspect of the proposed method in this paper is the integration of interval uncertainty propagation with the truncated singular value decomposition method to ensure the accuracy and stability of the damage identification equation solution. A numerical example of a 29-bar planar truss has been performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The superiority of this method is verified by comparing the identification results with other improved truncated singular value decomposition methods. Finally, the practical application effect of the proposed method was also verified through an experimental work.},

The framework eliminates reliance on complex constitutive models and phenomenological assumptions, especially avoiding the coupling tangent terms with a given material database. The interfacial chemical potential and its jumps are used to expand the phase space for describing the chemical states of interfaces. Subsequently, a novel chemo-mechanical distance norm, including traction-separation pair, interfacial chemical potential-concentration pair and corresponding chemical potential jump-flux pair, is presented. Momentum conservation law for interfacial tractions and mass conservation law for interfacial concentration are enforced via Lagrange multipliers. For tracking the history-dependent state of the interface damage, an internal variable, termed interface integrity, is introduced to condition the interfacial database and manage the subsets mapping strategies, following physically motivated evolution constraints. Numerical examples are conducted to investigate the efficiency and capability of the present framework. A monotonic loading test validates a good numerical convergence relative to the number of data points. Subsequent cyclic loading simulations, compared with the reference solutions, show that the algorithm is well suitable to predict the history-dependent interface damage evolution under complex loading paths. Finally, the chemo-mechanically coupled examples capture phenomena such as interfacial swelling and interface degradation induced by transient diffusion and stress-driven diffusion. The current work provides a promising tool for understanding chemo-mechanical behaviors of interfaces within heterogeneous composites.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting of stochastic ductile failures in fabrication and service stages are challenging tasks of advanced structures in practical engineering. Due to the prohibitive costs of repetitive experimental tests to quantify optimal failure-related parameters, numerous studies have turned to simulation-based uncertainty quantification. However, the credibility of these approaches is frequently doubted by the function-generated distribution of random data involved. Thus, an accurate assessment of the material parameters ascertains the appropriate estimation of uncertain parameters, which is essential for the risk/safety assessment of structures in different stages. In this paper, a full-field experiment-aided virtual modelling framework for inverse-based prediction of stochastic elastoplastic failure (EVMF-ISP) is proposed to deliver precise insights regarding the effective distribution range of mechanical parameters. To this end, all available experiment observations serve as the reference for assessing the prior and posterior probability density of the unknown parameters through the real-time inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) module. The framework can be divided into three parts, where initially a pre-virtual model (PRVM) is formulated, and Bayesian inference is implemented to propagate the experiment observations backwards to ascertain the uncertain parameters. Then, an advanced multidimensional slice sampling method is developed to deal with the derived complex posterior probability density function (PDF) of mechanical parameters. In the end, a reliable stochastic elastoplastic analysis can be conducted with the revised uncertain samples and finalised with post-virtual models (POVMs) for the concerned structures. Such that, accurate and efficient determination of nonlinear response of structures can be directly predicted. The EVMF-ISP framework is logically presented and thoroughly illustrated with practical applications.},

  abstract     = {We present a fully explicit dynamic formulation for geometrically exact shear-deformable beams. The starting point of this work is an existing isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) formulation which is explicit in the strict sense of the time integration algorithm, but still requires a system matrix inversion due to the use of a consistent mass matrix. Moreover, in that work, the efficiency was also limited by an iterative solution scheme needed due to the presence of a nonlinear term in the time-discretized rotational balance equation. In the present paper, we address these limitations and propose a novel fully explicit formulation able to preserve high-order accuracy in space. This is done by extending a predictor–multicorrector approach, originally proposed for standard elastodynamics, to the case of the rotational dynamics of geometrically exact beams. The procedure relies on decoupling the Neumann boundary conditions and on a rearrangement and rescaling of the mass matrix. We demonstrate that an additional gain in terms of computational cost is obtained by properly removing the angular velocity-dependent nonlinear term in the rotational balance equation without any significant loss in terms of accuracy. The high-order spatial accuracy and the improved efficiency of the proposed formulation compared to the existing one are demonstrated through some numerical experiments covering different combinations of boundary conditions.},

This model is a system of two semilinear parabolic partial differential equations describing the evolution and mutual interaction of biological species. This article presents and analyzes a high-order discretization method for the numerical approximation of the heterodimer model capable of handling complex geometries. In particular, the proposed numerical scheme couples a Discontinuous Galerkin method on polygonal/polyhedral grids for space discretization, with a θ θ -method for time integration. This work presents novelties and progress with respect to the mathematical literature, as stability and a-priori error analysis for the heterodimer model are carried out for the first time. Several numerical tests are performed, which demonstrate the theoretical convergence rates, and show good performances of the method in approximating traveling wave solutions as well as its flexibility in handling complex geometries. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested in a practical test case stemming from neuroscience applications, namely the simulation of the spread of α α -synuclein in a realistic test case of Parkinson’s disease in a two-dimensional sagittal brain section geometry reconstructed from medical images.},

The main features include the use of an energy norm for the VE projection, a high-order divergence-free interpolation for stresses and a piecewise constant interpolation for plastic multipliers within element subdomains. The HVEM does not require any stabilization term, unlike classical VEM formulations which are affected by the choice of stabilization parameters. The algorithmic tangent matrix is derived consistently and analytically. A standard strain-driven formulation and a Backward-Euler time integration scheme are adopted. The return mapping process for the stress evaluation is formulated at the element level to preserve the stress interpolation as plasticity evolves. Even though general constitutive laws can be readily considered, to test the robustness of HVEM, an elastic-perfectly plastic behavior is adopted. In such a case, the return mapping process is efficiently solved using a Sequential Quadratic Programming Algorithm. The solution is free from volumetric locking and from spurious hardening effects that are observed in stabilized VEM. The numerical results confirm the accuracy of HVEM for rough meshes and high rate of convergence in recovering the collapse load.},

  abstract     = {Discretizations based on the Bubnov-Galerkin method and the isoparametric concept suffer from membrane locking when applied to Kirchhoff–Love shell formulations. Membrane locking causes not only smaller displacements than expected, but also large-amplitude spurious oscillations of the membrane forces. Continuous-assumed-strain (CAS) elements were originally introduced to remove membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of linear plane curved Kirchhoff rods (Casquero et al., CMAME, 2022). In this work, we propose CAS s CASs and CAS ns CASns elements to overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff–Love shells. CAS s CASs and CAS ns CASns elements are interpolation-based assumed-strain locking treatments. The assumed strains have C 0 C0 continuity across element boundaries and different components of the membrane strains are interpolated at different interpolation points. CAS s CASs elements use the assumed strains to obtain both the physical strains and the virtual strains, which results in a global tangent matrix which is a symmetric matrix. CAS ns CASns elements use the assumed strains to obtain only the physical strains, which results in a global tangent matrix which is a non-symmetric matrix. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, CAS s CASs and CAS ns CASns elements are the first assumed-strain treatments to effectively overcome membrane locking in quadratic NURBS-based discretizations of geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff–Love shells while satisfying the following important characteristics for computational efficiency: (1) No additional unknowns are added, (2) No additional systems of algebraic equations need to be solved, (3) The same elements are used to approximate the displacements and the assumed strains, (4) No additional matrix operations such as matrix inversions or matrix multiplications are needed to obtain the stiffness matrix, and (5) The nonzero pattern of the stiffness matrix is preserved. Analogously to the interpolation-based assumed-strain locking treatments for Lagrange polynomials that are widely used in commercial FEA software, the implementation of CAS s CASs and CAS ns CASns elements only requires to modify the subroutine that computes the element residual vector and the element tangent matrix. The benchmark problems show that CAS s CASs and CAS ns CASns elements, using either 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 Gauss–Legendre quadrature points per element, are effective locking treatments since these element types result in more accurate displacements for coarse meshes and excise the spurious oscillations of the membrane forces.},

In this paper, we develop a physics-informed machine-learning architecture built specifically for solving thermal conductivity problems. Originally developed for mechanical problems, we extend and develop a deep material network (DMN) that incorporates (i) principles from thermal homogenization directly into the network architecture in which nodes propagate heat flux and temperature gradient (as opposed to stress and strain in the original ‘mechanical’ DMN) and (ii) nodal rotations to capture the topological complexity of the materials’ microstructure. The result is a ‘thermal’ DMN better suited for thermal conductivity problems than the ‘mechanical’ deep material network. We demonstrate the ability of this ‘thermal’ DMN to act as an accurate reduced order model with a significantly smaller number of degrees of freedom on two different woven microstructures examples. Our results show that the ‘thermal’ DMN can not only accurately predict the averaged effective thermal conductivity of these complex weaved composite structures but also the distribution of local heat flux and temperature gradients. Based on these performances, we show how this ‘thermal’ DMN can be exercised for rapid uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to assess microstructure effects and variability of the properties of the composite’s constituents, a task that would be otherwise computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Based on its architecture, the ‘thermal’ DMN opens possibilities for multiscale, multiphysics simulations for a heterogeneous structure, especially when coupled with its mechanical counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Modeling subsurface flow and transport phenomena is essential for addressing a wide range of challenges in engineering, hydrology, and ecology. The Richards equation is a cornerstone for simulating infiltration, and when coupled with advection–dispersion equations, it provides insights into solute transport. However, the complexity of this coupled model increases significantly when dealing with multiple solute transport. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a flexible technique that merges data-driven approaches with the underlying physics principles, enabling the direct incorporation of physical laws or constraints into the neural network training process. Nevertheless, employing PINNs for solving multi-physics problems can present challenges during training, particularly in achieving convergence to realistic concentration profiles. Our study introduces a transfer learning technique to tackle the challenge of modeling multiple species transport in unsaturated soils. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of the PINN framework by decoupling the training process and solving the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) sequentially. We incorporate various strategies to optimize and accelerate the training process. Specifically, we begin by solving the Richards equation and then transfer the acquired knowledge to subsequent solute PINN solvers. This strategy leverages the fact that these PDEs have some similarities in their structure as advection–diffusion equations. To rigorously validate our approach, we conduct 1D numerical experiments and extend our analysis to encompass 2D problems, and inverse problems for homogeneous soils, as well as numerical tests using layered soils. Our findings indicate that transferring learned features is more advantageous than utilizing random features, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

The gradient smoothing technique simplifies the processing of the hanging nodes and ensures the mesh density of the Cartesian elements.

In this research, we introduce a novel physics-informed model architecture which can generalize to various discrete representations of PDE parameters and irregular domain shapes. Particularly, inspired by deep operator neural networks, our model involves a discretization-independent learning of parameter embedding repeatedly, and this parameter embedding is integrated with the response embeddings through multiple compositional layers, for more expressivity. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The present study reports a family of iterative domain decomposition method for the static structural analysis, labeled as AFETI-DO and its variants ( AFETI-DOc and AFETI-DOci ), all of which employ a recently developed Displacement-Only (DO) partitioned formulation (Park et al., 2023). The DO partitioned equation ( P d f − Kd = 0 Pdf−Kd=0 ) consists of the applied force f f , the block-diagonal stiffness matrix ( K K ) for each partition, the coupling projection operator ( P d Pd ), and the unknown partitioned displacements ( d d ). Numerical experiments with the AFETI-DO and its two variants demonstrate that, while their performance is comparable to existing iterative solution algorithms for homogeneous problems, for highly heterogeneous two and three-dimensional problems the proposed methods yield an accurate convergence threshold compared with the FETI-DP method (Farhat et al., 2001). For fourth-order elasticity problems (i.e., thin plates and shells), the present methods offer a comparable accuracy and computational effort required with the FETI-DP method. In addition, while not extensive, the numerical performance of the proposed AFETI-DO method and its variants appear to exhibit scalability and improved accuracy, provided the preconditioners are paired with the commensurate heterogeneities.},

The following are addressed: (1) Firstly, it is claimed that 16 parameters were introduced (somewhat misleading as evident in what follows) to obtain a more generalized single-step mathematical formulation. We show that 4 conditions are made redundant with minimum consistency requirements, and thus, the framework is not new and is identical to the original version of the GS4-II computational framework with 12 parameters. (2) Then, the overshooting behavior is revisited, and the analysis, missteps, and information are clarified and corrected in this paper, which is significant. (3) Next, the time shift phenomenon is also revisited to show the recovery of the order of time accuracy in the acceleration, which is misunderstood in much of the existing literature. (4) Lastly, each design in the so-called newly proposed schemes already exists and is found in the GS4-II computational framework. In particular, via GS4-II we additionally prove and demonstrate that the so-called “Optimal Equivalent Single-step with Single parameter (OESS)” scheme by Zhang ( CMAME , 418(2024), 116503) is nothing but identical to the existing Three-Parameters Optimal/Generalized- α α method within the GS4-II framework for physically undamped problems. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to point out that also within the GS4-II framework, for physically damped problems, U0/U0 ∗ ∗ , TPO/G- α α , and OESS all share the same undesired overshooting deficiency in comparison to V0/V0 ∗ ∗ .

This paper employs the minimum compliance model constrained by volume to optimize the density of the macrostructure, considering three types of design variables: the element density of the macrostructure, the initial microstructure value, and its deformation parameters. Concurrently, microstructures are generated starting from an initial microstructure using the thermal diffusion process and then are optimized through backward derivation. The proposed TVCTO offers flexible adaptability to various working conditions while significantly mitigating dependence on initial input microstructures.

However, part design for hybrid manufacturing has mostly been done by experts with rare support from computational design algorithms. Hence, the primary contribution of this work is to propose a solution for HASM-oriented structural topology optimization that incorporates both dynamic process planning and accessibility constraints. This novel optimization algorithm is developed under a unified SIMP and magic needle framework. Two sets of design variables are proposed: one for the topological description while the other for identifying the printing stage-related subdivisions. Accordingly, a series of additive manufacturing (AM) and subtractive manufacturing (SM) dedicated geometric constraints are developed based on these design variables to enable the cutting tool and laser head accessibility. Supported by the sensitivities, the structural geometry and fabrication fields can be simultaneously optimized. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proved through several numerical and experimental case studies. All the factors of cutting tool directions, HASM stages, and specific tool shapes are thorough investigated.},

Coupling the sensitivity enhancement to arbitrary Polynomial Chaos allows the formulation to be extended to a wide range of stochastic processes, including multi-modal, fat-tailed, and truncated probability distributions. In so doing, this work addresses two of the barriers to widespread industrial application of PCEs. The method is demonstrated for a number of synthetic test cases, including an uncertainty analysis of a Finite Element structure, determined using Topology Optimisation, with 306 uncertain inputs. We demonstrate that by exploiting sensitivity information, PCEs can feasibly be applied to such problems and through the Sobol sensitivity indices, can allow a designer to easily visualise the spatial distribution of the sensitivities within the structure.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently prevailed as differentiable solvers that unify forward and inverse analysis in the same formulation. However, PINNs have quite limited caliber when dealing with concentration features and discontinuous multi-material heterogeneity, hindering its application when labeled data is missing. We propose a novel physics-encoded finite element network (PEFEN) that can deal with concentration features and multi-material heterogeneity without special treatments, extra burden, or labeled data. Leveraging the interpretable discretized finite element approximation as a differentiable network in the new approach, PEFEN encodes the physics structure of multi-material heterogeneity, functional losses, and boundary conditions. We simulate three typical numerical experiments, and PEFEN is validated with a good performance of handling complex cases where conventional PINNs fail. Moreover, PEFEN entails much fewer iterations (&lt;10%) than some published improved PINNs (namely the mixed form and domain decomposition method), and the proposed PEFEN does not employ extra variables for stresses or special treatments for subdomains. We further examine PEFEN in hyperelastic multi-layer strata with and without a pile, validating its ability for more practical applications. PEFEN is also tested for inverse analysis. In 3D experiments, transfer learning with PEFEN is validated. PEFEN need much less memory than FEM (&lt;20%), and its training from zero initialization is faster than FEM forward analysis (&gt;1 million dofs). It is also discussed that PEFEN may act like domain decomposition in a refined way, and a simple experiment validates that PEFEN can solve the problem with multi-scale frequency. The PEFEN, thus, proves to be a promising method and deserves further development.},

  abstract     = {Measured data from a dynamical system can be assimilated into a predictive model by means of Kalman filters. Nonlinear extensions of the Kalman filter, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), are required to enable the joint estimation of (possibly nonlinear) system dynamics and of input parameters. To construct the evolution model used in the prediction phase of the EKF, we propose to rely on the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). SINDy enables to identify the evolution model directly from preliminary acquired data, thus avoiding possible bias due to wrong assumptions and incorrect modelling of the system dynamics. Moreover, the numerical integration of a SINDy model leads to great computational savings compared to alternate strategies based on, e.g., finite elements. Last, SINDy allows an immediate definition of the Jacobian matrices required by the EKF to identify system dynamics and properties, a derivation that is usually extremely involved with physical models. As a result, combining the EKF with SINDy provides a data-driven computationally efficient, easy-to-apply approach for the identification of nonlinear systems, capable of robust operation even outside the range of training of SINDy. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we address the identification of a linear non-autonomous system consisting of a shear building model excited by real seismograms, and the identification of a partially observed nonlinear system. The challenge arising from the use of SINDy when the system state is not entirely accessible has been relieved by means of time-delay embedding. The great accuracy and the small uncertainty associated with the state identification, where the state has been augmented to include system properties, underscores the great potential of the proposed strategy, paving the way for the setting of predictive digital twins in different fields.},

  abstract     = {A maximum energy dissipation-based incremental approach (MEDIA) is proposed to overcome limit points, e.g. strong snap-backs, in the fracture analysis of quasi-brittle materials. An optimisation step is applied using an expression proposed to compute the change of dissipated energy within the discretised body when moving from one state of equilibrium to another. This expression is developed at the integration point level and uses a binary pathway vector to define all the possible solutions within that step. Due to the unique way the problem is cast, a genetic algorithm is deployed to identify the solution leading to the highest energy dissipation while following applicable thermodynamic constraints. The resulting analysis is non-iterative and purely incremental. MEDIA is particularly applicable in combination with discrete crack models. In this case, meshes are relatively coarse and each crack can be individually handled to maintain the computational cost independent of the discretisation. The equations are also cast in a direct inverse method that avoids explicitly solving the inversion of the stiffness matrices for each chromosome in the genetic optimisation. Problems having multiple snap-back effects and non-proportional loading, as well as lightly and highly reinforced concrete beams, are used to assess the suitability and efficiency of the proposed method. In contrast with other available techniques, MEDIA is shown to follow the adopted constitutive models without any energy loss due to the solution-finding process while providing adequate structural responses.},

Pneumatically actuated variants of these metamaterials can then change their mechanical, acoustic, or other types of effective behavior in response to applied pressure with possible applications ranging from soft robotic actuators to phononic crystals. Such materials often undergo large deformations, leading to self-contact, which makes their modeling and generative design challenging. We propose to use the third medium method to simulate both pneumatic actuation and contact behavior. In contrast to existing formulations, we (i) combine together contact with pneumatic actuation in a single material model for the third medium, (ii) include more permissive regularization scheme for our model, penalizing gradient of pseudo-rotation and gradient of volume change only, and (iii) introduce pneumatic actuation as an exact value of Cauchy stress. Our formulation is energetically consistent and admits advanced finite element solvers, such as the modified Cholesky decomposition to detect instabilities. We demonstrate the behavior of the proposed formulation on several examples of traditional contact benchmarks, including a standard patch test, and validate it with experimental measurement.},

An SO(3) SO(3) -consistent and second-order accurate time integration scheme for accelerations, velocities and rate-dependent viscoelastic strain measures is adopted. To achieve high efficiency and geometrical flexibility, the spatial discretization is carried out with the isogemetric collocation (IGA-C) method, which permits bypassing elements integration keeping all the advantages of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) in terms of high-order space accuracy and geometry representation. Moreover, a primal formulation guarantees the minimal kinematic unknowns. The generalized Maxwell model is deployed directly to the one-dimensional beam strain and stress measures. This allows to express the internal variables in terms of the same kinematic unknowns, as for the case of linear elastic rate-independent materials bypassing the complexities introduced by the viscoelastic material. As a result, existing SO(3)-consistent linearizations of the governing equations in the strong form (and associated updating formulas) can straightforwardly be used. Through a series of numerical tests, the attributes and potentialities of the proposed formulation are demonstrated. In particular, we show the capability to accurately simulate beams and beam systems featuring complex initial geometry and topology, opening interesting perspectives in the inverse design of programmable mechanical meta-materials and objects.},

  abstract     = {Deformation and failure in hyperelastic materials exhibit unique characteristics that are absent in purely elastic materials. The presence of pre-existing cracks and holes further increases these complications. To study this phenomenon, an implicit hyperelastic non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB-PD) is developed for modelling finite deformation and damage under quasi-static conditions. Highlights in the present work include: (1) integration of a bond-associated (BA) scheme to improve numerical stability in calculation of the deformation gradient; (2) development of an implicit scheme to discretize PD equations, facilitating simulation of quasi-static damage process; (3) implementation of an equivalent strain-based criterion to accurately determine PD bond breakage; and (4) comprehensive analysis of the effects of crack patterns, loading conditions, and material properties on damage evolution. Next, the proposed implicit BA-NOSB-PD is validated through benchmark tests to examine its convergence performance and accuracy. Comparative analysis is conducted to explore deformation and damage characteristics in failure under shear and tensile loadings. Then, the proposed method is applied to study more complex scenarios involving multiple holes and edge crack. Simulation results provide insights into underlying mechanisms that govern the failure process under large deformation condition.},

  abstract     = {Equilibrated fluid–solid-growth (FSGe) is a fast, open source, three-dimensional (3D) computational platform for simulating interactions between instantaneous hemodynamics and long-term vessel wall adaptation through mechanobiologically equilibrated growth and remodeling (G&amp;R). Such models can capture evolving geometry, composition, and material properties in health and disease and following clinical interventions. In traditional G&amp;R models, this feedback is modeled through highly simplified fluid solutions, neglecting local variations in blood pressure and wall shear stress (WSS). FSGe overcomes these inherent limitations by strongly coupling the 3D Navier–Stokes equations for blood flow with a 3D equilibrated constrained mixture model (CMMe) for vascular tissue G&amp;R. CMMe allows one to predict long-term evolved mechanobiological equilibria from an original homeostatic state at a computational cost equivalent to that of a standard hyperelastic material model. In illustrative computational examples, we focus on the development of a stable aortic aneurysm in a mouse model to highlight key differences in growth patterns between FSGe and solid-only G&amp;R models. We show that FSGe is especially important in blood vessels with asymmetric stimuli. Simulation results reveal greater local variation in fluid-derived WSS than in intramural stress (IMS). Thus, differences between FSGe and G&amp;R models became more pronounced with the growing influence of WSS relative to pressure. Future applications in highly localized disease processes, such as for lesion formation in atherosclerosis, can now include spatial and temporal variations of WSS.},

Applications of the virtual element method (VEM) in three-dimensional mechanics include linear elasticity problems, finite elastic strain problems, finite deformation plasticity problems, etc. But besides linear elastic problems, see e.g. Visinoni, 2024, the numerical schemes were all based on a first-order approximation of the displacement. We derive three-dimensional elastic problems, including linear elastic problems and for the first time hyperelastic problems. Similar to previous work, we discuss the calculation method of three-dimensional high-order projection operators of vector fields and calculate the tangent stiffness matrix of elastic problems according to the variational scheme. Since traditional VEM requires the use of stabilization terms to ensure the correctness of the rank of the stiffness matrix, we give suggestions for the selection of stabilization terms for high-order virtual element methods in both linear and nonlinear elasticity. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy, convergence, and stability of the high-order VEM for elastic problems by means of some classic elastic and hyperelastic examples. In addition, we also apply the developed methodology to some complex and difficult problems which illustrate the adaptability of the method to engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {The kinematics of polydisperse granular materials comprised of overlapping spheres is carefully analysed. A single-particle strain estimate is developed that summaries the deformation experienced by each particle in terms of a mean deformation gradient. This strain estimate accounts for material displaced at interparticle contacts as well as a compensatory motion of the free particle surface. Forces that are work-conjugate to the mean deformation gradient are determined; they constitute the many-body forces required for a correct mechanical behaviour in the zero-porosity limit. Notwithstanding this, pairwise interparticle forces are needed for two main reasons; they dominate the particle interactions at small overlaps and stabilise the formulation in the continuum limit. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the properties of the single-particle strain estimate and to test certain aspects of the formulation. In particular, it is demonstrated that the formulation can accommodate large rotations and provides a mechanical response consistent with that of a solid material in the zero-porosity limit. It is concluded that this work forms the basis for future developments aiming at formulation of realistic contact models for plastic particles and macroscopically consistent discrete methods for granular materials.},

In particular, it studies the linear systems arising from a regularized mortar-type approach for embedding geometrically exact beams into solid continua. Due to the lack of block diagonal dominance of the arising 2 × 2 block system, an approximate Block-LU preconditioner is used. It exploits the sparsity structure of the beam sub-block to construct a sparse approximate inverse, which is then not only used to explicitly form an approximation of the Schur complement, but also acts as a smoother within the prediction and correction step of the arising Block-LU preconditioner. The Schur complement equation is tackled with an algebraic multigrid method. Although, for now, the beam sub-block is tackled by a one-level method only, the multi-level nature of the computationally demanding Schur equation delivers a scalable preconditioner in practice. In numerical test cases, the influence of different algorithmic parameters on the quality of the sparse approximate inverse is studied and the weak scaling behavior of the proposed preconditioner on up to 1000 MPI ranks is demonstrated. In addition, the robustness of the proposed method regarding material parameters and geometric properties is shown, before the preconditioner is finally applied for the analysis of steel-reinforced concrete structures in civil engineering.},

  abstract     = {The fluid-flexible-structure interaction (FFSI) is characterized by the large deformation, the thin structure, and the complex turbulent flow field. Accurately simulating FFSI poses three challenges, which are the modeling of the thin structure, the capture of moving interface, and the numerical stability of multi-physics field coupling, respectively. In this study, the FFSI is simulated by the entirely smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) because of its natural advantage in dealing with the moving interface within a unified framework. The shell model with single-layer particles is introduced into SPH to simulate the thin flexible structure. The truncation error caused by the single-layer boundary is modified by the normal flux approach. The k - ε turbulence model is incorporated into SPH to improve numerical accuracy in capturing turbulent details. In addition, other techniques or models that ensure the efficiency and stability of the calculation are used in this study, including PST (particle shifting technique), δ-SPH model, and GPU (graphics processing unit). The flows around the single filament and the hydrostatic benchmark are simulated to verify the accuracy of the current SPH method for simulating FFSI. The interaction between fluid and single filament and the interaction between fluid and dual-filament system are simulated to study the interacting mechanism between fluid and flexible structures. Three important conclusions are obtained by the discussions of numerical results: the critical values of dimensionless parameters can be found to determine whether the filament vibration attenuates or tends to stabilize; the stabilization time of the filament movement can be effectively reduced as the initial orientation angle increases or the perturbation of upstream flow field increases; the movement of filament with a small mass ratio is more sensitive to the perturbation of upstream flow field.},

In the online phase, the method applies an online adaptive scheme informed by the Brezzi–Rappaz–Raviart theorem to select an appropriate hyperreduction fidelity for each component to meet the user-prescribed error tolerance at the system level. The method accommodates the rapid construction of hyperreduced models for large-scale component-based nonlinear systems and enables model reduction of problems with many continuous and topology-varying parameters. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on a two-dimensional nonlinear thermal fin system that comprises up to 225 components and 68 independent parameters.},

In this mixed dimensional type system, the flow equation on a d d dimensional porous matrix is coupled to the flow equation on a d − 1 d−1 dimensional fracture surface. The fracture geometry is treated as a possibly non-planar interface, and the fracture is assumed to remain open ( i.e. , ignoring contact mechanics boundary conditions). The main contribution is developing a multirate scheme in which flow takes multiple fine time steps within one coarse mechanics time step using the standard fixed stress splitting approach. In this coupled system, the linear quasi-static Biot model is assumed for the porous matrix, and the lubrication-type system (Girault et al., 2015) is assumed for the fracture. More specifically, two variations ( i.e. , algorithms) of the multirate scheme are formulated and their convergence analyses are established. The convergence analysis is based on proving a Banach fixed-point contraction argument which establishes the geometric convergence, and hence, the uniqueness of the obtained solution for both algorithms. The theoretical investigations are supplemented by preliminary numerical results validating the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an enhanced differential evolution algorithm based on dual population hybrid update and random population replacement strategy (namely RPR mechanism) is proposed, which is called DHRDE. DHRDE algorithm involves three key improvements, first, the elite reverse population is constructed according to the original population before the update phase to uncover more potential areas to be searched. Second, a perturbation mechanism is integrated into the DE/rand/2 approach of the differential evolution algorithm to bolster its search efficiency, two updating models are established using co-leadership of random and locally optimal individuals, and then dual-population hybrid update strategy is adopted to achieve all-round and multi-angle search. Thirdly, using RPR mechanism to operate multiple types of mutations on some populations further improves the convergence accuracy. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, DHRDE is compared with a variety of different types of algorithms in multi-dimension of the CEC2017, CEC2020 and CEC2022 test set, and statistical analysis is performed by Wilcoxon rank sum test and Friedman test. The results show that DHRDE algorithm has better performance. DHRDE algorithm is also used to solve seven engineering design problems and three PV model parameter estimation problems, the optimization results show that DHRDE algorithm is suitable for different complex problems and has effectiveness. In addition, this paper establishes a smooth path planning model for multi-size robots, and uses DHRDE to solve the model, the results of five groups of simulation experiments show that DHRDE algorithm can provide robot moving trajectories with higher smoothness and shorter paths. Analyzing and comparing the fitness metrics through heat maps, the comparative study demonstrates that the DHRDE algorithm is more advantageous and stronger than other algorithms in solving the smooth path planning model for multi-size robots. The above results show that DHRDE algorithm has better performance and has great advantages and competitiveness in solving engineering application optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Structural problems play a critical role in many areas of science and engineering. Their efficient and accurate solution is essential for designing and optimising civil engineering, aerospace, and materials science applications, to name a few. When appropriately tuned, Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) methods exhibit a convergence that is independent of the problem size, making them the preferred option for solving structural problems. Nevertheless, AMG faces several computational challenges, including its remarkable memory footprint, costly setup, and the relatively low arithmetic intensity of the sparse linear algebra operations. This work presents AMGR, an enhanced variant of AMG that mitigates such limitations. Its name arises from the AMG reduction framework it introduces, and its flexibility allows for leveraging several features that are common in structural problems. Namely, periodicities, spatial symmetries, and localised non-linearities. For such cases, we show how to reduce the memory footprint and setup costs of the standard AMG, as well as increase its arithmetic intensity. Despite being lighter than the standard AMG, AMGR exhibits comparable scalability and convergence rates. Numerical experiments on several industrial applications prove AMGR’s effectiveness, resulting in up to 3.7x overall speed-ups compared to the standard AMG.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an innovative variant of the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), termed the Dynamic Matrix Transformation-based Oppositional Marine Predators Algorithm (DMT-OMPA), aimed at enhancing the efficiency of engineering optimization strategies. Traditional MPAs have several shortcomings, including insufficient solution diversity and coverage in the initialization phase, a tendency to become trapped in local optima, and inadequate search capabilities in the later stages of iteration, all of which negatively impact the algorithm’s efficiency and effectiveness. To address these issues, the DMT-OMPA incorporates oppositional learning mechanisms and dynamic matrix transformation strategies, significantly enhancing global search capabilities and accelerating convergence speed, particularly in handling complex multidimensional optimization problems.Experimental results on the CEC2013 and CEC2017 test suites demonstrate that DMT-OMPA outperforms other recent MPA variants, various classical algorithm variants, and newly proposed algorithms, verifying its advantages in precision and reliability. Furthermore, the application of this algorithm to various real-world engineering problems substantiates its broad applicability and high efficiency. The study’s findings not only deepen our understanding of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms but also provide a new efficient tool for solving complex engineering problems. The results indicate a promising potential for wider application in diverse fields, suggesting that the DMT-OMPA algorithm could become an effective tool for tackling complex optimization problems in the future.},

  abstract     = {The modeling of cracks is an important topic — both in engineering as well as in mathematics. Since crack propagation is characterized by a free boundary value problem (the geometry of the crack is not known beforehand, but part of the solution), approximations of the underlying sharp-interface problem based on phase-field models are often considered. Focusing on a rate-independent setting, these models are defined by a unidirectional gradient-flow of an energy functional. Since this energy functional is non-convex, the evolution of the variables such as the displacement field and the phase-field variable might be discontinuous in time leading to so-called brutal crack growth. For this reason, solution concepts have to be carefully chosen in order to predict discontinuities that are physically reasonable. One such concept is that of Balanced Viscosity solutions (BV solutions). This concept predicts physically sound energy trajectories that do not jump across energy barriers. The paper deals with a time-adaptive finite element phase-field model for rate-independent fracture which converges to BV solutions. The model is motivated by constraining the pseudo-velocity of the crack tip. The resulting constrained minimization problem is solved by the augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical examples highlight the predictive capabilities of the model and furthermore show the efficiency and the robustness of the final algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel neural network non-ordinary state-based peridynamic (NOSB PD) algorithm for large deformation and fracture analysis of hyperelastic membranes. A non-local membrane theory has been developed by approximating the curved horizon of the membrane as a flat surface and applying the plane stress assumption locally. This allows the simulation of the membrane structure using a single layer of material points, simplifying implementation, improving efficiency, and avoiding volume locking. In the framework of NOSB PD, the deformation gradients are represented by their corresponding bond vectors based on the non-local geometry relationship. Then, the nonlinear bijection between bond vectors and force density is obtained using a developed neural network model. This approach successfully overcomes the zero-energy problem and significantly improves the efficiency. Three representative numerical examples: out of plane deformation, out of plane loading crack propagation and penetrating of a ball are simulated to validate the developed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the developed method can accurately and efficiently achieve the large deformation, out of plane tearing, wrinkle as well as fracture of hyperelastic membranes.},

  abstract     = {Computational cost is one of the challenges in the field of fracture resistance topology optimization. An efficient topology optimization approach is proposed for enhancing resistance to structural fracture based on the adaptive isogeometric–meshfree method. The mesh can be adaptively refined in the computational and design domains simultaneously to capture the fracture and structural boundary delicately, which significantly reduces the degree of freedom and improves the efficiency of the topology optimization problems related to crack propagation. The proposed approach naturally inherits the advantages of both the computer-aided design and continuity of the higher-order basis functions, where the geometry and the analysis models in the process of topology optimization are integrated. The problem is formulated to maximize the absorbed energy throughout the crack process using the solid isotropic material with penalization method under volume constraints. The phase field method is used for modeling crack propagation, thereby eliminating the need of an explicit representation of the crack surface and complex tracking procedures, while a delicate mesh is still required. With this approach, the external work required during the fracture process is maximized, and the crack growth is delayed remarkably. Several representative examples are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the present approach in fracture-resistance-enhanced topology optimization, and the computational cost shows remarkable improvement.},

However, recent advances have rapidly expanded this to include the approximation of multiple operators using foundation models equipped with millions or billions of trainable parameters, leading to the research of multi-operator learning (MOL). In this paper, we present a novel distributed training approach aimed at enabling a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges, all without incurring additional average costs. Our method is applicable to various neural operators, such as the Deep Operator Neural Networks (DON). The core idea is to independently learn the output basis functions for each operator using its dedicated data, while simultaneously centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset. Through a systematic study of five numerical examples, we compare the accuracy and cost of training a single neural operator for each operator independently versus training a MOL model using our proposed method. Our results demonstrate enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy. Moreover, our approach illustrates that some operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning. This highlights another MOL’s potential to bolster operator learning.},

The contemporary deep learning physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from accuracy issues while learning initial conditions, fail to capture the sharp gradient behaviors, and provide inadequate approximations to rapidly oscillating solutions. A novel technique named PATPINN is introduced to effectively address singularly perturbed parabolic problems with significant gradients in the spatio-temporal domain, utilizing a unique time and parameter multi-step asymptotic pre-training approach based on PINNs. The presented technique can assist the model in learning the system dynamic behavior and improve the accuracy of the initial conditions. It also enables PINNs to capture abrupt changes in the solution without prior knowledge of the boundary layer position, boosting its ability to approximate oscillatory solutions. This innovative approach does not require hyperparameter fine-tuning and provides a dependable deep learning approach for handling evolutionary singular perturbation problems. The proposed method is compared to PINNs and pre-training PINN (PTPINN) by solving singular convection–diffusion–reaction equations and magnetohydrodynamic equations. The results show that the proposed strategy outperforms PINNs and PTPINN in capturing the boundary layer gradient, improving the approximation accuracy and accelerating the training process, in addition to significantly improving the accuracy of PINNs in approximating the initial conditions.},

Since the representation of this inversion is exact for a sufficiently high approximation order, the proposed scheme is shown to provide a fixed-point-type iterative solver for gradient flow problems that require the solution of linear systems in the context of an implicit time-integration. While the proposed scheme is applicable to general gradient flow phase-field models, we discuss the scheme in the context of the Cahn–Hilliard equation, the Swift–Hohenberg equation, and the phase-field crystal equation for which we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with classical solvers.},

  abstract     = {In additive manufacturing, the fabrication sequence has a large influence on the quality of manufactured components. While planning of the fabrication sequence is typically performed after the component has been designed, recent developments have demonstrated the possibility and benefits of simultaneous optimization of both the structural layout and the corresponding fabrication sequence. This is particularly relevant in multi-axis additive manufacturing, where rotational motion offers enhanced flexibility compared to planar fabrication. The simultaneous optimization approach, called space–time topology optimization, introduces a pseudo-time field to encode the manufacturing process order, alongside a pseudo-density field representing the structural layout. To comply with manufacturing principles, the pseudo-time field needs to be monotonic, i.e., free of local minima. However, explicitly formulated constraints proposed in prior work are not always effective, particularly for complex structural layouts that commonly result from topology optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to regularize the pseudo-time field in space–time topology optimization. We conceptualize the monotonic additive manufacturing process as a virtual heat conduction process starting from the surface upon which a component is constructed layer by layer. The virtual temperature field, which shall not be confused with the actual temperature field during manufacturing, serves as an analogy for encoding the fabrication sequence. In this new formulation, we use local virtual heat conductivity coefficients as optimization variables to steer the temperature field and, consequently, the fabrication sequence. The virtual temperature field is inherently free of local minima due to the physics it resembles. We numerically validate the effectiveness of this regularization in space–time topology optimization under process-dependent loads, including gravity and thermomechanical loads.},

This insight underscores a link between the so-called additive plasticity and the viscoelasticity model under consideration, further inspiring our development of a nonlinear viscoelasticity theory. Our strategy is based on Hill’s hyperelasticity framework and leverages the concept of generalized strains. Notably, the adopted kinematic assumption makes the proposed theory fundamentally different from the existing models rooted in the notion of the intermediate configuration. The computation aspects, including the constitutive integration, consistent linearization, and modular implementation, are addressed in detail.

However, traditional data-driven models are hindered by limitations arising from a scarcity of datasets and the absence of explicit physical principles. These limitations lead to inadequate generalization capabilities and predictions that may contradict established physical laws. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a thermodynamics-informed neural network (TINN) for elastoplastic constitutive modeling of granular materials. Following the thermodynamics-based elastoplastic theory, the TINN model incorporates elastic free energy, stored plastic work, and dissipation. It achieves this by integrating a path-dependent recurrent neural network (RNN) and three sub-fully connected neural networks to capture the mechanical response and energy evolution in sheared granular materials. The total loss function of TINN combines data-driven and physics-informed components. The effectiveness and generalization capabilities of TINN are evaluated by testing it on diverse datasets, including both simulated and experimental data. The simulated virtual data are derived either from an available elastoplastic model or via discrete element method (DEM) simulations employing stress probing techniques. The results highlight the superior generalization ability and robustness of the TINN model, surpassing purely data-driven models in performance and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the nature of brittle failure in ferroelectric materials is essential, but difficult due to the complex interaction between mechanical and electrical concentrated fields near the crack tip. In this work, an extended phase-field model incorporating multiple order parameters is constructed to analyze the coupled evolution of fracture and domain behavior in ferroelectric materials. The strain gradient is incorporated into the governing equations to evaluate the impact of the flexoelectric effect during the crack propagation process. Our advanced phase-field model demonstrated that, with the consideration of the flexoelectric effect, both the crack extension rate and crack path are related to the initial polarization direction. This phenomenon is associated with the eigenstrain induced by the flexoelectric effect. This study provides in-depth insight into the fracture behavior of ferroelectric materials. The developed model framework can also be employed to investigate electromechanical coupling failures in more complex ferroelectric structures.},

The framework as such has been developed in previous works, and in the present work, neural networks are used to model the rate-dependence and hardening of the material. Functional forms for these material properties are then replaced by neural networks. The neural network-based model is applied to both theoretical reference data as well as actual experimental data in the form of stress–strain data. Simulated annealing is used to optimise/train the neural networks. The model was able to reproduce both the theoretical reference solutions as well as the experimental data very well. An implicit FE formulation was also provided in the form of a subroutine (UMAT) in Abaqus. The implementation was applied to two 3D examples, and the implementation seems to be robust and shows nice convergence properties. Overall, the present neural network-enhanced framework seems to be promising and there is potential for further development, such as inclusion of directional hardening and a more general neural network-based treatment of rate-dependence and material hardening.},

  abstract     = {The high-order moment-based method is an attractive non-intrusive approach for structural reliability analysis, while it remains a challenge to strike a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and versatility in estimating statistical moments of performance functions. In this paper, a point mapping strategy-based sparse grid integration (SGI) method is proposed for statistical moment estimation and structural reliability analysis, with improved efficiency while ensuring the accuracy. Firstly, a point mapping strategy (PMS) is developed based on the adaptive high dimensional model representation (HDMR), by which the traditional SGI is reconstructed as a sum of multiple integrations over the sparse grid point sets with different effective dimensions. With this new form of SGI, the estimation of statistical moments only requires the evaluation of the performance function at a small number of necessary reference points, once the effects of some interaction terms are negligible. The validity and feasibility of the proposed PMS-based SGI method for statistical moments estimation are verified by several numerical examples. Then, the proposed method is applied to structural reliability analysis with the aid of an improved maximum entropy method. Two engineering examples are investigated, including the strength failure problem of tubular tower K-shape connection joints and the fatigue failure problem of a marine riser resulting from the vortex-induced vibration (VIV). The results indicate that the proposed method provides a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in evaluating the first four order statistical moments and structural failure probability compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale structures, renowned for their remarkable properties, have garnered significant attention due to advancements in design methodologies and manufacturing technologies. In this study, a novel multiscale concurrent topology optimization (MCTO) method is proposed to address the issues associated with the dis-connectivity phenomenon between microstructures and the large number of design variables. To reduce the design variables significantly, the ordered material field series expansion (MFSE) method is adopted to describe the distribution of multiple microstructures. To ensure the continuous transition of different microstructures, a correlation-driven connection (CDC) method is proposed. In this method, adjacent regions between different microstructures arranged in order are combined to form a connected material field, the microstructural connectivity is then driven by the correlation function. Hence, the proposed framework incorporates the feature of the macroscopic interpolation scheme and the spatial correlation defined in the MFSE method to effectively ensure multiple microstructural connectivity without additional optimization constraints. Moreover, the number of design variables is reduced by an order of magnitude, complemented by several accelerated strategies, showcasing improved optimization efficiency. Several benchmark 2D/3D MCTO examples including complex design domains are presented featuring multiple connectable microstructures to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Compared with other connectivity frameworks and two-stage multiscale topology optimization, the proposed method shows a noteworthy performance enhancement.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of continuous fiber-reinforced polymer additive manufacturing (CFRP-AM) enables the fabrication of lightweight structures with intricate geometries and superior properties. However, existing design methods treat structural optimization and toolpath design as distinct stages, typically implementing toolpath design as a post-processing step following structural optimization. This sequential workflow hampers the full exploitation of CFRP-AM&#39;s potential, hindering optimal structural integrity and manufacturability. In this paper, an integrated structure and toolpath optimization (ISTO) method is proposed for improving the final product&#39;s structural performance and manufacturability simultaneously. In ISTO, two different strategies are employed to address different aspects of the design space: bi-material topology optimization for the structural layout and scalar field projection for continuous fiber toolpaths. Correspondingly, elemental pseudo densities and scalar field gradients serve as design variables for structural topology and toolpath parameterization, respectively, in a compliance minimization problem . This facilitates analytical sensitivities for seamless integration with gradient-based optimization algorithms. Additionally, incorporating volume fraction constraints of both the solid structure and the fiber percentage relative to the solid guarantees the attainment of predetermined weight reduction targets and ensures calculation accuracy. Thus, the proposed ISTO establishes a comprehensive framework for concurrent CFRP-AM optimization, incorporating design-to-manufacturing information to optimize structural topology and continuous CFRP-AM toolpaths concurrently. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by typical numerical examples. Comparisons with existing optimization methods show that the proposed ISTO can remarkably boost structural stiffness while ensuring manufacturability and moreover it effectively tackles design challenges of smooth toolpath planning including different initial cutouts.},

This paper proposes an energy-driven machine learning framework to address crack initiation and propagation in rock-like materials by considering long-range interactions. By leveraging the minimization energy principle, the displacement of physical system is determined by minimizing the peridynamic potential energy instead of directly solving the equilibrium equation, which serves as the neural network&#39;s loss function. An incremental form loss function and transfer learning technique are developed to account for the cumulative effects of all preceding loading steps. Furthermore, the critical strain energy density criterion is established from an energy perspective. A key advantage of the proposed neural network lies in evaluating peridynamic strain energy through spatial integration rather than spatial derivatives, thus bypassing the limitations of automatic differentiation encountered in original physics-informed neural networks at crack surfaces. Notably, the proposed approach inherits the ability of peridynamics to simulate spontaneous damage evolution and crack propagation without necessitating special crack treatment techniques. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified via comparison with analytical solutions, experimental observations, or classical numerical methods in fracture analysis of rock-like materials subjected to various quasi-static loading conditions.},

  abstract     = {The interface oxidation-induced cracking process in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) is rather complex. It involves the material changes of chemical reactions, dynamic migration and diffusion of BC/TGO (bond coat/thermally grown oxide) interface, delamination of TC (top coat)/TGO and BC/TGO interfaces, multiple delamination cracks and their interactions within the TGO layer, etc. The complex process presents significant difficulties and challenges to simulation. To explore the comprehensive cracking mechanisms induced by the interface oxidation, we propose the coupled chemo-mechanical-damage model in a dual-horizon peridynamic framework (CMD-DHPD). The corresponding governing equations and their linearized forms are derived in the form of integral coupled equations for CMD-DHPD. The dual-horizon peridynamic diffusion-reaction equation and its linearization are derived based on the dual-horizon peridynamic correspondence principle. The nonlocal crack phase-field and interface phase-field are presented to address the geometric discontinuity of bulk materials and the material discontinuity in the region of the TC/TGO interface, respectively. In order to ensure convergence and accuracy, the BFGS Quasi-Newton algorithm is further enhanced to solve for the integral equations arising from the coupled chemo-mechanical-damage processes. The proposed CMD-DHPD captures the TGO growth pattern, interface cracks initiation, propagation and their interactions as observed in experiments. Therefore, it is extremely suitable for solving the interface oxidation-induced cracking process in thermal barrier coatings.},

  abstract     = {The 3D reconstruction is generally defined as the process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects. By reconstructing 3D digital model from a series of 2D slices, it brings considerable convenience to visualize internal structure and decipher structure-property relation of a material. Nowadays, the 3D reconstruction is becoming a cutting-edge technique in depicting the internal structure and evaluating the physical performance of targeted materials. Recent years, generative machine learning methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN), have achieved tremendous success in AI-generated physical content (AIGPC). However, lots of technical challenges remain, including oversimplified models, oversized dataset requirement and inefficient convergence. These difficulties are caused by the insufficient ability to capture detailed features and the inadequacy of the generated model quality. To this end, a novel generative model is developed, which combines the multiscale features of U-net and the synthesis ability of GANs. With the help of the multiscale channel aggregation module, the hierarchical feature aggregation module and the convolutional block attention module, our model is developed to capture the features of the material microstructure better. The loss function is refined by combining the image regularization loss with the Wasserstein distance loss. In addition, the anisotropy index is adopted to measure anisotropic degree of selected samples quantitively. The results demonstrate that the 3D structures generated by the proposed model retain high fidelity with ground truth samples. With remarkable performance, the proposed model not only overtakes traditional GAN, but will shed a brilliant light on AIGPC and physical 3D reconstruction.},

By introducing iterative procedures, the single scattering BVPs are decoupled and a convenient domain truncation technique, employing artificial boundaries, reduces the unbounded domain of the original BVPs to relatively small bounded domain around each scatterer. Then, high order Karp’s farfield expansions absorbing boundary conditions (KFE) are imposed at the artificial boundaries of each scatterer. An overall high order numerical method is constructed by combining these absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) with a high order isogeometric finite element method (IGA) in the interior of the computational domains. We performed ample numerical experiments for complex configuration of scatterers, using the isogeometric finite elements and also finite differences techniques combined with the high order KFE.

Based on this, an efficient and multi-fidelity RBDO framework is formulated, synchronously enhancing the efficiency, precision, and applicability of RBDO.

  abstract     = {The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is widely being used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) due to its ability to provide high-order accurate solutions in complex geometries, capture discontinuities, and exhibit high arithmetic intensity. However, the scalability of DG-based solvers is impeded by communication bottlenecks arising from the data movement and synchronization requirements at extreme scales. To address these challenges, recent studies have focused on the development of asynchronous computing approaches for PDE solvers. Herein, we introduce the asynchronous DG (ADG) method, which combines the benefits of the DG method with asynchronous computing to overcome communication bottlenecks. The ADG method relaxes the need for data communication and synchronization at a mathematical level, allowing processing elements to operate independently regardless of the communication status, thus potentially improving the scalability of solvers. The proposed ADG method ensures flux conservation and effectively addresses challenges arising from asynchrony. To assess its stability, Fourier-mode analysis is employed to examine the dissipation and dispersion behavior of fully-discrete equations that use the DG and ADG schemes along with the Runge–Kutta (RK) time integration scheme. Furthermore, an error analysis within a statistical framework is presented, which demonstrates that the ADG method with standard numerical fluxes achieves at most first-order accuracy. To recover accuracy, we introduce asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that utilize data from multiple time levels. Extensive numerical experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the ADG-AT scheme for both linear and nonlinear problems . Overall, the proposed ADG-AT method demonstrates the potential to achieve accurate and scalable DG-based PDE solvers, paving the way for simulations of complex physical systems on massively parallel supercomputers .},

  abstract     = {Many applications of density-based topology optimization require a very fine mesh, either to obtain high-resolution designs, or to resolve physics in sufficient detail. Solving the discretized state and adjoint equation in every iteration step then becomes computationally demanding, restricting the applicability of the method. Model Order Reduction (MOR) offers a solution for this computational burden, using a reduced vector basis for simulations and resulting in a higher computational speed and reduced storage requirements. When the geometry is separable and the 3D density field can be expressed as a linear combination of products of lower-coordinate (1D or 2D) basis functions, Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) is a promising emerging MOR technique. PGD computes the basis functions for the state field on-the-fly as the reduced problem is solved, making it an a priori method. This paper studies the application of PGD in the context of topology optimization. It is used for the optimization of a 3D ribbed floor for minimum elastic compliance and the optimization of a heat sink device for minimum thermal compliance. The geometry of the designs can be expressed as a sum of products of 2D functions of the in-plane coordinates (representing the rib/fin pattern), and 1D functions of the out-of-plane coordinate (representing the distinction between compression slab and ribs or between baseplate and fins). Numerical results demonstrate that PGD can significantly reduce the computational demand, with computation times 100 to 500 times lower than the full 3D approach. The results show that PGD holds promise for large-scale topology optimization of problems with separable geometries.},

The developed methods aim to minimize information loss during mapping in the virtual manufacturing process for fiber-reinforced composites. The strategy of decomposing features that describe tensor shape and orientation, followed by separate interpolation, has been found to be a suitable approach for interpolating second-order fiber orientation tensors. Thus, in this work, decomposition-based approaches are also applied to fourth-order fiber orientation tensors. The decomposition of orthotropic fourth-order tensors into shape- and orientation-describing features with respect to three-dimensional space is presented. Various proposals for shape interpolation are described and evaluated. The developed interpolation methods are then applied to the numerical solution of a continuous problem from fluid mechanics. The continuous solution is used to generate data for the associated discrete problem and to evaluate the interpolation results of the different methods. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed interpolation methods are clearly superior to the conventional interpolation methods. Separating shape- and orientation-describing features with respect to three-dimensional space also proves to be useful for fourth-order tensors. The developed methods can significantly reduce the loss of information during mapping in virtual manufacturing process chains.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel reduced-order model (ROM) based data assimilation framework for parametric high-fidelity time-dependent neutron transport equations (TNTE). The ROM is constructed utilizing affine-parametric operator inference, a scientific machine learning that learns operators of the subspace dynamical system through a non-intrusive data-driven approach. The affine-parametric structure effectively accommodates TNTE with diverse time-varying parameters, obviating the need for interpolation in parameter space and enabling direct mapping of time-varying input parameters to high-fidelity solutions. Compared with the FOM solver in test problems, owing to ROM’s low-rank feature, the ROM yields accurate and rapid solutions with less than 1% L 2 L2 relative error and achieves speedups by five or six orders of magnitude. To underscore the efficacy of the operator inference-based ROM within a data assimilation context, the framework is seamlessly integrated with both the linear Kalman filter (KF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Employing a numerical example of a two-dimensional pressurized water nuclear reactor core, the ROM-based KF/EnKF successfully incorporates spatiotemporal information from measurements to correct predictions in the absence of accurate initial conditions or parameters. Furthermore, the method demonstrates a promising capacity for time-varying parameter inference and inverse uncertainty quantification , indicating a significant stride in the field of nuclear reactor core data assimilation.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical structures with complicated two-scale configurations show great potential for applications with the advancement of additive manufacturing technology, while fatigue performance is one of the key challenges in structural design. In this study, a two-scale topology optimization method is proposed for designing lightweight hierarchical structures that simultaneously possess high structural stiffness while satisfying microscopic fatigue strength requirements. In the microstructural fatigue analysis, the modified Goodman criterion is adopted for evaluating fatigue failure by considering the high-cycle fatigue problem under proportional loading with constant amplitude. To analyze the fatigue performance of hierarchical structures rapidly and accurately, a microscopic fatigue failure criterion characterization for the two-scale structure is established. In the optimization model, the structural compliance is chosen as the objective function and the local fatigue failure criteria for the microstructures over the whole structures are taken as the optimization constraints. To mitigate the challenges posed by an excessive number of constraints in optimization problems, the enhanced aggregation strategy of the two-scale fatigue constraints is proposed for accurate controlling of fatigue failure criteria in two-scale structures with fewer numbers of constraints. The sensitivity of the aggregated local fatigue constraints is derived, and the optimization problems are solved with the method of moving asymptotes algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate that two-scale optimized structures that have high stiffness and meet microstructural fatigue constraints can be obtained through the proposed optimization approach. Furthermore, the effect of different fatigue criteria used as constraints on the optimization results and the comparison with concurrent topology optimization are thoroughly discussed.},

To mitigate these undesirable features, three approaches have been studied: a hybrid strategy combining independent control with entire void control for parallel distributions, a fusion of independent control and entire solid control for parallel and wrapped distributions, and a local relaxation method employing a two-step filtering scheme. The modified minimum length scale controls for multi-material problems are proposed based on geometric constraints and the indicator functions with a normalization gradient norm. To validate the effectiveness of these methods, four numerical tests have been conducted. The results indicate that the combinations of two minimum length scale controls cannot achieve the parallel distribution and wrapped distribution due to the limited ability to modify the material layout. While local relaxation is feasible, which results in a significant reduction in stress concentration at joint areas.},

Machine learning (ML) excels in the presence of large data and is an actively growing field in seismology. However, not all ML methods incorporate rigorous physics, and purely data-driven models can predict physically unrealistic outcomes due to observational bias or extrapolation. Our work focuses on the recently emergent Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which seamlessly integrates data while ensuring that model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints. In this work we develop a multi-network PINN for both the forward problem as well as for direct inversion of nonlinear fault friction parameters, constrained by the physics of motion in the solid Earth, which have direct implications for assessing seismic hazard. We present the computational PINN framework for strike–slip faults in 1D and 2D subject to rate-and-state friction. Initial and boundary conditions define the data on which the PINN is trained. While the PINN is capable of approximating the solution to the governing equations to low-errors, our primary interest lies in the network’s capacity to infer friction parameters during the training loop. We find that the network for the parameter inversion at the fault performs much better than the network for material displacements to which it is coupled. Additional training iterations and model tuning resolves this discrepancy, enabling a robust surrogate model for solving both forward and inverse problems relevant to seismic faulting.},

To overcome the problems of numerical oscillations, an accurate and stable Lagrangian Weighted-Least-Square (LWLS) method embedded with WENO-Z scheme (LWLS-WENO-Z) is proposed. To further enhance the numerical accuracy and stability, the particle shifting technique, the multi-level local-refinement technique, and the interface repulsive force are appropriately employed in the numerical scheme. Moreover, the smooth and stable coupled particle method between the LWLS and Roe&#39;s Riemann solver (LWLS-RR) is considered for the comparisons, further demonstrating the merit of the proposed LWLS-WENO-Z scheme. To reduce the simulation time, parallel computing with a CUDA-based program for the proposed scheme is implemented on a single GPU. In the numerical experiments, several 1D/2D benchmarks are solved to test the accuracy of the proposed method. Particularly, the challenge 2D underwater explosion and the cavitation bubble collapse and jetting are numerically investigated.

In the bioengineering field, soft materials typically mimic the low stiffness of biological matter subjected to extreme deformations. Computational frameworks surge as a versatile tool to assist the design of functional applications. The constitutive model lies at the core of such frameworks. In this regard, the customary extreme non-linear behavior of elastomers poses an additional challenge to thoroughly capture the material behavior. Here, data-driven methodologies hold considerable promise for enhancing constitutive modeling when contrasted with phenomenological approaches. In this investigation, we introduce a versatile data-adaptive method tailored to the modeling of hyperelastic soft materials at finite strains. Specifically, our method substitutes an a priori chosen model for the strain energy function by a flexible interpolant defined on a discretized invariant space. Within this framework, the interpolation values assume the role of material parameters and are determined through finite element model updating to conform to measured experimental data — comprising full-field displacements coming from Digital-Image-Correlation and global reaction forces. We validate the method on uniaxial experimental tests of soft elastomers, encompassing ELASTOSIL TM ELASTOSILTM , DOWSIL TM DOWSILTM , and V HB TM V HBTM . Overall, we aim to establish a new route for the construction of hyperelastic energy functions, untethered from any predefined existing models or assumptions regarding the shape of the energy.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of random spatial variation in the mechanical properties of composite materials using random fields derived from their microstructure can be computationally demanding, since it often requires numerical homogenization of a large number of stochastic volume elements (SVEs). These SVEs are usually extracted from an initial image of the composite microstructure by using a moving window technique and their homogenized properties constitute the discrete data points of the random field at the centroid of each SVE. By replacing the expensive and highly repetitive homogenization procedure with a convolutional neural network (CNN), it is possible to perform nearly instant computations of random property fields. In this work, a CNN is proposed, that takes as input an SVE image and returns its apparent mechanical properties, and can therefore be applied along with the moving window technique. Training is performed on randomly generated SVEs with varying volume fractions and inclusion positions, which are representative of the SVEs obtained during processing of the initial large composite image. It is shown that the proposed CNN can accurately predict the mechanical properties of SVEs and it is subsequently applied for the prediction of random property fields derived from computer simulated and real microstructure images. Results show that, with the proposed methodology, it is possible to make accurate predictions of random fields within a few seconds, a procedure which could potentially require hours of computation time with the finite element based approach.},

This study aims to develop a novel strength-based collaborative optimization of topological layout and fiber path (namely SCOTF) for continuous fiber reinforced composite structures through a level set algorithm with a parameterized stream function. The level set function for characterizing structural topology and the stream function for portraying fiber path are decomposed into a sum of weights associated with a series of radial basis functions. In this approach, the weights are treated as design variables to update the topological layout and fiber path of CFRP structure. To enhance mechanical strength, the design objective is established in terms of the Tsai-Wu strength criterion with mathematical derivation of analytical sensitivity. The effectiveness and reliability of SCOTF are demonstrated by three illustrative examples to compare with other two conventional methods, namely a maximum principal stress-based fiber placement and a stiffness-based design. In comparison, the structural strength optimized by SCOTF increase by 28.9 % and 42.8 %, respectively, proving that SCOTF can generate more effective topological layouts with smooth and continuous fiber paths, appreciably alleviating the concentration of failure index and lowering damage and failure of CFRP composite structures. The proposed approach is anticipated to provide a new tool for the strength-based design of fiber reinforced plastic composite structures.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel framework for topological shape optimization of curved non-conforming multi-patch and trimmed thick-shells subjected to external loads. Our method integrates the level set method (LSM) with a diffuse interface, a Hadamard shape derivative, and multi-patch isogeometric analysis (IGA) into a gradient descent algorithm to systematically capture the evolution of the shape. This integration enables us to directly manipulate CAD-compatible geometries and analysis techniques and to obtain the results as a CAD surface. The novelty lies in the utilization of multi-patch IGA models based on NURBS functions, which allows us to simultaneously maximize the stiffness and minimize the volume of the shell by searching for an optimal material distribution within its middle surface. The material is modeled under a small strain assumption in linear elasticity using a Reissner–Mindlin kinematic shell model in plane stress. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on several curved conforming and non-conforming multi-patch geometries in 3D.},

A nonlocal Drucker–Prager -type plasticity formulation is realized through the gradient-extended micromorphic approach, leading to mesh-insensitive plasticity in the Finite Element framework. Further, the critical fracture energy release rate is coupled to plasticity through the micromorphic variable, yielding the final ductile phase-field fracture formulation.

  abstract     = {High-dimensional dynamical systems often require computationally intensive physics-based simulations, making full physical space data assimilation impractical. Latent data assimilation methods perform assimilation in reduced-order latent space for efficiency but struggle with complex, nonlinear state-observation mappings. Recent solutions like Generalized Latent Data Assimilation (GLA) and Latent Space Data Assimilation (LSDA) address heterogeneous latent spaces by incorporating surrogate mapping functions but introduce computational costs and uncertainties. Furthermore, current algorithms that integrate data assimilation and deep learning still face limitations when it comes to handling non-explicit mapping functions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based data assimilation scheme, named Multi-domain Encoder–Decoder Latent Data Assimilation (MEDLA), capable of handling diverse data sources by sharing a common latent space. The proposed approach significantly reduces the computational burden since the complex mapping functions are mimicked by the multi-domain encoder–decoder neural network. It also enhances assimilation accuracy by minimizing interpolation and approximation errors. Extensive numerical experiments from three different test cases assess MEDLA’s performance in high dimensional dynamical systems, benchmarking it against state-of-the-art latent data assimilation methods. The numerical results consistently underscore MEDLA’s superiority in managing multi-scale observational data and tackling intricate, non-explicit mapping functions.},

  abstract     = {The use of deep learning methods in scientific computing represents a potential paradigm shift in engineering problem solving. One of the most prominent developments is Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), in which neural networks are trained to satisfy partial differential equations (PDEs). While this method shows promise, the standard version has been shown to struggle in accurately predicting the dynamic behavior of time-dependent problems. To address this challenge, methods have been proposed that decompose the time domain into multiple segments, employing a distinct neural network in each segment and directly incorporating continuity between them in the loss function of the minimization problem. In this work we introduce a method to exactly enforce continuity between successive time segments via a solution ansatz. This hard constrained sequential PINN (HCS-PINN) method is simple to implement and eliminates the need for any loss terms associated with temporal continuity. The method is tested for a number of benchmark problems involving both linear and non-linear PDEs. Examples include various first order time dependent problems in which traditional PINNs struggle, namely advection, Allen–Cahn, and Korteweg–de Vries equations. Furthermore, second and third order time-dependent problems are demonstrated via wave and Jerky dynamics examples, respectively. Notably, the Jerky dynamics problem is chaotic, making the problem especially sensitive to temporal accuracy. The numerical experiments conducted with the proposed method demonstrated superior convergence and accuracy over both traditional PINNs and the soft-constrained counterparts.},

For its construction we make use of a local simplex spline basis. The rule is shown to be optimal, with the minimum number of nodes. Next, in view of using C 1 C1 quadratic splines on triangulations in Galerkin finite element discretizations of differential problems, we design a collection of weighted quadrature rules that are helpful for an efficient formation of the linear systems arising in such discretizations. Lastly, we provide numerical comparisons with elementwise Gaussian rules and we illustrate the performance of the presented quadrature rules in the context of C 1 C1 quadratic spline finite elements on triangulations.},

The approach is comprised of three main facets. First, we derive a Gaussian filter for a statistically-dependent, vector-valued, additive and multiplicative noise model that is needed to evaluate the likelihood within the Bayesian posterior. Second, we develop a novel algorithm for cost-effective application of Bayesian system identification to high-dimensional systems. Third, we demonstrate how structure-preserving methods can be incorporated into the proposed framework, using nonseparable Hamiltonians as an illustrative system class. We assess the method’s performance based on the forecasting accuracy of a model estimated from single-trajectory data. We compare the Bayesian method to a state-of-the-art machine learning method on a canonical nonseparable Hamiltonian model and a chaotic double pendulum model with small, noisy training datasets. The results show that using the Bayesian posterior as a training objective can yield upwards of 724 times improvement in Hamiltonian mean squared error using training data with up to 10% multiplicative noise compared to a standard training objective. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of the novel algorithm for parameter estimation of a 64-dimensional model of the spatially-discretized nonlinear Schrödinger equation with data corrupted by up to 20% multiplicative noise.},

  abstract     = {There have been impressive advances in the physical and mathematical modelling of complex physiological systems in the last few decades, with the potential to revolutionise personalised healthcare with patient-specific evidence-based diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment decision support using digital twins. However, practical progress and genuine clinical impact hinge on successful model calibration, parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, which calls for novel innovative adaptions and methodological extensions of contemporary state-of-the-art inference techniques from Statistics and Machine Learning. In the present study, we focus on two computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) models of the blood systemic and pulmonary circulation. We discuss state-of-the-art emulation techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian processes, which are coupled with established inference techniques based on greedy optimisation, simulated annealing, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, History Matching and rejection sampling for computationally fast inference of unknown parameters of the CFD models from blood flow and pressure data. The inference task was set as a competitive challenge which the participants had to conduct within a limited time frame representative of clinical requirements. The performance of the methods was assessed independently and objectively by the challenge organisers, based on a ground truth that was unknown to the method developers. Our results indicate that for the systemic challenge, in which an idealised case of noise-free data was considered, the relative deviation from the ground-truth in parameter space ranges from 1 0 − 5 10−5 % (highest-performing method) to 3% (lowest-performing method). For the pulmonary challenge, for which noisy data was generated, the performance ranges from 0.9% to 7% deviation for the parameter posterior mean, and from 35% to 570% deviation for the parameter posterior variance.},

This study addresses challenges associated with enhancing buckling resistance through topology optimization, focusing on avoiding incorrect buckling analyses and reducing reliance on parameter tuning. To eliminate pseudo buckling modes in low-density elements, this research employs a linear material model and a stress relaxation function, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating pseudo modes. Additionally, a novel local stress relief strategy is proposed to avoid spurious localized modes caused by stress singularities or concentrations, particularly near applied loads and constrained nodes. The study also introduces a reformulated problem statement for buckling-constrained optimization that separates the critical buckling load factor (BLF) from the aggregation function, allowing the use of a small aggregation factor for the Kreisselmeier‐Steinhauser function. This reformulation effectively prevents the influence of aggregation parameters on the accuracy of the critical BLF approximation and enhances optimization stability by avoiding mode switching. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through both BLF maximization and buckling-constrained problems. A series of 2D and 3D examples demonstrate that the proposed algorithm requires minimal parameter tuning across various challenging cases, achieving stable convergence and satisfactory objective values while accurately meeting constraints. Additionally, the algorithm produces smooth designs that are conducive to manufacturing.},

Specifically, this work introduces a hybrid and adaptive coupling of a 3D bulk fluid flow model with a 2D thin film flow model. As a result, this work extends the applicability of existing thin film flow models to complex scenarios where, for example, bulk flow develops into thin films after striking a surface. At each location in space and time, the proposed framework automatically decides whether a 3D model or a 2D model must be applied. Using a meshless approach for both 3D and 2D models, at each particle, the decision to apply a 2D or 3D model is based on the user-prescribed resolution and a local principal component analysis. When a particle needs to be changed from a 3D model to 2D, or vice versa, the discretization is changed, and all relevant data mapping is done on-the-fly. Appropriate two-way coupling conditions and mass conservation considerations between the 3D and 2D models are also developed. Numerical results show that this model adaptive framework shows higher flexibility and compares well against finely resolved 3D simulations. In an actual application scenario, a 3 factor speed up is obtained, while maintaining the accuracy of the solution.},

  abstract     = {The application of neural network models to scientific machine learning tasks has proliferated in recent years. In particular, neural networks have proved to be adept at modeling processes with spatial–temporal complexity. Nevertheless, these highly parameterized models have garnered skepticism in their ability to produce outputs with quantified error bounds over the regimes of interest. Hence there is a need to find uncertainty quantification methods that are suitable for neural networks. In this work we present comparisons of the parametric uncertainty quantification of neural networks modeling complex spatial–temporal processes with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Stein variational gradient descent and its projected variant. Specifically we apply these methods to graph convolutional neural network models of evolving systems modeled with recurrent neural network and neural ordinary differential equations architectures. We show that Stein variational inference is a viable alternative to Monte Carlo methods with some clear advantages for complex neural network models. For our exemplars, Stein variational interference gave similar pushed forward uncertainty profiles through time compared to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, albeit with generally more generous variance. Projected Stein variational gradient descent also produced similar uncertainty profiles to the non-projected counterpart, but large reductions in the active weight space were confounded by the stability of the neural network predictions and the convoluted likelihood landscape.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, a novel modeling strategy to accelerate multi-scale simulations of heterogeneous materials using deep neural networks is developed. This approach, called FE-LSTM, consists of combining the finite element method and LSTM recurrent neural networks to solve multiscale problems. In contrast to FE 2 2 method, the finite element resolution of the microscopic problems is no longer required within FE-LSTM framework, the computation of RVE homogenized response is directly predicted by an LSTM trained on a database of offline micro simulations. The usefulness of such approach lies in the fact that once the RNN training process is performed, FE-LSTM can be applied to simulate nonlinear behaviors of any heterogeneous structure having the same microstructure used in training, considering a different Boundary Value Problem to solve. To assess the validity and reliability of the developed approach, FE-LSTM has been evaluated on several 3D architectured structures from rather simple to complex geometries under proportional and non proportional loading conditions. In terms of execution time, it has been found that FE-LSTM shows a speedup factor of nearly 40 000 as compared with legacy two-scale implementation of the FE 2 2 method, while up to date optimized FE 2 2 methods shows a speed up factor around 1000. Furthermore, RAM memory saving factor allow complex structures simulations to be conducted on desktop computers without requiring HPC clusters with specific additions to RAM memory.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) of different types, including fractional PDEs (fPDES) (Pang et al., 2019). Herein, we propose a new general (quasi) Monte Carlo PINN (GMC-PINNs) for solving fPDEs on irregular domains. Specifically, instead of approximating fractional derivatives by Monte Carlo approximations of integrals as was done previously in Guo et al. (2022), we use a more general Monte Carlo approximation method to solve different fPDEs, which is valid for fractional differentiation under any definition. Moreover, based on the ensemble probability density function, the generated nodes are all located in denser regions near the target point where we perform the differentiation. This has an unexpected connection with known finite difference methods on non-equidistant or nested grids, and hence our method inherits their advantages. At the same time, the generated nodes exhibit a block-like dense distribution, leading to a good computational efficiency of this approach. We present the framework for using this algorithm and apply it to several examples. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC-PINNs in dealing with irregular domain problems and show a higher computational efficiency compared to the original fPINN method. We also include comparisons with the Monte Carlo fPINN (Guo et al., 2022). Finally, we use examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in dealing with fuzzy boundary location problems, and then use the method to solve the coupled 3D fractional Bloch–Torrey equation defined in the ventricular domain of the human brain, and compare the results with classical numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty propagation (UP) is crucial for assessing the impact of input uncertainty on structural responses, holding significant importance in engineering applications. However, achieving accurate and efficient UP remains challenging, especially for highly nonlinear structures. Bayesian neural networks (BNN) have gained attention for addressing UP issues, yet current BNN models only utilize input samples and corresponding structural responses for training. However, incorporating gradients of structural responses with respect to input samples provides valuable information. This study proposes a novel approach called gradient-enhanced Bayesian neural networks (GEBNN) to tackle UP tasks. In the GEBNN, a modified evidence lower bound (MELBO) loss is developed to consider both structural responses and gradient information simultaneously. This includes disparities between actual and predicted responses, as well as disparities between actual and predicted derivatives. Additionally, a gradient screening strategy based on the marginal probability density functions (PDFs) of input samples is established to identify significant derivative data for GEBNN training. Once the GEBNN is configured, it is utilized to replace the computationally intensive finite element model to efficiently provide UP results. Various applications, including nonlinear numerical examples, and mechanical, civil, and aeronautical structures, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GEBNN. The results show that the GEBNN significantly enhances the computational accuracy of the BNN in solving UP tasks.},

  abstract     = {Conventional aerodynamic inverse design (AID) methods have major limitations in terms of optimality and actuality of target parameter distribution. In this research, the target pressure distribution (TPD) of the FX63–137 airfoil was manually corrected to enhance its lift-to-drag ratio from a design perspective, and the corresponding geometry was obtained by the elastic surface algorithm (ESA) inverse design method. An artificial neural network (ANN) was incorporated into the ESA to optimize the TPD and filter out pressure distributions that are not achievable or correspond to fishtail geometries. For this purpose, a genetic algorithm–deep learning (GA–DL) model was developed to optimize the TPD in which the DL model was used to approximate the cost function as a surrogate model. The data generated from CFD simulations during shape modifications in the inverse design were used to train the DL model to correlate PDs with aerodynamic coefficients. Using this approach, the TPD of the FX63–137 airfoil was optimized at a determined angle of attack to reach the maximum lift-to-drag ratio. The unrealistic PDs corresponding to fishtail geometries were eliminated automatically by the ANN during the online process of the inverse design. The results showed that the lift-to-drag ratio of the FX63–137 airfoil increased by more than 18 %. Contrary to traditional methods, the GA–DL model produced several greatly different improved geometries, which were more robust over a wide range of angles of attack. The proposed method addresses the greatest weakness of AID methods in determining the optimal target parameter distribution regardless of the user&#39;s input and initial design and without imposing further computational cost for acquiring an external dataset by exploiting the data obtained in the early stages of the design procedure.},

The continuous adjoint method is employed to derive the sensitivity, which is a general form that accepts any kind of discretization method. Then, the governing equations of the adjoint problem are derived as a format that holds at any moment and at any location in the continuum body or on its boundary. Accordingly, the proposed formulation is independent of any requirements in numerical implementation. In addition, the reaction–diffusion equation is used to update the design variable in an optimizing process, for which the continuous distribution of the design variable as well as material properties are maintained. Two specific optimization problems, stiffness maximization and plastic hardening maximization, for two and three-dimensional structures are presented to demonstrate the ability of the proposed formulation.},

A three-dimensional meshless framework for the fluid–structure interaction simulation with shell structures is proposed in this study. The weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics is deployed in the fluid domain, where the boundary integral terms are incorporated to handle the one-layer shell boundary. On the other hand, a semi-meshless finite volume modeling method based on the Reissner–Mindlin shell is deployed in the one-layer shell domain. A one-way coupling method is employed for the interactive forcing between the fluid and shell particles near the interface, where the boundary integral method is employed to approximate the gradient and Laplacian operators in the fluid governing equations. Regarding the no-slip boundary, the original boundary integral method always leads to the artificial slipping phenomenon between the fluid and shell interface. To this end, a velocity penalty term with a relaxation factor is proposed to enforce the no-slip boundary condition, which substantially improves the accuracy of the original boundary integral method. In order to reduce computational costs, a multi-resolution strategy for the meshless framework is employed. A set of challenging cases with low and high Reynolds numbers are simulated by the present framework, and good accuracy is observed with the velocity penalty term in these cases. Overall, the new framework shows a satisfactory performance.},

  abstract     = {Using a fixed Eulerian mesh, interface-capturing approaches such as volume-of-fluid, level-set and phase-field methods have been successfully utilized for a broad range of moving boundary problems involving multiphase fluids and single-phase fluid–structure interaction. Nevertheless, multiphase fluids interacting with multiple solids are rarely explored, especially for large-scale finite element simulations with contact dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel parallelized three-dimensional fully Eulerian variational framework for simulating multiphase fluids interacting with multiple deformable solids subjected to solid-to-solid contact. In the framework, each solid or fluid phase is identified by a standalone phase indicator. Moreover the phase indicators are initialized by the grid cell method, which restricts the calculation to several grid cells instead of the entire domain and provides efficiency for modeling evolving interfaces on a fixed mesh. A diffuse interface description is employed for a smooth interpolation of physical properties across the phases, yielding unified mass and momentum conservation equations for the coupled dynamical interactions. For each solid object, temporal integration is carried out to track the strain evolution in an Eulerian frame of reference. The coupled differential equations are solved in a partitioned manner and integrated via nonlinear iterations. We first verify the framework against reference numerical data in a two-dimensional case of a rotational disk in a lid-driven cavity flow. The case is generalized to a rotational sphere in a lid-driven cavity flow to showcase large deformation and rotational motion of solids and examine the convergence in three dimensions. We then simulate the falling of an immersed solid sphere on an elastic block under gravitational force to demonstrate the translational motion and the solid-to-solid contact in a fluid environment. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of our proposed framework for a ship–ice interaction problem involving multiphase fluids with an air–water interface and contact between a floating ship and ice floes.},

The proposed strategy relies on the LArge Time INcrement (LATIN) nonlinear solver combined with model reduction based on the Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD). The LATIN presents a robust treatment of contact conditions, sharing similarities with augmented Lagrangian approaches, and naturally leads to a mixed DDM. In addition, the global space–time formulation of the method allows PGD-based model reduction to be used during computations, creating and enriching on-the-fly reduced bases per substructure to better track sliding fronts and propagative phenomena. The introduction of a multiscale strategy in the LATIN framework is consistent with the physics of contact problems, in which phenomena with different wavelengths interact: local solutions at contact interfaces presents high gradient effects with a short wavelength compared to the characteristic length of the structure. By taking advantage of this, the coarse scale problem of the strategy enables to capture efficiently the behavior of the problem at the structural level, focusing then on capturing the local contact variations at the contact interfaces. The most important features of the approach are shown comprehensively on a simple one-dimensional frictional contact problem. Then, its robustness and effectiveness are tested on a two-dimensional multibody frictional contact problem with more complex loadings. Guidelines are also given for choosing the parameters of the strategy, in particular those driving the construction of the reduced basis.},

  abstract     = {Considering the intricate correlation among uncertain parameters from multiple sources in engineering practice, the bounded region describing parameter uncertainty displays irregular boundary features. To facilitate effective reliability analysis and optimization within this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability optimization design methodology grounded in rough set theory and a hybrid surrogate model. Initially, utilizing the concept of equivalent knowledge bases and limited experimental data, upper and lower approximation sets are constructed to quantitatively describe the irregular region of uncertain parameters from both internal and external perspectives. Subsequently, based on the upper and lower bounds of the response derived from the dual-approximate model, both radical and conservative reliability indexes are defined to assess system safety. On this basis, reliability optimization design models for complex structures are established by incorporating these indexes as constraints. Meanwhile, to enhance computational efficiency during each optimization iteration, a hybrid surrogate model integrating Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and Kriging models is employed, effectively substituting for the original computationally intensive simulations. Finally, the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified through a numerical example and two optimization problems relevant to aircraft structures.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we focus on topology optimization considering the accessibility constraint, which is a constraint that removes inaccessible regions from multiple linear directions. To detect inaccessible regions, we propose a method using a fictitious anisotropic diffusion equation. The proposed equation can simultaneously consider access from a bi-direction, which means one access direction and its 180-degree rotated direction, contributing to computational efficiency improvements. Additionally, we formulate a representative optimization problem with the accessibility constraint from multiple bi-directions and perform sensitivity analysis based on a coupled fictitious physics model. The model can resolve the difficulty in converging to a single optimal shape in the previous formulation method. Furthermore, through various numerical examples, we verify whether the numerical result converges to the optimal structure satisfying the accessibility constraint.},

The problem domain is partitioned into non-overlapping subdomains and the partitioned neural network functions are defined on the given non-overlapping subdomains. Each neural network function then approximates the solution in one subdomain. To obtain the convergent neural network solution, certain continuity conditions on the partitioned neural network functions across the subdomain interface need to be included in the loss function, that is used to train the parameters in the neural network functions. In our work, by introducing suitable interface values, the loss function is reformulated into a sum of localized loss functions and each localized loss function is used to train the corresponding local neural network parameters. In addition, to accelerate the neural network solution convergence, the localized loss function is enriched with an augmented Lagrangian term, where the interface condition and the boundary condition are enforced as constraints on the local solutions by using Lagrange multipliers. The local neural network parameters and Lagrange multipliers are then found by optimizing the localized loss function. To take the advantage of the localized loss function for the parallel computation, an iterative algorithm is also proposed. For the proposed algorithms, their training performance and convergence are numerically studied for various test examples.},

Furthermore, we propose a new approach to update porosity solely determined by the strain change rather than damage evolution as in the existing models. As such, these poroelastic behaviors of Biot’s coefficient and the porosity dictate Biot’s modulus and the thermal expansion coefficient. For numerical implementation, we employ an isotropic diffusion method to stabilize the advection-dominated heat flux and adapt the fixed stress split method to account for the thermal stress. We verify our model against a series of analytical solutions such as Terzaghi’s consolidation, thermal consolidation, and the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD fracture.

  abstract     = {Two complementary approximations for describing aspects of continuum electromagnetics in moving media are discussed: electroquasistatic and magnetoquasistatic. Each has been implemented in the finite element shock code ALEGRA for modeling dynamic electromechanical phenomena on typical engineering time scales, with fully integrated circuit coupling (Niederhaus et al. 2023). The approximations can be obtained by consistent asymptotic balancing of Maxwell’s equations relative to timescales associated with magnetic diffusion, charge relaxation, and electromagnetic wave propagation. In ALEGRA, the electroquasistatic approximation is used for ferroelectric (FE) modeling, while the magnetoquasistatic approximation is used for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling. In this paper we introduce for the first time a detailed derivation of a useful quasi-steady “low- R m Rm ” variant of the MHD approximation applicable for cases, such as with detonators, where the thermodynamic pressure arising from Joule heating dominates over magnetic forces. An additional purpose of this paper is to present a coupling mode using Multiple Program-Multiple Data (MPMD) message passing communication that allows the user to run 3D FE problems together with 2D and/or 3D MHD problems with the respective simulation domains coupled through a common circuit equation. The MPMD coupling capability is used here to model the dynamic coupling of a notional ferroelectric generator with an RP-87 exploding bridgewire detonator. The simulated bridgewire heats up and bursts under current generated by simulated depoling of the ferroelectric generator, as a demonstration of the MPMD capability.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we develop a novel framework to extract turbulent combustion closure, including closure for species chemical source terms, from multiscalar and velocity measurements in turbulent flames. The technique is based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that combines models for velocity and scalar measurements and a deep operator network (DeepONet) to accommodate spatial measurements and experimental parameters as separate input streams. An additional key innovation is the estimate of the unconditional means of the species’ chemical source terms as additional “observations” to constrain the prediction of these rates. This estimate is based on a convolution of the means of species reaction rates conditioned on principal components of the multiscalar data and the joint probability density functions of these principal components. The PINN-DeepONet method is implemented on the so-called Sydney flames, where training is carried out on 3 flames and validated on 4 flames. The results show that, despite the limited samples of experimental parameters, including the inlet flow and the fuel jet recess length within the air flow, the PINN-DeepONet approach can construct velocity and scalar fields along with important closure terms for turbulent transport and reaction rates.},

  abstract     = {Despite all the progress achieved in the characterization of heterogeneous materials by using multiscale paradigms based on the Representative Volume Element concept (RVE), there are still many aspects that demand ongoing development. We mention, for instance, in-homogeneous media with internal micro-structure comprising a mixture of components that require a dissimilar number/character of primary fields to describe their physical behavior. Micro-structures constituted by a saturated porous matrix (described through the pair displacement/pore pressure fields) endowed with impermeable non-porous solid inclusions (described only by the displacement field) are a typical example among many other practical applications. This new level of heterogeneity, between the set of primal descriptors for each micro-scale constituent, claims detailed revisions and novel adjustments in multiscale RVE-based theories. In this work, we present a first-order RVE-based formulation to address with the aforementioned phenomenology at a smaller length scale. At the macro-scale, the well-known poromechanics theory is preserved, where the constitutive response is provided by homogenization of the corresponding micro-scale problem. Two important attributes feature the model: (i) it is encompassed within the general framework posited by the “Method of Multiscale Virtual Power (MMVP)”, this leads to a variationally consistent methodology; (ii) our formulation preserves the objectivity with respect to the RVE-size (an indispensable but uncommon characteristic in RVE-based multiscale approaches for saturated porous media), due to it is based in a recent contribution of the authors (the so-called Selective Order Expansion technique “SOE”). The formulation is implemented following the squared Finite Element (FE 2 2 ) numerical scheme. The potentialities of the model are demonstrated through a detailed series of numerical examples, including rigorous comparisons against the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) procedure.},

  abstract     = {Simulating forced time-periodic flows in industrial applications presents significant computational challenges, partly due to the need to overcome costly transients before achieving time-periodicity. Reduced-order modelling emerges as a promising method to speed-up computations. We extend upon the work of Lotz et al. (2024) where a time-periodic space–time model is introduced. We present a time-periodic reduced-order model that directly finds the time-periodic solution without requiring extensive time integration. The reduced-order model gives a reduction in variables in both space and time. Our approach involves a POD-Galerkin reduced-order model based on a time-periodic full-order model that employs isogeometric analysis, residual-based variational multiscale turbulence modelling and weak boundary conditions. The projection-based reduced-order model inherits these features. We evaluate the reduced-order model with numerical experiments on moving hydrofoils. The motion is known a priori and we restrict ourselves to two spatial dimensions. In these experiments we vary the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers, and the motion profile respectively. Reduced-order model solutions agree well with those of the full-order model. The errors over the entire time period of thrust and lift forces are less than 0.2%. This includes complex scenarios such as the transition from drag to thrust production with increasing Strouhal number. Our time-periodic reduced-order model offers speed-ups ranging from O ( 1 0 2 ) O(102) to O ( 1 0 3 ) O(103) compared to the full-order model, depending upon the basis size. This makes it an appealing solution for prescribed time-periodic problems, with potential for additional speedup through nonlinear reduction techniques such as hyper-reduction.},

Preventive structure design and real-time maintain suggestions based on accurate numerical simulation are critical, especially when plasticity develops. It remains a challenge to efficiently model dynamic crack propagation in elasto-plastic materials while the uncertain factors in service life may significantly increase the difficulty. In this paper, a phase-field virtual modelling method (PFVM), based on the features of the novel extended support vector regression (X-SVR) method, is proposed to tackle this non-deterministic problem. The phase field method is adopted for its outstanding performance in complex fracture problems, which provides solid reference data for the virtual model&#39;s training and verification. The PFM application to dynamic elasto-plastic fracture problems is validated in two practical engineering examples. The integrated virtual modelling technique is then proven capable of instantly providing precise crack propagation prediction under multiple complex uncertainties, making up-to-date numerical dynamic fracture simulation achievable and affordable. The proposed PFVM method can minimize the contradiction between accurate modelling and high computational cost and can be utilized in various extensions like sensitivity analysis or design optimization.},

  abstract     = {In order to evaluate the failure probability corresponding to the Limit State Function (LSF) in structural reliability, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) linearizes the LSF and directly calculates the failure probability based on the Most Probable Point (MPP). But this method is unable to effectively handle nonlinear problems. The Second Order Reliability Method (SORM), on the other hand, utilizes the Hessian matrix to obtain curvature information at the MPP and computes the failure probability with Breitung&#39;s second-order approximation formula. However, SORM is unable to maintain satisfactory computational accuracy in highly nonlinear problems due to its lack of detailed analysis on the shape of the limit state surface. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Improved Approximation Integration Method (IAIM). The initial approximation of the limit state surface is based on the intersection region between the hypersphere and the n-dimensional paraboloid. Subsequently, a statistical analysis of the deviation between the aforementioned region and its projected area is conducted to construct a corresponding fitting function, which is then utilized for dimensionality reduction in the multidimensional integration of the approximation area. Finally, several examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed IAIM.},

  abstract     = {The integrated behavior of the fluid flow, encompassing variation of some specific response, has received more attention than mere examination of velocity and pressure distributions. A machine learning framework is introduced for the first time to elucidate and predict the complex fluid dynamic responses across varying time scales. For the same class of fluid processes, the dynamic response curves with varying time durations can be defined in terms of time scales and curve shapes. The former is predicted by a single-objective regression model, and the curves are normalized and recovered using time scaling and uniform interpolation. The latter are downscaled by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then predicted by a multi-objective regression model. As a novel application, this framework is employed to analyze small bubbles in a Newtonian fluid as they impact a horizontal wall, predicting the velocity, aspect ratio, and position dynamic response of the bubbles. Both Random Forest and Gaussian Process models, based on PCA-driven data processing, exhibit remarkable accuracy in describing and predicting complex dynamics of rising bubbles. Notably, PCA&#39;s principal components demonstrate independence and are set through rigorous cross-validation of the training set, rather than dependence on the Cumulative Variance Explained (CVE) values. Furthermore, our framework adeptly extends to predict the complex behavior of multiple bubble bounces by concatenating individual bounce predictions with high efficiency and precision. The proposed framework proves to be a catalyst for comprehending the dynamic response of fluids.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to solve large-scale variational inequalities (VIs), which are equivalent to high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach (Wu and Lisser, 2023) shows superior performance for VIs with less than 1000 variables, but fails for VIs of larger size, due to the increasing number of equations and the requirement of an extensive time interval. To overcome this limitation, we present two algorithms that dynamically adjust the initial condition for the PINN. The first algorithm uses multiple PINNs sequentially to decompose the task, where the best prediction from the current PINN serves as the initial condition for the next PINN. The second algorithm uses a single PINN throughout the solution process, immediately taking any improved prediction as an initial condition and refining the PINN to achieve a better prediction. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on a number of large-scale VI problems with up to 100,000 variables.},

  abstract     = {A partitioned flexibility method is presented as a dual to the recently developed displacement-only partitioned (DP) method (Park et al., 2023). The proposed PartFlex method relies on existing FEM software to generate the partitioned block-diagonal mass and flexibility matrices, and associated FEM partitioned nodal topology information. Unlike the classical force method whose formulations are all critically influenced by the choices of indeterminate redundants and how cuts(partitions) are chosen, the present PartFlex method can be constructed as automatic as the construction of displacement FEM equations. That is, the construction of the present flexibility equations does not depends on user’s level of expertise. Three key enablers employed in the present PartFlex method are: the use of localized Lagrange multipliers that yields a linearly independent and unique set of interface reaction forces for both determinate as well as indeterminate partitions, the enforcement of Newton’s 3rd law along the partition boundaries so that the reaction forces disappear when the partitioned substructures are assembled, and rigid-body modes for floating partitions. The validity of the PartFlex method is demonstrated by analyzing several example problems, and unlike the classical force method that has difficulty in modeling continuum structures such as plates, shells and solids, the present PartFlex method can be efficiently used to model continuum structures.},

Initially, we define both reliability and failure indices of NPFRA, and provide the corresponding Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) solution. Additionally, an extended variable space (EVS) method is established to transform the NPFRA problem into a conventional non-probabilistic reliability analysis (NPRA) one, and MCS based on EVS is derived accordingly. To address the efficiency issue of MCS, a novel method called active learning kriging with norm-constrained expected risk function (ALK-NERF) is developed explicitly for NPFRA. Four examples are adopted to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed ALK-NERF for NPFRA.},

  abstract     = {Most existing Finite Element Method and the Material Point Method (FEM-MPM) coupling is designed for explicit solvers. By contrast, implicit schemes offer the advantage of substantially larger time steps while maintaining enhanced stability, particularly beneficial for tackling stiff nonlinear problems. Despite this, the development of implicit FEM-MPM coupling has not been extensively explored, leaving a notable gap in the context of contact and elastoplastic deformation challenges. Thus, this paper proposes a novel unified FEM-MPM coupling approach within implicit time integration under the framework of multivariable variational principle and convex cone programming, termed CP-FEMP. The CP-FEMP is the first successful attempt to impose the contact constraints via Lagrange multiplier and barrier method under convex cone programming, which can tackle not only the tie constraints but also the frictional contact between MPM and FEM domains with ensuring convergence and feasibility regardless of the time step size or the mesh resolutions. The contact locking issue in tie contact is circumvented using a well-defined interpolation space. The governing equations, associated frictional contact model, and associated elastoplastic constitutive law are formulated into a global convex optimisation problem, which is efficiently solved using primal-dual interior-point method. Through a succession of standard contact and elastoplastic benchmarks, the CP-FEMP demonstrates its proficiency in the precise transference of contact forces across MPM and FEM domains while showcasing commendable energy conservation attributes. Finally, the CP-FEMP is applied to a slope-retaining wall interaction problem. All results demonstrate CP-FEMP provides a comprehensive solution for FEM-MPM coupling, allowing for large incremental step under nonlinear contact and elastoplastic large deformation and guaranteeing strict, hard non-penetration conditions without convergence issues.},

We use the framework to accelerate phase field (PF) fracture problems involving coupled partial differential equations with a near-singular operator due to near-zero modulus inside the crack. We define the initial graph representation using all mesh resolution levels. We perform a series of downsampling steps using Transformer MP GNNs to reach the coarsest graph followed by upsampling steps to reach the original graph. We use skip connectors from the generated embedding during coarsening to prevent over-smoothing. We use Transfer Learning (TL) to significantly reduce the size of training datasets needed to simulate different crack configurations and loading conditions. The trained framework showed accelerated simulation times, while maintaining high accuracy for all cases compared to physics-based PF fracture model.

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel Topological Derivative-based Sensitivity Analysis (TDSA) methodology for three-dimensional (3D) discrete variable topology optimization. Recently, the authors pointed out that the discrete variable sensitivity can be related to the topological derivative, and thus can be rationally approximated by the specially customized topological derivative for plane stress problems. However, the 3D discrete variable sensitivity requires the 3D topological derivative with element-shaped (e.g., unit cube) domain perturbation, whose analytical solution is not available in the literature. This paper proposes a unified parameter fitting framework to calculate the 3D topological derivative with arbitrary shape 3D domain perturbation. The formula for spherical hole perturbation obtained through this parameter fitting framework is identical to the well-known analytical topological derivative formula. Further, the 3D discrete variable sensitivity can be easily obtained through element-shaped domain perturbation. With the recently proposed Sequential Approximate Integer Programming (SAIP), numerical examples demonstrate that TDSA is precise not only for the self-adjoint 3D minimum compliance problems but also for the non-adjoint 3D compliant mechanism design problems. In sum, numerical examples have been conducted by feeding the derived sensitivity to the SAIP optimization algorithms, and the correctness of the sensitivity information has been well demonstrated. This research further solidifies the foundation of rational discrete variable sensitivity analysis in 3D topology optimization.},

In this study, we propose a new active learning surrogate-based method to predict the expected lifetime of structural systems affected by both time and space factors. The method starts by training an initial Kriging model with random samples and time-space coordinates. An extended expected feasibility function is proposed to select new training samples and their corresponding time-space coordinates, refining the Kriging model. A novel parallel learning strategy is proposed to expedite computations. By using the constructed Kriging model and the first failure time of random samples, we can predict the expected lifetime. The proposed method is adaptable to structural systems with multiple failure modes, implicit functions, and random field variations. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are validated through four examples.},

In this article, we propose a novel methodology for learning differential operators that are theoretically linearly stable and have sparsity patterns of common discretization schemes. These differential operators are obtained by solving a constrained regression problem, involving local constraints to ensure the linear stability of the global dynamical system. We further extend this approach for learning nonlinear differential operators by determining linear stability constraints for linearized equations around an equilibrium point. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations such as 1-D scalar advection-diffusion equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicated that solutions to constrained regression problems with linear stability constraints provide accurate and linearly stable sparse differential operators.},

Subsequently, a deep neural network (DNN) is used to map the parameter latent space to the state variable latent space. An approximate Bayesian method is developed for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in the proposed KL-DNN surrogate model. The KL-DNN method is tested for the linear advection–diffusion and nonlinear diffusion equations, and the Bayesian approach for UQ is compared with the deep ensembling (DE) approach, commonly used for quantifying uncertainty in DNN models. It was found that the approximate Bayesian method provides a more informative distribution of the PDE solutions in terms of the coverage of the reference PDE solutions (the percentage of nodes where the reference solution is within the confidence interval predicted by the UQ methods) and log predictive probability. The DE method is found to underestimate uncertainty and introduce bias. For the nonlinear diffusion equation, we compare the KL-DNN method with the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) method and find that KL-DNN is 10% more accurate and needs less training time than the FNO method.},

Our focus lies on delivering practical GRF realizations that accurately capture imperfections and variations and understanding how they impact the predictions of computational models as well as the shape and topology of optimized designs. We describe a numerical algorithm based on solving a generalized SPDE to sample GRFs on arbitrary meshed domains. The algorithm leverages established techniques and integrates seamlessly with the open-source finite element library MFEM and associated scientific computing workflows, like those found in industrial and national laboratory settings. Our solver scales efficiently for large-scale problems and supports various domain types, including surfaces and embedded manifolds. We showcase its versatility through biomechanics and topology optimization applications, emphasizing the potential to influence these domains. The flexibility and efficiency of SPDE-based GRF generation empowers us to run large-scale optimization problems on 2D and 3D domains, including finding optimized designs on embedded surfaces, and to generate design features and topologies beyond the reach of conventional techniques. Moreover, these capabilities allow us to model and quantify geometric uncertainties on reconstructed submanifolds, such as the interpolated surfaces of cerebral aneurysms provided by postprocessing CT scans. In addition to offering benefits in these specific domains, the proposed techniques transcend specific applications and generalize to arbitrary forward and backward problems in uncertainty quantification involving finite elements.},

  abstract     = {We derive a novel formulation for the interaction potential between deformable fibers due to short-range fields arising from intermolecular forces. The formulation improves the existing section–section interaction potential law for in-plane beams by considering an offset between interacting cross sections. The new law is asymptotically consistent, which is particularly beneficial for computationally demanding scenarios involving short-range interactions like van der Waals and steric forces. The formulation is implemented within a framework of rotation-free Bernoulli–Euler beams utilizing the isogeometric paradigm. The improved accuracy of the novel law is confirmed through thorough numerical studies. We apply the developed formulation to investigate the complex behavior observed during peeling and pull-off of elastic fibers interacting via the Lennard–Jones potential.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces three dimensional (3D) topology optimization specifically tailored for designing spatially-varying primitive-cubic (CP) type lattice structures. The developed design process consists of three steps: pre-processing, main processing, and post-processing. In the pre-processing step, a surrogate model between lattice geometry variables and effective elasticity tensor is constructed using an artificial neural network. This surrogate model is essential because it enables the quick calculation of the effective elasticity tensor of lattice microstructure. In the subsequent main processing step, multiscale topology optimization is performed. During this step, lattice microstructure size and rotation design variables are optimized together with the macrostructure density design variables. Macrostructures are designed using a well-established three-field density scheme with a SIMP formulation. Formulations for spatially-varying 3D lattice microstructure are newly developed based on a unit quaternion rotation representation scheme. In the final post-processing step, a spatially-varying microstructure is restored using a de-homogenization scheme, newly developed particularly for the primitive-cubic (CP) type 3D lattice structures. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed formulations are validated through three design examples for the compliance minimization problem. Moreover, a designed lattice structure is fabricated using an additive manufacturing machine.},

  abstract     = {The stiffness of a proportionally loaded structure may continuously increase or decrease. As a special exception, it may be constant. On the other hand, an initially stiffening (softening) structure may turn into a softening (stiffening) structure. At the load level of such a change the stiffness of the structure attains an extreme value. The task of this work is to present mathematical conditions for these load levels. Lack of them represents a void in the pertinent literature. The practical significance of the aforementioned changes is the one of indicators of the mechanical behavior to be expected after their occurrence. The second and the last author have recently presented a condition for the load level at which the stiffness of a proportionally loaded structure becomes a minimum value. It is given as d 2 ( ℜ ( χ 1 ( λ ) ) ) / d λ 2 = 0 d2(ℜ(χ1(λ)))/dλ2=0 , representing the condition for a point of inflection of the real part of a complex eigenvalue function χ 1 ( λ ) χ1(λ) , where λ λ denotes a dimensionless load parameter. The underlying linear eigenvalue problem has two indefinite coefficient matrices, which is a necessary condition for complex regions of eigenvalue functions. These matrices are established with hybrid elements, available in a commercial finite element program. In the present work, d 2 ( χ 1 ( λ ) ) / d λ 2 = 0 d2(χ1(λ))/dλ2=0 is shown to be the condition for the load level at which the stiffness of a proportionally loaded structure attains a maximum value. The eigenvalue function concerned has no complex region. It is also shown that the displacement elements, which are the basis for their extension to the employed hybrid elements, are unable to indicate the load level at an extreme value of the stiffness.},

This paper introduces a phase field-based topology optimization method for designing shell-infill structures. Interface-related issues can be easily addressed through the phase field function. A coupled topology optimization process is proposed to establish the connection between the shell and infill, facilitating the generation of optimized structures. The shell thickness, infill pattern and infill volume percentage, can be naturally controlled by different model parameters. Additionally, multiscale phase field topology optimization integrates the numerical homogenization method to evaluate the effective elasticity matrix of the microstructural infill. The approach is introduced for a uniform, periodical microstructure layout in the infill region, thereby achieving superior mechanical properties. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the design of both 2D and 3D shell-infill structures.},

The peridynamic material correspondence formulation provides passage for direct incorporation of any material constitutive models from the classical local continuum mechanics theory. The performance of the material correspondence formulation heavily relies on the influence function whose currently used form is spherical and depends only on the bond length. Together with the way how the nonlocal deformation gradient is constructed based on the material point horizon, this results in the well-known issue of material instability in the conventional peridynamic material correspondence formulation. In this paper, a generalized peridynamic material correspondence formulation that enables use both spherical and non-spherical influence functions is developed. A recently proposed class of parameterized non-spherical influence functions that depend on both the bond length and bond direction is used in the generalized formulation. Numerical examples including wave dispersion, small and finite deformation and linear elastic fracture analyses are studied to check the material stability, convergence characteristic, prediction accuracy and applicability to fracture problems without singularity issue of the proposed formulation. It is found that the proposed formulation is inherently stable, possesses linear convergence rate, yields highly accurate predictions for both small and finite deformation problems, and small horizon can be used to improve computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In engineering applications, plenty of components are subjected to variable-amplitude cyclic loading, resulting in fatigue damage, which is one of the main forms of structural damage. While the linear damage rule has long served as a fundamental approach, its limitations necessitate advancements for more accurate fatigue life predictions. Hence, this paper introduces a pioneering method termed nonlinear fatigue damage constrained topology optimization (NFDCTO). This method integrates several key components: the rainflow counting method to evaluate the non-proportional cyclic load levels, Basquin&#39;s equation to describe the S-N curve, and Morrow&#39;s plastic work interaction rule to calculate the nonlinear cumulative damage of the structure. Consequently, we establish a mathematical model for the NFDCTO method based on these components. The incorporation of penalized damage aggregation with the P-Normal function is used to address significant constraints and singularity challenges. Furthermore, by employing the adjoint method, we derive sensitivity equations for both the objective function and fatigue constraint function concerning the design variables. Subsequently, the superiority of the NFDCTO method over traditional linear fatigue damage method were verified applying 2D l -shaped beam and simply supported structures as examples. Concurrently, bridge structures were employed to investigate the effect of the sensitivity index of the material to the history of variable amplitude stresses on the optimization results. In addition, the influence of the fatigue penalty factor on the topology optimization results was assessed using a 2D cantilever beam. Finaly, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the NFDCTO method in addressing fatigue optimization challenges for 3D structures utilizing two 3D examples.},

We created two variants of an ML-enhanced CFD solver which were able to reduce the number of iterations required by the CFD pressure solver during unsteady flow simulations. Consequently, the simulations yielded comparable drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers, accompanied by an eightfold decrease in execution time. The performance enhancements are attributed to reduced computational effort per temporal iteration and early-stage forcing on the simulation dynamical behavior when using the ML-based surrogate models. This research introduces an approach to enhance the computational efficiency of fluid flow analyses by incorporating surrogate models to aid the pressure solver in CFD simulations.

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel computationally efficient methodology to perform topology optimization (TO) of fourth-order plate structures within the framework of multi-patch isogeometric analysis. This is realized by taking the multifold benefits of isogeometric PHT-Splines to (1) discretize the C 1 C1 continuous weak form of plate structures, (2) develop a C 0 C0 continuous density field for the material distribution in TO and inherently remove the need for filters, and (3) provide a hierarchical tree structure for the structural mesh to effortlessly implement an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy. Moreover, to ensure continuity between isogeometric patches, we adopt a strong C 1 C1 coupling between the boundaries. This is established by constructing new basis functions, defined as a linear combination of existing C 0 C0 functions at the patch interfaces. The density field in TO is further enhanced with a first-neighbourhood smoothening algorithm based on the Shepard function to generate printable topologies and alleviate the post-processing stages after optimization. An element-centre density, based on the control point densities of the isogeometric mesh, is used as the marking scheme for the AMR to determine the subdomains to be refined. Utilizing the Geometry Independent Field approximaTion, the design and adaptive analysis-optimization stages were independently discretized respectively through NURBS and PHT-Splines, allowing easy transfer of multi-patch geometries from industry-standard packages. Multiple numerical examples illustrate the stability of the multi-patch algorithm in optimizing the geometries effectively. The results also show considerable advantages in terms of solution accuracy such as precise field, smooth topology and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Modern digital engineering design process commonly involves expensive repeated simulations on varying three-dimensional (3D) geometries. The efficient prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them a suitable surrogate to provide design insights. Nevertheless, few available NNs can handle solution prediction on varying 3D shapes. We present a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) variant called Geom-DeepONet, which encodes parameterized 3D geometries and predicts full-field solutions on an arbitrary number of nodes. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature and is our primary novelty. In addition to expressing shapes using mesh coordinates, the signed distance function for each node is evaluated and used to augment the inputs to the trunk network of the Geom-DeepONet, thereby capturing both explicit and implicit representations of the 3D shapes. The powerful geometric encoding capability of a sinusoidal representation network (SIREN) is also exploited by replacing the classical feedforward neural networks in the trunk with SIREN. Additional data fusion between the branch and trunk networks is introduced by an element-wise product. A numerical benchmark was conducted to compare Geom-DeepONet to PointNet and vanilla DeepONet, where results show that our architecture trains fast with a small memory footprint and yields the most accurate results among the three. Results show a much lower generalization error of our architecture on unseen dissimilar designs than vanilla DeepONet. Training the model on 2500 cuboid designs is done within 2 h on a single A100 GPU while generating the training dataset through finite element simulations took about 27 h. Once trained, the model can predict vector fields and a single prediction can be over 1 0 5 105 times faster than its corresponding implicit finite element simulation if the mesh is large. The ability of the proposed model to perform efficient and accurate field predictions on variable 3D geometries, especially those discretized by different nodes and elements, makes it a valuable tool for preliminary performance evaluation and design optimizations and is the most significant contribution of the current work.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) has been used to solve multiphysics problems like thermoelasticity through multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks. However, MLPs have high computational costs and need to be trained for each prediction instance. To overcome these limitations, we introduced an integrated finite element neural network (I-FENN) framework to solve transient thermoelasticity problems in Abueidda and Mobasher (2024). This approach used a physics-informed temporal convolutional network (PI-TCN) within a finite element scheme for solving transient thermoelasticity problems. In this paper, we introduce an I-FENN framework using a new variational TCN model trained to minimize the thermoelastic variational form rather than the strong form of the energy balance. We mathematically prove that the I-FENN setup based on minimizing the variational form of transient thermoelasticity still leads to the same solution as the strong form. Introducing the variational form to the ML model brings the advantages of lower requirement for the differentiability of the basis function and, thus, lower memory requirement and higher computational efficiency. Also, it automatically satisfies zero Neumann boundary conditions, thus reducing the complexity of the loss function. The formulation based on the variational form complies with thermodynamic requirements. The proposed loss function reduces the difference between predicted and target data while minimizing the variational form of thermoelasticity equations, combining the benefits of both data-driven and variational methods. In addition, this study uses finite element shape functions for spatial gradient calculations and compares their performance against automatic differentiation. Our results reveal that models leveraging shape functions exhibit higher accuracy in capturing the behavior of the thermoelasticity problem and faster convergence. Adding the variational term and using shape functions for gradient calculations ensure better adherence to the underlying physics. We demonstrate the capabilities of this I-FENN framework through multiple numerical examples. Additionally, we discuss the convergence of the proposed variational TCN model and the impact of hyperparameters on its performance. The proposed approach offers a well-founded and flexible platform for solving fully coupled thermoelasticity problems while retaining computational efficiency, where the efficiency scales proportional to the model size.},

  abstract     = {An immersed boundary fast integration methodology featured by a consistent weight learning is proposed to accelerate Galerkin meshfree computation. In the proposed approach, the problem domain is embedded in a rectangular spatial domain discretized by regular distributions of meshfree nodes and integration sampling points with virtual integration cells. A trimming operation of the rectangular spatial domain by the physical problem boundary with nodal discretization yields the discrete model for meshfree computation, where the integration sampling points are grouped into the interior sampling points and the near boundary sampling points which form a training set. For the interior sampling points, a natural alignment between the influence domains of meshfree shape functions and virtual integration cells can be easily realized through employing integer support sizes, which ensures a satisfactory accuracy for the basis degree correspondent normal order Gauss integration. The background cells for the domain integration are completely avoided, which greatly simplifies the preprocessing for numerical integration. Meanwhile, a machine learning module is devised to optimize the weights of near boundary integration sampling points. The key step to construct this machine learning module for weight optimization is the selection of the variational integration consistency condition as the loss function, which guarantees the convergence of Galerkin meshfree formulation. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed weight learning immersed boundary fast integration methodology is thoroughly validated through numerical results.},

  abstract     = {The design of smart structures is challenging because of the integrated electromechanical modelling and optimization of actuators, sensors and load-bearing structures. To simplify the design process, it is common to decouple some of the components and physics and develop each part separately, which could lead to suboptimal systems. To improve the overall design of active structures, we propose an integrated and fully coupled design methodology for a certain class of smart structures. Specifically, this paper presents a numerical framework for the simultaneous application of density-based topology optimization of multi-material conductive compliant mechanisms and a composite multi-layered geometry-projection method for the optimization of the size, position and orientation of embedded piezoelectric stack actuators. Their electromechanical properties are represented in a continuum-based setting by an orientation- and geometry-dependent equivalent material model and their activation depends on the distribution of conductive material in the structure. Furthermore, a novel constraint on the polarization of the actuators is proposed to avoid unwanted designs that could cause their mechanical degradation. A set of numerical examples is analysed and discussed. The proposed framework exhibits promising results, with significant improvements in comparison to a benchmark problem.},

We derive novel multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators which rely on a shared subspace between the high-fidelity and low-fidelity models where the parameters follow the same probability distribution, i.e., a standard Gaussian. We build the shared space employing normalizing flows to map different probability distributions into a common one, together with linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, active subspaces and autoencoders, respectively, which capture the subspaces where the models vary the most. We then compose the existing low-fidelity model with these transformations and construct modified models with an increased correlation with the high-fidelity model, which therefore yield multifidelity estimators with reduced variance.

  abstract     = {Numerical simulation of moving boundary flows with topological changes in the fluid domain presents a significant challenge, as traditional mesh-based formulations cannot directly deal with these changes. In this work, we propose a novel position-based Particle Finite Element Method derived from the stationary total mechanical energy principle applied to incompressible Newtonian flows. The use of positions as the main variables instead of velocities might have some advantages in certain scenarios: i. it eliminates the need for an additional step to compute displacements based on particles velocities; ii. it naturally accounts for the geometric non-linearities through the deformation gradient and iii. the resulting approach seems ideal to simulate FSI problems in a monolithic way as hyperelastic materials are usually written in terms of position or displacement. The solution process follows the well-established PFEM, where the entire domain is discretized with particles and a finite element mesh is generated over them to solve the motion equations using the proposed approach. The reference is updated whenever the mesh needs to be reconstructed, resulting in a partially updated Lagrangian description. The incompressibility constraint is enforced using a mixed approach, where pressure is interpolated in the same polynomial basis as the positions. LBB condition is circumvented by applying a Lagrangian version of the pressure stabilization/Petrov–Galerkin (PSPG) technique. The proposed formulation is verified through numerical examples, demonstrating its robustness, accuracy, and applicability.},

Finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs) improve the performance of PINNs in this regime by combining them with an overlapping domain decomposition approach. In this work, FBPINNs are extended by adding multiple levels of domain decompositions to their solution ansatz, inspired by classical multilevel Schwarz domain decomposition methods (DDMs). Analogous to typical tests for classical DDMs, we assess how the accuracy of PINNs, FBPINNs and multilevel FBPINNs scale with respect to computational effort and solution complexity by carrying out strong and weak scaling tests. Our numerical results show that the proposed multilevel FBPINNs consistently and significantly outperform PINNs across a range of problems with high frequency and multi-scale solutions. Furthermore, as expected in classical DDMs, we show that multilevel FBPINNs improve the accuracy of FBPINNs when using large numbers of subdomains by aiding global communication between subdomains.},

In so doing these methods enable code reuse, increase concurrency and provide a convenient framework for plug-and-play multiphysics simulations. However, mathematically loosely coupled schemes are equivalent to a single step of an iterative solution method, which can compromise their accuracy and stability. We present a new data-driven partitioned method for coupled parametric PDEs that can improve upon the accuracy of traditional loosely coupled methods without incurring a performance penalty. To that end, we replace conventional field transfers across the interface by a surrogate for the dynamics of the interface flux exchanged between the subdomains. To develop this surrogate we apply dynamic mode decomposition to a non-standard staggered-in-time state, comprising the interface flux and small solution patches near the interface. The new approach shifts the main computational burden to an offline training phase, whereas application of the surrogate in the online phase amounts to a single matrix–vector multiplication. We provide stability analysis of the surrogate-based partitioned scheme and include numerical results that demonstrate its potential.},

This procedure preserves the original boundary conditions on the corrected velocity and it removes any pressure inconsistencies. As a main feature, our method allows the temperature to be transported by a non-divergence-free velocity, in which case we show how to handle the subtle temperature convection term in the error analysis and establish full first-order error estimates for the velocity and the temperature solutions and 1 / 2 1/2 -order estimates for the pressure solution in their appropriate norms.

To face these challenges, a holistic approach is essential that allows for the concurrent development of part design, material system and manufacturing process.

Data-driven machine learning methods can be used to replace time- and resource-intensive numerical simulations. In particular, MeshGraphNets (MGNs) have shown promising results. They enable fast and accurate predictions on unseen mesh geometries while being fully differentiable for optimization. However, these models rely on large amounts of expensive training data, such as numerical simulations.

This work introduces PI-MGNs, a hybrid approach that combines PINNs and MGNs to quickly and accurately solve non-stationary and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary meshes. The method is exemplified for thermal process simulations of unseen parts with inhomogeneous material distribution. Further results show that the model scales well to large and complex meshes after being trained exclusively on small, generic meshes.},

  abstract     = {Continuum damage models are often employed to represent cracking in quasi-brittle materials ( e.g. , concrete, masonry and some rocks). From a numerical perspective, these models yield mesh-dependent results at the structural scale without regularization. Standard regularization techniques are prone, however, to some well-known drawbacks. To address these limitations, non-local models with evolving interactions have been proposed. Inspired by the analogy between non-local interactions and wave propagation time in a damaged domain, the eikonal non-local regularization introduces evolving non-local interactions through a damage-dependent metric field. The contribution of the paper involves coupling for the first time the gradient-enhanced version of the eikonal non-local formulation with a second-order anisotropic damage constitutive model. Such an aspect is essential when modeling quasi-brittle materials, since the material response is anisotropic and associated with various well-established behaviors, including the dissymmetry between tension and compression and unilateral effect. The manuscript provides a detailed overview of the formulation, numerical solution methods, and test cases, demonstrating some important features of these models. Attention is focused not only on the regularization properties of the formulation but also on its capability to naturally represent the transition from damage to fracture.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainties resulting from geometrical dimensions, external load, and material properties are inevitable in realistic engineering applications. Such uncertainties may result in substantial ineffectiveness in system performance or even unreliability in optimized outcomes which a designer must handle prior to the design and production stages. To address these issues, in this study, a novel hybrid reliability based topology optimization (RBTO) method is extended for considering the probabilistic constraints under uncertainties of compliance TO problems for evaluating the optimum layout. The optimum shapes of continues structures are evaluated based on the various TO approaches combined with the Newton&#39;s method and then the probabilistic constraints are approximated based on the performance measure approach (PMA) computed by the conjugate finite step mean value (CFMV). Inverse TO-based Newton’ method (TOBN) is implemented for three different topology optimizations including evolutionary structural optimization (ESO), SIMP, and level set method. In TOBN, optimal results included optimal elemental data are yielded through mean volume fraction method TO which later these optimal results are used for RBTO method by hybrid approaches as TOBN for topology design optimum and CFMV for reliability assessment of topology constraints under uncertainties named TOBN CFMV. The CFMV approximates the probabilistic constraints under a conjugate sensitivity vector evaluated based on the finite value of gradient vector and new points i.e. most probable points (MPP). In the CFMV method, decent conditions are guaranteed stability when the objective function in the TO is structural compliance minimization. By having the MPP values the optimized volume fraction and therefore optimized features for RBTO can be achieved. The combination of Newton&#39;s method, the highly improved CFMV solution, and TO methods can be regarded as the innovations of the proposed approach. Additionally, the TOBN and dynamical mean value introduce a new sequential TO and reliability analysis method (STORA). The methodologies are demonstrated on benchmark problems which are frequently utilized in different TO approaches considering the uncertainties including material properties and external loads. With the comparison of the derived optimal results and topologies of TO and RBTOs, advantageous results concerning efficiency, validity, and accuracy of RBTO solution are drawn.},

  abstract     = {One strategy for predicting the state of nonlinear dynamical systems (typically of high dimensionality) is global linearization, such as utilizing the Koopman analysis model to transform the system state into an invariant subspace that evolves linearly. A critical challenge in the Koopman model is designing or deriving observation functions, typically nonlinear, to linearize the dynamical systems. To address the challenge, this study proposes a model called SKCAE (Skip-connected Koopman Convolutional AutoEncoder) that combines guidance of physics and data to learn observation functions accurately and efficiently. The novelties of SKCAE are twofold: (1) a coordinate-transforming main network for the construction of nonlinear observation functions, enabling the explicit identification of the low-dimensional dynamics that dominate the system&#39;s dynamical evolution, and (2) a Koopman dynamics-oriented subnetwork for quantitatively interpreting the system&#39;s intrinsic mechanisms from the frequency perspective and efficiently predicting the system state. Four numerical cases with discrete/continuous spectra on Eulerian/Lagrangrian descriptions are studied, i.e., fixed-point attractor, Duffing oscillator, fluid flow past a cylinder, and channel turbulence. Results demonstrate that SKCAE achieves significant improvement (up to a hundred times) in accuracy compared to conventional models and possesses remarkable capability in handling scenarios with data noises and/or loss, owing to its intrinsic advantage in retaining a broad range of frequency components of a dynamical system.},

  abstract     = {In scale-resolving simulations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES), the spatial discretization scheme of the convective term plays a crucial role in avoiding interference between the numerical errors and the subgrid-scale model. Accurate schemes lead to lower truncation errors and better predictions of turbulent flows without the need for an excessively refined grid. To this end, a new second-order finite-difference scheme (HCDS6) has been developed for incompressible flows and orthogonal staggered grids. Compared to the standard second-order scheme, the new scheme has significantly lower dispersion errors. Compared to existing high-order schemes, the numerical stencil of HCDS6 is more compact, which makes it easier to implement, especially considering boundary conditions around complex geometries using Immersed Boundary Methods (IBM). The HCDS6 scheme conserves the discrete momentum with limited production or dissipation of discrete kinetic energy, which guarantees its numerical stability. Its performance is evaluated using an open-source CFD package called REEF3D. Three benchmarks demonstrate the key properties and performance of the scheme: the convection of an isentropic vortex, the Taylor-Green vortex flow, and turbulent channel flow. Its relatively low dispersion errors, combined with ease of implementation, make the HCDS6 scheme a promising candidate for efficient scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flows.},

  abstract     = {Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composites exhibit significant potential in lightweight and multifunctionality due to its superior designability, which have been extensively employed in leading-edge industries, including automotive, aerospace, maritime, sports and wearable devices. Dynamic problems with certain frequency responses arise in these practical situations, in which even a small excitation force could result in severe deformation in composite structures, thereby largely affecting the performance. To address this critical design issue, we propose a novel topology optimization approach for controlling dynamic responses of FRP structures. A discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) method is developed for parameterization of topological and fiber orientation variables, in which the Heaviside penalization of polynomial interpolation scheme (HP-PIS) and rational approximate material penalization (RAMP) method are adopted for variable discretization, respectively. A new frequency response analysis (for short nFRA) method is implemented and a decoupled sensitivity analysis is incorporated in the optimization process. The design aims to minimize the dynamic displacement responses of FRP composites under given volume fraction. To verify the computational efficiency and accuracy of the optimization process, a comparative study is first conducted with the conventional mode displacement method (MDM), mode acceleration method (MAM), and original adjoint variable method (AVM) through a benchmark example. The generality and robustness of the proposed optimization procedure are further validated through the several numerical problems for a given excitation frequency and frequency band. The results demonstrate considerable potential of the proposed method for solving the frequency based dynamic topology optimization of FRP composite structures.},

Our method is able to receive various heat sources as inputs. To make the optimized structures porous, the input heat sources are constrained to be porous, e.g., wireframe models, stress lines inputs.

  abstract     = {Finite element simulations have become an integral part of product development and are extensively used in research as well. Depending on the complexity of the geometry or the physical problem, these simulations lead to a great degree of computational cost and time. In this study, we introduce a generative learning-based approach to accelerate finite element simulations. The aim is to explore the ability of generative adversarial networks to predict the output of a finite element simulation from a discretized domain with boundary conditions from a finite element pre-processor. The drawback of fully connected regression and recurrent models is that they are often bound to the distribution of training data and cannot extrapolate outside of the training domain. Generative models, however, can learn the underlying distribution of data and can efficiently extrapolate outside the training range. The goal here is to understand the ability of a GAN to replace FEM by incorporating the underlying mechanics knowledge into the network to enhance the generalizing ability of the network for various materials under various loading and boundary conditions. We propose an encoder–decoder-like U-Net generator architecture with activated skip connections and a PatchGAN-based discriminator that discriminates based on local patches of data, leading to a more robust critique for the generator. Both the generator and discriminator constitute convolutional blocks. The novelty of the proposed framework is that it takes inputs such as nodal information, their corresponding edges, nodal coordinates, and the boundary conditions for each particular node from a finite element pre-processor and computes the tensorial quantities of stresses and strains at each node as output that can be read by a finite element post-processor. Unlike the existing literature, where images are used as input and output. The proposed GAN architecture efficiently generates the solution to the given boundary value problem with an accuracy of about 97% and achieves an exact distribution of field variables as compared to a finite element solver. One drawback of using convolutional blocks inside the network is that they are not efficient at processing unstructured domains. To overcome this, we investigate the ability of graph neural networks to process the discretized domain and computing outputs and the future possibility of utilizing the graph architecture in the generator block.},

However, modeling such problems is challenging, as they often involve non-trivial structural deformation, morphing flow domains, and complex interfaces. In this paper, we develop an incompressible SPH-total Lagrangian SPH (ISPH-TLSPH) framework well-adapted to cardiovascular FSI simulations. The matrix-free iterative ISPH method is used to simulate the hemodynamics and the stabilized TLSPH is used to simulate the dynamics of blood vessels. We propose a novel FSI coupling strategy to couple the ISPH with TLSPH, conforming to strict interface matching conditions. Moreover, we accurately incorporate the lumped parameter (0D) models into the 3D SPH framework to simulate the physiological effects of downstream vascular beds. Lastly, graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelization techniques are implemented in our framework to improve efficiency. The developed framework is first validated by investigating the pulse wave propagation in straight vessels under different boundary conditions. Then the FSI processes in the blood vessel with stenosis and the patient-specific aorta are modeled and investigated. The simulation results show that our framework is effective and efficient for the simulations of patient-specific blood vessels.},

We focus on the more challenging case of super-resolution, where the input dataset, for the inverse problem, is at a significantly coarser resolution than the output. The results are comparable to or exceed the leading operator network benchmarks for accuracy. Furthermore, ViTO’s architecture has a small number of trainable parameters (less than 10% of the leading competitor), resulting in a performance speed-up of over 5 times when averaged over the various test cases.},

We discuss how the shape uncertainties can be modeled using the domain mapping approach and how the deformation mapping can be expressed as coefficients in Maxwell’s equations. Using derivatives of these coefficients and derivatives of the eigenpairs, we follow a perturbation approach to compute approximations of mean and covariance of the eigenpairs. For small perturbations these approximations are faster and more accurate than sampling or surrogate model strategies. For the implementation we use an approach based on isogeometric analysis, which allows for straightforward modeling of the domain deformations and computation of the required derivatives.

Surface integrals are involved in computing the consistency matrix, and we find that the results depend on the element-partitioning schemes for these integrals. Partitioning scheme that introduces facial centroids works well, but it can only be applied to star-convex polygons. Other partitioning schemes without introducing centroids cause significant errors since the integration weights are not computed from all nodes of the surface. In this paper, we provide a detailed derivation to illustrate these discrepancies. To overcome this challenge, we implement an integration scheme without element-partitioning, which converting the surface integrals into line integrals using a recursive procedure.

However, when applied to problems with expensive-to-evaluate and highly nonlinear limit state functions, it is still less satisfactory in terms of numerical accuracy and efficiency. To fill this gap, this paper develops a directional filter equipped active learning (DirFAL) algorithm. It integrates three key components: (1) an active learning directional filter scheme, which plays as a role for adaptively prioritizing the directional samples that dominantly contribute to the failure probability; (2) a tailored closed-form expression of acquisition function, which is newly defined and incorporated into DirFAL to effectively select new training data for enriching a Gaussian process regression surrogate model; (3) an active learning stratification strategy for tackling the performance degradation issue when applied to problems with relatively high dimension and extremely small failure probability. The performance of the proposed methods is ultimately demonstrated through two numerical examples and two engineering problems, and results show that they are of superiority over other parallel methods in terms of numerical efficiency given required accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) failure is a multi-physics phenomena and is usually modelled at the microstructural level, which includes mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical contributions. In aggressive corrosive environments, materials prone to localized corrosion, can suffer heavy pitting corrosion. Subsequently, pit-to-crack transition events might be initiated. Respective mechanical assisted pitting corrosion propagation processes are determined by mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical properties as well as transport properties of ions at grain boundaries. Variations in the electrolyte exposure conditions (including the kinetics at the solid–liquid interface), different mechanical loading scenarios, grain-specific crystal anisotropies, and other local factors combine to produce a highly complex SCC-type interaction scenario at various time and length scales. Since corrosion is a slow process whereas brittle fracture is a rapid failure mechanism, the individual domain discretization-based solvers need to use distinct time steps and appropriate solver settings to become capable to accurately simulate such coupled events. In order to address the issues that arise while accounting for scaling effects in both time and space, and retaining coupled mechanistic interplay and including the aspects specified earlier, a sophisticated modelling method is necessary for the analysis of structural failure by SCC. In this work, a partitioned multi-physics computational approach is presented, using two separate single physics solvers coupled by the open-source coupling library preCICE . In the proposed computational setup, two separate software environments are used, with dedicated solver settings and different time steps, to simulate the mechanical fracture and dissolution-driven pitting corrosion for various loading and corrosion conditions, while also taking into account the effects of microstructural anisotropy. For a 2D polycrystalline model representing face-centered-cubic (fcc) material systems, selected numerical experiments are conducted that predict the evolution of fracture and crack path resulting from SCC. The framework has been further extended to simulate 3D problems as well. The corresponding results are evaluated to show the applicability of the proposed methodology.},

In order to fill this gap in computational cost, this paper proposes a reduced order modeling strategy that involves constructing discrete basis functions (modes) in adaptive fashion for both the primal as well as dual problem in topology optimization of transient dynamic systems. The projection bases are enriched based on the residual threshold of the corresponding systems. We address the computational cost and scalability of the ROM learning and updating phases. The approach is validated using 2D and 3D benchmark problems, by comparing alternative reduced-order-sensitivity formulations and projection basis update schemes.},

A metamodel, as an effective mathematical modelling tool, plays an important role in it. With the deepening understanding of the complexity of practical problems, the dimensionality of uncertainties in engineering problems is also increasing, which poses a great challenge on effective high-dimensional metamodeling. To handle this issue, researchers have modified metamodeling methods using various techniques to reduce dimensionality of data requirements in high-dimensional engineering applications. We review advances in dimensional decomposition-aided metamodels for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification and optimization in engineering. First, we review the theoretical frameworks and methods for classifying and modelling uncertainty according to its sources and nature. Second, the theoretical foundations and applications of five popular metamodels are presented, and their advantages and limitations are summarized. Third, the basic theories, properties, and applications of dimensional decomposition techniques in uncertainty quantification and optimization are discussed. Different integration methods of dimensional decomposition techniques and metamodels, and their applications in uncertainty quantification are subsequently reviewed and summarized. In addition, the applications of the dimensional decomposition-aided metamodels in uncertainty optimization design are reviewed. Finally, recent research progress is summarized, and future research directions are outlined.

These models provide a balance between accuracy, surpassing pure MM models, and computational efficiency, offering advantages over pure QM models. Adaptive approaches have been developed to further improve this balance by allowing on-the-fly selection of the QM and MM subsystems as necessary. We propose a novel and robust adaptive QM/MM method for practical material defect simulations. To ensure mathematical consistency with the QM reference model, we employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) as the MM models (Chen et al., 2022 and Grigorev et al., 2023). Our adaptive QM/MM method utilizes a residual-based error estimator that provides both upper and lower bounds for the approximation error, thus indicating its reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce a novel adaptive algorithm capable of anisotropically updating the QM/MM partitions. This update is based on the proposed residual-based error estimator and involves solving a free interface motion problem, which is efficiently achieved using the fast marching method. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach via numerical tests on a range of crystalline defects comprising edge dislocations, cracks and di-interstitials.},

In the current work, the main intention is to develop a Multi-Patch Isogeometric Topology Optimization (MP-ITO) method for multi-objective designs of regions-divided structures, where the solid topology designs, porous infill designs and solid-porous infill designs are all addressed in the optimization. In the MP-ITO method, the multi-patch NURBS-based IGA is applied to couple all divided subregions in the whole domain to solve the unknown structural responses, and each subregion is modelled by one NURBS patch. An efficient topology description model is developed for regions-divided structures using the Density Distribution Functions (DDFs), in which a local smoothing mechanism keeps the connectivity and smoothness of structural topology. The two-resolution discretization meshes are used in topology description model and numerical analysis. Three multi-objective optimization formulations for solid topologies, porous infills and solid-porous infill designs of regions-divided structures are developed using the MP-ITO method, where the stress-minimization and compliance-minimization are respectively addressed in different subregions. Finally, several numerical design examples are discussed to present the effectiveness and indispensability of the multi-objective design formulations, and results reveal that the optimized solid-porous infill designs can be better for engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we elaborate on and evaluate a new reduced basis method for model reduction of the shallow water equations using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and artificial Neural Networks (NNs). The method begins with the POD technique to construct reduced bases from high-resolution solutions, followed by training two deep NNs to learn associated coefficients in the reduced bases. The approach follows an offline–online strategy: the POD reduced basis, along with the training of the NNs, is performed in an offline stage, and then the surrogate model can be used in an online stage for real-time predictions. The method takes into account the POD-based projection error, enabling the attainment of higher accuracy while preserving a limited number of POD modes, even in the delicate situation of convection-dominated flow problems. This point is crucial in our approach since it enables to limit the output dimension of the NNs, thus providing the opportunity to employ smaller NNs (with less parameters). This may lead to the utilization of potentially smaller datasets (i.e., the snapshots), better generalization of the obtained model, and simpler explainability. The process is non-intrusive: it does not require opening the high-resolution model code. The method is evaluated on a real-world test case aimed at simulating inundation of the Aude river (Southern France). The results show that the proposed method provides satisfying accuracy for the hydraulic variables (water elevation, discharge) compared to the reference high-resolution 2D shallow water model, with quite small dimension NNs. Overall, the method is promising, particularly for performing real-time simulations of large floodplains hydrodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Scientific machine learning (SciML) has emerged as a versatile approach to address complex computational science and engineering problems. Within this field, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets) stand out as the leading techniques for solving partial differential equations by incorporating both physical equations and experimental data. However, training PINNs and DeepONets require significant computational resources, including long computational times and large amounts of memory. In search of computational efficiency, training neural networks using half precision (float16) rather than the conventional single (float32) or double (float64) precision has gained substantial interest, given the inherent benefits of reduced computational time and memory consumed. However, we find that float16 cannot be applied to SciML methods, because of gradient divergence at the start of training, weight updates going to zero, and the inability to converge to a local minima. To overcome these limitations, we explore mixed precision, which is an approach that combines the float16 and float32 numerical formats to reduce memory usage and increase computational speed. Our experiments showcase that mixed precision training not only substantially decreases training times and memory demands but also maintains model accuracy. We also reinforce our empirical observations with a theoretical analysis. The research has broad implications for SciML in various computational applications.},

Its purpose is to truncate the computational domain and absorb outgoing waves in order to mimic the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Thanks to its substantial development, the method has been successfully applied to many time-harmonic unbounded problems. While the perfectly matched layer is very effective in the high frequency regime, its accuracy can deteriorate if the layer is placed in the near-field region of the scattering object, which often occurs at low frequencies. This article aims to extend the robustness of the perfectly matched layer method in the near-field for three-dimensional Helmholtz exterior problems. To handle the issue we propose a novel family of parameter-free absorbing functions, that can be directly integrated in classical discretization schemes with minimal modifications.

The benefits of the proposed formulation are the ability to handle large displacements of explicitly represented domain boundaries without generating body-fitted meshes and remeshing techniques. For the space discretization, we use a background mesh and an unfitted method that relies on the integration on cut cells. We perform this intersection by using clipping algorithms. To deal with the mesh movement, we pullback the equations to a reference configuration (the spatial mesh at the initial time slab times the time interval) that is constant in time. This way, the geometrical intersection algorithm is only required in 3D, another key property of the proposed scheme. At the end of the time slab, we compute the deformed mesh, intersect the deformed boundary with the background mesh, and consider an exact transfer mechanism between meshes to compute jump terms in the time discontinuous Galerkin integration. The transfer is also computed using geometrical intersection algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to fluid problems around rotating (2D and 3D) geometries described by oriented boundary meshes. We also provide a set of numerical experiments that show the optimal convergence of the method.},

The model is based on a phase-field model for two-phase flow coupled to a fully Eulerian description of the surface deformation tensor. We put a particular focus on purely dilational and 3D axisymmetric surfaces. For these cases we propose models to track the evolution of in-plane strains and stresses by simple scalar surface PDEs, which can be localized to the diffuse interface by use of an approximate surface delta function. To validate the applicability and accuracy of the phase-field model we conduct several numerical experiments and show convergence towards reference solutions. Finally, we highlight some distinct advantages of the presented model, including the ability to handle topological changes, while ensuring conservative properties. Including relaxation terms, we extend the model to viscoelastic in-plane surfaces which enables to tackle a range of complicated problems such as surface fluidization and solidification in the future.},

As a result, the skeletal MHM method changes its structure automatically, from primal to mixed forms, depending on the asymptotic of local RAD solutions, which respond to multiscale basis functions at the element level. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and optimality of the MHM solution with respect to two-scale mesh parameters, relating it to the solution of a discrete primal hybrid version of the RAD model. Furthermore, we estimate the condition number of the matrices associated with the local problems responsible for upscaling, from which we establish upper limits for the condition number of the algebraic system associated with the MHM method.

  abstract     = {Red blood cells (RBCs) are able to undergo significant shape changes when they flow in the microcirculation thanks to their ability to withstand large deformations. In this context, particular attention should be dedicated to the role of RBC deformability and membrane viscosity on the RBC fluid dynamics at the microscale. Experimentally investigating the impact of the RBC viscoelastic properties is challenging due to the overlapping effects of multiple viscous dissipation sources, making high-fidelity cell-resolved simulations crucial. This work focuses on (i) developing a fluid–structure interaction framework to predict the RBC dynamics at the microscale and (ii) evaluating the impact of the cell viscoelastic properties such as deformability, viscosity contrast and membrane viscosity on the RBC transport in bounded shear flow. An incompressible Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is adopted to resolve the fluid dynamics inside and outside the RBCs, alongside with a tagging procedure to assign a viscosity contrast between the cytoplasm and the plasma. A finite-element model coupled with the Standard-Linear-Solid model describes the viscoelastic behavior of the RBC membrane. The interaction between the fluid and the RBCs is enforced by means of an immersed-boundary (IB) technique. Benchmark tests are performed to simulate the deformation of a purely elastic capsule, a viscoelastic capsule, and a viscoelastic RBC subjected to a bounded shear flow. A good agreement is found between the present results and literature data obtained with similar IB-LBM methods. The analysis of the impact of the cell viscoelasticity on the RBC dynamics highlights the importance of including the membrane viscosity and a physiological viscosity contrast in the RBC model, especially when investigating the RBC time-dependent behavior. Overall, our findings revealed that adding a viscous term in the RBC model significantly impacts the migration timescale but has a minor effect on the RBC final equilibrium position.},

The explicit time approximation is constructed for the slow, non-reactive transport subproblem. The nonlinear reaction part uses the implicit approximation. To overcome a more significant time step restriction induced by an explicit approximation of the diffusive part, we combine Operator Splitting with an implicit–explicit scheme for the non-reactive transport part (OS-ImEx). To reduce the size of the non-reactive transport system, we propose a multiscale lower-dimensional model for the non-reactive transport in marine sediment column. By combining the multiscale method with the Operator splitting scheme and implicit–explicit approximation for the non-reactive part, we obtain an efficient decoupled approach that localizes the nonlinear coupled reaction part and performs a faster solution of the non-reactive transport part. Numerical results are presented for one-dimensional and two-dimensional test problems to study the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed decoupled multiscale approach.},

  abstract     = {Among all the different techniques for modeling moving interfaces, the ones that capture the interfaces with a phase function such as Level Set (LS) methods have a great advantage over surface tracking approaches when managing topological changes. However, the standard LS method and the Conservative Level Set (CLS) method only distinguish between two different stable levels or phases using one level set equation, which is a second-order partial differential equation. When managing three or more levels or phases, the formulation requires additional level set equations. The model presented in this work is a modification of the CLS method by which one single level set variable can manage three stable levels. The level set variable can then be interpreted as the average relative density of a specific material with three stable density levels. The presented model is suitable to represent the deposition and densification of powder material, where three different stable levels (void, powder, and fully dense material) coexist, and therefore can be applied to capture the evolving interfaces, as is of particular interest for processes such as powder based additive manufacturing. The main advantage of the proposed model is the large reduction of the number of degrees of freedom compared to the traditional LS formulation, reducing the required computational resources. Several test cases, including densification cases, are addressed in the present article.},

Stochastic finite element equations at both micro and macro scales are solved by using a unified and efficient numerical algorithm, which relies on a unified stochastic solution construction and an efficient iterative algorithm.

However, challenges arise when dealing with input functions that exhibit heterogeneous properties, requiring multiple sensors to handle functions with minimal regularity. To address this issue, discretization-invariant neural operators have been used, allowing the sampling of diverse input functions with different sensor locations. However, existing frameworks still require an equal number of sensors for all functions. We propose a novel distributed approach to further relax the discretization requirements and solve the heterogeneous dataset challenges. Our method involves partitioning the input function space and processing individual input functions using independent and separate neural networks. A centralized neural network is used to handle shared information across all output functions. This distributed methodology reduces the number of gradient descent back-propagation steps, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate that the corresponding neural network is a universal approximator of continuous nonlinear operators and present three numerical examples to validate its performance.},

  abstract     = {Sufficient myocardial perfusion plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal pump function. However the development of a comprehensive myocardial perfusion model remains particularly challenging as it requires the incorporation of complex interactions across different spatial scales and physical domains. In this study, we couple a coronary blood flow model to our previous work on a poroelastic immersed finite element framework for myocardial perfusion in a left ventricle (LV) heart. The coronary flow in the epicardial vessels is described by a 1-D flow model, and the intramural vessels are modelled as a structural tree-based vascular bed. The intramyocardial pressure resulting from myocardial contraction is further imposed on the coronary vessel wall. We first benchmark this coupled myocardial perfusion and coronary flow in a healthy heart. The systolic impediment phenomenon of the coronary flow can be reproduced with this coupled model, and the wall volume change is around 13 mL, which is consistent with literature-reported values. We further study cardiac perfusion under coronary network rarefaction, arterial wall stiffening and ventricular wall stiffening. Our results suggest that both vessel rarefaction and a stiffer arterial wall can directly impede flow through the coronaries leading to perfusion deficiency, and LV wall stiffening will impair heart pump function significantly but with a minor drop in coronary flow rate. It is expected that such a coupled myocardial perfusion and coronary flow model will have the potential to deepen our understanding of myocardial dysfunction due to perfusion deficiency.},

To develop an effective numerical method for simulating this problem, we propose an alternative equation by introducing the poroelasticity equation and the porosity variation equation to account for the influence of rock deformation on porosity. In addition, we introduce a free energy for the skeleton of rocks and take into account rock compressibility as well. Instead of the pressure gradient, we utilize the chemical potential gradient as the primary driving force. This formulation is proved to satisfy an energy dissipation law. By applying the improved energy factorization method to handle the Helmholtz free energy density, we propose a semi-implicit time discretization scheme. The discrete pressure is carefully calculated by the discrete chemical potential and Helmholtz free energy so as to inherit the energy dissipation law. A fully discrete scheme is constructed based on the discontinuous Galerkin and mixed finite element methods with the upwind strategy. We prove that the fully discrete scheme still satisfies the energy dissipation law as well as possesses the feature of mass conservation. Additionally, we can prove the boundedness of density under reasonable assumptions on porosity. Numerical results are provided to show the performance of the proposed scheme and validate our theoretical analysis.},

First-order formulation with the compliance tensor and Voigt notation are employed to provide a compact description of the discretized problem and flexibility with highly heterogeneous media. We further focus on the question of optimal choices of stabilization in the definition of HDG numerical traces. For this purpose, we construct a hybridized Godunov-upwind flux for anisotropic elastic media possessing three distinct wavespeeds. This stabilization removes the need to choose a scaling factor, contrary to the identity and Kelvin–Christoffel based stabilizations which are popular choices in the literature. We carry out comparisons among these families for isotropic and anisotropic material, with constant background and highly heterogeneous ones, in two and three dimensions. These experiments establish the optimality of the Godunov stabilization which can be used as a reference choice for a generic material in which different types of waves propagate.},

  abstract     = {For more than half a century, scientists have developed mathematical models to understand the behavior of the human heart. Today, we have dozens of heart tissue models to choose from, but selecting the best model is limited to expert professionals, prone to user bias, and vulnerable to human error. Here we take the human out of the loop and automate the process of model discovery. Towards this goal, we establish a novel incompressible orthotropic constitutive neural network to simultaneously discover both, model and parameters, that best explain human cardiac tissue. Notably, our network features 32 individual terms, 8 isotropic and 24 anisotropic, and fully autonomously selects the best model, out of more than 4 billion possible combinations of terms. We demonstrate that we can successfully train the network with triaxial shear and biaxial extension tests and systematically sparsify the parameter vector with L 1 L1 -regularization. Strikingly, we robustly discover a four-term model that features a quadratic term in the second invariant I 2 I2 , and exponential quadratic terms in the fourth and eighth invariants I 4f I4f , I 4n I4n , and I 8fs I8fs . Importantly, our discovered model is interpretable by design and has parameters with well-defined physical units. We show that it outperforms popular existing myocardium models and generalizes well, from homogeneous laboratory tests to heterogeneous whole heart simulations. This is made possible by a new universal material subroutine that directly takes the discovered network weights as input. Automating the process of model discovery has the potential to democratize cardiac modeling, broaden participation in scientific discovery, and accelerate the development of innovative treatments for cardiovascular disease.

Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier–Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with 42 ∼ 62 % 42∼62% improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.},

  abstract     = {In the field of computational science and engineering, solving nonlinear transient problems still poses a challenging task that often requires significant computational resources. This research introduces a novel methodology that harnesses the power of cutting-edge Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) to accelerate the solution of such problems in multi-query scenarios (i.e. parameterized problems). At each time step, TFT models, renowned for their time series forecasting capabilities, are combined with dimensionality reduction techniques to efficiently generate initial solutions for nonlinear solvers. Specifically, during the training phase, a reduced set of high-fidelity system solutions is obtained by solving the system of differential equations governing the problem for different parameter instances. Then, dimensionality reduction is applied to create a reduced latent space to simplify the representation of the complex system solutions. Subsequently, TFT models are trained for one-step-ahead forecasting in the latent space, utilizing information from previous states to make accurate predictions about future states. The TFTs’ predictions are fed back to the system as initial guesses at each time step of the solution algorithm and are then guided towards the exact solutions that satisfy equilibrium using Newton–Raphson (NR) iterations. The basic premise of the proposed idea is that having accurate initial predictions will significantly decrease the number of the costly NR-iterations needed in nonlinear dynamic problems, effectively reducing the solution time. In addition, the proposed scheme is able to handle problems with parametric and time-variant forcing forces. A customized TFT architecture is developed that takes as input not only the response history of the system, but also the current loading, and makes informed guesses about the future state of the system. The methodology’s effectiveness is demonstrated in numerical applications that involve high nonlinearity, where the TFT-generated initial solutions resulted in a notable reduction in the number of NR-iterations required for solver convergence. This significant enhancement in computational efficiency holds substantial promise, especially in scenarios involving a multitude of analyses and high iteration demands, with wide-ranging applications across computational mechanics and related fields.},

  abstract     = {Surface tension plays a crucial role in determining the interfacial behavior between partially miscible fluid systems, and affects the overall dynamics of phase transition processes. Accurate modeling of surface tension is crucial for understanding and predicting various phase transition phenomena, such as capillary-driven flows, droplet formation, and interfacial dynamics. Cubic equations of state (EoS), such as the van der Waals (vdW) model, incorporate two corrective terms to account for intermolecular interactions. These terms improve the predictions of the equation of state at high pressures and low temperatures, where intermolecular forces become significant; however they also affect to the effective surface tension when the EoS is used in combination with diffuse-interface models of multiphase systems. The ability to capture the correct surface tension is essential in pore-scale models flow through permeable media, particularly in capillary-dominated flow regimes. For typical geological or industrial pore sizes the effective surface tension obtained using standard equations of state may be several orders of magnitude larger than the physical value, which greatly affects the accuracy and physical fidelity of the simulations. In this work we present a methodology that allows diffuse-interface numerical methods to reproduce the physical surface tension in pore-scale simulations of multiphase flow. The proposed methodology is applied to the simulation of interfacial processes at arbitrary length scales while honoring the physical surface tension driving capillary phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Conventional finite element methods are known to be tedious in adaptive refinements due to their conformal regularity requirements. Further, the enrichment functions for adaptive refinements are often not readily available in general applications. This work introduces a novel neural network-enriched Partition of Unity (NN-PU) approach for solving boundary value problems via artificial neural networks with a potential energy-based loss function minimization. The flexibility and adaptivity of the NN function space are utilized to capture complex solution patterns that the conventional Galerkin methods fail to capture. The NN enrichment is constructed by combining pre-trained feature-encoded NN blocks with an additional untrained NN block. The pre-trained NN blocks learn specific local features during the offline stage, enabling efficient enrichment of the approximation space during the online stage through the Ritz-type energy minimization. The NN enrichment is introduced under the Partition of Unity (PU) framework, ensuring convergence of the proposed method. The proposed NN-PU approximation and feature-encoded transfer learning form an adaptive approximation framework, termed the neural-refinement (n-refinement), for solving boundary value problems. Demonstrated by solving various elasticity problems, the proposed method offers accurate solutions while notably reducing the computational cost compared to the conventional adaptive refinement in the mesh-based methods.},

  abstract     = {To gain better insights into the structural reliability of lithium-ion battery electrodes and the nucleation as well as propagation of cracks during the charge and discharge cycles, it is crucial to enhance our understanding of the degradation mechanisms of electrode particles. This work presents a rigorous mathematical formulation for a fatigue failure theory for lithium-ion battery electrode particles for lithium diffusion induced fracture. The prediction of fatigue cracking for lithium-ion battery during the charge and discharge steps is an particularly challenging task and plays an crucial role in various electronic-based applications. Here, to simulate fatigue cracking, we rely on the phase-field approach for fracture which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing fracture failure phenomena in solids. The primary goal here is to describe a variationally consistent energetic formulation for gradient-extended dissipative solids, which is rooted in incremental energy minimization. The formulation has been derived as a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that governs the gradient-extended elastic-chemo damage response. Additionally, since the damage mechanisms of the lithium-ion battery electrode particles result from swelling and shrinkage, an additive decomposition of the strain tensor is performed. Several numerical simulations with different case studies are performed to demonstrate the correctness of our algorithmic developments. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of randomly distributed micro cavities (voids) and micro notches on fracture resistance.},

This involves the complex integration of the cross-section strains along the beam axis, typically done by the Curvature and Shear Based Displacement Interpolation (CSBDI) technique. Although, the CSBDI is sufficiently accurate for standard applications, this may cause numerical issues when many quadrature cross-sections are placed along the element length. This work presents a novel technique for computing the transverse displacements of a 3D Timoshenko beam, based on a finite difference approximation of the bending and shear compatibility conditions, which avoids the issues of the CSBDI. The proposed technique is introduced in a force-based finite element formulation with moderately large deformations, endowed with a corotational approach, suitable for analyzing geometrically nonlinear framed structures.

  abstract     = {The two fundamental concepts of materials theory, pseudo potentials and the assumption of a multiplicative decomposition, allow a general description of inelastic material behavior. The increase in computer performance enabled us to thoroughly investigate the predictive capabilities of ever more complex choices for the potential and the Helmholtz free energy. Today, however, we have reached a point where materials and their models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This raises the question: How do we find the best model that includes all inelastic effects to explain our complex data? Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (CANN) may answer this question. Here, we extend the CANNs to inelastic materials (iCANN). Rigorous considerations of objectivity, rigid motion of the reference configuration, multiplicative decomposition and its inherent non-uniqueness, choice of appropriate stretch tensors, restrictions of energy and pseudo potential, and consistent inelastic evolution guide us towards the general architecture of the iCANN satisfying thermodynamics per design. We combine feed-forward networks of the Helmholtz free energy and pseudo potential with a recurrent neural network approach to take time dependencies into account. Specializing the general iCANN to visco-elasticity, we demonstrate that the iCANN is capable of autonomously discovering models for artificially generated data, the response of polymers at different stretch rates for cyclic loading as well as the relaxation behavior of muscle data. Since the design of the network is not limited to visco-elasticity, iCANNs might help to autonomously identify the inelastic phenomena of the material and subsequently select the most appropriate model. Here, our focus is on providing a thermodynamically consistent framework for inelastic material behaviors and how to incorporate this framework into neural networks in an architecture-based manner.

Existing symbolic/sparse regression methods rely on the availability of libraries of material models, which are typically hand-designed by a human expert using known models as reference, or deploy generative algorithms with exponential complexity which are only practicable for very simple expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to constitutive law discovery relying on formal grammars as an automated and systematic tool to generate constitutive law expressions. Compliance with physics constraints is partly enforced a priori and partly empirically checked a posteriori. We deploy the approach for two tasks: (i) Automatically generating a library of valid constitutive laws for hyperelastic isotropic materials; (ii) Performing data-driven discovery of hyperelastic material models from displacement data affected by different noise levels. For the task of automatic library generation, we demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed methodology in avoiding hand-crafted features and human intervention. For the data-driven discovery task, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and significant generalizability of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {Meshfree methods offer significant flexibility in discretizing partial differential equations, including arbitrary smoothness uncoupled with the order of the approximation, and the ability to reconstruct connectivity on the fly, which enables extreme deformation capabilities for problems such as high-rate impact without erosion. Yet special care has to be taken to impose essential boundary conditions as shape functions generally do not interpolate field variables on the boundary. While various weak and strong methods are available, each has varying degrees of inherent difficulty, such as the selection of parameters, additional degrees of freedom, or sub-optimal convergence. As an alternative to these techniques, this work develops the variational multiscale (VMS) method for applying essential boundary conditions in meshfree methods. A primal formulation is developed such that no additional degrees of freedom are necessary. Stability is naturally derived from the fine-scale field rather than relying on a constant as in Nitsche’s method. It is further shown that VMS is more accurate than Nitsche’s method when material properties vary in space since the stabilization is local rather than global. In addition, we explore the idea of using VMS to inform the Nitsche method parameters for an improved solution. Numerical examples demonstrate the optimal convergence of the method and the insensitivity of the choice of fine-scale basis.},

  abstract     = {When generating in-silico clinical electrophysiological outputs, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and body surface potential maps (BSPMs), mathematical models have relied on single physics, i.e. of the cardiac electrophysiology (EP), neglecting the role of the heart motion. Since the heart is the most powerful source of electrical activity in the human body, its motion dynamically shifts the position of the principal electrical sources in the torso, influencing electrical potential distribution and potentially altering the EP outputs. In this work, we propose a computational model for the simulation of ECGs and BSPMs by coupling a cardiac electromechanical model with a model that simulates the propagation of the EP signal in the torso, thanks to a flexible numerical approach, that simulates the torso domain deformation induced by the myocardial displacement. Our model accounts for the major mechano-electrical feedbacks, along with unidirectional displacement and potential couplings from the heart to the surrounding body. For the numerical discretization, we employ a versatile intergrid transfer operator that allows for the use of different Finite Element spaces to be used in the cardiac and torso domains. Our numerical results are obtained on a realistic 3D biventricular-torso geometry, and cover both cases of sinus rhythm and ventricular tachycardia (VT), solving both the electromechanical-torso model in dynamical domains, and the classical electrophysiology-torso model in static domains. By comparing standard 12-lead ECG and BSPMs, we highlight the non-negligible effects of the myocardial contraction on the EP-outputs, especially in pathological conditions, such as the VT.},

The core innovation is that large regions of the mesh in a Finite Element Method (FEM) crash simulation are replaced by a Neural Network (NN). The NN is directly integrated into the FEM solver and aims to reduce computational time and resources while maintaining high-fidelity results. The introduced NN architectures and training strategies address the inherent challenges posed by crash simulations, such as long time series, dynamic loads, and complex, history-dependent material behaviors. Our work includes the development of load cases tailored to validate the FEMIN approach. Furthermore, we introduce a novel NN architecture, the Temporal gated Multi-Layer Perceptron (TgMLP), both as a stand-alone model and also as an initial state predictor in combination with a conditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and compare their effectiveness in FEMIN. The results demonstrate that FEMIN, employing these NN models, can accurately predict the structural response under crash conditions while inferring the loads significantly faster than the replaced FEM mesh. This research paves the way for more efficient vehicle design, offering a promising solution for integrating machine learning into computational mechanics.},

Therefore, the polynomial coefficients and the optimal weights in the W/TENO reconstruction are corrected to adapt this system. The accuracy of SPH is improved by W/TENO reconstruction up to 4th and 5th order in the Eulerian framework, respectively. The performances in the Lagrangian, ALE and Eulerian frameworks, and of different reconstructions are also compared.

This study proposes a high-performance semi-implicit two-phase two-layer MPM framework for modeling granular mass-water dynamic interaction problems based on mixture theory. This innovative approach employs two layers of material points and two layers of grids: a co-located grid dedicated to the solid phase and a Mark and Cell (MAC) staggered grid for the fluid phase. In this structure, the solid phase is solved explicitly, while the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations govern the fluid phase, utilizing a fractional-step method. To ensure the stability of the framework, the second-order B-spline basis function and the Affine Particle In Cell (APIC) mapping schemes are used for both phases. The proposed MPM is programmed using the Taichi language on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform, fully leveraging the data structures and parallel computing capabilities provided by Taichi to achieve efficient computation. Under the GPU framework, a parallel matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) iteration is used to solve the pressure Poisson equation, overcoming the significant storage requirements caused by coefficient matrix assembly. Additionally, a geometric multigrid (MG) method is utilized for matrix preconditioning, achieving strong convergence and enabling efficient computation for large-scale linear systems. Furthermore, a prefix sum algorithm maintaining linear complexity in neighbor retrieval is innovatively proposed and implemented into DEM-based contact algorithm, enhancing calculation efficiency The comparisons with experimental data confirm the model&#39;s capacity to provide profound insights into granular mass-water interaction problems.},

It comes with a handy implementation including boundary treatments, enabling one pre-trained LNO to solve on varied domains. For demonstration, we let LNO learn typical transient PDEs, including viscous Burgers’ equation, wave equation, and Navier–Stokes (N–S) equation from randomly generated field samples. Then, the pre-trained LNO models solve demo problems on unseen domains different from training ones. Significantly, the pre-trained LNO solves practical flows (governed by N–S equation) three orders of magnitude faster than the conventional finite element method at most. This advantage of LNO is attributed to its pure explicit approximation for the large-interval time-marching operator.},

The framework is grounded in hierarchical Bayesian inferences and employs model validation tests to evaluate the credibility and prediction reliability of the surrogate models under uncertainty. Leveraging these principles, OPAL-surrogate introduces a systematic and efficient strategy for balancing the trade-off between model complexity, accuracy, and prediction uncertainty. The effectiveness of OPAL-surrogate is demonstrated through two modeling problems, including the deformation of porous materials for building insulation and turbulent combustion flow for ablation of solid fuels within hybrid rocket motors.},

  abstract     = {Comprehensive image-based computational modeling pipelines are being actively developed for high-fidelity patient-specific cardiac simulations. However, conventional simulation techniques pose a challenge in this regard, primarily because of their excessively slow performance. We have developed a Neural Network Finite Element (NNFE) approach for high-speed cardiac mechanics simulations that can produce accurate simulation results within seconds (Journal of Biomechanical Engineering 144.12 (2022): 121010.). The method utilized neural networks to learn the displacement solution; and finite elements for defining the problem domain, specifying the boundary conditions, and performing numerical integrations. The NNFE method does not rely on use of traditional FEM simulations, experimental data, or reduced order modeling approaches, and has been successfully applied to hyperelastic boundary value problems using a potential energy formulation. In the present work we extended the NNFE approach to a prolate spheroid model of the left ventricle as a starting point for more complex cardiac simulations. We incorporated spatially varying fiber structures and utilized a Fung-type material model that included active contraction along the local myofiber axis. As cardiac mechanics are non-conservative problems with path-dependent pressure boundary conditions, we developed a new NNFE formulation based on classical virtual work principles. Importantly, the resultant NNFE cardiac model was trained over the complete physiological functional range of pressure, volume, and myofiber active stress. The final trained cardiac model predicted the displacement solution over the cardiac cycle for any physiological condition without retraining with a mean nodal displacement error of 0 . 023 ± 0 . 019 mm 0.023±0.019mm . Similar agreement accuracy was found for the stress and strain results. The NNFE model trained within 2.25 h and predicted the complete pressure–volume response within 30 s, whereas the FE model took approximately 5 h. This study successfully demonstrates the potential of the NNFE method to simulate cardiac mechanics with high speed and accuracy over the complete physiological functional space.},

In this work, we introduce a unique, cost-effective framework for sensitivity analyses that reduces dimensionality by excluding insensitive parameters from the design space in wave-resistance problems. At the heart of our approach is the formulation of a geometric operator that leverages, via high-order geometric moments, the underlying connection between geometry and physics, specifically the wave-resistance coefficient ( C w Cw ), of ships using the slender body theory based on the well-known Vossers’ integral. The resulting geometric operator is computationally inexpensive yet physics-informed and can act as a geometry-based surrogate to drive parametric sensitivities. To analytically demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach, we use a well-known benchmark geometry, namely, the modified Wigley hull. Its simple analytical formulation allows for closed expressions of the geometric operators and exploration of computational domains that would otherwise be inaccessible. In this context, the proposed geometric operator outperforms existing similar approaches by achieving 100% similarity with C w Cw at a fraction of the computational cost.},

For the uncertainties with adequate data, probability theory can be used while for the uncertainties with insufficient data, probability theory is limited and interval quantification can be used. Taking the widely used proportional-integral-differential (PID) control as an example, a novel study on controller design based on probability density evolution method and interval-oriented sequential optimization strategy considering interval and random uncertainties is proposed. Firstly, under a certain sample point of interval uncertainties, probability density evolution equation is utilized to calculate the probability density function of uncertain response considering only random uncertainties. In this way the probabilistic reliability corresponding to the sample point can be obtained. Then the hybrid reliability is defined as the average probability within the interval uncertainty and the adaptive dichotomy method is utilized to choose proper sample points of interval uncertainties, in which the reliability curve and the interval uncertainty axis is regarded as the judgement of convergence. Next the hybrid reliability is introduced to the optimization as a constraint and the PID gains reliable design optimization is established to balance the energy-consuming and safety. Finally, the sequential optimization strategy is adopted to improve the efficiency of optimization. In every iteration step of the optimization, the constraint of deterministic optimal design is adjusted according to the static reliability at the moment before the passage or reaching the maximum value. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and practicability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Elliptic equations on complex porous microstructures govern the flow of fluids inside subsurface rocks in underground CO 2 2 and H 2 2 storage, and the transport of heat and solute within electrochemical devices like batteries and fuel cells. The algebraic systems arising from the discretization of these equations are often prohibitively large and must be solved via iterative (e.g., Krylov) methods, for which effective preconditioning is key to ensure rapid convergence. In recent work, the authors proposed a scalable two-level preconditioner whose performance was superior to existing algebraic multigrid variants for pore-scale problems. The preconditioner was based on the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and consisted of a coarse preconditioner, M G MG , and a fine smoother, M L ML . Similar two-level preconditioners based on the multiscale finite element/volume and variational multiscale methods also exist for solving continuum-scale PDEs in porous media. The most expensive step in building such two-level preconditioners is computing M G MG , for which many numerical bases on a set of subdomains must be calculated to yield a prolongation matrix. Here, we show that machine learning (ML) can dramatically reduce this cost. Moreover, by embedding ML within a preconditioning framework, we enable the rarity of estimating and controlling ML errors to any desired level. We systematically probe the ML-built preconditioner in solving the Poisson and linear-elasticity equations over complex 2D/3D geometries and show that it performs comparably to its solver-built counterpart. Implications and future extensions are discussed.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) computational framework that incorporates an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formalism, expressed through a system of first-order conservation laws. In addition to the standard material and spatial configurations, an additional (fixed) referential configuration is introduced. The ALE conservative framework is established based on the fundamental conservation principles, including mass, linear momentum and the first law of thermodynamics represented through entropy density. A key contribution of this work lies in the evaluation of the physical deformation gradient tensor, which measures deformation from material to spatial configuration through a multiplicative decomposition into two auxiliary deformation gradient tensors. Both of the deformation tensors are obtained via additional first-order conservation equations. Interestingly, the new ALE conservative formulation will be shown to degenerate into alternative mixed systems of conservation laws for solid dynamics: particle-shifting, velocity-shifting and Eulerian formulations. The framework also considers path- and/or strain rate-dependent constitutive models, such as isothermal plasticity and thermo-visco-plasticity, by integrating evolution equations for internal state variables. Another contribution of this paper is the evaluation of ALE motion (known as smoothing procedure) by solving a conservation-type momentum equation. This procedure is indeed useful for maintaining a regular particle distribution and enhancing solution accuracy in regions characterised by large plastic flows. The hyperbolicity of the underlying system is ensured and accurate wave speed bounds in the context of ALE description are presented, crucial for ensuring the stability of explicit time integrators. For spatial discretisation, a Godunov-type SPH method is employed and adapted. To guarantee stability from the semi-discretisation standpoint, a carefully designed numerical stabilisation is introduced. The Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out by assessing the time rate of the Ballistic energy of the system, aiming to ensure non-negative entropy production. In order to ensure the global conservation of angular momentum, we employ a three-stage Runge–Kutta time integrator together with a discrete angular momentum projection algorithm. Finally, a range of three dimensional benchmark problems are examined to illustrate the robustness and applicability of the framework. The developed ALE SPH scheme outperforms the Total Lagrangian SPH framework, particularly excelling in capturing plasticity regimes with optimal computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Numerical models for hydraulic fracturing often demand substantial computing resources. Recent advancements like Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and operator nets (like DeepONet) have introduced innovative approaches to partial differential equation solutions. Within the phase-field framework, hydraulic fracturing is viewed as a multi-physics coupling problem. This portrayal of multi-field coupling, where the fracture is regarded as a diffuse field, makes it possible for PINN or DeepONet to solve the governing equations of each field. However, employing PINN or operator nets for fracture mechanics encounters challenges such as the convergence issues and the need for extensive datasets. We developed a Semi-Physics-Informed Multiple Input Operator Net (SPI-MIONet) tailored for phase-field hydraulic fracturing. SPI-MIONet employs a subset of governing equations from the actual physical process to constrain the problem. This strategy effectively combines data-driven and physical constraint mechanisms while circumventing the need for expressing complex governing equations in a multi-physics system. In the context of hydraulic fracturing, the unified governing equation for fluid flow in porous media and fractures presents computational challenges due to the complexity of certain parameters. These complexities often result in time-consuming numerical solving like FEM. With the emergence of operator nets, neural networks can now undergo training without strict adherence to complete physical constraints. The optimization of the pressure field loss function predominantly relies on implicit physical constraints from the phase field and displacement field, complemented by explicit constraints from the original data loss function of operator nets. Moreover, SPI-MIONet inherently handles multiple function inputs, a critical aspect for hydraulic fracturing simulations. The results section presents two scenario studies comparing SPI-MIONet’s predictions to those of the FEM. Notably, SPI-MIONet accurately captures crack propagation paths, even in challenging scenarios involving the interaction of multiple cracks.},

Often only time-averaged data is available, which poses challenges for DA in the context of unsteady flow problems. Recent works have shown promising results in optimizing Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations of stationary flows using sparse data through variational data assimilation, enabling the reconstruction of mean flow profiles. In this study we perform three-dimensional variational data assimilation of sparse time-averaged data into an unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation by means of a stationary divergence-free forcing term in the URANS equations. Efficiency and speed of our method are enhanced by employing coarse URANS simulations and leveraging the stationary discrete adjoint method for the time-averaged URANS equations. The data assimilation codes were developed in-house using OpenFOAM for the URANS simulations as well as for the solution of the adjoint problem, and Python for the gradient-based optimization. Our results demonstrate that data assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity measurements not only enables accurate mean flow reconstruction, but also improves the flow dynamics, specifically the vortex shedding frequency. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we applied it to turbulent flows around cylinders of various shapes at Reynolds numbers ranging from 3000 to 22000. Our findings indicate that data points near the cylinder play a crucial role in improving the vortex shedding frequency, while additional data points further downstream are necessary to also reconstruct the time-averaged velocity field in the wake region.},

Specifically, we incorporate an anisotropic grid regularization based on the mesh-implied metric that reduces grid motion in directions with small element length scales, an element shape regularization that mitigates excessive element curvature, and a penalty regularization that penalizes degenerate elements. Additionally, we introduce a procedure for locally scaling the regularization operators in an adaptive, elementwise manner in order to maintain grid validity. We apply the proposed MDG-ICE formulation to two- and three-dimensional test cases involving viscous shocks and/or boundary layers, including Mach 17.6 hypersonic viscous flow over a circular cylinder and Mach 5 hypersonic viscous flow over a sphere, which are very challenging test cases for conventional numerical schemes on simplicial grids.

The DMCDM incorporates the concepts of interpolation, duality, and numerical integration from the former and the idea of satisfying the integral (global) form of the differential (or balance) equations from the latter. In this paper, we present a fresh and systematic approach to solving two-dimensional nonlinear problems, including advection–diffusion problems, with arbitrary primal meshes. We develop an approach where element-level equations are derived and assembled in a manner similar to that of the FEM, as opposed to using nodal equations, as has been the convention in all of the previous works involving the DMCDM. Additionally, we extend the previous works to include higher-order interpolation, specifically quadratic interpolation. In short, we provide formulations for four-node bilinear and nine-node biquadratic elements of quadrilateral shape, enabling the application of the DMCDM to arbitrary primal and dual meshes. Finally, we explore the Newton iteration method for linearizing the nonlinear system of equations that arises from the DMCDM discretization. We present numerical results and comparisons against available exact and numerical solutions to verify the accuracy and robustness of the DMCDM.},

The problem of lack of differentiability of property tensors at the sharp phase interfaces is circumvented by making use of a diffuse interface approach. Periodic boundary conditions are incorporated strictly through the introduction of an input-transfer layer (Fourier feature mapping), which takes the sine and cosine of the inner product of position and reciprocal lattice vectors. This, together with the absence of Dirichlet boundary conditions, results in a lossless boundary condition application. Consequently, the sole contributors to the loss are the locally-scaled differential equation residuals. We use crystalline arrangements that are defined via Bravais lattices to demonstrate the formulation’s versatility based on the reciprocal lattice vectors. We also show that considering integer multiples of the reciprocal basis in the Fourier mapping leads to improved convergence of high-frequency functions. We consider applications in one, two, and three dimensions, including periodic composites, composed of embeddings of monodisperse inclusions in the form of disks/spheres, and stochastic monodisperse disk arrangements.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are being applied to forward and inverse problems in various science and engineering disciplines, integrating physical principles into the learning process. In line with this, the previously proposed Physics-Informed Parallel Neural Networks (PIPNNs) framework addresses the inverse structural identification problem of continuous structural systems, particularly for handling inherent discontinuities in the system such as interior supports and dissimilar element properties. The PIPNNs framework accommodates structural discontinuities by dividing the computational domain into subdomains, each uniquely represented through a parallelized and interconnected Neural Network (NN) architecture. However, these parallel NNs pose a challenge due to the increased number of terms in the loss function, making network training more complex. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based self-adaptive loss weighting mechanism within the PIPNNs framework to address the challenges of dissimilar convergence rates of loss terms during the training of multiple NNs, ensuring balanced convergence across various physical constraints and subdomains. Guided by NTK theory, which describes the evolution of fully connected NNs during training by gradient descent, the self-adaptive weighting approach developed here adaptively alters the weights for each loss component throughout the NNs training process. These weights, determined based upon the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix of the PIPNNs, adjust the convergence rates of each loss term to achieve a balanced convergence, while requiring less training data. In the context of the inverse problem and structural identification, the NTK matrix is derived by considering not only the training evolution of the parallel NNs but also the changes in unknown structural parameters during the training process. The NTK-enhanced PIPNNs framework is verified and validated against an alternative independent model, and its accuracy is assessed through the application of numerical examples of several continuous structural systems, including bars, beams, and plates.},

  abstract     = {Numerous cutting-edge scientific technologies originate at the laboratory scale, but transitioning them to practical industry applications is a formidable challenge. Traditional pilot projects at intermediate scales are costly and time-consuming. An alternative, the pilot-scale model, relies on high-fidelity numerical simulations, but even these simulations can be computationally prohibitive at larger scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable, physics-constrained reduced order model (ROM) method. The ROM identifies critical physics modes from small-scale unit components, projecting governing equations onto these modes to create a reduced model that retains essential physics details. We also employ Discontinuous Galerkin Domain Decomposition (DG-DD) to apply ROM to unit components and interfaces, enabling the construction of large-scale global systems without data at such large scales. This method is demonstrated on the Poisson and Stokes flow equations, showing that it can solve equations about 15–40 times faster with only ∼ ∼ 1% relative error. Furthermore, ROM takes one order of magnitude less memory than the full order model, enabling larger scale predictions at a given memory limitation.},

  abstract     = {Solid Composite Propellants (SCPs) are widely employed in the field of propulsion due to their enduring chemical and mechanical stability during extended periods of storage, as well as their uncomplicated production and reliable performance. Unlike liquid propellants, solid propellants are self-supporting, meaning that that they function as structural materials as well as energetic. Consequently, it is essential to understand the mechanical behavior of SCPs during deflagration, as structural failure can have potentially catastrophic consequences. SCP failure is often associated with the formation and growth of micromechanical damage sites due to thermal and mechanical loads during burning. Thus, the ability to simulate stress propagation during the burning process is a key feature for the effective design and safe use of SCPs. The ability to evaluate failure in aged propellants and of those produced using additive manufacturing is of special interest. In this work, we present an elasticity solver coupled with a thermal phase-field model of regression of SCPs. The method implements a unique strong-form solver for finite deformation material response, featuring block structured adaptive mesh refinement techniques and a multigrid solver. Two verification results for the model are presented: first, results for an infinite plate with a pressurized hole is compared to the classical Lamé solution; second, results for a clamped plate with a hole subjected to uniaxial tension are compared to the equivalent results using the traditional finite element. In both cases, a close match is observed. Next, to test the model for the application of SCPs, tension-compression tests are used to validate the model for AP/HTPB under tension. The model is then used to determine the mechanical response of an AP/HTPB SCP during deflagration, driven both by thermal and mechanical loading, with both spherical and experimentally measured mesostructures. Overall, it is determined that the model adequately captures the stress and strain fields, indicating the model’s viability for simulations that lend insight into the interplay between mesostructure, deflagration, and mechanical damage.},

  abstract     = {In this work, optimisation-based techniques for solving inverse problems are examined and explored, specifically addressing the challenges posed by expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions within the domain of material modelling. Our primary objectives are twofold: First, we conduct a thorough critical comparison of various cutting-edge optimisation algorithms by leveraging target responses derived from analytical, numerical, and experimental solutions with varying input space dimensionality. The performance of these methods is further evaluated in accurately calibrating material parameters for complex constitutive models, such as a finite strain visco-elastic visco-plastic model for amorphous polymers and a crystal plasticity model with martensitic transformation. Second, we present an innovative composite Bayesian Optimisation strategy tailored for finite element responses, enhancing the quality of surrogate models within the optimisation framework. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of this technique over other methods, requiring only a fraction of the function evaluations. Recognising the sensitivity of the approach to the number of samples in the reference curve, we propose a response reduction algorithm to mitigate the computational cost associated with this strategy, thereby further optimising the overall efficiency of the method. The proposed approach offers an accurate, efficient, and unsupervised calibration of material parameters, reducing the need for time-consuming trial-and-error methods in parameter identification.},

The deep-learning model is trained to enforce thermodynamic principles, leading to a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model. To accomplish this, a long short-term memory network is combined with a feed-forward neural network to predict internal variables required for characterizing the internal dissipation of the nanocomposite materials. In addition, another feed-forward neural network is used to indicate the free-energy function, which enables defining the thermodynamic state of the entire system. The PIDL model is initially developed for the three-dimensional case by generating synthetic data from a classical constitutive model. The model is then trained by extracting the data directly from cyclic loading–unloading experimental tests. Numerical examples show that the PIDL model can accurately predict the mechanical behavior of epoxy-based nanocomposites for different volume fractions of fibers and nanoparticles under various hygrothermal conditions.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing popularity of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), their applicability in the long-time integration of partial differential equations (PDEs) remains constrained. We argue that this problem stems from the lack of consideration of temporal causality in the original PINN formulation, resulting in a bias towards satisfying governing equations at later times before learning the initial condition and hence leading to erroneous solutions. To this end, we propose a novel method that seamlessly integrates temporal causality into the training process. Drawing inspiration from classical numerical methods where the temporal causality is reflected, we divide the time domain into nonoverlapping subintervals, assign a unique neural network to each subinterval, and construct a loss function founded on the integral form of PDEs within these subintervals. The proposed networks undergo sequential training, beginning with the initial time step. Our method demonstrates significant improvement in accuracy for long-time simulations of various PDE problems where the original PINN method fails while it requires less computational cost and memory compared to the PINN method. A parallelization algorithm is provided to further enhance the computational efficiency, showing a significant speedup for solving time-dependent PDEs.},

We investigate the locality of LNO by looking into its receptive field and receptive range, carrying a main concern about how the locality acts in LNO training and applications. In a large group of LNO training experiments for learning fluid dynamics, it is found that an initial receptive range compatible with the learning task is crucial for LNO to perform well. On the one hand, an over-small receptive range is fatal and usually leads LNO to numerical oscillation; on the other hand, an over-large receptive range hinders LNO from achieving the best accuracy. We deem rules found in this paper general when applying LNO to learn and solve transient PDEs in diverse fields. Practical examples of applying the pre-trained LNOs in flow prediction are presented to confirm the findings further. Overall, with the architecture properly designed with a compatible receptive range, the pre-trained LNO shows commendable accuracy and efficiency in solving practical cases.},

Such ROMs can keep the intrinsic structure of the system, allowing them to capture the physics described by the governing equations. In this work, we extend this approach to more general systems that are either conservative or dissipative in energy, and which possess a gradient structure. We derive the optimization problems for inferring structure-preserving ROMs that preserve the gradient structure. We further derive an a priori error estimate for the reduced-order approximation. To test the algorithms, we consider semi-discretized partial differential equations with gradient structure, such as the parameterized wave and Korteweg–de-Vries equations, and equations of three-dimensional linear elasticity in the conservative case and the one- and two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equations in the dissipative case.

To address these gaps, an automated data-driven framework is proposed for the simultaneous discovery of Lagrange densities and diffusion coefficients of stochastically excited dynamical systems by leveraging sparse regression. This novel framework offers several advantages over existing approaches. Firstly, it provides an interpretable description of the underlying Lagrange density, allowing for a deeper understanding of system dynamics under stochastic excitations. Secondly, it identifies the interpretable form of the diffusion coefficient of generalized stochastic force, addressing the limitations of existing deterministic approaches. Additionally, the framework demonstrates robustness and versatility through numerical case studies encompassing both stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), with results showing almost exact approximations to true system behavior and minimal relative error in derived equations of motion.},

In this work, we propose a model for planar Euler–Bernoulli beams that incorporates the following features: firstly, we utilize two phase-field damage parameters to describe material damaging, specifically addressing the ‘erosion’ occurring above and below the original, undamaged beam; secondly, we assume a simple linear dependence of the axial stress field on the thickness coordinate, along with linear dependence on the axial force and bending moment. By appropriately identifying the constitutive response, our model effectively considers the coupling between stretching and bending induced during through-the-thickness damage, demonstrating good agreement with 2D observations.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a data-driven based hierarchical multiscale combined finite-discrete element method (DHM-FDEM) for accurately reproducing rock macro-scale mechanical behavior while ensuring acceptable computational costs. To construct the DHM-FDEM scheme, firstly, upscale finite elements assembly (UFEA) and upscale crack elements assembly (UCEA) are constructed, incorporating meso-scale finite elements and crack elements with mechanical parameters directly derived from meso mechanics test results. Then, a conversion method is proposed to transform the mechanical response of UFEA and UCEA into a strain-stress pair of the macro-scale element, avoiding directly solving the mechanical state of macro-scale elements with mismatched mechanical parameters, thus ensuring the accurate reproduction of rock mechanical properties. Furthermore, UFEA and UCEA subjected to various loading paths are conducted by meso-scale FDEM to generate data sets comprising sequential strain-stress pairs with history dependence and one-to-many mapping relationships. The generated data sets are then applied to train a data-driven method, long short-term memory with mixture density network (LSTM-MDN), which directly maps strain input to stress output, thus replacing tedious and repetitive meso-scale FDEM computation on UFEA and UCEA to significantly save computational costs. Subsequently, UFEA and UCEA driven by LSTM-MDN are equivalent to macro-scale FDEM elements, replacing their phenomenological constitutive relationships and thereby achieving the multiscale numerical computation scheme. After that, the uniaxial compression test and Brazilian disk test are conducted to validate the computational accuracy and efficiency of DHM-FDEM. Finally, the capability of DHM-FDEM to accurately reproduce rock accumulated damage from loading-unloading cycles is verified through uniaxial and biaxial cyclic loading-unloading tests.},

  abstract     = {The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations provide a computationally efficient method for solving fluid flow problems in engineering applications. However, the use of closure models to represent turbulence effects can reduce their accuracy. To address this issue, recent research has explored data-driven techniques such as data assimilation and machine learning. An efficient variational data assimilation (DA) approach is presented to enhance steady-state eddy viscosity based RANS simulations. To account for model deficiencies, a corrective force term is introduced in the momentum equation. In the case of only velocity reference data, this term can be represented by a potential field and is divergence-free. The DA implementation relies on the discrete adjoint method and approximations for efficient gradient evaluation. The implementation is based on a two-dimensional coupled RANS solver in OpenFOAM , which is extended to allow the computation of the adjoint velocity and pressure as well as the adjoint gradient. A gradient-based optimizer is used to minimize the difference between the simulation results and the reference data. To evaluate this approach, it is compared with alternative data assimilation methods for canonical stationary two-dimensional turbulent flow problems. For the data assimilation, sparsely distributed reference data from averaged high-fidelity simulation results are used. The results suggest that the proposed method achieves the optimization goal more efficiently compared to applying data assimilation for obtaining the eddy viscosity, or a field modifying the eddy viscosity, directly. The method works well for different reference data configurations and runs efficiently by leveraging coarse meshes.},

  abstract     = {We present a new linear eigensolution analysis technique that provides superior estimates of dissipation distribution in wavenumber space for the continuous Galerkin (CG) method. The technique builds upon traditional dispersion–diffusion analyses that have been applied to spectral/hp element methods, but in particular is an improvement upon the non-modal eigenanalysis approach proposed by Fernandez et al. (2019). The present technique takes into account the indirect effects that dispersion may have on dissipation, as recently discussed by Moura et al. (2022), in order to better represent dissipation itself. Also, a concept used by the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) community is invoked to weight the relative contribution of the multiple diffusion curves that stem from temporal eigenanalysis. This allows for obtaining a single dissipation profile in wavenumber space, so that the proposed technique is named joint-mode analysis. Although the non-modal approach also provides a single diffusion curve, the joint-mode dissipation curve is shown to correlate significantly better with the energy spectrum of Burgers’ turbulence at large and intermediate scales, which is particularly relevant for implicit large-eddy simulation (LES). The proposed technique is readily extensible to other spectral/hp element methods.},

  abstract     = {While deep learning and data-driven modeling approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently attracted increasing attention for solving partial differential equations, their practical applications to real-world scientific and engineering problems remain limited due to the relatively low accuracy and high computational costs. In this study, we present a differentiable programming-based hybrid meshfree approach within the field of computational mechanics. This approach seamlessly integrates neural network-based deep learning architectures with physics-based meshfree discretization techniques, thus referred to as the neural-integrated meshfree (NIM) method. To effectively approximate the solution, NIM employs a hybrid scheme called NeuroPU approximation, which combines continuous DNN representations with partition of unity (PU) basis functions associated with the underlying spatial discretization. This neural-numerical hybridization not only enhances the solution representation through functional space decomposition but also reduces both the size of DNN model and the need of automatic differentiation for spatial gradient computations, leading to a significant improvement in training efficiency. Under the NIM framework, we propose two truly meshfree solvers: the strong form-based NIM (S-NIM) and the local variational form-based NIM (V-NIM). In the S-NIM solver, the strong-form governing equation is directly considered in the loss function, while the V-NIM solver employs a local Petrov–Galerkin approach that allows the construction of variational residuals based on arbitrary overlapping subdomains. This ensures both the satisfaction of underlying physics and the preservation of the meshfree property. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both stationary and transient benchmark problems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed NIM methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, generalizability, and convergence properties. Moreover, comparative analysis with other physics-informed machine learning methods demonstrates that NIM, especially V-NIM, significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in end-to-end predictive capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Turbulent flows, characterized by their chaotic and stochastic nature, have historically presented formidable challenges to predictive computational modeling. Traditional eddy-resolved numerical simulations often require vast computational resources, making them impractical or infeasible for numerous engineering applications. As an alternative, deep learning-based surrogate models have emerged, offering data-drive solutions. However, these are typically constructed within deterministic settings, leading to shortfall in capturing the innate chaotic and stochastic behaviors of turbulent dynamics. In this study, we introduce a novel generative framework grounded in probabilistic diffusion models for versatile generation of spatiotemporal turbulence under various conditions. Our method unifies both unconditional and conditional sampling strategies within a Bayesian framework, which can accommodate diverse conditioning scenarios, including those with a direct differentiable link between specified conditions and generated unsteady flow outcomes, as well as scenarios lacking such explicit correlations. A notable feature of our approach is the method proposed for long-span flow sequence generation, which is based on autoregressive gradient-based conditional sampling, eliminating the need for cumbersome retraining processes. We evaluate and showcase the versatile turbulence generation capability of our framework through a suite of numerical experiments, including: (1) the synthesis of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) simulated instantaneous flow sequences from unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) inputs; (2) holistic generation of inhomogeneous, anisotropic wall-bounded turbulence, whether from given initial conditions, prescribed turbulence statistics, or entirely from scratch; (3) super-resolved generation of high-speed turbulent boundary layer flows from low-resolution data across a range of input resolutions. Collectively, our numerical experiments highlight the merit and transformative potential of the proposed methods, making a significant advance in the field of turbulence generation.},

The solid is simulated by the edge-based SPIM (ESPIM) which can soften the numerical stiffness by utilizing the generalized gradient smoothing technique. The interaction between the fluid and structure is realized with the help of virtual particles and the pressure integral method. Virtual particles are pre-set inside the solid and they keep with the structure nodes. The fluid exerts external forces on the solid by integrating the pressure alongside the solid boundary segments. In this way, the fluid and solid are free to be discretized with different spatial resolutions. The fluid, solid and FSI solvers are respectively verified. In the situations of complex FSI problems like sloshing, dam-breaking and impacting, the present model performs well in predicting the fluid fields and structural deformations.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an enhanced prismatic-element scaled boundary perfectly matched layer (SBPML) is developed, which is a novel time-domain artificial boundary method for 3D infinite wave problems. The SBPML permits the utilization of an artificial boundary with general geometry and can consider planar physical surfaces and interfaces extending to infinity. Moreover, this enhancement enables the seamless integration with surface meshes of arbitrary polygonal faces (such as triangles, quadrangles, pentagons, heptagons, octagons, etc.) at the truncation boundaries. The interior domain can be modelled by polyhedrons formulated by the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). The geometric shape of the SBPML elements in the proposed method, within the local coordinate system, takes the form of a regular prism with regular polygonal top and bottom faces. Consequently, it is referred to as the Prismatic-element SBPML. Local scaled boundary coordinates based on the polygonal shape function are firstly introduced into the truncated infinite domain to describe its general geometry properties and provide the coupled capabilities with arbitrary polygonal face meshes at the truncation boundaries of numerical models. Then, a complex stretching function from PML is applied to radial direction of the local scaled boundary coordinates to map the physical space onto the complex space, resulting in a SBPML domain. Upon spatial discretization, the proposed method is formulated using a 2nd-order mixed displacement-stress unsplit-field formulation, allowing seamless coupling with FEM and SBFEM originally designed for the interior computational domain. Finally, three benchmark examples of wave propagation problems in unbounded domains and two soil-structure interaction problems of engineering problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the Prismatic-element SBPML.},

The proposed coupled SPFEM formulation is validated through four elastic examples and one elasto-plastic example. Good agreement with the numerical or analytical results reported in the literature is obtained. Further, the rainfall-induced slope failure is studied, in which a suction-dependent elasto-plastic Mohr–Coulomb model is adopted to take account of the suction effect in unsaturated soil. The evolution of the suction and soil deformation during the rainfall period and the whole slope failure process are obtained. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is a promising tool in numerical investigations of both the triggering mechanisms and post-failure behavior of the rainfall-induced slope failure.},

A computational challenges that has so far prevented its deployment on large-scale systems is that the energy functions required for characterization of controllability and observability are solutions of various high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–(Bellman) equations, which are computationally intractable in high dimensions. This work proposes a unifying and scalable approach to this challenge by considering a Taylor-series-based approximation to solve a class of parametrized Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations that are at the core of nonlinear balancing. The value of a formulation parameter provides either open-loop balancing or a variety of closed-loop balancing options. To solve for the coefficients of Taylor-series approximations to the energy functions, the presented method derives a linear tensor system and heavily utilizes it to numerically solve structured linear systems with billions of unknowns. The strength and scalability of the algorithm is demonstrated on two semi-discretized partial differential equations, namely the Burgers and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the basis of a new mechanical model named QuadWire dedicated to efficient simulations of bead-based additive manufacturing processes in which elongated beads undergoing significant cooling and eigenstrain are assembled to form 3D parts. The key contribution is to use a multi-particular approach containing 4 particles per material point to develop an extended 1D model capable of capturing complex 3D mechanical states, while significantly reducing computation time with respect to conventional approaches. Indeed, 3D models usually require at least 3 to 4 elements across the bead section, which results in fine discretization along the tangential direction to avoid conditioning issues, and therefore very fine mesh of the entire 3D part. In the QuadWire model, the bead height and thickness are internal dimensions, enabling a significantly coarser mesh along the tangential direction. Thus, although the QuadWire has 12 degrees of freedom per material point instead of 3 for classical models, the total number of degrees of freedom is reduced by several orders of magnitude for large parts. The proposed model is classically developed within the framework of the principle of virtual power and standard generalized hyperelastic media (i.e., finite strain theory), which necessitates a thermodynamic analysis. Furthermore, the proposed approach includes native and manageable kinematic constraints between successive beads so that the stress state properly evolves during fabrication. Finite element analysis is used for numerical implementation under infinitesimal strain assumption for the sake of simplicity, and the QuadWire stiffness parameters are optimized so that the mechanical response fit conventional 3D approaches. To validate and demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed strategy, the evolution of displacements and stresses in fused deposition modeling of polylactide is simulated.},

Using examples of compositional poromechanics with application to geological CO 2 2 sequestration, we see that solutions obtained using the fixed-stress scheme with a low order finite element-finite volume discretization which is not inherently inf-sup stable can exhibit the same pressure oscillations obtained with the corresponding fully implicit scheme. Moreover, pressure jump stabilization can effectively remove these spurious oscillations in the fixed-stress setting, while also improving the efficiency of the scheme in terms of the number of iterations required at every time step to reach convergence.},

  abstract     = {For conventional Material Point Method (MPM), both explicit-based and implicit-based MPM have shortcomings: explicit MPM has high requirements on time steps, and implicit MPM has high requirements on convergence. To circumvent these limitations, this paper innovatively proposes a convex cone programming-based implicit MPM (CP-MPM) algorithm, which ensures excellent convergence of solving complex problems involving large deformation, regardless of the chosen time step. In the proposed CP-MPM, the governing equations are initially transformed into a stationary point of a multivariable functional, leveraging the generalized Hellinger-Reissner (HR) variational principle. This stationary point problem is subsequently reformulated as a min-max convex cone optimization problem, with constraints originating from elastoplastic constitutive equations. In addition, a novel particle-based adhesive-frictional contact algorithm is proposed to effectively tackle the interaction between MPM domain and rigid bodies. The contact inequality between material points and rigid bodies is transformed into convex cone constraints, which rigorously prevent material point penetration and facilitate the imposition of irregular boundary conditions. Both elastic and elastoplastic problems involving contact under static or dynamic loading are ultimately represented as standard second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems, which is effectively solved by employing the Primal-Dual Interior Point (PDIP) method. The robustness, accuracy and convergence of the proposed method are validated through a series of elastic and elastoplastic benchmark problems. All results demonstrate the CP-MPM is a very promising method for implicitly solving complex practices.},

  abstract     = {Design optimization considering the presence of uncertainties in parameters poses an extremely challenging problem. The source of difficulties comes with reliability-based formulations, where addressing the probabilistic problem exhausts the large computing efforts for failure estimations of the structure violating limit-state functions (LSFs). This paper proposes a novel decoupled approach for effectively solving reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems, namely an invertible cross-entropy (iCE) method advantageously combined with a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, termed as iCE-GPR. The GPR model is applied to approximate the spectrum of LSFs under random parameters. Furthermore, to enhance the accurate prediction of the system failure probability, an active learning process is applied to systematically refine the GPR model by adding new learning points in the region with the largest uncertainty and high-reliability sensitivity through the maximization of an expected feasibility function (EFF). Based on the updated GPR model, the failure probability is estimated by a cost-effective cross-entropy (CE) method without any calls to the actual performance function. To perform the decoupling optimization process with the reliability analysis, the novel iCE, based on the CE method, is developed to update the most probable point (MPP) assigned for the next deterministic optimization process in determining the new optimal design. The method iteratively performs the deterministic optimization process based on the MPP underpinning LSFs sequentially updated by the active learning process. The proposed iCE-GPR method fast-converges the optimal design and significantly alleviates computational burdens associated with reliability analyses. The proposed method is also applied to solve a reliability-based topology optimization (RBTO) problem. Four numerical examples for both the RBDO and RBTO problems are provided to illustrate efficiency and robustness of the proposed iCE-GPR method.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel nonlinear topology optimization framework tailored for flexoelectric soft dielectrics undergoing large deformation. A numerical method based on Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is introduced to nonlinear soft dielectrics at finite strain, ensuring the C 1 C1 -continuity for flexoelectric problems. We outline the process of consistent linearizations and IGA discretizations. Additionally, we introduce an innovative and efficient Strain Density Function (SDF) interpolation scheme for optimizing electromechanical coupling factors (ECFs). In this scheme, the interpolation of electromechanical and hyper-elastic energy terms is grounded in the SIMP model, while a linear material interpolation model is employed for the dielectric energy. Our numerical analysis highlights the remarkable performance of the proposed SDF interpolation scheme in nonlinear electromechanical optimization scenarios. An energy remedy scheme is applied to void regions to eliminate the instability of nonlinear optimization, effectively preventing distortion deformations in low-stiffness elements. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of size effect and larger deformation on the optimization of flexoelectric soft materials. The proposed topology optimization framework adeptly leverages the interplay between size effect and larger deformation, resulting in a notable improvement in ECFs within the optimized structures. Finally, the electromechanical coupling factors (ECFs) of the optimized structures in all the examined cases exhibit enhancements up to 9 times as compared to the reference guess designs.},

However, modern flood models lack the capacity to accurately model flow interactions with linear features, or hydraulic structures like bridges and gates, which act as partial barriers to flow. Presented within this paper is a new Riemann solver which represents a novel approach to modelling fluid–structure interactions within two-dimensional hydrodynamic models. The solution procedure models obstacles as existing at the interface between neighbouring cells and uses a combination of internal boundary conditions, different forms of the conservation laws and vertical discretisation of the neighbouring cells to resolve numerical fluxes across a partially obstructed interface. The predictive capacity of the solver has been validated through comparisons with experimental data collected from experiments conducted in a state-of-the-art hydraulic flume. Since the solution procedure is local, only applying to the cells within the immediate vicinity of a structure, the method is designed to be compatible with existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic models which use a finite volume scheme to solve the shallow water equations.},

  abstract     = {Simulating the mechanical response of advanced materials can be done more accurately using concurrent multiscale models than with single-scale simulations. However, the computational costs stand in the way of the practical application of this approach. The costs originate from microscale Finite Element (FE) models that must be solved at every macroscopic integration point. A plethora of surrogate modeling strategies attempt to alleviate this cost by learning to predict macroscopic stresses from macroscopic strains, completely replacing the microscale models. In this work, we introduce an alternative surrogate modeling strategy that allows for keeping the multiscale nature of the problem, allowing it to be used interchangeably with an FE solver for any time step. Our surrogate provides all microscopic quantities, which are then homogenized to obtain macroscopic quantities of interest. We achieve this for an elasto-plastic material by predicting full-field microscopic strains using a graph neural network (GNN) while retaining the microscopic constitutive material model to obtain the stresses. This hybrid data-physics graph-based approach avoids the high dimensionality originating from predicting full-field responses while allowing non-locality to arise. In addition, this approach introduces beneficial inductive bias to the model by encoding microscopic geometrical features. By training the GNN on a variety of meshes, it learns to generalize to unseen meshes, allowing a single model to be used for a range of microstructures. The embedded microscopic constitutive model in the GNN implicitly tracks history-dependent variables and leads to improved accuracy. While the microscopic stresses are fully dependent on the microscopic strains, we found it crucial to include both microscopic strains and stresses in the loss function. We demonstrate for several challenging scenarios that the surrogate can predict complex macroscopic stress–strain paths. As the computation time of our method scales favorably with the number of elements in the microstructure compared to the FE method, our method can significantly accelerate FE 2 2 simulations.},

  abstract     = {Recent work in data-driven modeling has demonstrated that a weak formulation of model equations enhances the noise robustness of a wide range of computational methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of the weak form to enhance the LaSDI (Latent Space Dynamics Identification) algorithm, a recently developed data-driven reduced order modeling technique. We introduce a weak form-based version WLaSDI (Weak-form Latent Space Dynamics Identification). WLaSDI first compresses data, then projects onto the test functions and learns the local latent space models. Notably, WLaSDI demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noise. With WLaSDI, the local latent space is obtained using weak-form equation learning techniques. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) used in LaSDI, the variance reduction of the weak form guarantees a robust and precise latent space recovery, hence allowing for a fast, robust, and accurate simulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of WLaSDI vs. LaSDI on several common benchmark examples including viscid and inviscid Burgers’, radial advection, and heat conduction. For instance, in the case of 1D inviscid Burgers’ simulations with the addition of up to 100% Gaussian white noise, the relative error remains consistently below 6% for WLaSDI, while it can exceed 10,000% for LaSDI. Similarly, for radial advection simulations, the relative errors stay below 16% for WLaSDI, in stark contrast to the potential errors of up to 10,000% with LaSDI. Moreover, speedups of several orders of magnitude can be obtained with WLaSDI. For example applying WLaSDI to 1D Burgers’ yields a 140X speedup compared to the corresponding full order model. Python code to reproduce the results in this work is available at ( https://github.com/MathBioCU/PyWSINDy_ODE ) and ( https://github.com/MathBioCU/PyWLaSDI ).},

  abstract     = {The Deep Fourier Residual (DFR) method is a specific type of variational physics-informed neural network (VPINN). It provides a robust neural network-based solution to partial differential equations (PDEs). The DFR strategy is based on minimizing the dual norm of the weak residual of a PDE, which is equivalent to minimizing the energy norm of the error. To compute the dual norm of the weak residual, the DFR method employs an orthonormal spectral basis of the test space, known for rectangles or cuboids for multiple function spaces. In this work, we extend the DFR method with ideas of traditional domain decomposition (DD). This enables two improvements: (a) to solve problems in more general polygonal domains and (b) to develop an adaptive refinement technique in the test space using a Döfler marking algorithm. In the former case, we retain the desirable equivalence between the employed loss function and the H 1 H1 error under non-restrictive assumptions, numerically demonstrating adherence to explicit bounds in the case of the L-shaped domain problem. In the latter, we show how refinement strategies lead to potentially significant improvements against a reference, classical DFR implementation with a test function space of significantly lower dimensionality, allowing us to better approximate singular solutions at a more reasonable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Porous media processes involve various physical phenomena such as mechanical deformation, transport, and fluid flow. Accurate simulations must capture the strong couplings between these phenomena. Choosing an efficient solver for a multiphysics problem usually entails the decoupling into subproblems related to separate physical phenomena. Then, the suitable solvers for each subproblem and the iteration scheme must be chosen. Finally, the numerical parameters of the solvers must be optimized. Theoretical considerations often allow us to come up with several robust linear solvers for a given problem, but they cannot guide us further in seeking the most efficient linear solver configuration because its performance depends on hardware, software and the driving forces of the simulated model. As a further complication, these driving forces can vary with time within one simulation, causing the most efficient linear solver configuration to change. Switching a solver with respect to the dominant process can be beneficial, but the threshold of when to switch solver is unclear and complicated to analyze. We address this challenge by developing a machine learning framework that automatically searches for the optimal solver for a given multiphysics simulation setup, based on statistical data from previously solved problems. For a series of problems, exemplified by successive time steps in a time-dependent simulation, the framework updates and improves its decision model online during the simulation. We describe the solver selection algorithm, present examples of how the solver selector tunes the solver during the simulation, and show how it outperforms preselected state-of-the-art solvers for test problem setups. The examples are based on simulations of poromechanics and simulations of flow and transport. For the quasi-static linear Biot model, we demonstrate automated tuning of numerical solver parameters by showing how the L-parameter of the so-called Fixed-Stress preconditioner can be optimized. Motivated by a test example where the main heat transfer mechanism changes between convection and diffusion, we also discuss how the solver selector can dynamically switch solvers when the dominant physical phenomenon changes with time.},

Random transient uncertain but bounded loading is modeled in the form of an ellipsoid convex model. A transformation matrix is defined with uncertainty in input parameters based on orientation and lengths of semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipsoid. Latin hypercube sampling is utilized to generate samples inside the normalized space. These samples are then converted to a physical space using a transformation matrix. The generalized- α α method is employed to compute the dynamic response of the system subjected to time-dependent loading. A density-based TO formulation is used to minimize dynamic response. The robust topology optimization problem is defined as bi-criteria optimization to minimize both the mean and variance across all deterministic cases within the ellipsoidal bounds. The solid isotropic material with penalization method is employed for the interpolation of material stiffness. Helmholtz filter is used to stabilize the problem numerically. The optimality criteria method is used to update the design variables. The proposed scheme’s effectiveness and the efficiency of the optimized designs are checked using a set of numerical examples. For most of the cases, robust design exhibits a substantial reduction of approximately 70%–75% in standard deviation when compared with deterministic design. The results demonstrate the proposed framework’s ability to reduce structure transient response under uncertain but bounded regions.},

  abstract     = {One of the biggest challenges in optimizing the shape of complex solids is the requirement to maintain a reasonable mesh quality not only at the boundary but also for the bulk discretization of the interior. Thus, additional regularization and, in many cases, re-meshing of the structure during the iterative process is unavoidable with a Lagrangian description. By tracking the shape update using an Eulerian representation, embedded boundary methods are a promising technique for eliminating mesh distortion problems. This work consistently combines the unique features of implicit Vertex-Morphing and embedded boundary methods, facilitating the node-based shape optimization of solids with industrial complexity. One of the crucial elements for solving the primal problem on a fixed background grid is an efficient and robust quadrature scheme. To this end, we incorporate the open-source C++ framework QuESo ( https://github.com/manuelmessmer/QuESo ) developed for the numerical integration of arbitrarily complex embedded solids defined by oriented boundary meshes, e.g., in STereoLithography (STL) format. Meanwhile, applying the Helmholtz/Sobolev-based (implicit) filter to the vertices of the embedded boundary mesh not only exploits the extensive design space of node-based optimization but also ensures robust control over the feature size. To realize the above methodology, this work introduces a novel sensitivity analysis that yields mesh-independent shape gradients with respect to the immersed boundary. Through a specific sensitivity weighting, we recover a continuous gradient field from discrete values calculated at the nodes of the background grid. In addition, the presented workflow ensures robust enforcement of challenging geometrical constraints, including minimum wall thicknesses and design space limitations. We critically assess our approach with benchmarks and structures of industrial relevance. In all examples, trivariate B-Spline bases span the background grid, providing highly accurate finite element solutions and shape sensitivities at every iteration. Moreover, the elimination of mesh distortion problems enables a successful termination at the local optimum, even for large shape modifications.},

  abstract     = {Developing the proper representations for simulating high-speed flows with strong shock waves, rarefactions, and contact discontinuities has been a long-standing question in numerical analysis. Herein, we employ neural operators to solve Riemann problems encountered in compressible flows for extreme pressure jumps (up to 1 0 10 1010 pressure ratio). In particular, we first consider the DeepONet that we train in a two-stage process, following the recent work of Lee and Shin (2023), wherein the first stage, a basis is extracted from the trunk net, which is orthonormalized and subsequently is used in the second stage in training the branch net. This simple modification of DeepONet has a profound effect on its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness and leads to very accurate solutions to Riemann problems compared to the vanilla version. It also enables us to interpret the results physically as the hierarchical data-driven produced basis reflects all the flow features that would otherwise be introduced using ad hoc feature expansion layers. We also compare the results with another neural operator based on the U-Net for low, intermediate, and very high-pressure ratios that are very accurate for Riemann problems, especially for large pressure ratios, due to their multiscale nature but computationally more expensive. Overall, our study demonstrates that simple neural network architectures, if properly pre-trained, can achieve very accurate solutions of Riemann problems for real-time forecasting.

  abstract     = {Searching for the most probable point (MPP) by traditional methods cannot avoid the demand for accurate gradients of limit state functions (LSFs) essentially. It is difficult to calculate the accurate gradient of unknown high nonlinear LSFs. In this paper, a multi-failure mode reliability analysis method based on intelligent directional search with constraint feedback (IDS) is proposed, focusing on unknown high nonlinear LSFs. (i): To improve the convergence rate, a point on the feasible domain boundary is settled as a starting point. The starting point is also located in the quadrant containing the MPP. (ii): To further enhance the optimization efficiency, the improved slime mould algorithm (iSMA) is proposed by adding constraint feedback, so that the current optimal point can move towards the LSF during the optimization process. (iii): To overcome the local optimum, iSMA and adaptive Lévy flight are combined which can expand the search area in the exploration phase. Finally, the failure probability of multi-failure mode is obtained by the second-order approximation method (SOAM) based on the MPPs. Three mathematical examples are utilized to demonstrate the excellent accuracy and acceptable efficiency of the proposed method by comparison with other existing methods. The results indicate that when the nonlinearity of LSF is not very high, IDS has the same computational cost as ECC, and the same order of accuracy as an intelligent optimization algorithm. As the nonlinearity of LSF of structural system failure modes increases, the computational cost of IDS will be higher than ECC. However, the accuracy of IDS has always been good enough. When the structural system has a concave LSF, IDS is more efficient than other intelligent optimization algorithms. Results of the engineering example indicate that the proposed method is very suitable for multi-failure mode reliability analysis problems with unknown high nonlinear LSF.},

  abstract     = {The interactions between non-spherical particles and fluids are commonplace in both nature and engineering applications, such as deep-sea nodules hydraulic collection. However, accurately simulating granular particles with non-spherical shapes and gaining a deep understanding of the intricate mechanisms involved in fluid–particle interactions still pose significant challenges. In this study, the superquadric model and the Gaussian curvature model are introduced in the Discrete Element Method to describe particle shapes and characterize their nonlinear contact behavior, respectively. Simultaneously, the Fictitious Domain-Immersed Boundary Method (FD-IBM) and the Particle Boundary Field Method (PBFM) are employed to enhance the stability and accuracy of numerical simulations. Building upon these advancements, an extended resolved CFD-DEM-PBFM method is developed. The validation and superiority of this resolved CFD-DEM-PBFM method are rigorously verified by comparing its results with the experimental and other research results across various scenarios, including non-spherical particle collision and packing, particle settling, drafting-kissing-tumbling test, and flow around non-spherical particles. Subsequently, the application of our novel model has been further conducted by a case study that simulates the hydraulic collection of nodules with different aspect ratios l/d . Concurrently, the influences of the nodule shapes on the hydraulic collection mechanism of the hydraulic collection are unveiled in terms of suction forces, trajectory of the particle, and flow field characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that the extended resolved CFD-DEM-PBFM method excels at accurately characterizing multiphase interaction mechanisms at both macro and micro scales, presenting considerable advantages in simulating fluid-particle systems involving non-spherical particles.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an efficient and robust isogeometric three-dimensional solid-beam finite element is developed for large deformations and finite rotations with merely displacements as degrees of freedom. The finite strain theory and hyperelastic constitutive models are considered and B-Spline and NURBS are employed for the finite element discretization. Similar to finite elements based on Lagrange polynomials, also NURBS-based formulations are affected by the non-physical phenomena of locking, which constrains the field variables and negatively impacts the solution accuracy and deteriorates convergence behavior. To avoid this problem within the context of a solid-beam formulation, the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method is applied to alleviate membrane and transversal shear locking and the Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) method against Poisson thickness locking. Furthermore, the Mixed Integration Point (MIP) method is used to make the formulation more efficient and robust. The proposed novel isogeometric solid-beam element is tested on several single-patch and multi-patch benchmark problems, and it is validated against classical solid finite elements and first-order Lagrange solid-beam element. The results show that the proposed formulation can alleviate the locking effects and significantly improve the performance of the isogeometric solid-beam element. With the developed element, efficient and accurate predictions of mechanical properties of lattice-based structured materials can be achieved. The proposed solid-beam element inherits both the merits of solid elements e.g. flexible boundary conditions and of the beam elements i.e. higher computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In engineering practices, it is a time-consuming procedure to estimate the small failure probability of highly nonlinear and dimensional limit state functions and Kriging-based methods are more effective representatives. However, it is an important challenge to construct the candidate importance sample pool for Kriging-based small failure probability analysis methods with multiple input random variables when the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm with acceptance-rejection sampling principle is employed. To address the challenge and estimate the reliability of structures in a more efficient and accurate way, an active learning Kriging model based on the Gibbs importance sampling algorithm (AK-Gibbs) is proposed, especially for the small failure probabilities with nonlinear and high-dimensional limit state functions. A new active learning function that can be directly linked to the global error is first constructed. Weighting coefficients of the joint probability density function in the new active learning function are then determined to select the most probable points (MPPs) and update samples efficiently and accurately. The Gibbs importance sampling algorithm is derived based on the Gibbs algorithm to effectively establish the candidate importance sample pool. An improved global error-based stopping criterion is finally constructed to avoid pre-mature or late-mature for the estimation of small failure probabilities with complicated failure domains. Two numerical and four engineering examples are respectively employed to elaborate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Here, we postulate that RNN models of elasto-plastic solids feature a large common core that is shared by all materials of the same class. The common core is complemented by material-specific layers with parameters that vary from material-to-material. After training RNN models for 25 different von Mises materials, we identify the common core of a multi-task model. Furthermore, we demonstrate through ensemble transfer learning that adding a new material to the multi-task model requires datasets that are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the datasets needed for training an RNN from scratch. In addition, to multi-task learning, we introduce probabilistic ensembles of RNN plasticity models to quantify the epistemic uncertainty. A deep drawing simulation is performed to demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of RNNs identified via multi-task learning as compared to those obtained through single task training.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity data are common in various scientific and engineering fields. High-fidelity data, often more accurate, come with greater expense, such as precision experimental testing or high-resolution simulation. Conversely, low-fidelity data are less accurate but more cost-effective. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling, which integrates multi-fidelity data to build a model, is widely used for its ability to reduce costs while improving modeling accuracy. In this work, we introduce an innovative method named active learning-assisted multi-fidelity surrogate modeling based on geometric transformation (AL-MFSGT). The AL-MFSGT method comprises three essential components: the two-fidelity surrogate based on geometric transformation (TFSGT), an active learning (AL) strategy, and a multi-fidelity modeling framework. TFSGT utilizes geometric transformations to adjust the low-fidelity surrogate to align it more closely with the high-fidelity data. Then, the transformed low-fidelity surrogate and the high-fidelity surrogate are coupled using correlation functions. The AL strategy combines accelerating error convergence and enhancing sample set diversity to judiciously select high-fidelity incremental samples. Subsequently, the two-fidelity surrogate modeling is extended to a comprehensive multi-fidelity framework. To validate the efficacy of AL-MFSGT, we conduct extensive comparative experiments using ten numerical examples. The results demonstrate the superiority of AL-MFSGT over several compared multi-fidelity surrogate modeling methods. Furthermore, we apply AL-MFSGT to two practical engineering cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world modeling scenarios.},

The proposed theoretical framework comprises three main elements: a microstructural material model describing intestine wall geometry and composition of reinforcing fibers, with four fiber families, two active–conductive and two passive; an electrophysiological model describing the propagation of slow waves, based on a fully-coupled nonlinear phenomenological approach; and a thermodynamical consistent mechanical model describing the hyperelastic energetic contributions ruling tissue equilibrium under diverse loading conditions. The active strain approach was adopted to describe tissue electromechanics, thus solving the governing equations via a staggered finite element scheme. The computational framework was fine-tuned according to state-of-the-art experimental evidence, and extensive numerical analyses were conducted to compare and contrast clinical manometric traces. The model proved capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively high or low-amplitude propagation contractions demonstrating that material properties of the deposited tissue are critical to restoring a proper peristaltic activity.},

The evolution of stresses and internal variables, i.e., the material state, is governed by partial derivatives of the potential functions with respect to deformation and stress measures. Furthermore, for application of such models in implicit nonlinear finite element analysis tangent operators, consistent with the numerical integration algorithm, are required. In this work, we study analytical, numerical and automatic differentiation schemes for the implementation of coupled, generalized continuum models considering finite inelastic deformations and fracture. This includes the application of finite difference approximations, complex-step derivative approximations and automatic differentiation based on hyper-dual numbers. For the use of automatic differentiation, a semi-analytical split approach is introduced for increasing the computational efficiency. Based on a comprehensive 2D and 3D finite element study, we demonstrate the superior properties of automatic differentiation compared to numerical differentiation methods with regards to accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the additional computational cost for automatic differentiation using the proposed split approach becomes negligible for large problems.},

  abstract     = {In the process of reconstructing structural forces, the influence of measurement errors and inherent model inaccuracies cannot be ignored. These errors exhibit a degree of correlation, and the presence of such correlation inevitably affects the quantification of uncertainties in force reconstruction. Objectively, the inherent ill-posed nature of structural inverse problems makes it difficult to obtain the forces to be identified, subject to uncertainties and highly susceptible to perturbations. Consequently, this paper introduces a force reconstruction regularization approach that explicitly considers the correlation of uncertainty parameters based on the truncated singular value regularization method. The primary objective is to refine the influence of uncertainties on the reconstructed force bounds with greater precision. When determining robust regularization parameters, the generalized cross-validation method and convex modelling approach are introduced to consider the uncertainty and its correlation in solving inverse problems. The proposed approach is rigorously validated through a comprehensive numerical case study. Error indexes and dispersion indices are employed to analyze the impact of different levels of noise and correlation on force reconstruction results. The force bounds obtained using the proposed method are compared with Monte Carlo simulation results. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by an experiment with a four-story shear frame.},

Neural networks have been receiving ever-increasing attention and demonstrated remarkable success in computational modeling of PDEs, however; their prediction accuracy is not at the level of full deployment. In this work, we utilize the transformer architecture, the backbone of numerous state-of-the-art AI models, to learn the dynamics of physical systems as the mixing of spatial patterns learned by a convolutional autoencoder. Moreover, we incorporate the idea of multi-scale hierarchical time-stepping to increase the prediction speed and decrease accumulated error over time. Our model achieves similar or better results in predicting the time-evolution of Navier–Stokes equations compared to the powerful Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and two transformer-based neural operators OFormer and Galerkin Transformer.

In this paper, we tackle the task by proposing an efficient and implementation-friendly computational method that can fully leverage the computing power offered by hardware accelerators, namely, graphical processing units (GPUs). We first employ the Two-Point Flux-Approximation scheme to discretize the PDE and then utilize the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve the resulting algebraic linear system. The construction of the preconditioner originates from FFT-based homogenization methods, and an engineered linear programming technique is utilized to determine the homogeneous reference parameters. The fundamental observation presented in this paper is that the preconditioner system can be effectively solved using multiple Fast Cosine Transformations (FCT) and parallel tridiagonal matrix solvers. Regarding the fact that default multiple FCTs are unavailable on the CUDA platform, we detail how to derive FCTs from FFTs with nearly optimal memory usage. Numerical experiments including the stability comparison with standard preconditioners are conducted for 3D RVEs. Our performance reports indicate that the proposed method can achieve a 5-fold acceleration on the GPU platform over the pure CPU platform and solve the problems with 51 2 3 5123 degrees of freedom and reasonable contrast ratios in less than 30 s.},

To solve this system, we employ the fast second-order exponential time differencing Runge–Kutta (ETDRK2) method with stabilizing terms. This method is a decoupled linear numerical algorithm that preserves three crucial physical properties of the model: a maximum bound principle (MBP) on the order parameter and non-negativity of the two concentration variables. Our simulations allow us to predict tumor growth patterns and outcomes of drug therapy over extended periods, offering valuable insights for both basic research and clinical treatments.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stability-preserving model reduction approach for a vibro-acoustic finite element model including poroelastic materials. Most of the research on these systems in the past was conducted in the frequency domain and there were less focus on the stability properties. However, with the increasing of interest in time-domain auralization and virtual sensing, stability-preserving model order reduction is becoming essential for efficient time-domain simulations. The original finite element models for such systems are already well established but not extended to the time domain because of its high computational demand. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to generate stable reduced-order models. The solid displacement–total displacement ( u s − u t us−ut ) formulation of the Biot’s model is used to describe the poroelastic media. This formulation leads to a set of positive and symmetric system matrices with passive transfer functions. Applying the Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma and the Cholesky/LDL decomposition, this formulation is modified to satisfy the previously proven stability-preserving conditions under one-sided model order reduction. Furthermore, the coupling conditions between the poroelastic media, air, and structure are also investigated. It is finally shown that the stability-preserving property is kept for the coupled models with appropriate variables. The proposed method is verified by several numerical simulations.},

Among other aspects, this includes hemolysis , i.e., red blood cell damage. For this purpose, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are employed to predict blood flow in prototypes. The most basic hemolysis models directly estimate red blood cell damage from fluid stress in the resulting flow field. More advanced models explicitly resolve cell deformation. On the downside, these models are typically written in a Lagrangian formulation, i.e., they require pathline tracking. We present a new Eulerian description of cell deformation, enabling the evaluation of the solution across the whole domain. The resulting hemolysis model can be applied to any converged CFD simulation due to one-way coupling with the fluid velocity field. We discuss the efficient numerical treatment of the model equations in a stabilized finite element context. We verify the model by comparison to the original Lagrangian formulation in selected benchmark flows. Two more complex test cases demonstrate the method’s capabilities in real-world applications. The results highlight the advantages over previous hemolysis models. In conclusion, the model holds great potential for the design process of future generations of medical devices.},

Gappy POD has inherent constraints in accurately representing solutions characterized by slowly decaying Kolmogorov N-widths, primarily due to its reliance on linear subspaces for data prediction. In contrast, Gappy AE leverages the power of nonlinear manifold representations to address data reconstruction challenges of conventional Gappy POD. It excels at real-time state prediction in scenarios where only sparsely measured data is available, filling in the gaps effectively. This capability makes Gappy AE particularly valuable, such as for digital twin and image correction applications. To demonstrate the superior data reconstruction performance of Gappy AE with sparse measurements, we provide several numerical examples, including scenarios like 2D diffusion, 2D radial advection, and 2D wave equation problems. Additionally, we assess the impact of four distinct sampling algorithms – discrete empirical interpolation method, the S-OPT algorithm, Latin hypercube sampling, and uniformly distributed sampling – on data reconstruction accuracy. Our findings conclusively show that Gappy AE outperforms Gappy POD in data reconstruction when sparse measurements are given.},

  abstract     = {Computationally modeling the laser powder bed fusion process can be expensive despite the fact that the laser covers a small fraction of the entire domain. Hence, we developed GO-MELT, a multilevel approach inspired by the variational multiscale method. GO-MELT calculates the full temperature solution using three coupled thermal solvers, each solving one of three overlapping domains, subsequently referred to as levels. Level 1’s solver obtains a global, coarse-scale solution. Level 2’s solver computes a meso-scale thermal field spanning the melt pool region. Level 3’s solver obtains a fine-scale temperature field spanning the laser’s immediate region. Coarser solutions provide boundary conditions for finer solvers. Finer solutions compute subgrid scales that influence coarser solvers through additional source terms. Being independently meshed, Levels 2 and 3 can track a laser along its tool path without remeshing. Moreover, fixed-sized, structured meshes allow for GPU acceleration using Google’s JAX library with just-in-time compilation. Five case studies were conducted to demonstrate proper convergence of GO-MELT, to show that GO-MELT can reach the same accuracy as a uniform mesh with fewer degrees of freedom, and to quantify the computational load from each level’s solver. A simulated production run averaged 1.64 ms per time step after taking 9.36 h to complete 20.5 million time steps, which is approximately 678 × 678× faster than a uniform mesh solver with identical resolution and GPU acceleration. Future work will implement different solvers into GO-MELT to improve fidelity and speed.},

We present an efficient computational method to study fluid flow and solute transport problems in periodic porous media. Fluid flow is governed by the Stokes equation, and the solute transport is governed by the advection–diffusion equation. We follow the accelerated computational micromechanics approach that leads to an iterative computational method where each step is either local or the solution of a Poisson’s equation. This enables us to implement these methods on accelerators like graphics processing units (GPUs) and exploit their massively parallel architecture. We verify the approach by comparing the results against established computational methods and then demonstrate the accuracy, efficacy, and performance by studying various examples. This method efficiently calculates the effective transport properties for complex pore geometries.},

Multirate time integration algorithms employing different time steps, optimized for the dynamics of each subproblem, can significantly improve simulation efficiency for such coupled problems. However, development of multirate algorithms is a highly non-trivial task due to the coupling, which can impact accuracy, stability or other desired properties such as preservation of system invariants. DGiT provides a general template for multirate time integration that can achieve these properties. To elucidate the manner in which DGiT accomplishes this task, we fully detail each step in the application of the framework to the SSI and air–sea coupled problems.

The idea comes from the observation that convolutional layers can be used to express a discretisation as a neural network whose weights are determined by the numerical method, rather than by training, and hence, we refer to this approach as Neural Networks for PDEs (NN4PDEs). To solve the discretised multiphase flow equations, a multigrid solver is implemented through a convolutional neural network with a U-Net architecture. Immiscible two-phase flow is modelled by the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with surface tension and advection of a volume fraction field, which describes the interface between the fluids. A new compressive algebraic volume-of-fluids method is introduced, based on a residual formulation using Petrov–Galerkin for accuracy and designed with NN4PDEs in mind. High-order finite-element based schemes are chosen to model a collapsing water column and a rising bubble. Results compare well with experimental data and other numerical results from the literature, demonstrating that, for the first time, finite element discretisations of multiphase flows can be solved using an approach based on (untrained) convolutional neural networks. A benefit of expressing numerical discretisations as neural networks is that the code can run, without modification, on CPUs, GPUs or the latest accelerators designed especially to run AI codes.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven constitutive modeling with neural networks has received increased interest in recent years due to its ability to easily incorporate physical and mechanistic constraints and to overcome the challenging and time-consuming task of formulating phenomenological constitutive laws that can accurately capture the observed material response. However, even though neural network-based constitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated representations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of trainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow for obtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a library of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the functional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train regularized physics-augmented neural network-based constitutive models utilizing a smoothed version of L 0 L0 -regularization. This aims to maintain the trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables interpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine learning-based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a priori but were actually discovered. During the training process, the network simultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active parameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic consistency. We show that the method can reliably obtain interpretable and trustworthy constitutive models for compressible and incompressible hyperelasticity, yield functions, and hardening models for elastoplasticity, using synthetic and experimental data. This work aims to set a new paradigm for interpretable machine learning models in the broad area of solid mechanics where low and limited data is available along with prior knowledge of physical constraints that the learned maps need to obey. This paradigm can potentially be extended to a broader spectrum of scientific exploration.},

  abstract     = {Interface mechanics can significantly govern the evolution of multiple phases on smaller scales, e.g., determining the properties of TWIP- and TRIP-steels, geopolymers or Li-ion batteries. The present contribution is specifically centered around the influence of interface elasticity on mechanically induced phase transformations. A geometrically exact finite element framework is developed for this purpose based on incremental energy minimization. It is set up in three-dimensional space and comprises an Allen-Cahn type phase field formulation based on a Modica-Mortola double-well functional, as well as a Ginzburg-Landau type viscosity formulation. The phase field approximation of the interface deformation gradient is derived by means of homogenization theory. A monolithic solver is employed for the resulting set of non-linear coupled equations. The example of coalescing spheres shows that larger interface energies can amplify and accelerate coalescence. Lower interface energies, in contrast, allow for distinct spreading of the energetically favorable bulk phase. Deformation-dependent interface energies particularly add stress peaks to this process that are localized at the phase transition zone. The relaxation of a stepped interface shape showed that deformation-dependent interface energies favor a plane partition of the bulk phases. Yet, they also delay breakup events compared to simple constant interface energies. This peculiarity can be beneficial for calibration purposes. Strain dependence moreover causes an additional elastic stiffness in the direction of the interface tangent plane and constitutes thus another origin for anisotropy of the overall structure.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a first-order Stress-Hybrid Virtual Element Method (SH-VEM) on six-noded triangular meshes for linear plane elasticity. We adopt the Hellinger–Reissner variational principle to construct a weak equilibrium condition and a stress based projection operator. In each element, the stress projection operator is expressed in terms of the nodal displacements, which leads to a displacement based formulation. This stress-hybrid approach assumes a globally continuous displacement field while the stress field is discontinuous across each element. The stress field is initially represented by divergence-free tensor polynomials based on Airy stress functions, but we also present a formulation that uses a penalty term to enforce the element equilibrium conditions, referred to as the Penalty Stress-Hybrid Virtual Element Method (PSH-VEM). Numerical results are presented for PSH-VEM and SH-VEM, and we compare their convergence to the composite triangle FEM and B-bar VEM on benchmark problems in linear elasticity. The SH-VEM converges optimally in the L 2 L2 norm of the displacement, energy seminorm, and the L 2 L2 norm of hydrostatic stress. Furthermore, the results reveal that PSH-VEM converges in most cases at a faster rate than the expected optimal rate, but it requires the selection of a suitably chosen penalty parameter.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hybrid variational framework for the Virtual Element Method (VEM) is proposed and a family of polygonal elements for plane elasticity is developed. Under specific assumptions, it is proved that the minimization of Total Potential Energy and the projection operation typical of enhanced VEM can be deduced from the stationary condition of the Hellinger–Reissner mixed functional. Since the designed elements can be regarded as either enhanced VEM or hybrid finite elements, they are named as Hybrid Virtual Element Method (HVEM). The primary variables are the displacements along the element boundary and the stress field within the element domain. The assumed stress field is expressed on a polynomial basis that satisfies the divergence-free condition. In the HVEM formulation, stabilization-free elements can be obtained using two concepts, namely hyper-stability and iso-stability . In particular, the iso-stable cases show the best solution in recovering both displacement and stress fields. Several numerical applications are developed, assessing the stability for a single distorted element. The proposed family of HVEM proves to be accurate, also if coarse meshes are used. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed HVEM is demonstrated for typical structural elements, testing the convergence rate and comparing the results with analytic or other numerical solutions.},

  abstract     = {A two-stage form-finding procedure, based on Isogeometric Analysis (IgA), is proposed to determine the configuration of shells having a prescribed planar footprint so as to carry applied loads in a state of purely membrane stresses. The boundary-value problem of a membrane shell is described by Pucher’s equation in terms of Airy stress function, external loads and shell mid-plane elevation. Within the IgA framework, the weak form of the problem is derived and the resulting integral equation is discretised by approximating the relevant fields as a linear combination of control point values and B-Spline basis functions. Taking external loads as input, control point values of the Airy potential are computed via a nonlinear programming (NLP) routine aimed at minimising the thrusts at edge supports while ensuring no-traction membrane stresses fulfilling the relevant boundary conditions. The corresponding shell form is then obtained in terms of control point heights based on the stress field computed at the previous stage. Compared to the traditional practice of manually prescribing the Airy stress function, incorporation of the proposed NLP routine into the present IgA-based form-finding procedure proves to be an effective and versatile tool to assist the designer in computing a suitable Airy stress field able to account for usual static as well as user-defined functional constraints, regardless of the domain geometry complexity. Two numerical examples substantiate the presented approach.},

Unlike conventional models, the new extended model considers the secondary ``solid&#39;&#39; material phase as a type of lattice, enabling adjustment of lattice geometry and mechanical behavior with gradient control variables such as density or size. By means of numerical homogenization and interpolation, we explicitly express the effective mechanical behavior of the gradient lattice in relation to the gradient control variable. This approach enhances design freedom by allowing for flexible control of individual material volumes, and also the lower and upper bounds of gradient variables. By using implicit geometrical modeling techniques, the resulting gradient control variable field can be interpreted to create spatially-varying and smoothly-connected lattices at any arbitrary resolution.

In the 3D-NCDDAM, four-node tetrahedral elements which can be automatally generated are used to discretize the problem domain. To reduce computational cost, and effectively model the failure process of rock masses at concerned regions, the problem domain is devided into two types of regions, namely, the “non-destructive region” and “possible destructive region”. The non-destructive region is mainly used to reduce the boundary effects on the numerical results, and is regarded transitional zone in which the failure of rock masses is not considered. For the possible destructive region, artificial joint elements are inserted, and the failure of these joint elements is used to represent fracture initiation and propagation in rock masses. Additionally, the contact potential which is initially proposed in finite-discrete element method (FDEM) is incorporated into the 3D-NCDDAM to simuate the opening and slipping of discontinuous structural planes involved in rock masses’ failure process. Note that the difficultly in determing contact types in the traditional 3D discontinuous deformation analysis (3D-DDA) method is avoided in the 3D-NCDDAM. The proposed 3D-NCDDAM can be treated as a hybrid method, which inherite both the advantage of DDA method and FDEM. To validate the 3D-NCDDAM, seven numerical examples are conducted. The numerical results indicte that the 3D-NCDDAM can effectively model the failure process of rock masses in both experimental scale and engineering scale.},

In this learning strategy consistent with thermodynamics, the constitutive model is expressed using two potentials (free energy and dissipation potential) which are represented by input-convex neural networks, thus automatically satisfying the principles of thermodynamics. The neural network is trained thanks to an unsupervised procedure that does not rely on strain–stress pairs but needs only partial strain or displacement measurements inside the structure, moreover with uncertain boundary conditions. This method is based on the minimization of the modified Constitutive Relation Error functional, and it extends previous works on this error measure for neural networks to the case of history-dependent behaviors, which requires to design a specific minimization procedure. Given that neural networks for typical structural health monitoring applications often need to be trained online, there is here a significant emphasis placed on automatically and adaptively tuning crucial hyperparameters such as learning rate or weighting between losses. The method is evaluated on elastoplastic and elastoviscoplastic test cases with synthetic data collected from optic fiber or full-field measurements. It is shown that the method can properly learn hidden behaviors, achieves high robustness to noise level, and low sensitivity to user-defined hyperparameters.},

The SBFE-based TO algorithm adopts a bi-evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) approach, which utilizes image/STL-based procedures to automatically adapt meshes and minimize mechanical compliance under varying volume fractions in the time domain. A key advantage of this approach is that it uses images of TO responses, rather than specific error functions, to guide the automatic adaptive mesh schemes. The method also incorporates a quadtree/octree mesh refinement to address the problem of hanging nodes, ensuring fast mesh convergence during the optimization process. Furthermore, a high-order implicit time integration technique provides a close approximation of equivalent static loads, allowing for the accurate mapping of displacement fields under actual dynamic responses at each time step. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical examples and benchmarks.},

Turbulence super-resolution reconstruction is crucial for extracting finer details from irregularly structured, low-resolution measurement data, thereby facilitating comprehensive flow field analyses. This article introduces a sparse learning model (Embedding Restricted Isometry Property Autoencoder (RIP-AE)) for achieving super-resolution reconstruction of flow fields by obtaining compressed representations and sparse transform domain information. In this model, we embed the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition to ensure the effectiveness of compressed representations and sparse transform domains, thereby enhancing the super-resolution reconstruction accuracy of the model. To assess the performance of the RIP-AE model, we utilized data sets of flow around a cylinder at different Reynolds numbers generated by unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. We sequentially validate the effectiveness of the RIP condition at different Reynolds numbers (ranging from 1,000 to 500,000) and compare the reconstruction results of the RIP-AE model with those of the downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale (DSC/MS) and MS-AE models under different sampling ratios. The results indicate that the RIP-AE model excels in terms of L2 relative error and demonstrates the capability to achieve high-precision flow field reconstruction even under high sampling ratios.},

However, it also suffers from imbalanced exploration and exploitation, delayed convergence, and insufficient convergence accuracy in dealing with high-dimensional and complex applications. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes an enhanced Kepler optimization algorithm called CGKOA with stronger performance by combining adaptive function, sinusoidal chaotic gravity, lateral crossover, and elite gold rush strategies. Firstly, the adaptive function and sinusoidal chaotic gravity are adjustments to the internal structure of KOA algorithm, which successfully balances the exploration and exploitation, and increases the population diversity. Secondly, the lateral crossover strategy strengthens the spatial exploration ability of the algorithm, eliminates the poor quality individuals and accelerate the output of high-quality population, and finally, the proposed elite gold rush strategy provides an in-depth and rational exploration of elite groups from multiple perspectives, improves solving accuracy and accelerates the convergence speed. Experimental comparisons of CGKOA with a variety of state-of-the-art and high-performance algorithms on different dimensions of the 2017 and 2020 test sets are conducted, and the experimental results show the superiority and robustness of CGKOA algorithm. In addition, the effectiveness and practicability of CGKOA for real problems are verified by solving 50 complex engineering applications. Last, the algorithm is applied to the difficult problems in the fields of path planning, job-shop scheduling, variant travelers, robot machining trajectory planning, and complex truss topology optimization, and the excellent results obtained by CGKOA demonstrate its applicability and development potential for optimization tasks in various fields. Therefore, CGKOA is an efficient and competitive algorithm for solving complex optimization problems with different dimensions.},

This paper presents a multivariable level set-based topology optimization method for designing GLSs considering the matching of multiple microstructure prototypes. In this method, the basic level set functions (LSFs) of implicit and designable microstructures are constructed using the signed distance function. Multiple sets of LSFs are further developed by introducing weight coefficients to generate GLSs based on the basic LSFs. During optimization, each set of LSFs will generate a sub-GLS corresponding to the pre-defined microstructure prototype. Then, the final GLS containing multiple microstructures is obtained by combining these sub-GLSs through a union operation. Due to the continuity of the multivariable LSF, perfect geometric connections between neighboring graded microstructures are guaranteed without imposing any extra constraints. This work offers a novel strategy to optimize the macroscopic graded pattern of GLSs, resulting in an enlarged design space and performance improvement. Several 2D and 3D examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurate material description is crucial to achieve high-quality results in computational analysis software. Phenomenological constitutive laws generalize the material behaviour observed in simple mechanical tests. The resulting empirical expressions contain parameters that need to be calibrated through an inverse optimization process. Advancements in Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques have enabled the extraction of non-uniform multi-axial displacement fields, facilitating the development of heterogeneous mechanical specimens and unlocking access to richer material behaviour data. Despite these advancements, constitutive models are still limited by mathematical formulations and biases due to simplifying assumptions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), as universal function approximators, could potentially drive a paradigm shift in the field. ANNs do not require explicit pre-formulations, hence avoiding the need for identifying unknown parameters. Moreover, ANNs are able to implicitly learn patterns purely from data, allowing to circumvent the biases induced by the simplifying assumptions of first-order principles. However, the training of ANNs for implicit constitutive modelling is not straightforward, given the impossibility of obtaining direct measurements of stress. This paper explores the integration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) for material modelling. This approach uses global force and displacement data to indirectly train the neural network, with the equilibrium being evaluated globally through the VFM loss function. The proposed method is (i) computationally efficient by not requiring Finite Element Analysis (FEA), (ii) compatible with both full-field measurements and numerically generated data, and (iii) able to handle experimental boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Typical pipelines for model geometry generation in computational biomedicine stem from images, which are usually considered to be at rest and in absence of external stimuli, despite the object being either in mechanical equilibrium under several well-known forces or in a transient state. We refer to the stress-free geometry computation as the inverse elasticity problem (IEP), and in this work we extend such a formulation to the theory of fully nonlinear poroelastic media. The main steps are (i) writing the equations in terms of the reference porosity and (ii) defining a time dependent problem whose steady state solution is the reference porosity. This problem can be computationally challenging as it can require several hundreds of iterations to converge, so we propose the use of Anderson acceleration to speed up this procedure. Our evidence shows that this strategy can reduce the number of iterations up to 80%. In addition, we note that a primal formulation of the nonlinear mass conservation equations is not consistent due to the presence of second order derivatives of the displacement, which we alleviate through adequate mixed formulations. All claims are validated through numerical simulations in both idealized and realistic scenarios.},

The monitoring data can be augmented with numerical modeling results to support treatment-risk assessment. Often, medical images are not suitable for high-fidelity modeling due to their spatial sparsity and low resolution. In this work, we present a workflow that converts a limited number of two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram images into analysis-suitable left-ventricle geometries for isogeometric analysis (IGA). The image data is fitted by reshaping a multi-patch NURBS template. This fitting procedure results in a smooth interpolation with a limited number of degrees of freedom. In addition, a coupled 3D-0D cardiac model is extended with a pre-stressing method to perform ventricular-cardiac-mechanic analyses based on in vivo images. The workflow is benchmarked using population-averaged imaging data, which demonstrates that both the shape of the left ventricle and its mechanical response are well predicted in sparse-data scenarios. The case of a clinical patient is considered to demonstrate the suitability of the workflow in a real-data setting.},

Isosurface extraction is exploited in a series of piecewise-linear interface reconstruction methods to simulate complex interface dynamic problems on arbitrary grids, and high-order surface patches are applied to achieve significantly improved accuracy. Isosurface extraction is also used to choose a convenient set of neighboring cells, hereafter called reconstruction stencil, for the reconstruction of highly curved interfaces when using well-known linearity-preserving methods. The relevance of the proper selection of the reconstruction stencil is highlighted, showing that the convergence of formal second-order methods can deteriorate when inappropriate reconstruction stencils are used.

The locality of the method is achieved through k-means clustering, and the selection of local problems in the online stage is done in the solution space. All hyperparameters of the reduced method, such as the number of clusters or the number of POD modes, are estimated by deterministic criteria. Furthermore, the offline–online splitting strategy for online calculations is explicitly outlined. The method is applied to a single-parameter problem and a two-parameter problem, showing its ability to rapidly compute bifurcation diagrams with small errors.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel quasi-smooth tetrahedral numerical manifold method (NMM) and its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart are proposed. A new topology optimization method is established by combining the quasi-smooth manifold element (QSME) with the parameterized level set method (PLSM). The QSME introduces an innovative displacement function characterized by high accuracy and high-order continuity, effectively addressing the “linear dependence” (LD) issue inherent in traditional high-order NMM. To integrate QSME and PLSM, the corresponding optimization formulations and sensitivity analyses are provided. In order to fully utilize advantages of this novel quasi-smooth NMM and the PLSM, an element subdivision technique based on model recognition is proposed to accurately capture the physical boundaries. Additionally, a volume fraction update method based on element refinement is proposed. Taking advantage of the characteristics of the PLSM, a structure visualization method based on the sign distance function is developed to accurately describe curve boundary. This method allows for precise visualization of optimized structures. This study verifies high efficiency of the QSME-based PLSM for minimum compliance topology optimization problems in both 2D and 3D structures. Some representative structural optimization examples are tested to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method in both 2D and 3D problems, especially in complex design domain.},

A recursive formula is obtained for the interpolation of the rotations. Similar recursive formulas are derived for the spin and the curvature vector, leading to a generalization of the Bézier basis functions on the manifold SO(3). The rod formulation so obtained is invariant under a rigid rotation (objective), in the sense that the patch-test with respect to the rigid body motion is satisfied.

Instead, homogenization and multiscale methods are often used with the composite material replaced by a homogeneous material with the homogenized constitutive law obtained by solving cell-problems representing the mesoscale material structure. For non-linear time-dependent problems, FEM is often used with a time-transient method (TTM) and the solution is obtained one time-step at a time. However, in cases where a steady-state solution is of interest, the multiharmonic method can be faster and more cost effective for the same accuracy of the time discretization. In addition, when solving magnetoquasistatic multiscale problems with TTM, the dynamic hysteresis in the homogenized fields can slow down or even impede the convergence of the macro-scale problem due to the possibly non-continuously differentiable homogenized material laws.

  abstract     = {We determine the material parameters in the relaxed micromorphic generalized continuum model for a given periodic microstructure in this work. This is achieved through a least squares fitting of the total energy of the relaxed micromorphic homogeneous continuum to the total energy of the fully-resolved heterogeneous microstructure, governed by classical linear elasticity. We avoid establishing exact micro–macro transition relations, as in classical homogenization theory, because defining a representative volume element is not feasible in the absence of scale separation, as such an element does not exist. The relaxed micromorphic model is a generalized continuum that utilizes the Curl Curl of a micro-distortion field instead of its full gradient as in the classical micromorphic theory, leading to several advantages and differences. The most crucial advantage is that it operates between two well-defined scales. These scales are determined by linear elasticity with microscopic and macroscopic elasticity tensors, which respectively bound the stiffness of the relaxed micromorphic continuum from above and below. While the macroscopic elasticity tensor is established a priori through standard periodic first-order homogenization, the microscopic elasticity tensor remains to be determined. Additionally, the characteristic length parameter, associated with curvature measurement, controls the transition between the micro- and macro-scales. Both the microscopic elasticity tensor and the characteristic length parameter are here determined using a computational approach based on the least squares fitting of energies. This process involves the consideration of an adequate number of quadratic deformation modes and different specimen sizes. We conduct a comparative analysis between the least square fitting results of the relaxed micromorphic model, the fitting of a skew-symmetric micro-distortion field (Cosserat-micropolar model), and the fitting of the classical micromorphic model with two different formulations for the curvature; one simplified formulation involving only one single characteristic length and a simplified isotropic curvature with three parameters. The relaxed micromorphic model demonstrates good agreement with the fully-resolved heterogeneous solution after optimizing only four parameters. The “simplified” full micromorphic model, which includes isotropic curvature and involves the optimization of seven parameters, does not achieve superior results, while the Cosserat model exhibits the poorest fitting.},

  abstract     = {This paper integrates nonlinear-manifold reduced order models (NM-ROMs) with domain decomposition (DD). NM-ROMs approximate the full order model (FOM) state in a nonlinear-manifold by training a shallow, sparse autoencoder using FOM snapshot data. These NM-ROMs can be advantageous over linear-subspace ROMs (LS-ROMs) for problems with slowly decaying Kolmogorov n n -width. However, the number of NM-ROM parameters that need to be trained scales with the size of the FOM. Moreover, for “extreme-scale” problems, the storage of high-dimensional FOM snapshots alone can make ROM training expensive. To alleviate the training cost, this paper applies DD to the FOM, computes NM-ROMs on each subdomain, and couples them to obtain a global NM-ROM. This approach has several advantages: Subdomain NM-ROMs can be trained in parallel, involve fewer parameters to be trained than global NM-ROMs, require smaller subdomain FOM dimensional training data, and can be tailored to subdomain-specific features of the FOM. The shallow, sparse architecture of the autoencoder used in each subdomain NM-ROM allows application of hyper-reduction (HR), reducing the complexity caused by nonlinearity and yielding computational speedup of the NM-ROM. This paper provides the first application of NM-ROM (with HR) to a DD problem. In particular, this paper details an algebraic DD reformulation of the FOM, training a NM-ROM with HR for each subdomain, and a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver to evaluate the coupled global NM-ROM. Theoretical convergence results for the SQP method and a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the DD NM-ROM with HR are provided. The proposed DD NM-ROM with HR approach is numerically compared to a DD LS-ROM with HR on the 2D steady-state Burgers’ equation, showing an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy of the proposed DD NM-ROM over the DD LS-ROM.},

Computationally, contact introduces challenges in altering the fluid domain topology and preserving stress balance. This work introduces a new mathematical framework for a unified continuum description of fluid-porous-structure-contact interaction (FPSCI), leveraging the Navier–Stokes–Brinkman (NSB) equations to incorporate porous effects within the surface asperities in the contact region. Our approach maintains mechanical consistency during contact, circumventing issues associated with contact models and complex interface coupling conditions, allowing for the modeling of tangential creeping flows due to surface roughness. The unified continuum and variational multiscale formulation ensure robustness by enabling stable and unified integration of fluid, porous, and solid sub-problems. Computational efficiency and ease of implementation – key advantages of our approach – are demonstrated by solving two benchmark problems of a falling ball and an idealized heart valve. This research has broad implications for fields reliant on accurate fluid–structure interactions and promising advancements in modeling and numerical simulation techniques.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time how the Integrated Finite Element Neural Network (I-FENN) framework, previously proposed by the authors [1] , [2] , can efficiently simulate the entire loading history of non-local gradient damage propagation. To achieve this goal, we first adopt a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as the neural network of choice to capture the history-dependent evolution of the non-local strain in a coarsely meshed domain. The quality of the network predictions governs the computational performance of I-FENN, and therefore we perform an extended investigation aimed at enhancing them. We explore a data-driven vs. physics-informed TCN setup to arrive at an optimum network training, evaluating the network based on a coherent set of relevant performance metrics. We address the crucial issue of training a physics-informed network with input data that span vastly different length scales by proposing a systematic way of input normalization and output un-normalization. We then integrate the trained TCN within the nonlinear iterative FEM solver and apply I-FENN to simulate the damage propagation analysis. I-FENN is always applied in mesh idealizations different from the one used for the TCN training, showcasing the framework’s ability to be used at progressively refined mesh resolutions. We illustrate several cases that I-FENN completes the simulation using either a modified or a full Newton–Raphson scheme, and we showcase its computational savings compared to both the classical monolithic and staggered FEM solvers. We underline that we satisfy very strict convergence criteria for every increment across the entire simulation, providing clear evidence of the robustness and accuracy of I-FENN. All the code and data used in this work will be made publicly available upon publication of the article.},

  abstract     = {The increasing application of cardiorespiratory simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning necessitates the development of computational methods significantly faster than the current technology. To achieve this objective, we leverage the time-periodic nature of these flows by discretizing equations in the frequency domain instead of the time domain. This approach markedly reduces the size of the discrete problem and, consequently, the simulation cost. With this motivation, we introduce a finite element method for simulating time-periodic flows that are physically stable. The proposed time-spectral method is formulated by augmenting the baseline Galerkin’s method with a least-squares penalty term that is weighed by a positive-definite stabilization matrix. An error estimate is established for the convective–diffusive system, showing that the proposed method emulates the behavior of existing standard time methods including optimal convergence rate in diffusive regimes and stability in strong convection. This method is tested on a patient-specific Fontan model at nominal Reynolds and Womersley numbers of 500 and 10, respectively, demonstrating its ability to replicate conventional time simulation results using as few as 7 modes at 11% of the computational cost. Owing to its higher local-to-processor computation density, the proposed method also exhibits improved parallel scalability for fast simulation of time-critical applications.},

  abstract     = {The sine–Gordon and Allen–Cahn equations are two typical models in the fields of conservative Hamiltonian systems and dissipative gradient flows, respectively. As the demand for numerical methods that respect intrinsic energy conservation/dissipation laws turns into a fundamental principle, the subsequent computational efficiency is getting more and more desired. Linearly implicit methods, which only require solutions of linear algebraic systems at each time step, have become a popular way to design efficient schemes. However, the overall computational cost of these methods depends heavily on the speed at which the linear system can be solved. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for developing highly efficient energy-conservative or dissipative schemes for the sine–Gordon and Allen–Cahn equations. Our approach is based on spatial finite difference approximations and is fully implicit at first glance, but actually it is completely decoupled point by point, allowing for the implementation of a scalar nonlinear equation successively with a lower complexity that is comparable only to the degrees of freedom. We further establish the connections between our approach and the classic Itoh–Abe discrete gradient and the partitioned averaged vector field methods, and then propose the generalized Itoh–Abe discrete gradient method, which offers great flexibility in the ordering of updating each unknown point. One immediate benefit is that we can specifically choose an ordering to achieve a naturally parallel computation of the resulting scheme, significantly improving the computational efficiency. Various numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes.},

To accurately monitor and forecast the load environment where the structure works can provide guidance for the structural design of aircraft and predict potential structural damage. However, with the development of hypersonic aircraft, the influence of thermal field also cannot be ignored besides external forces that are applied to the structure, thus, there is an urgent need for effective methods to identify both force and thermal loads. In this paper, firstly, A data-driven load identification method and various load identification strategies for the identification of force-thermal load based on Artificial Neural Networks are proposed, and in different loading cases the relative error of identification is less than 5 %, with the training process converging efficiently within a short time; additionally, multi-source uncertainties, including Gaussian white noises and structural uncertainties, are simulated, and their influence on load identification is also evaluated; moreover, sensor placement optimization based on particle swarm optimization is carried out to enhance accuracy of load identification, and the number of sensors and the corresponding optimal placement of sensors are determined, it can be proved via numerical examples that the optimized sensor placement can reduce the error of load identification by more than 90 % of that of a random sensor placement.},

  abstract     = {Despite substantial advancements in optimizing structural designs for stiffness, the field of design against fracture is still in its early stages. This paper introduces a fundamental and standardized paradigm for structural design against brittle fracture, achieved through the minimization of the energy release rate G G within the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). By leveraging the Griffith criterion expression and the total potential energy in LEFM, we propose an efficient approach for structural optimization that enhances the toughness of architected materials. The energy release rate G G is evaluated a synergistic application of finite element analysis and finite difference methods, yielding a precision of 0.6% compared to benchmarks in published handbooks. We demonstrate significantly reduced G G values compared to standard stiffness and stress-oriented topology optimization, which directly contributes to increased toughness. To comprehensively analyze the fracture process encompassing damage, crack initiation, propagation, and failure, we employ post-processing phase field fracture modeling on the optimally designed architected materials. By performing multi-objective optimization of the stiffness and energy release rate G G , the toughness and extreme load-bearing capacity can be simultaneously improved. The resulting perforated architecture effectively outperforms homogeneous structures in both toughness and peak load. Additionally, we extend our analysis to various configurations, such as non-center cracks, pure shear loading, and adherence to the standard 3D compact tension ASTM E-399-72. The designed structures are additively manufactured and experimentally validated, demonstrating a toughness increase of over 10 times compared to stress-based design. These contributions offer promising prospects for advancing the design of future engineering structures and materials with a favorable balance of critical fracture resistance characteristics.},

Through this enhancement, the fluid will be spread within the network through cells lacuna in equilibrium way promoting osteocytes efficiency, growth factor, and paracrine signaling. The complete adaptation of both microarchitecture bone and scaffold in the transition zone is not possible (No technology of micro-manufacturing is available). However, in our model, the initial bone architecture was extracted from micro-CT. We determine then the dominant flow characteristics (flow magnitude, pressure, orientation, and the carried electrical potential) at the transition zone between native tissue and scaffold. We identify the area where we may have many governing flows escaping from bone not matching with scaffold opening pores. We identify as well, the locations of scaffold pores which do not coincide with enough open lacuna in native tissue, compromising the adequate fluid exchange during osteointegration. By identifying regions of low osteogenesis, we provide a customized pores architecture enhancing flow permeability, driving to spread the fluid energy and the streaming generated potential (SGP) to be in adequate locations. The model may be applied also to evaluate the support for cells migration, cells efficiency, proliferation, differentiation, and growth factors spread. We may promote the exchange of nano particles (NP) as well for carrying anti-microbial properties. However, the scaffold can be designed to promote osteogenesis through the transition region. Results, permit a customized bio-graft design, increasing the options of scaffold architectures with customized pores (position, concentration, and size).

The proof is based on an error representation formula using a discrete dual problem and a stability estimate involving the kinetic, elastic, and viscoelastic energies. To set up the dual error analysis and to prove the basic stability estimates, it is natural to formulate the problem as a first-order-in-time system involving evolution equations for the viscoelastic stress, the displacements, and the velocities. The equations for the viscoelastic stress can, however, be solved analytically in terms of the deviatoric strain velocity, and therefore, the viscoelastic stress can be eliminated from the system, resulting in a system for displacements and velocities.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-order homogenization (ROH) and related methods are important computational tools for simulating the material behavior of composites. These methods generally sacrifice accuracy in exchange for superior computational efficiency, relative to methods such as classical computational homogenization (CCH). In this study, building on the recently developed solver-free CCH, we propose a fine-scale solver-free reduced order homogenization approach that avoids solving the fine-scale equilibrium equations and approximates the phase-average eigenstrains by sampling the fine-scale eigenstrain at a small number of points. The proposed method, which we call solver-free ROH, works by pre-computing history-dependent eigenstrain influence function tensors and sampling point contribution factors based on training data from a small set of CCH simulations. Then, during the online stage of the computation, phase-average eigenstrains are computed from sampling point eigenstrains and used to compute homogenized stresses and strains. Focusing on small-deformation problems, this paper formulates and verifies the solver-free ROH approach for nonlinear periodic heterogeneous media. First, in the formulation, we delineate a sampling point approximation of the phase eigenstrains and describe the use of this approximation within the coarse-scale stress update. Next, we verify the solver-free ROH using loading cases outside the training data set. Finally, we use the proposed method to simulate a multilayer composite plate in three point bending (3pt-bend) and open hole tension (OHT), demonstrating the method’s efficiency and accuracy relative to the CCH.},

This paper establishes the novel adaptive schemes for the biharmonic eigenvalue problems and provides a mathematical proof of optimal convergence rates towards a simple eigenvalue and numerical evidence thereof. This makes the suggested algorithm highly competitive and clearly justifies the higher computational and implementational costs compared to low-order nonconforming schemes.

The first contribution of this article is to demonstrate the applicability of the incremental pressure correction scheme for the dynamic evolution of pressure and velocity states. The evolution of a large number of these reduced states in the online stage can be expensive. In contrast, the accuracy significantly decreases if only a few reduced states are considered while not accounting for the interactions between unresolved and resolved states. The second contribution of this article is to compare three closure model forms based on global, modal and tensor artificial viscosity approximation to account for these interactions. The unknown model parameters are determined using two calibration techniques: least squares minimization of error in energy approximation and closure term approximation. This article demonstrates that an appropriate selection of solution methods and data-driven artificial viscosity closure models is essential for consistently accurate dynamics forecasting of incompressible fluid flows.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) have been considerably employed in modeling plate and shell structures, or developing the related size, shape or topology optimization methods for their design. However, the NURBS with the tensor product feature strongly hinders the effectiveness of the optimization on complex structures. The primary intention of the current research is to propose a new T-splines-oriented Isogeometric Topology Optimization (T-ITO) method and then address the critical design problem of plate and shell structures with arbitrary shapes in practical applications. Firstly, the Bézier extraction is utilized in the T-splines to map the geometrical model into a family of Bézier elements, each of which is presented by a local Density Distribution Function (DDF) for elementary topology. A global DDF is constructed by an assembly of all local DDFs with a natural connection to the present structural topology. Secondly, the T-splines-based IsoGeometric Analysis (T-IGA) formulation with the Bézier extraction for complex plate and shell structures is developed using the Kirchhoff-Love theory, where a universal numerical implementation framework is constructed, including the Rhino, MATLAB, export modules with all geometric information and import modules for the analysis. Thirdly, a mathematical formulation for plate and shell structures with arbitrary geometries is developed using the T-ITO method to improve structural loading-capability, and the sensitivity analysis with respect to design variables is rigorously derived in detail. Finally, several numerical examples of plate and shell structures with both regular and elaborate geometries are tested to demonstrate the validity, effectiveness, superiorities and indispensability of the T-ITO method.},

  abstract     = {This study deals with the topology optimization (TO) of linear elastic composite structures considering fundamental natural frequency maximization. The concept of functionally graded structures (FGS) is used for anisotropic composite material structure design to improve the structural dynamic performance. The rational approximation of material properties (RAMP) method was employed as an alternative to the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method to improve the convergence stability for eigen-frequency problem. In the SIMP method, the occurrence of local eigen-modes at low frequencies in the void region causes ill-convergence, whereas the RAMP method prevents local eigen-modes from occurring. The method of moving asymptotes is used as an optimizer. Numerical verification was performed for three structural types: cantilever beam, double-clamped beam, and four-pinned beam structure. In addition, for cantilever beam design, bi-objective optimization for maximizing fundamental natural frequency as well as minimizing structural compliance was performed using the adaptive weighting method that quantitatively reflects the designer&#39;s preference by adjusting the weight for each objective function at each iteration.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a peridynamic (PD) correspondence model with strain gradient elasticity (SGE) to capture size effect on strength of nano- and micro-scale structures. The classical elasticity theory lacking a length scale parameter does not account for the microstructure-dependent size effects. Strain Gradient (SG) elasticity is an extension of the classical elasticity with a length scale parameter(s) which can be linked to the microstructure of the material. Peridynamic theory introduces damage into the constitutive relations in a natural way by allowing for interactions of a material point within its horizon which is referred to as the internal length parameter. The correspondence model of the PD theory permits the incorporation of the constitutive relationship of SG theory. Therefore, the present approach combines the effects of PD and SGE length scale parameters on the stiffness and strength of the material. The resulting equations present two length parameters: the horizon of a material point in PD theory and the characteristic length in SGE theory. The PD equation of motion with SGE (PDSG) is free of spatial derivatives and allows for the imposition of classical and nonclassical boundary conditions. The PDSG is first applied to investigate the deformation response of a one-dimensional nanoscale film subjected to a quasi-static tensile load and a dynamic load through an initial constant strain. The static response is compared with the analytical solution for varying ratio of SG length parameter to PD horizon. The dynamic response is compared with a computational solution while satisfying the nonclassical boundary conditions. Subsequently, the PDSG is applied to study the deformation response of a two-dimensional nanoscale film subjected to a quasi-static axial load and a specified tangential end displacement. These two cases are considered under special displacement constraints to compare with the available analytical solutions. Subsequently, a two-dimensional nanoscale film with or without an internal crack is subjected to uniform tensile loading. Finally, crack propagation is simulated under incremental displacement loading. The results capture the analytical predictions and the expected increase in stiffness with increasing ratio of SG length parameter to PD horizon.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a novel phase-field solution for simulating and predicting fractures in elastic solids. In this phase-field fracture model, the crack growth is driven by the material energy–momentum flux, or the configurational force, inspired by a null divergence conservation law and its variational theory, as opposed to employing the commonly-used strain energy degradation-based crack-driving force. By doing so, the crack growth or material configuration change is solely determined by the physics-based Eshelby energy–momentum tensor density or the Rice J-integral flux, which aligns with the energy release criterion of the celebrated Griffith–Eshelby–Rice (GER) theory. The proposed method not only preserves the integrity of the balance of linear momentum principle at the crack tip region but also provides a correct stress asymptotic field in front of the crack tip, while accurately capturing the crack growth. The key idea of this approach is to use the monotonically increasing and irreversible phase field as the marker of the configurational change and form a phase field variational principle that couples the strain energy density with the configurational strain energy density. By doing so, we only damage the displacement field as a form of diffused crack, as opposed to damaging the stress field in the existing phase-field method. Moreover, from numerical simulations, we discovered two different forms of energy release rates: one drives crack growth by enforcing the crack-tip traction loading condition, and one drives crack growth by enforcing the crack-tip deformation condition, demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to naturally capture two distinct modes of fractures due to two different near-crack tip loading conditions. These advancements and contributions reveal previously unknown insights into fracture mechanics.},

  abstract     = {The remodelling process in bones is closely related to electromechanical phenomena. In addition to streaming potentials and piezoelectricity, flexoelectricity has been found to serve as an initiator for remodelling in cortical bone. Since flexoelectricity is coupled to strain gradients, the effect is size-dependent and, accordingly, most relevant on small scales. This means that particularly microcracks which occur in the mechanically loaded bone under daily activity, are healed in response to flexoelectric initiation. More specifically speaking, flexoelectricity induces electric fields in the vicinity of such microcracks and thereby causes osteocyte apoptosis which is a pivotal event in the process of bone remodelling. Since experiments on such small scales are difficult to conduct, a numerical framework is established in this contribution which captures the flexoelectric initiation of bone remodelling as well as the remodelling process itself, including bone cell diffusion and progressive crack closure through surface growth. Due to the higher-order PDEs that result from the incorporation of flexoelectricity, a globally C 1 C1 -continuous isogeometric analysis framework is adopted for the initiation process, whereas a classic finite element approach is proposed for the subsequent diffusion and growth processes. This framework is applied to a cortical bone sample with a narrow microcrack subject to mechanical loading. Growth is coupled to the activity of osteoblasts and incorporated numerically by a moving mesh algorithm. It is shown that the proposed framework can capture the entire process of cortical bone remodelling from its initiation until the successive healing of the microcrack.},

  abstract     = {We make use of linear plane curved Timoshenko rods as a model problem to study how to overcome shear and membrane locking in NURBS-based discretizations. In this work, we propose lumped-assumed-strain (LAS) elements, a projection-based assumed-strain treatment that removes shear and membrane locking for a very broad range of slenderness ratios. For a NURBS patch with basis functions of degree p and C p − 1 continuity across element boundaries, the space of the assumed strains is defined on a B-spline patch with the same elements, but using basis functions of degree p − 1 and C p − 2 continuity across element boundaries. The assumed strains are obtained by performing a L 2 projection of the compatible strains at the patch level in which the consistent mass matrix is substituted with the lumped mass matrix. Our numerical investigations suggest that LAS elements need either the same or slightly finer mesh resolutions than B ̄ elements in order for the relative errors in L 2 norm of the unknowns and the stress resultants to be all below 1%. However, LAS elements are significantly more computationally efficient than B ̄ elements for a given mesh. The use of C 1 -continuous quadratic LAS elements with 2 Gauss–Legendre quadrature points per element exhibit superconvergence of the stress resultants for most slenderness ratios, making it a particularly cost-effective choice of obtaining accurate results. When compared with linear Lagrange B ̄ elements with 2 Gauss–Legendre quadrature points per element, C 1 -continuous quadratic LAS elements with 2 Gauss–Legendre quadrature points per element require far fewer elements in order to obtain relative errors in L 2 norm of the unknowns and the stress resultants smaller than 1%.},

The resulting coupled differential equations are solved using a staggered iteration scheme. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the phase-field model, an adaptive refinement scheme is introduced. This scheme utilizes an artificial threshold that takes into consideration of both phase-field variables and cumulative fatigue history field variables to determine the elements to be refined. The handling of the hanging nodes resulting from mesh refinement is accomplished through the application of the variable-node element technique, offering a flexible and efficient mesh integration technique. We validate our proposed numerical scheme through five representative numerical examples: single-edge cracked specimen, compact tension specimen, double-edge cracked panel, plate with a hole and plate with multi-cracks and hole. The results demonstrate that the adaptive mesh refinement scheme significantly reduces computational costs without compromising the accuracy of the numerical predictions.},

This review addresses multiscale computational models based on representative volume elements (RVEs), which constitute an excellent tool for studying this micro–macro relationship. First, a comprehensive discussion on arterial biomechanics with emphasis on microstructural aspects is presented to underpin the subsequent discussion of RVE-based models and examine their geometrical, constitutive and kinematic assumptions. Second, a series of selected results is then presented to highlight the predictive and descriptive capabilities of the models. Finally, some directions for future work are suggested.},

  abstract     = {The Artificial Rabbit Optimization (ARO) algorithm has been proposed as an effective metaheuristic optimization approach in recent years. However, the ARO algorithm exhibits shortcomings in certain cases, including inefficient search, slow convergence, and vulnerability to local optima. To address these issues, this paper introduces a multi-strategy improved Artificial Rabbit Optimization (IARO) algorithm. Firstly, in the enhanced search strategy, we propose integrating the centroid guidance mechanism and elite guidance mechanism with the greedy strategy to update the position during the exploration phase. Additionally, the Levy flight strategy integrated with self-learning, is employed to update the position during the development phase to improve convergence speed and prevent falling into local optima. Secondly, the algorithm incorporates a per-dimension mirror boundary control strategy to map individuals exceeding the boundary back within the boundary back inside the boundary. This boundary control strategy ensures the algorithm operates within bounds and enhances convergence speed. Finally, within the survival of the fittest strategy, an adaptive factor is introduced to gradually enhance the population&#39;s overall adaptability. This factor regulates the balance between exploration and exploitation, allowing the algorithm to fully explore the search space and improve its robustness. To substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed IARO algorithm, a rigorous and systematic verification analysis was undertaken. Comparative experiments for qualitative and quantitative analysis were conducted on three benchmark test sets, namely CEC2017, CEC2020, and CEC2022. The analysis results, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, consistently demonstrates that this improved algorithm outperforms ARO and other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms comprehensively. Finally, the feasibility of the IARO algorithm has been verified in seven classical constrained engineering problems.},

This neural operator provides a forward model in the form of state-based peridynamics, with objectivity and momentum balance laws automatically guaranteed. As applications, we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in learning complex material behaviors from both synthetic and experimental data sets. We also compare the performances with baseline models that use predefined constitutive laws. We show that, owing to its ability to capture complex responses, our learned neural operator achieves improved accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, by preserving the essential physical laws within the neural network architecture, the PNO is robust in treating noisy data. The method shows generalizability to different domain configurations, external loadings, and discretizations.},

The first formulation, which is the general one, is prone to the curse of dimensionality. The second one separates dimensions in the NURBS domain and allows saving computational time and resources. The optimisation process consists of three steps, which are solved sequentially. Each step is characterised by different design variables and solving strategies. The gradient of the cost function, for both formulations and for each optimisation step, is derived analytically by exploiting the properties of NURBS entities, hence enhancing computational efficiency and accuracy. One of the main features of the presented methodology lies the incorporation of a smoothing term in the problem formulation. This term plays a crucial role in controlling overfitting phenomenon and attenuating local oscillations within the dataset. These oscillations may be due to various sources, such as inherent noise, model instabilities, measurement uncertainties, or numerical precision limitations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on both analytical benchmark problems and real-world engineering problems taken from the literature.},

  abstract     = {Tissue scaffolds have emerged as a promising solution for treatment of critical size bone defects, offering significant advantages over conventional strategies. One of the key functionalities of bone scaffolds is their ability to promote long-term bone ingrowth effectively. To enhance this functionality, we develop a novel dynamic optimisation framework to customise bone scaffolds for achieving maximum bone ingrowth outcomes over a certain period in this study. To improve the design efficiency, we extensively leverage machine learning (ML) techniques within our proposed dynamic optimisation framework. Specifically, two neural networks are integrated into a dynamic bone growth model, and another neural network is coupled with a genetic algorithm for dynamic optimisation process. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach, we employ a sheep mandible reconstruction for treating a critical size bone defect as an illustraive example. To validate the finite element (FE) model established, we first conduct a mechanical test on the sheep mandible assembled with a tailored 3D printed scaffold made of Polyetherketone (PEK) material. Then, we compare three different optimisation schemes, namely uniform design, lateral gradient design, and vertical gradient design, with an empirical design under the same biomechanical conditions. A 18.5 % enhancement is found in the long-term bone ingrowth when the optimised scaffold is adopted in comparison with the empirical design, which is attributed to the fine-tuning of strut sizes within lattice scaffold structures for facilitating bone regeneration in the gradient regions. This study proposes a novel design framework by combining ML and time-dependent topology optimisation, which provides a new methodology for developing innovative tissue scaffolds with better clinical outcomes.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, the applicability of physics-augmented neural network (PANN) constitutive models for complex electro-elastic finite element analysis is demonstrated. For the investigations, PANN models for electro-elastic material behavior at finite deformations are calibrated to different synthetically generated datasets describing the constitutive response of dielectric elastomers. These include an analytical isotropic potential, a homogenised rank-one laminate, and a homogenised metamaterial with a spherical inclusion. Subsequently, boundary value problems inspired by engineering applications of composite electro-elastic materials are considered. Scenarios with large electrically induced deformations and instabilities are particularly challenging and thus necessitate extensive investigations of the PANN constitutive models in the context of finite element analyses. First of all, an excellent prediction quality of the model is required for very general load cases occurring in the simulation. Furthermore, simulation of large deformations and instabilities poses challenges on the stability of the numerical solver, which is closely related to the constitutive model. In all cases studied, the PANN models yield excellent prediction qualities and a stable numerical behavior even in highly nonlinear scenarios. This can be traced back to the PANN models excellent performance in learning both the first and second derivatives of the ground truth electro-elastic potentials, even though it is only calibrated on the first derivatives. Overall, this work demonstrates the applicability of PANN constitutive models for the efficient and robust simulation of engineering applications of composite electro-elastic materials.},

Whereas the VPINN’s loss depends upon the selected basis functions of a given test space, herein, we minimize a loss based on the discrete dual norm of the residual. The main advantage of such a loss definition is that it provides a reliable and efficient estimator of the true error in the energy norm under the assumption of the existence of a local Fortin operator. We test the performance and robustness of our algorithm in several advection–diffusion problems. These numerical results perfectly align with our theoretical findings, showing that our estimates are sharp.},

  abstract     = {Many applications demand tunable structural responses through tailored organic microstructural distributions and spatially varied material properties. Notable progress has been made in discovering optimized designs using periodic material patterns and fixed material phases to achieve unusual structural responses. To enable the capability of exploring non-periodic material architectures with continuous material phase design space, we propose a topology optimization methodology that leverages a virtual growth rule for designing unique multiscale structures with tunable responses and irregular architectures, while naturally ensuring manufacturability. Our approach exploits the virtual growth algorithm to create a material database, delineating constitutive relations between the homogeneous frequency hints of building blocks responsible for generating microstructures and the resultant homogenized microstructural elasticity tensors. We then employ a neural network to yield a continuous and differentiable constitutive relation. Subsequently, a topology optimization framework is introduced to optimize both the macroscale material layout and the local frequency hints for building block distribution. Finally, we generalize the virtual growth algorithm to account for optimized heterogeneous frequency hints and grow irregular yet optimized structures at the microscale. We present four examples to showcase our proposed approach in programming several types of responses, including displacement cloaking, tunable strain energy density, and global structural stiffness, in both two and three dimensions. The optimized multiscale structures, characterized by their stochastic and irregular architectures, demonstrate programmed responses that closely match the desired targets. These structures also ensure microstructural connectivity and offer the flexibility to select building blocks with guaranteed minimal features. Consequently, we leverage such connectivity and minimal features to manifest the manufacturability of the optimized structures by 3D printing. Our proposed computational strategy, which precisely realizes programmed structural responses in multiscale structures with irregular architectures and facilitates manufacturing feasibility, can be beneficial for applications that prioritize structures exemplifying disorderedness, non-uniformity, and heterogeneity.},

The variable trajectory constraints are distributed in the design domain and are uniformly modeled by nonlinear spring model. Each of the variable trajectory constraints has an active or inactive state and different states map various mechanical properties of the nonlinear springs. The nonlinear relation between force and displacement of the spring is formulated. A new group of design variables denoting the states of the springs is introduced into the traditional density-based topology optimization model. The design variables representing the element density of the continuum structure and the states of the variable trajectory constraints are uniformly penalized to avoid intermediate values in order to obtain a physically realizable mechanism. Sensitivity analysis is performed by the adjoint equation method. To demonstrate the versatility and the generality of the proposed method, the typical numerical examples including linear, spline and circular trajectory constraints were implemented. The numerical comparisons between the nonlinear spring model and the actual trajectory constraints verify the accuracy. The proposed method expands the application of topology optimization and can be extensively employed to design the mechanisms integrating both the compliant members and rigid parts.},

Additionally, curved geometry and large deformations can induce an interlayer thickness strain affecting the overall response of the laminate. This work presents a rotation-free Total Lagrangian large deformation curved shell model to accurately capture such a structural response. Each stiff layer is modeled as a Kirchhoff–Love shell. Without additional DOFs, each soft interlayer is modeled as a solid-shell by expressing, in finite kinematics, the displacement of top and bottom interfaces as a function of the mid-surface displacement of the upper and lower stiff layers it couples. The model is characterized by a sparse stiffness matrix compared to high-order theories and requires a small number of DOFs (3 per stiff layer) to reproduce the 3D solution. A NURBS discretization meets the high continuity of the weak form with a patch-wise reduced quadrature to avoid locking and enhance efficiency. All thickness integrals are pre-computed just once.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel methodology based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving systems of partial differential equations admitting discontinuous solutions. Our method, called Gradient-Annihilated PINNs (GA-PINNs), introduces a modified loss function that forces the model to partially ignore high-gradients in the physical variables, achieved by introducing a suitable weighting function. The method relies on a set of hyperparameters that control how gradients are treated in the physical loss. The performance of our methodology is demonstrated by solving Riemann problems in special relativistic hydrodynamics, extending earlier studies with PINNs in the context of the classical Euler equations. The solutions obtained with the GA-PINN model correctly describe the propagation speeds of discontinuities and sharply capture the associated jumps. We use the relative l 2 l2 error to compare our results with the exact solution of special relativistic Riemann problems, used as the reference “ground truth”, and with the corresponding error obtained with a second-order, central, shock-capturing scheme. In all problems investigated, the accuracy reached by the GA-PINN model is comparable to that obtained with a shock-capturing scheme, achieving a performance superior to that of the baseline PINN algorithm in general. An additional benefit worth stressing is that our PINN-based approach sidesteps the costly recovery of the primitive variables from the state vector of conserved variables, a well-known drawback of grid-based solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations. Due to its inherent generality and its ability to handle steep gradients, the GA-PINN methodology discussed in this paper could be a valuable tool to model relativistic flows in astrophysics and particle physics, characterized by the prevalence of discontinuous solutions.},

  abstract     = {One possibility to utilize excess energy from electricity generation or other industrial processes is to use thermal energy storage systems based on phase change materials (PCM). These systems can accumulate and release significant amounts of heat energy during the phase transitions. The volume and properties of PCM undergo rapid changes during the transitions, creating strong physical non-linearities and geometric discontinuities. Describing this complexity with local formulations of the physical processes, i.e., formulations with differential equations, makes the numerical solutions of the corresponding problems challenging. This paper presents a numerical approach for the analysis of such physically complicated systems based on Peridynamics. The approach is illustrated by modelling and analysing the thermal behaviour of a PCM. The computational challenges associated with simulating composite structures with large differences in the heat conductivity of their components are addressed by investigating the influence of different types of peridynamic kernels and their numerical implementation. The results demonstrate that the solution is significantly influenced by the definition of the average thermal conductivity of the peridynamic bonds. The proposed modelling framework provides the base for developing a precise thermo-hydro-mechanical description of PCM composites that can fully represent the complex physical behaviour of thermal energy storage systems.},

This was considered in the paper (Li et al. 2023), and we extend the methodology by improving the analysis to be in the L 2 L2 norm instead of a weighted H 1 H1 norm where the weight depended on the coarse mesh width, and to the case of noisy measurement data. For noisy measurement data, we prove that the CDA-Picard method is stable and convergent, up to the size of the noise. Numerical tests illustrate the results, and show that a very good strategy when using noisy data is to use CDA-Picard to generate an initial guess for the classical Newton iteration.},

The reliability-oriented sequential experimental design is framed as a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP), with the associated utility function defined by a measure of epistemic uncertainty about Kriging-estimated failure probability, referred to as integrated probability of misclassification (IPM). On this basis, a one-step Bayes optimal learning function termed integrated probability of misclassification reduction (IPMR), along with a compatible convergence criterion, is defined. Three effective strategies are implemented to accelerate IPMR-informed sequential experimental design: (i) Analytical derivation of the inner expectation in IPMR, simplifying it to a single expectation. (ii) Substitution of IPMR with its upper bound IPMR U IPMRU to avoid element-wise computation of its integrand. (iii) Rational pruning of both quadrature set and candidate pool in IPMR U IPMRU to alleviate computer memory constraint. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two benchmark examples and two numerical examples. Results indicate that IPMR U IPMRU facilitates a much more rapid reduction of IPM compared to other existing learning functions, while requiring much less computational time than IPMR IPMR itself. Therefore, the proposed reliability method offers a substantial advantage in both computational efficiency and accuracy, especially in complex dynamic reliability problems.},

The techniques of centroidal Voronoi tessellation and polytree decomposition are adopted to discretize the computational domains and efficiently refine the potential cracking areas in a multi-level manner. This allows fast transition of the mesh density and direct elimination of the hanging-node issue using the CSFEM. To calculate the displacements and the damage variables, only Wachspress shape functions and boundary geometries are needed, eliminating the need for coordinate mapping and Jacobian inversion. For each CSFEM subcell, crack-driving forces are determined at the integration point and stored as history variables. Typical concrete structures under different loading conditions are validated with respect to the crack path and load-carrying capacity, exhibiting good coarse-mesh accuracy. A mesoscale test-piece under uniaxial tension is also modelled using the developed framework, showing significant computational efficiency when compared to the conventional FEM.},

  abstract     = {The stochastic isogeometric analysis (SIGA) based on random geometric methods plays a crucial role in structural random analysis. However, existing intrusive SIGA methods suffer from limitations of low applicability or efficiency. On the other hand, current material uncertainties are mostly limited to low dimensions and often ignore spatial correlations. Therefore, we propose an efficient and adaptive nested non-intrusive SIGA method based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). This method combines quasi-Monte Carlo simulation (QMCS) to achieve a general solution for high-dimensional material uncertainty in porous functionally graded materials (PFGM) plates, including statistical quantities and probability density functions (PDFs) of random responses. Firstly, within the IGA framework, we establish a geometrically nonlinear model for PFGM plates using HSDT and Von Kármán strain-displacement relations, effectively mitigating shear locking effects. Secondly, by considering spatial correlations, we employ the Karhunen-Loève expansion to establish a high-order random field for material uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose a nested and non-intrusive response surface analysis method using RBFNN, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of SIGA in addressing high-dimensional uncertainty problems. Finally, by leveraging the efficiency of SIGA, we overcome the low convergence speed drawback of QMCS, achieving a comprehensive solution for statistical quantities and PDFs of high-dimensional uncertainty problems. The advantages of efficiency and accuracy are validated through random response analysis of high-dimensional uncertain PFGM plates. In randomly structured geometrically nonlinear PFGM plates, porosity significantly influences the response, while the gradient exponent and Young&#39;s modulus have a weaker but non-negligible impact on the response.},

  abstract     = {Mesh degeneration is a bottleneck for fluid–structure interaction (FSI) simulations and for shape optimization via the method of mappings. In both cases, an appropriate mesh motion technique is required. The choice is typically based on heuristics, e.g., the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDE), such as the Laplace or biharmonic equation. Especially the latter, which shows good numerical performance for large displacements, is expensive. Moreover, from a continuous perspective, choosing the mesh motion technique is to a certain extent arbitrary and has no influence on the physically relevant quantities. Therefore, we consider approaches inspired by machine learning. We present a hybrid PDE-NN approach, where the neural network (NN) serves as parameterization of a coefficient in a second order nonlinear PDE. We ensure existence of solutions for the nonlinear PDE by the choice of the neural network architecture. Moreover, we present an approach where a neural network corrects the harmonic extension such that the boundary displacement is not changed. In order to avoid technical difficulties in coupling finite element and machine learning software, we work with a splitting of the monolithic FSI system into three smaller subsystems. This allows to solve the mesh motion equation in a separate step. We assess the quality of the learned mesh motion technique by applying it to a FSI benchmark problem. In addition, we discuss generalizability and computational cost of the learned mesh motion operators.},

  abstract     = {Higher-order two-way electromechanical coupling between strain gradients and electric field, known as flexoelectricity, has a strong influence on the micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices characterization as it is highly pronounced on smaller scales. Flexoelectricity in dielectrics and piezoelectrics has been well analyzed recently, however, its influence on the behavior of ferroelectric materials has not been explored yet. On the one hand, the current study can be seen as an expansion of ferroelectric material behavior towards higher-order electromechanical coupling. On the other hand, it can be treated as an advancement of flexoelectricity to non-linear material behavior, including inherent residual stresses and polarization. Either way of thinking is equally justified and leads to a substantial advancement in material modeling that incorporates small scales and strong electromechanical loading that drives the ceramics out of the linear response domain. For the numerical implementation, the mixed FEM is successfully employed. This involves the formulation from scratch of a three-dimensional mixed FE for flexoelectricity in dielectrics/piezoelectrics. After its successful verification, the micromechanical ferroelectric switching model is additionally implemented into the mixed FE. Initial investigations involve single and polycrystalline representative volume element simulations, which enable the analysis of the altered hysteresis loops. Following this, novel simulations of the truncated pyramid problem for flexoelectricity + ferroelectricity are performed. The introduced fully coupled, multi-scale, mixed FEM-based electromechanical model brings insights into the combined impact of the first-order nonlinear (ferroelectricity) and higher-order (flexoelectricity) responses.},

Since the lack of information outside the measurement zone prevents identifying properties in this area, many multi-scale identification methods require at least two scales measurements. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a multi-scale inverse identification strategy based on the principles of the Modified Constitutive Relation Error (M-CRE) using micro-scale full-field measurement. The basic idea is to construct mechanical fields and material parameters that are a trade-off between all available information, but with no further hypothesis. Two coupling schemes are proposed between the scales, and the reliability of the coupling equations is studied. We apply two steps to validate the multi-scale approach on numerical examples. Furthermore, the study of the measurement zone size effect and noise effect on the tension test illustrate the robustness of this multi-scale approach.},

Since these processes are massively influenced by the underlying heterogeneity of the material, discrete modeling of the lower-scale features strongly improves the simulation results. At the same time, the computational effort is greatly increased. We therefore propose here a mesomechanical simulation approach which is efficient in terms of model generation and computational efforts even for large 3d models. Furthermore, it is robust by limiting the application of computationally less efficient cohesive zone elements to the weak transition boundary between matrix and inclusions. Intermatrix failure is considered by a smeared crack approach and element removal after a certain crack opening has been reached. We apply an improved version of the widely used RHT concrete model, which is enhanced with a principal stress criterion. The resulting approach leads to an accurate replication of experiments in terms of crack propagation and stress wave induced dynamic fragmentation.},

A novel nonlocal hybrid model (NHM) based on the Hoek-Brown criterion is proposed to characterize the combined elasto-plastic and fracture behaviors of rock-like materials. The proposed model couples the non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSBPD) method and the nonlocal differential operator method to eliminate the surface effect due to the incomplete integral region near the boundary, and to simplify the imposition of boundary conditions. A plastic constitutive model with the well-known Hoek-Brown criterion is integrated within this framework to accurately represent the nonlinear behavior of rock-like materials. Strain-softening and fracture criteria, based on the equivalent plastic strain, capture the elasto-plastic response and damage-fracture processes in rock. The dynamic relaxation method is combined with the return mapping method to address quasi-static nonlinear problems. The proposed model is verified by comparing its results with those from the Finite Element Method (FEM), as well as with experimental data from the literature. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed model captures well the entire elasto-plastic fracture process for rock-like materials, including elasto-plastic deformations, crack propagation and progressive failure.},

  abstract     = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have proven effective in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), especially when some data are available by seamlessly blending data and physics. However, extending PINNs to high-dimensional and even high-order PDEs encounters significant challenges due to the computational cost associated with automatic differentiation in the residual loss function calculation. Herein, we address the limitations of PINNs in handling high-dimensional and high-order PDEs by introducing the Hutchinson Trace Estimation (HTE) method. Starting with the second-order high-dimensional PDEs, which are ubiquitous in scientific computing, HTE is applied to transform the calculation of the entire Hessian matrix into a Hessian vector product (HVP). This approach not only alleviates the computational bottleneck via Taylor-mode automatic differentiation but also significantly reduces memory consumption from the Hessian matrix to an HVP’s scalar output. We further showcase HTE’s convergence to the original PINN loss and its unbiased behavior under specific conditions. Comparisons with the Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent (SDGD) highlight the distinct advantages of HTE, particularly in scenarios with significant variability and variance among dimensions. We further extend the application of HTE to higher-order and higher-dimensional PDEs, specifically addressing the biharmonic equation. By employing tensor-vector products (TVP), HTE efficiently computes the colossal tensor associated with the fourth-order high-dimensional biharmonic equation, saving memory and enabling rapid computation. The effectiveness of HTE is illustrated through experimental setups, demonstrating comparable convergence rates with SDGD under memory and speed constraints. Additionally, HTE proves valuable in accelerating the Gradient-Enhanced PINN (gPINN) version as well as the Biharmonic equation. Overall, HTE opens up a new capability in scientific machine learning for tackling high-order and high-dimensional PDEs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-scale simulations can be accelerated by substituting the meso-scale problem resolution by a surrogate trained from off-line simulations. In the context of history-dependent materials, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have widely been considered to act as such a surrogate, since their hidden variables allow for a memory effect. However, defining a data-set for the training, which virtually covers all the possible strain–stress state evolution encountered during the online phase, remains a daunting task. This is particularly true in the case in which the strain increment size is expected to vary by several orders of magnitude. Self-Consistent recurrent networks were thus introduced by Bonatti and Mohr (2022) to reinforce the self-consistency of the neural network with respect to the input increment size when acting as a surrogate of an elasto-plastic material model. When designing RNN to act as a surrogate of a meso-scale Boundary Value Problem (BVP) defined by a Representative Volume Element (RVE) of complex micro-structures, the number of learnable parameters required for existing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to be accurate could remain high, impeding the training performance. In this work, we revisit and design alternative self-consistent recurrent units in order to limit the number of hidden variables required for the neural network to act as a composite material surrogate in multi-scale simulations. Although the RNNs based on the newly suggested self-consistency reinforced recurrent units have a reduced number of learnable parameters yielding good training performance, they remain accurate in the context of multi-scale simulations considering various strain increment sizes.},

Translating microstructural details to macro-level mechanical properties often proves to be an arduous challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based framework to predict 3D material stress fields, mechanical behavior, and progressive damage in ceramic materials informed by the microstructural features of the material. We construct a dataset of synthetic representative volume elements utilizing X-ray computed tomography scans and employ an automated finite element (FE) modeling approach to generate datasets of alumina ceramics with varying inclusion morphologies. The deep learning model, a U-Net based convolutional neural network (CNN), is trained to understand the structure-property linkages and mechanical responses directly from FE-generated data without transforming them into image format. The CNN&#39;s architecture is optimized for capturing both local and global contextual information from the microstructural data, enabling accurate prediction of stress fields and damage evolution. Inclusions within the material are shown to play a crucial role in the initiation and propagation of damage. The CNN model demonstrated robust performance in predicting the stress field, stress-strain curve, and progressive damage curve, with training and test data both showing high and consistent similarity between predictions and the ground truth. Overall, this research offers a generalized approach that can be adapted for different materials and structures toward creating efficient and accurate digital replicas for optimizing material performance in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {This work evaluates the benefits of using the Anderson acceleration method in a finite volume context to solve convective-dominant power-law non-Newtonian fluid flows. We use a pressure-correction fractional step approach adapted to the finite volume method as a segregation strategy with the Picard linearization scheme. We evaluate the accuracy and performance of the Anderson method when we use TVD and non-TVD convective schemes. The work emphasizes algorithmic and programming aspects. We conduct several numerical tests to support the findings and evaluate the sensitivity of the methods concerning numerical parameters. First, we evaluate the convective schemes when solving two problems with analytical solutions to validate the implementation and accuracy. Subsequently, we use the Anderson acceleration method to solve the square lid-driven cavity flow problem for a steady case defined by Re = 7500 =7500 and for unsteady solutions defined by Re = 10 , 000 =10,000 and 20,000. In this case, we analyze the robustness and performance of the schemes when solving nonlinear convection-dominant flows. Finally, we solve the lid-driven cavity flow problem for power-law fluids of shear-thinning and shear-thickening behavior defined by a power-law index n = 0 . 5 n=0.5 and n = 1 . 5 n=1.5 . In this last case, we resolve a steady flow defined by Re = = 5000, and then, we evaluate the methods to approximate unsteady solutions defined by Re = = 15,000 with n = 0 . 5 n=0.5 and Re = = 25,000 with n = 1 . 5 n=1.5 . As the most important result, we reduce the number of nonlinear iterations using Anderson by 91.6% in the steady case and 79.9% in the time-dependent one in the Newtonian case. In the case of shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids, the nonlinear iterations were reduced up to 49.7% and 64.3% when using acceleration in an unsteady, highly convective flow.},

  abstract     = {An in-depth understanding of the time-dependent deformation and failure behavior of rocks is essential for the long-term stability of surrounding rock mass around underground engineering. In this paper, the kinematic-constraint-inspired non-ordinary state-based peridynamic (KC NOSBPD) formulation is proposed to incorporate time dependence by adopting a fractional viscoelastic-viscoplastic (FVEVP) constitutive law to describe the non-linear creep deformation behavior and conjugating it with a time-independent progressive damage-rupture criterion to reproduce creep damage and subsequent creep fracture process. The FVEVP constitutive model is established by coupling a Hooke body, an Abel dashpot and a fractional viscoplastic body. Through the Grünwald-Letnikov (GL) definition of the fractional-order derivatives, finite increment formulations for the FVEVP constitutive model are derived to facilitate numerical implementation by an explicit time integration scheme. The unified progressive damage-rupture criterion is obtained by combining the damage criterion with the rupture criterion via a strain-dependent isotropic scalar damage variable. The novel model is employed to reproduce the time-dependent deformation and fracturing behaviors of intact salt rock, macrofractured sandstone specimens, and surrounding rock mass around the salt cavern gas storage. The proposed model agrees well with experimental data and numerical results from other published literature. To the authors’ knowledge, the FVEVP model is first developed to simulate fracture behaviors.},

The approach is simple, and requires no additional dofs and no static condensation. It does not increase the bandwidth of the tangent matrix and is effective for both linear and nonlinear problems. It combines isogeometric surface discretizations with classical Lagrange-based surface discretizations, and can thus be run with existing isogeometric finite element codes. Also, the stresses can be recovered straightforwardly. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in alleviating, if not eliminating, membrane locking is demonstrated through the rigorous study of the convergence behavior of several classical benchmark problems. Accuracy gains are particularly large in the membrane stresses. The approach is formulated here for quadratic NURBS, but an extension to other discretization types can be anticipated. The same applies to other constraints and associated locking phenomena.},

In this paper, we develop a high-order space–time parallel computing method for solving the Navier–Stokes equations. The method is based on revisionist integral deferred correction (RIDC) algorithm proposed by Christlieb, Macdonald and Ong [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 32 (2010), pp. 818-835]. This parallel-in-time algorithm yields high-order accurate results within a wall-clock time comparable to that of a forward or backward Euler simulation. We extend the RIDC algorithm to a space–time parallel method and apply the method to a compressible fluid solver using the message passing interface (MPI) framework. The global communicator is split into space and time communicators to manage parallel computing in spatial and temporal domains, respectively. Accuracy tests show that the method is high-order accurate. Numerical results encompassing both smooth flows and flows with discontinuities demonstrate that the proposed method can accelerate the computation robustly. Additionally, a three-dimensional space–time parallel computation of flow around a sphere is performed. The results indicate that RIDC has the potential to be used in the field of computational fluid dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a Tucker tensor cross approximation method that constructs a low-rank representation of a d d -dimensional tensor by sparsely sampling its fibers. These fibers are selected using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Our proposed algorithm is referred to as DEIM fiber sampling ( DEIM-FS ). For a rank- r r approximation of an O ( N d ) O(Nd) tensor, DEIM-FS requires access to only d N r d − 1 dNrd−1 tensor entries, a requirement that scales linearly with the tensor size along each mode. We demonstrate that DEIM-FS achieves an approximation accuracy close to the Tucker-tensor approximation obtained via higher-order singular value decomposition at a significantly reduced cost. We also present DEIM-FS (iterative) that does not require access to singular vectors of the target tensor unfolding and can be viewed as a black-box Tucker tensor algorithm. We employ DEIM-FS to reduce the computational cost associated with solving nonlinear tensor differential equations (TDEs) using dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA). The computational cost of solving DLRA equations can become prohibitive when the exact rank of the right-hand side tensor is large. This issue arises in many TDEs, especially in cases involving non-polynomial nonlinearities, where the right-hand side tensor has full rank. This necessitates the storage and computation of tensors of size O ( N d ) O(Nd) . We show that DEIM-FS results in significant computational savings for DLRA by constructing a low-rank Tucker approximation of the right-hand side tensor on the fly. Another advantage of using DEIM-FS is to significantly simplify the implementation of DLRA equations, irrespective of the type of TDEs. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm through several examples including solving high-dimensional partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) has significantly enhanced the systemic analysis of the relationship between microstructure and material properties, paving the way for developing high-performance materials. However, analyzing microstructure-sensitive material behavior remains challenging due to the scarcity of three-dimensional (3D) microstructure datasets. Moreover, this challenge is intensified if the microstructure is anisotropic, as this also results in anisotropic material properties. This paper presents a framework for reconstructing anisotropic microstructures solely based on two-dimensional (2D) micrographs using conditional diffusion-based generative models (DGMs). The proposed framework involves the spatial connection of multiple 2D conditional DGMs, each trained to generate 2D microstructure samples for three orthogonal planes. The connected multiple reverse diffusion processes then enable effective modeling of a Markov chain for transforming noise into a 3D microstructure sample. Furthermore, a modified harmonized sampling enhances the sample quality while preserving the spatial connection between the slices of anisotropic microstructure samples in 3D space. The 2D-to-3D reconstructed anisotropic microstructure samples are evaluated regarding the spatial correlation function and the physical material behavior to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate that the framework can reproduce the statistical distribution of material phases and properties in 3D space. It highlights the potential application of the proposed 2D-to-3D reconstruction framework in establishing microstructure-property linkages, which could aid high-throughput material design for future studies.},

The two PDEs are coupled with a stiff system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), representing ionic currents through the cardiac membrane. Developing efficient and scalable preconditioners for the linear systems arising from the discretization of such computationally challenging model is crucial in order to reduce the computational costs required by the numerical simulations of cardiac electrophysiology. In this work, focusing on the Bidomain system as a model problem, we have benchmarked two popular implementations of the Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioner embedded in the PETSc library and we have studied the performance on the calibration of specific parameters. We have conducted our analysis on modern HPC architectures, performing scalability tests on multi-core and multi-GPUs settings.

The originality herein involves the extension of the above-mentioned scheme to 3D using enrichment functions derived from asymptotic solutions for near-field crack tip displacements, in which Williams’ expansions are used on the crack surfaces and on the boundaries crossed by the crack front. Besides, Heaviside functions enrich external boundaries and allow the displacement discontinuity modelling. As with most enriched formulations, additional degrees of freedom are introduced; novel strategies are presented for the generation of auxiliary equations to recover a square system. Another key element of the proposed scheme is that the stress intensity factors are recovered directly from the solution vector and no post processing is required. Four applications demonstrate the formulation robustness, with results of models having comparatively few degrees of freedom comparing well against classical and other published results.},

We present a solution to a pseudo-impulsive formulation in the time domain, where the frequency-dependent quantities, such as added mass, radiation damping, and wave excitation force for arbitrary heading angle, β β , are evaluated using Fourier transforms from the tailored time-domain responses. The spatial domain is tessellated by an unstructured high-order hybrid configured mesh and with solutions represented by piece-wise polynomial basis functions in the spectral element space. Fourth-order accurate time integration is employed, making the entire numerical scheme a high-order scheme. The model can use symmetry boundaries in the spatial representation to reduce the computational burden. The key piece of the numerical model – the discrete Laplace solver – is verified through p p - and h h -convergence studies. Moreover, to highlight the capabilities of the proposed model, we present proof-of-concept examples of simple floating bodies (a hemisphere and a box). Also, an oscillating water column is considered, including generalized modes representing the piston motion and wave sloshing effects inside the wave energy converter chamber. In this case, the spectral element model trivially computes the infinite-frequency added mass, which is a singular problem for conventional boundary element-type solvers. The proposed model serves its practical purpose within the field of offshore engineering for simulations of floating offshore wind turbines, wave energy converters, and much more.},

However, stress topology optimization itself is ill-conditioned and the resulting optimized designs highly depend on the used parameters, mesh size, and so on. In this paper, stress minimization and stress-constrained topology optimization problems are reformulated by introducing a global measure of an optimized design, the average solid stress. The floating projection topology optimization method is established with ε ε -relaxation and the p-norm function. Due to the modified problem formulations, the optimized design becomes insensitive to the selection of p p in the p-norm function once p p is large enough, such as p = 16 p=16 , to ensure the total elimination of stress concentration. Numerical results show the uniform stress distribution of optimized designs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Some findings on the elimination of stress concentration, mesh-independent optimized topology, equivalent smooth design, and impractical design are presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {In real-world engineering, uncertainty is ubiquitous within material properties, structural geometry, load conditions, and the like. These uncertainties have substantial impacts on the estimation of structural performance. Furthermore, information or datasets in real life commonly contain imperfections, e.g., noise, outliers, or missing data. To quantify these impacts induced by uncertainties on structural behaviours and reduce the effects of data imperfections simultaneously, a machine learning-aided stochastic analysis framework is proposed. A novel supervised machine learning technique, namely the Capped Extended Support Vector Regression (CX-SVR) technique, is developed to effectively suppress the effects of outliers and noise in datasets. Its inherent convexity in optimization and capped strategy theoretically supports the accuracy of CX-SVR, especially in handling datasets with imperfections. Once the effective surrogate model is established, subsequent analyses, like sampling-based methods, can circumvent the cumbersome physical model, which is potentially the nest of computational burden and errors in engineering applications. The high robustness of the proposed approach can be summarized in four main aspects: unrestrictive selection of the system inputs and their statistical information, ‘perfect’ or ‘imperfect’ data, enough statistical information (including statistical moments, probability density functions, and cumulative distribution functions) of the system outputs, and physical problems from various engineering fields.},

  abstract     = {Continuous fiber-reinforced composite (CFRC) materials may exhibit different moduli in tension and compression. This nonlinear behavior significantly impacts the optimal design of CFRC structures. However, current topology optimization methods for CFRCs primarily rely on the assumption of uniform moduli, leading to inaccurate analyzes and suboptimal results. In this paper, a novel concurrent topology, fiber orientation and fiber content optimization method for CFRCs is proposed with the property of different moduli in tension and compression being considered. The tension/compression bi-modulus orthotropic property is incorporated through the weighted compliance matrix (WCM) material model. To solve the nonlinear equilibrium equation, a computational framework based on the Newton-Raphson method is established and the accurate tangent stiffness matrix is derived. The macro topology and fiber content distribution are optimized utilizing the density-based topology optimization method. Concurrently, element-wise fiber orientations are optimized by determining the rotation angles of the material orthotropy. The three design variables, namely macro topology, fiber content distribution, and fiber orientations, are all updated using the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) while calculating the sensitivities of the objective. In the numerical examples, various tension/compression modulus ratios are employed to explore the impact of modulus asymmetry on the optimized results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The convergence of the computational framework is verified by extracting equilibrium errors during the iterations. Furthermore, the paper presents several extensions of the method, including dealing with problems involving multiple loads and multiple bi-modulus orthotropic materials. A distinct constitutive model is also used to establish the optimization method for the bi-modulus orthotropic materials for verification as shown in Appendix B.},

This study proposes a robust optimization framework to account for the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties in industrial robotic systems. The design objective is established with the kinematic extremes and means of motion by incorporating the statistical moments of positioning accuracy and torque error in the joints. The nondeterministic kinematic and dynamic optimization is carried out by integrating the moment-based method and computational optimization techniques. Specifically, the mixed-degree cubature formula is adopted to evaluate the objective function under given design parameters. The optimization algorithm is utilized to achieve a best possible design. The moment sensitivity of motion error with respect to the uncertain parameters is derived by numerical integration. In this study, three practical design examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kinematic and dynamic robust optimization methods. The computational and experimental results indicate that the proposed robust optimization framework enables to reduce motion error and lower its sensitivity to uncertainties, thereby achieving reliable improvements in both motion accuracy and system robustness.},

  abstract     = {Complex mechanical systems often exhibit strongly nonlinear behavior due to the presence of nonlinearities in the energy dissipation mechanisms, material constitutive relationships, or geometric/connectivity mechanics. Numerical modeling of these systems leads to nonlinear full-order models that possess an underlying Lagrangian structure. This work proposes a Lagrangian operator inference method enhanced with structure-preserving machine learning to learn nonlinear reduced-order models (ROMs) of nonlinear mechanical systems. This two-step approach first learns the best-fit linear Lagrangian ROM via Lagrangian operator inference and then presents a structure-preserving machine learning method to learn nonlinearities in the reduced space. The proposed approach can learn a structure-preserving nonlinear ROM purely from data, unlike the existing operator inference approaches that require knowledge about the mathematical form of nonlinear terms. From a machine learning perspective, it accelerates the training of the structure-preserving neural network by providing an informed prior (i.e., the linear Lagrangian ROM structure), and it reduces the computational cost of the network training by operating on the reduced space. The method is first demonstrated on two simulated examples: a conservative nonlinear rod model and a two-dimensional nonlinear membrane with nonlinear internal damping. Finally, the method is demonstrated on an experimental dataset consisting of digital image correlation measurements taken from a lap-joint beam structure from which a predictive model is learned that captures amplitude-dependent frequency and damping characteristics accurately. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields generalizable nonlinear ROMs that exhibit bounded energy error, capture the nonlinear characteristics reliably, and provide accurate long-time predictions outside the training data regime.},

Simultaneously, the macro material distribution is adjusted utilizing 3D density-based topology optimization method. To enhance the computation efficiency and significantly amplify the versatility in optimization design, a Parameterized Interpolation for Anisotropic Lattice material (PIAL) is established based on elastic stiffness matrices of micro lattices with 21 independent components. Specifically, a cubic multinomial function is employed to construct a direct correlation between micro topology configurations and equivalent elasticities of the EBCC lattices. Several numerical examples of compliance optimization are carried out to confirm the validity of the proposed approach. Concurrently, Additive Manufacturing (AM) using AlSi10Mg is adopted to manufacture the obtained hierarchical structures, which exhibit well-improved mechanical performance, as confirmed by experimental testing, when compared to the classical density-graded structures.},

Such theory results in fourth-order governing partial differential equations, and the periodicity conditions involve continuity across the periodic boundary of primal fields (displacement and electric potential) and their normal derivatives, continuity of the corresponding dual generalized forces (tractions, double tractions, surface charge density and double surface charge density). Rather than imposing these conditions numerically as explicit constraints, we develop an approximation space which fulfills generalized periodicity by construction. Our method naturally allows us to impose general macroscopic fields (strains/stresses and electric fields/electric displacements) along arbitrary directions, enabling the characterization of the material anisotropy. We apply the proposed method to study periodic architected metamaterials with apparent piezoelectricity. We first verify the method by directly comparing the results with a large periodic structure, then apply it to evaluate the anisotropic apparently piezoelectricity of a geometrically polarized 2D lattice, and finally demonstrate the application of the method in a 3D architected metamaterial.},

  abstract     = {Numerical path continuation is commonly applied to determine how limit states of dynamical systems evolve with a free parameter. For high-fidelity models of complicated nonlinear systems, the sequential nature inherent to continuation can become an unsurmountable obstacle. In the present work, we propose a new paradigm for obtaining the targeted solution curves in a parallelized way. The point of departure is a low-fidelity model, which is of lower order and/or neglects certain nonlinear/coupling terms. The simplifications must be as drastic as necessary to obtain an approximate solution curve with reasonable effort. A subset of relevant points along this approximate solution curve is then selected, and, departing there, points on the targeted solution branch of the high-fidelity model are then iteratively computed. It is important to note that the iterative correction towards the high-fidelity solution branch can be applied independently for each point, and is thus predestined for parallel computation. The proposed generic concept is exemplified for a selection of nonlinear vibration problems. Different types of system models, nonlinearities and analyses are considered, and the Harmonic Balance method is used in all cases to compute periodic limit states. In particular, it is shown that the proposed concept is applicable to modal and harmonic order refinement. Finally, it is shown that the concept is also interesting when instead of a model refinement a second system parameter (besides the continuation parameter) is varied, and it permits to robustly reach parameter ranges that are extremely difficult to obtain with conventional path continuation. The method is available, along with the presented numerical examples, as a branch PEACE ( P arallelized R e - a nalysis Of Solution C urv e s) of the open source tool NLvib.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the behavior of biological tissues and organs often necessitates the knowledge of their shape in the absence of external loads. However, when their geometry is acquired in-vivo through imaging techniques, bodies are typically subject to mechanical deformation due to the presence of external forces, and the load-free configuration needs to be reconstructed. This paper addresses this crucial and frequently overlooked topic, known as the inverse elasticity problem (IEP), by delving into both theoretical and numerical aspects, with a particular focus on cardiac mechanics. In this work, we extend Shield’s seminal work to determine the structure of the IEP with arbitrary material inhomogeneities and in the presence of both body and active forces. These aspects are fundamental in computational cardiology, and we show that they may break the variational structure of the inverse problem. In addition, we show that the inverse problem might have no solution even in the presence of constant Neumann boundary conditions and a polyconvex strain energy functional. We then present the results of extensive numerical tests to validate our theoretical framework, and to characterize the computational challenges associated with a direct numerical approximation of the IEP. Specifically, we show that this framework outperforms existing approaches both in terms of robustness and optimality, such as Sellier’s iterative procedure, even when the latter is improved with acceleration techniques. A notable discovery is that multigrid preconditioners are, in contrast to standard elasticity, not efficient, where a one-level additive Schwarz and generalized Dryja–Smith–Widlund provide a much more reliable alternative. Finally, we successfully address the IEP for a full-heart geometry, demonstrating that the IEP formulation can compute the stress-free configuration in real-life scenarios where Sellier’s algorithm proves inadequate.},

In this work, we created a dataset with more than one thousand TPMS scaffolds for the training of Machine Learning (ML) models able to find such correlation. Finite Element Modeling and image analysis have been used to characterize the scaffolds. In particular, we trained three different ML models, exploring both a linear and non-linear approach, to select the features able to predict the input parameters. Furthermore, the features used for the prediction can be selected in three different modes: i) fully automatic, through a greedy algorithm, ii) arbitrarily, by the user and iii) in a combination of the two above methods: i.e. partially automatic and partially through a user-selection. The latter, coupled with the non-linear ML model, exhibits a median error less than 3% and a determination coefficient higher than 0.89 for each of the selected features, and all of them are accessible during the design phase. This approach has been applied to the design of a hydroxyapatite TPMS scaffolds with prescribed properties obtained from a real trabecular-like hydroxyapatite scaffold. The obtained results demonstrate that the ML model can effectively design a TPMS scaffold with prescribed features on the basis of biomechanical, mechanobiology and technological constraints.},

  abstract     = {A new approach is developed for computational modelling of microstructure evolution problems. The approach combines the phase-field method with the recently-developed laminated element technique (LET) which is a simple and efficient method to model weak discontinuities using non-conforming finite-element meshes. The essence of LET is in treating the elements that are cut by an interface as simple laminates of the two phases, and this idea is here extended to propagating interfaces so that the volume fraction of the phases and the lamination orientation vary accordingly. In the proposed LET-PF approach, the phase-field variable (order parameter), which is governed by an evolution equation of the Ginzburg–Landau type, plays the role of a level-set function that implicitly defines the position of the (sharp) interface. The mechanical equilibrium subproblem is then solved using the semisharp LET technique. Performance of LET-PF is illustrated by numerical examples. In particular, it is shown that, for the problems studied, LET-PF exhibits higher accuracy than the conventional phase-field method so that, for instance, qualitatively correct results can be obtained using a significantly coarser mesh, and thus at a lower computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Real-world applications of computational fluid dynamics often involve the evaluation of quantities of interest for several distinct geometries that define the computational domain or are embedded inside it. For example, design optimization studies require the realization of response surfaces from the parameters that determine the geometrical deformations to relevant outputs to be optimized. In this context, a crucial aspect to be addressed is represented by the limited resources at disposal to computationally generate different geometries or to physically obtain them from direct measurements. This is the case for patient-specific biomedical applications for example. When additional linear geometrical constraints need to be imposed, the computational costs increase substantially. Such constraints include total volume conservation and barycenter location. We develop a new paradigm that employs generative models from machine learning to efficiently sample new geometries with linear constraints. A consequence of our approach is the reduction of the parameter space from the original geometrical parametrization to a low-dimensional latent space of the generative models. Crucial is the assessment of the quality of the distribution of the constrained geometries obtained with respect to physical and geometrical quantities of interest. Non-intrusive model order reduction is enhanced since smaller parametric spaces are considered. We test our methodology on two academic test cases: a mixed Poisson problem on the 3d Stanford bunny with fixed barycenter deformations and the multiphase turbulent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for the Duisburg’s naval hull test case with fixed volume deformations.},

  abstract     = {This contribution deals with the solution of a new monolithically coupled fluid–structure interaction approach using mixed least-squares (LS) stress–velocity (SV) formulations with implicit time discretization schemes and adaptive time stepping. The variational approach for the fluid is based on the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in Arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) description to consider a deforming fluid domain. For the deformation of the fluid background mesh, a pseudo-material with linear elastic behavior and local hardening using mesh-Jacobian-based stiffening is presented. The proposed LS solid formulations are based on linear and hyperelastic material behavior, and are likewise expressed in terms of stresses and velocities. In combination with conforming finite element spaces in H ( div ) H(div) and H 1 H1 for the spatial discretization of the unknowns, an inherent fulfillment of the coupling conditions in FSI problems is achieved. Time discretization is performed using SDIRK methods with different orders and the Houbolt method. Before solving the coupled problem, the accuracy of various high-order time discretizations is investigated when solving dynamic flow and solid problems with SV formulations. Two numerical examples with exact solution are used, i.e. an unsteady Taylor–Green vortex flow and a linear elastic vibrating plate, to evaluate the temporal convergence order of different schemes. The coupled LS FSI approach is tested by solving the benchmark problem, flow around a cylinder with attached flag, which is characterized by large deformations of the solid flag and hence the fluid domain. A major focus is on the investigation and comparison of embedded Runge–Kutta methods with adaptive time step control in terms of efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {The present study introduces a new physics-based self-learning spiking neural framework to compute geometrically and physically nonlinear structural response. While the so-called traditional or second-generation deep neural networks are used in many applications in the class of physics-informed neural networks, we propose a hybrid model that consists of third-generation Leaky-Integrated and Fire (LIF) neurons, Recurrent Leaky-Integrated and Fire (RLIF) neurons and second-generation dense transformation. The third-generation neurons are inspired by the human brain’s energy-efficient functioning which introduces inherent temporal and sparse behavior leading to a more sustainable AI approach. However, the sparse nature of the spiking neurons poses a challenge to tackle nonlinear regression tasks. Thus, in the present study, we use an autoencoding strategy that converts the real-valued signals to its spiking representation and enables the spiking neurons to learn nonlinear material response. The proposed hybrid network is firstly pretrained with combined data-driven and physics-based loss functions and then deployed in the plastic corrector step of the implicit integration which is used in the Finite Element solver and is validated on a series of Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) consisting of plate elements. A self-learning strategy is introduced for the hybrid network to train itself during FE simulation using the proposed physics-based loss function. Two major advantages were observed: an overall computational gain in the excess of 30% and the self-learning/online training ability of the model that bolsters its convergence behavior. Finally, the proposed third-generation layers are deployed on the Xylo-Av2 neuromorphic chip and its energy performance is compared with the second-generation Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).},

  abstract     = {The fracture of polymers involves viscous dissipation and finite deformation, which poses difficulties for theoretical and numerical analysis. The phase field model (PFM) is a promising tool for fracture simulation, but the near incompressibility nature of polymers presents challenges. This study proposes a fourth-order PFM to deal with the rate-dependent fracture of nearly incompressible polymers within the adaptive mixed isogeometric framework that integrates the hierarchical B-splines. The higher-order terms improve the regularity of the phase field solution. The penalty formulation in PFM incorporates the non-uniform energy degradation scheme that integrates the Sargado-type degradation function to address the contradiction between the incompressibility constraint and crack opening. This scheme preserves the undamaged response before fracture while narrowing the incompressibility loosening band. Based on the weighted residual method, a new mixed formulation is derived and serves as the weak form of the governing equations of PFM. Using the robust staggered scheme, the established multi-field problem is decoupled, and the mixed displacement-pressure ( u - p ) formulation of the deformation sub-problem is discretized by the presented stable hierarchical spline space combination, maintaining the high continuity advantage of isogeometric analysis. To enhance the computational efficiency, an adaptive local refinement algorithm based on a level-by-level marking strategy is proposed for the u - p hierarchical meshes. The performance of the developed mixed u - p elements is assessed in the benchmark example by comparing them with the standard elements. Representative numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed phase field fracture model.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new Multi-Objective Mantis Search Algorithm (MOMSA) to handle complex optimization problems, including real-world engineering optimization problems. The Mantis Search Algorithm (MSA) is a recently reported nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm, and it has been inspired by the unique hunting behavior and sexual cannibalism of praying mantises. The proposed MOMSA algorithm employs the same underlying MSA mechanisms for convergence combined with an elitist non-dominated sorting approach to estimate Pareto-optimal solutions. In addition, MOMSA employs the crowding distance mechanism to enhance the coverage of optimal solutions across all objectives. To validate its performance, we conduct 29 case studies, encompassing twenty multi-objective benchmark problems (ZDT, DTLZ, and CEC 2009) and nine engineering design problems. Furthermore, MOMSA is applied to the IEEE-30 bus system, addressing both single- and multi-objective optimal power flow problems across eight distinct cases. Results are compared with some state-of-the-art approaches using various performance metrics such as GD, MS, IGD, and HV. The findings demonstrate MOMSA’s ability to effectively balance convergence, diversity, and uniformity, providing valuable insights for decision-makers addressing complex problems.

  abstract     = {Compared with conventional symmetric sandwich structure with identical face sheets and single-material core, asymmetric porous sandwich structures (APSSs), which are composed of unidentical face sheets and composite core, usually take better advantage of all materials and provide superior bending stiffness. However, current studies regarding the APSSs are mainly analytical- and experimental-based methods with predefined face sheet thicknesses and core configurations, which greatly confines the potential loading capacity of sandwich structures. This paper develops a multiscale topology optimization method for the multi-material APSSs, which can realize the designs of the thickness and material of two face sheets at macroscale as well as the configuration of composite cores at microscale for minimizing structural compliance. Firstly, at macroscale, a multi-material variable thickness sheet method integrated with an alternating active-phase algorithm are employed to optimize the thickness and material of two solid face sheets. Then, at microscale, a difference-set-based multi-material level set (DS-MMLS) model is applied to represent the topology of each material phase within sandwich core, and their topological evolution can be readily achieved by using a parametric level set method also combined with the alternating active phase algorithm. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The results indicate that compliances of the optimized APSSs show superior advantages over some conventional sandwich structures with predefined design features.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the discretisation of fractured/faulted poromechanical models using 3D polyhedral meshes in order to cope with the geometrical complexity of faulted geological models. A new polytopal scheme is proposed for contact-mechanics, based on a mixed formulation combining a fully discrete space and suitable reconstruction operators for the displacement field together with a face-wise constant approximation of the Lagrange multiplier, accounting for the surface tractions along the fracture/fault network. To ensure the inf–sup stability of the mixed formulation, a bubble-like degree of freedom is included in the discrete space of displacements and used in the reconstruction operators. This fully discrete scheme for the displacement is equivalent to a low-order Virtual Element scheme, with a bubble enrichment of the virtual space. This P 1 P1 -bubble VEM– P 0 P0 mixed discretisation is combined with an Hybrid Finite Volume scheme for the Darcy flow. The proposed approach is adapted to complex geometry with a network of planar faults/fractures which can include corners, tips and intersections; it leads to efficient semi-smooth Newton solvers for the contact-mechanics, and preserves the dissipative properties of the fully coupled model. The scheme is numerically investigated in terms of convergence and robustness on several 2D and 3D test cases, using either analytical or numerical reference solutions and considering both the stand alone static contact-mechanics model and the fully coupled poromechanical model.},

The development of surrogates approximating a homogenization operator is a fairly classical topic that has been addressed through various methods, including polynomial- and deep-learning-based models. Such approaches, and their extensions to probabilistic settings, remain expensive and hard to deploy when the nonlinear upscaled quantities of interest exhibit large statistical variations (in the case of non-separated scales, for instance) and potential non-locality. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology that addresses this particular setting from the point of view of probabilistic learning. More specifically, we formulate the approximation problem using conditional statistics, and use probabilistic learning on manifolds to draw samples of the nonlinear constitutive model at mesoscale. Two applications, relevant to inverse problem solving and forward propagation, are presented in the context of nonlinear elasticity. We show that the framework enables accurate predictions (in probability law), despite the small amount of training data and the very high levels of nonlinearity and stochasticity in the considered system.},

The former, however, is not readily attainable in the cases whose closed-form solution does not exist. Those cases invoke the use of a cascade of expensive computations for the recovery of inner-subdomain solution fields, leaving one of the main assets of the method almost unused. As a remedy, we propose a new solution scheme by which the interior fields of subdomains can be easily recovered so that the full potential of the scaled boundary finite element method can be harvested. No auxiliary variables are introduced to the global algebraic system and the dimensions of the matrices remain constant. Most of the computations are carried out prior to the global algebraic system assembly, and in a completely decoupled manner on the element level, rendering the introduced method to be embarrassingly parallelizable. The inner-subdomain information is not required for the solution process and it can be computed locally for the selected regions and subdomains, also using parallel computing .},

Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was used to establish the training sample set. The surrogate model of the discrete element numerical simulation method was established by combining the relevance vector mechanism (RVM) and the third-generation nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to find the nonlinear relationship between the accumulation characteristics after landslide and microscopic parameters. Based on the calibration results, the area that may be affected by landslides was predicted. The results showed that the similarity between the calculated value of the intelligent model and the measured value was 97.49%.

  abstract     = {The phase field method has gathered significant attention in the past decade due to its versatile applications in engineering contexts, including fatigue crack propagation modeling. Particularly, the phase field cohesive zone method (PF-CZM) has emerged as a promising approach for modeling fracture behavior in quasi-brittle materials, such as concrete. The present contribution expands the applicability of the PF-CZM to include the modeling of fatigue-induced crack propagation. This study critically examines the validity of the extended PF-CZM approach by evaluating its performance across various fatigue behaviors, encompassing hysteretic behavior, S-N curves, fatigue creep curves, and the Paris law. The experimental investigations and validation span a diverse spectrum of loading scenarios, encompassing pre- and post-peak cyclic loading, as well as low- and high-cyclic fatigue loading. The validation process incorporates 2D and 3D boundary value problems, considering mode I and mixed-modes fatigue crack propagation. The results obtained from this study show a wide range of validity, underscoring the remarkable potential of the proposed PF-CZM approach to accurately capture the propagation of fatigue cracks in concrete-like materials. Furthermore, the paper outlines recommendations to improve the predictive capabilities of the model concerning key fatigue characteristics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we build on the work of Hughes and Sangalli (2007) dealing with the explicit computation of the Fine-Scale Greens’ function. The original approach chooses a set of functionals associated with a projector to compute the Fine-Scale Greens’ function. The construction of these functionals, however, does not generalise to arbitrary projections, higher dimensions, or Spectral Element methods. We propose to generalise the construction of the required functionals by using dual functions. These dual functions can be directly derived from the chosen projector and are explicitly computable. We show how to find the dual functions for both the L 2 L2 and the H 0 1 H01 projections. We then go on to demonstrate that the Fine-Scale Greens’ functions constructed with the dual basis functions consistently reproduce the unresolved scales removed by the projector. The methodology is tested using one-dimensional Poisson and advection–diffusion problems, as well as a two-dimensional Poisson problem. We present the computed components of the Fine-Scale Greens’ function, and the Fine-Scale Greens’ function itself. These results show that the method works for arbitrary projections, in arbitrary dimensions. Moreover, the methodology can be applied to any Finite/Spectral Element or Isogeometric framework.},

We use a discretized approach, with the parameters of the discrete rod calibrated to approach the continuous case as the number N N of rod segments goes to infinity, and use a quasi-Newton approach to minimize the discretized energy. We explore convergence of the results as N → ∞ N→∞ , and also as we vary shear, stretch, and contact parameters to approach the inextensible–unshearable and hard-contact limits. For a straight and isotropic rod, we present results for three sets of boundary conditions – loop, buckled strut, and hairpin, in each case as an imposed twist angle is increased – and compare energies and configurations for the non-contact and contact problems. Finally, we show how our results change when isotropy is broken in two ways: by the rod being bent in its undeformed state, or by the rod having unequal bending stiffnesses.},

Nevertheless, MLIPs have demonstrated impressive accuracy in predicting forces and energies in simulations involving intricate and complex structures. In this paper we aim to take steps towards rigorously explaining the excellent observed generalization properties of MLIPs. Specifically, we offer a comprehensive theoretical and numerical investigation of the generalization of MLIPs in the context of dislocation simulations. We quantify precisely how the accuracy of such simulations is directly determined by a few key factors: the size of the training structures, the choice of training observations (e.g., energies, forces, virials), and the level of accuracy achieved in the fitting process. Notably, our study reveals the crucial role of fitting virials in ensuring the consistency of MLIPs for dislocation simulations. Our series of careful numerical experiments encompassing screw, edge, and mixed dislocations, supports existing best practices in the MLIPs literature but also provides new insights into the design of data sets and loss functions.},

  abstract     = {A novel approach for the construction of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is proposed to facilitate high-dimensional uncertainty quantification (UQ). The current PCE techniques are well-known for UQ; however, they are affected by the curse of dimensionality that leads to over-fitting and tractability issues. Although L 1 L1 -minimization can be used to deal with over-fitting, it is still ineffective for problems with a large number of independent random inputs or requiring a very high-order PCE. Therefore, a classifier-based PCE (CAPCE) is presented to mitigate the factorial growth of basis terms and prevent over-fitting. The adaptive framework includes four basis selection strategies – enrichment, screening, discovery, and recycling – in the inner loop and the enrichment of the training samples in the outer loop. Mainly, an adaptive classifier is trained on the dominant and discarded basis terms obtained from L 1 L1 -minimization during discovery. It then allows the judicious selection of new higher-order basis candidates for L 1 L1 -solver in the next iteration, thereby alleviating the effect of the curse of dimensionality. The proposed framework has been tested with analytical problems of varying sizes of independent random inputs and an engineering composite laminate problem. The comparison of CAPCE with the available efficient PCE techniques demonstrated improvements in accuracy using fewer samples due to a faster convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {The Bayesian failure probability inference (BFPI) framework provides a well-established Bayesian approach to quantifying our epistemic uncertainty about the failure probability resulting from a limited number of performance function evaluations. However, it is still challenging to perform Bayesian active learning of the failure probability by taking advantage of the BFPI framework. In this work, three Bayesian active learning methods are proposed under the name ‘partially Bayesian active learning cubature’ (PBALC), based on a cleaver use of the BFPI framework for structural reliability analysis, especially when small failure probabilities are involved. Since the posterior variance of the failure probability is computationally expensive to evaluate, the underlying idea is to exploit only the posterior mean of the failure probability to design two critical components for Bayesian active learning, i.e., the stopping criterion and the learning function. On this basis, three sets of stopping criteria and learning functions are proposed, resulting in the three proposed methods PBALC1, PBALC2 and PBALC3. Furthermore, the analytically intractable integrals involved in the stopping criteria are properly addressed from a numerical point of view. Five numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the performance of the three proposed methods. It is found empirically that the proposed methods can assess very small failure probabilities and significantly outperform several existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

This paper introduces a two-step machine learning approach that returns mathematical models interpretable by human experts. In particular, we introduce a surrogate model where yield surfaces are expressed in terms of a set of single-variable feature mappings obtained from supervised learning. A post-processing step is then used to re-interpret the set of single-variable neural network mapping functions into mathematical form through symbolic regression. This divide-and-conquer approach provides several important advantages. First, it enables us to overcome the scaling issue of symbolic regression algorithms. From a practical perspective, it enhances the portability of learned models for partial differential equation solvers written in different programming languages. Finally, it enables us to have a concrete understanding of the attributes of the materials, such as convexity and symmetries of models, through automated derivations and reasoning.

  abstract     = {The paper deals with the rebound of an elastic solid off a rigid wall of a container filled with an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Our study focuses on a collision-free bounce, meaning a rebound without topological contact between the elastic solid and the wall. This has the advantage of omitting any artificial bouncing law. In order to capture the contact-free rebound for very small viscosities an adaptive numerical scheme is introduced. The here-introduced scheme is based on a Glowinski time scheme and a localized arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian map on finite elements in space. The absence of topological contact requires that very thin liquid channels are solved with sufficient accuracy. It is achieved via newly developed geometrically driven adaptive strategies. Using the numerical scheme, we present here a collection of numerical experiments. A rebound is simulated in the absence of topological contacts. Its physical relevance is demonstrated as, with decreasing viscosities, a free rebound in a vacuum is approached. Further, we compare the dynamics with a second numerical scheme; a here-introduced adaptive purely Eulerian level-set method. The scheme produced the same dynamics for large viscosities. However, as it requires a much higher computational cost, small viscosities cannot be reached by this method. The experiments allow for a better understanding of the effect of fluids on the dynamics of elastic objects. Several observations are discussed, such as the amount of elastic and/or kinetic energy loss or the precise connection between the fluid pressure and the rebound of the solid.},

Specifically, we adopt a mathematical “transport” model for the solution of the dynamical system at specific spatial locations that allows us to accurately estimate the model parameters, including those associated with structural damage. This is accomplished by means of a newly-developed mathematical transform, the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT), which is shown to convert the general nonlinear parameter estimation problem into a simple linear regression. This approach has the additional practical advantage of requiring no a priori knowledge of the source of the excitation (or, alternatively, the initial conditions). By using training data, we devise a coarse regression procedure to recover different PDE parameters from the PDE solution measured at a single location. Numerical experiments show that the proposed regression procedure is capable of detecting and estimating PDE parameters with superior accuracy compared to a number of recently developed machine learning methods. Furthermore, a damage identification experiment conducted on a publicly available dataset provides strong evidence of the proposed method’s effectiveness in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. The Python implementation of the proposed system identification technique is integrated as a part of the software package PyTransKit (Imaging and data science lab) [1] .},

Based on the localized structure of the steep activation wavefront in solutions to monodomain problems, the proposed framework adopts small time steps and a tree-based adaptive mesh refinement scheme only in the regions necessary to resolve these localized structures. The time step and mesh adaptation selection process is fully controlled by a combination of local error indicators. The main contributions of this work consist in the introduction of a primal symmetric interior penalty formulation of the monodomain model and an efficient algorithmic strategy to manage local time stepping for its temporal discretization. In a first serial implementation of this framework, we report that our new scheme is between 50% and 95% faster (in wall clock time) compared to an optimized implementation of a commonly used numerical scheme without significant loss of solution accuracy, showing that this framework is a promising candidate to accelerate monodomain simulations of cardiac electrophysiology. Preliminary studies of a parallel version of the proposed scheme alongside a novel load balancing strategy are found in the appendix and show that, although the scaling of the proposed scheme is limited, the new strategy remains faster than an optimized implementation of a classic operator splitting scheme.},

  abstract     = {Critical to finite element (FE) analysis of fiber-reinforced composites is accurately reproducing microstructural features via high-quality meshes such that the material heterogeneity and anisotropy are properly captured. Here we present an integrated computational framework for generating realistic FE models of woven composites with high fiber volume fractions ( &gt; 50 % &amp;gt;50% ). This framework relies on a virtual microstructure reconstruction algorithm that first generates a geometric model of loosely-woven yarns ( i . e . , i.e., bundles of fibers), followed by performing an FE compaction simulation to create the final textile composite microstructure. A non-iterative meshing algorithm, i.e. , conforming to interface structured adaptive mesh refinement (CISAMR), has been adapted to automatically transform synthesized microstructures into conforming FE meshes. CISAMR can handle challenging geometrical features such as thin resin interstices and yarn interpenetrations (an artifact of the FE compaction) without the need to reprocess the digital geometry before mesh generation. We show that the homogenized elastic moduli obtained from FE simulations of an 8-harness satin woven composite laminate agree well with experimental measurements (within 3%), thereby validating the accuracy of the framework. We also present several other mechanical analysis examples, including a nonlinear damage simulation, that further demonstrate the ability of this framework to construct high-fidelity FE models of intricate woven composites with varying 2D and 3D woven architectures.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven surrogate modeling has emerged as a promising approach for reducing computational expenses of multi-scale simulations. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a common choice for modeling of path-dependent behavior. However, previous studies have shown that RNNs fail to make predictions that are consistent with perturbation in the input strain, leading to potential oscillations and lack of convergence when implemented within finite element simulations. In this work, we leverage neural differential equations which have recently emerged to model time series in a continuous manner and show their robustness in modeling elasto-plastic path-dependent material behavior. We develop a new sequential model called Incremental Neural Controlled Differential Equation (INCDE) for general time-variant dynamical systems, including path-dependent constitutive models. INCDE is formulated and analyzed in terms of stability and convergence. Surrogate models based on INCDE are subsequently trained and tested for J2 and Drucker–Prager plasticity. The surrogate models are implemented for material point simulations and boundary value problems solved using the finite element method with various cyclic and monotonic loading protocols to demonstrate the robustness, consistency, and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive structures can counteract the effect of external loads and other environmental actions through active manipulation of the internal force flow (i.e., the load path) and geometry (i.e., form or shape). Previous studies have shown that adaptation enables significant mass and energy saving compared to conventional structures that resist the effect of loading solely through material strength and stiffness (i.e., passive structures). The computational synthesis of adaptive structures is a challenging process since it involves optimization of the structural layout as well as sensor and actuator placement, which is, generally, a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem. Previous formulations employ sizing and/or geometry optimization in combination with actuator placement optimization. No method has yet been formulated for the simultaneous synthesis of the structural topology, element sizing, and placement of actuators. This paper offers the first-ever formulation for the All-In-One (AIO) topology optimization of adaptive structures based on the Ground Structure approach. The objective function comprises the mass of structural elements and actuators. The design variables are structural topology, element cross-section areas, and actuator locations. State variables include element forces and deformations, nodal displacements, and actuator commands. Constraints ensure that feasible solutions satisfy equilibrium and geometric compatibility as well as limits on stress, stability, nodal displacements, and actuator forces. Auxiliary constraints are implemented to enable the simultaneous synthesis of the structural layout and actuator placement and linearize the formulation into a Mixed-Integer Linear Problem (MILP) that can be solved to a global optimum. Due to a large number of variables, the AIO formulation can be typically applied to small-scale problems. To reduce the computational cost, a two-step sequential formulation is developed and benchmarked against the AIO method. Results show that the sequential method produces solutions of similar quality compared to the AIO one albeit with a significantly reduced computational cost. Results confirm that the optimal adaptive solutions vastly outperform topology-optimized conventional (i.e., passive) solutions. Adaptive solutions approach the limit of material economy (fully stressed design, e.g., Michell trusses) and, in parallel, satisfy important constraints including displacements and stability that would not be possible without adaptation.},

  abstract     = {In computational electromagnetism, the radar signature of a target usually requires solving repeated electromagnetic scattering problems associated to plane waves illuminating the target with varying frequency and incident angle. When the problem is large scale, strategies based on repeated solver calls usually lead to prohibitive computational costs. This is especially the case when the solver relies on an integral equation discretized using the boundary element method (BEM), as this amounts to solving numerous complex, unsymmetrical and fully populated linear systems . In this work, reduced order models (ROMs) are built in order to rapidly and accurately approximate the solutions for illuminating waves with frequencies and incident angles within bands of interest. In the context of the BEM, the success of a ROM essentially depends on the ability to decouple the frequency from the Green kernels of the underlying integral equation. In this work, we present a methodology for achieving such decoupling that combines the Empirical Interpolation Method (EIM) with the notion of local adaptivity. We use our approximation of the frequency-dependent BEM operator in a locally adaptive non-intrusive reduced basis method. The proposed strategy is fully non-intrusive, in the sense that it only requires the ability to perform matrix–vector products with standard BEM operators. We illustrate our methodology on real-life electromagnetic scattering problems solved by the Combined Field Integral Equation (CFIE) and with matrix–vector products accelerated with the fast-multipole method (FMM).},

VEM has been increasingly used in various fields of engineering, but the need of stabilization yields a method that cannot be used without care, e.g. in nonlinear engineering applications . In this work, by increasing the order of the strain model, a new virtual element formulation is constructed for three-dimensional problems that does not require any stabilization term. The core concept involves adapting the virtual element space to enable the computation of a higher-order L 2 L2 projection operator, guaranteeing an accurate representation of the element energy in terms of strain and stress. This work describes the calculation process of the original H 1 H1 projection operator and the higher-order L 2 L2 projection operator for three-dimensional problems. Eigenvalue analysis allows to derive an approximate relation between the polynomial order and the number of element vertices. Some benchmark problems illustrate the capability of the stabilization-free VEM for three-dimensional linear elastic problems.},

Our approach uses physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to find the saddle point equilibrium of the underlying potential energy. Specifically, our deep energy method employs multiple distinct neural networks to model the mechanical and electrostatic fields in an adversarial relationship. The optimal configuration of an electromechanical system is calculated by using saddle point optimization algorithms . This involves minimizing the maximum value of the cost function which is related to the potential energy of the system. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework by solving various benchmark problems for dielectric elastomers and comparing the results with the analytical or finite element solutions. The proposed method significantly extends the applicability of DEM and has versatility for various material models in dielectric elastomer problems. In particular, the buckling phenomenon in electromechanical coupling problems, with which conventional finite element method (FEM) has struggled, can be successfully solved without difficulties. The proposed method is easy to implement using open-source machine-learning environments and is expected to pave the way for solving multiphysics problems effectively.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) offers innovative and powerful ways for spatio-temporal soil consolidation analysis. However, status quo applications employ physics-informed deep learning with the continuous-time scheme that necessitates sampling massive collocation points across the entire spatio-temporal domain, which can be computationally expensive in time-evolution simulation and high-dimensional models. In this paper, a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) framework with a local time-updating discrete scheme for forward and inverse consolidation analysis is proposed and formulated by combining the local time-updating strategy and the Runge–Kutta time discretization methods with the PIDL. Furthermore, the total and local time-updating discrete time schemes fitted to PIDL to solve the time-dependent partial differential equations are investigated. The proposed model was validated across various soil consolidation cases spanning 1D to 3D single and double drainage, exponentially time-growing drainage boundary conditions, and inverse analysis to retrieve the material and model parameters. A comprehensive evaluation of PIDL with the continuous and discrete time schemes in time-dependent multi-dimensional consolidation analysis, which is of significant reference value, is performed. Numerical results manifested that PIDL with the discrete time scheme outperforms the continuous time scheme in consolidation analysis, particularly in high dimensions. The PIDL using the local time-updating strategy yielded more accurate results than the total time-updating strategy and can facilitate training with time evolution. A transfer learning model in time domain fitted to PIDL with the discrete time scheme was developed to enhance model generality and reduce the computation cost. In addition, PIDL with the discrete time scheme can unify forward simulation and inverse analysis in a unified framework requiring less training data, which can be a promising candidate to serve as a versatile surrogate modeling tool in geotechnical engineering.},

We present a robust and efficient procedure for producing accurate stencil polynomial approximations . Bad stencils are identified by considering the condition number of the linear system used to define the stencil polynomial. Second, we develop a novel and efficient finite volume, multilevel WENO (ML-WENO) reconstruction that is flexible enough to be applied effectively in a variety of settings and with essentially any reasonable set of stencils. It combines stencil polynomial approximations of various degrees with a nonlinear weighting biasing the reconstruction away from both inaccurate oscillatory polynomials of high degree (i.e., those crossing a shock or steep front) and smooth polynomials of low degree, thereby selecting the smooth polynomial(s) of maximal degree of approximation . We conduct numerical tests showing poor quality mesh stencils, the behavior of the reconstruction for both smooth and discontinuous functions , and applications to scalar conservation laws.},

The goal is to obtain an optimized topology that satisfies the stress failure criterion before and after the occurrence of any damage, also taking into account slight imperfections that may occur during the structure manufacturing process. In order to achieve this goal, the conventional volume minimization formulation with local stress constraints is generalized to simultaneously accommodate possible damage scenarios, considering a simplified damage model of removal of failure regions with predefined shape, size and position from the design domain, and possible manufacturing scenarios, which are included via the three-field density projection approach based on intermediate, eroded and dilated designs. Two numerical examples are addressed: L-shaped and Cantilever problems; both are solved for different arrangements of damage scenarios. Stress constraints are handled via the augmented Lagrangian method , without using aggregation techniques, and problems with up to 82.5 million stress constraints are solved. Numerical investigations demonstrate that: (1) the proposed formulation is able to obtain results which are at the same time fail-safe and tolerant to uniform manufacturing error, as for any manufacturing situation the maximum stress does not exceed the allowable design stress after the occurrence of any predefined damage; (2) when manufacturing error tolerance is not considered, extremely sensitive results are obtained, being truly fail-safe for unique manufacturing situations.},

To address this challenge, this paper demonstrates a deep learning (DL) framework that is capable of predicting micro-scale elasto-plastic strains and stresses in a two-phase medium, at a much greater speed than traditional FE simulations . The proposed framework uses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture with 3D operations, to map the composite microstructure to the corresponding stress and strain fields under a predetermined load path. In particular, the model is applied to a two-phase fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite microstructure subjected to a given loading-unloading path, predicting the corresponding stress and strain fields at discrete intermediate load steps. A novel two-step training approach provides more accurate predictions of stress, by first training the model to predict strain fields and then using those strain fields as input to the model that predicts the stress fields. This efficient data-driven approach enables accurate prediction of physical fields in inelastic materials, based solely on microstructure images and loading information.},

We argue that this is a fundamental limitation and a key source of error that can ultimately steer PINN models to converge towards erroneous solutions. We address this pathology by proposing a simple re-formulation of PINNs loss functions that can explicitly account for physical causality during model training. We demonstrate that this simple modification alone is enough to introduce significant accuracy improvements, as well as a practical quantitative mechanism for assessing the convergence of a PINNs model. We provide state-of-the-art numerical results across a series of benchmarks for which existing PINNs formulations fail, including the chaotic Lorenz system , the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation in the chaotic regime, and the Navier–Stokes equations.

We first approximate the structural interval equilibrium equation using a bivariate dimension-reduction method. An explicit expression for the sequence of displacements is derived by approximating the inverse of the structural interval stiffness matrix using the Neumann series . Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis can effectively avoid the response interval expansion caused by parameter coupling. For improving the convergence speed and computational accuracy , the displacement response sequence is accelerated by a vector ɛ ɛ ɛ acceleration algorithm and an adaptive strategy. Finally, three engineering structures with uncertain-but-bounded parameters are analyzed with the proposed method. Compared with conventional interval analysis methods, the proposed method effectively balances computational accuracy and efficiency, making it more suitable for non-linear and large uncertainty problems with multiple interval parameters.

  abstract     = {High-throughput (several thousand) calculations have been carried out to investigate the yield behavior of porous materials with randomly distributed pores, porosity levels over four orders of magnitude and up to a hundred pores per simulation box. To this end, a Galerkin based fast Fourier transform (FFT) formulation was enhanced to deal with high phase contrast materials. In addition, GPU parallelization was employed in solving the governing equation for strain fluctuations using a Krylov iterative solver. Emphasis is laid on the conditions under which percolation of plastically non-deforming zones through the porous network emerge, a regime termed unhomogeneous yielding . By way of contrast, the regime where the plastic strain fluctuations (associated with the heterogeneous void-matrix aggregate) fall below the percolation threshold is defined as homogeneous yielding . We find that nonuniform pore distributions only affect unhomogeneous yielding and have a universal softening effect. The extent of this distribution softening is analyzed as a function of porosity, cell size and number of realizations. Whether the uncovered universal distribution softening has direct implications on failure resistance of porous materials is discussed.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient method for topology optimization of composite structures with spatially varying fiber orientations using GPU acceleration. One of the challenges in solving such problems is that the element stiffness matrices are not the same even for congruent elements, thus all the element stiffness matrices have to be computed on-the-fly or pre-computed and stored in advance, which can significantly increase the computational burden or memory requirement. To address this challenge, this work exploits both the structure of the Cartesian grids and the element stiffness matrices . By extending the idea of template stiffness matrices (TSMs) for 2D problems, each element stiffness matrix in 3D problems can be expressed as a linear combination of 21 TSMs, with the coefficients being derived from the corresponding elasticity matrix . As a result, only the TSMs need to be pre-computed and stored in memory, reducing the computational burden and memory requirement. Combining with the MGPCG method, an efficient linear solver for problems with spatially varying composite materials is developed. Further, the Node-by-Node (NbN) and Element-by-Element (EbE) strategies for sparse matrix–vector multiplication (SpMV) computation and two strategies for handling the elasticity matrices are implemented and compared to determine their effectiveness. Additionally, decoupled sensitivity analysis and design variables updating methods are introduced to further enhance the efficiency of topology optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples using both consumer-grade and high-end GPU cards. It is shown that topology optimization problems with 33.6 million elements and 100.8 million design variables can be solved with 150 iterations in approximately 2.9 h using a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.},

  abstract     = {Numerical coarsening is an approach that constructs coarsened shape (or basis) functions for simulating heterogeneous structures on a coarse mesh, and seeks the fine mesh solution on a finite dimensional space spanned by these shape functions. It avoids the challenging issue of conforming meshing , reduces computational costs while maintaining high simulation accuracy, and has huge potential in the simulation of composites or even complex CAD models in fictitious domain methods. The C 1 C1 -continuity of the coarsened shape functions is of vital importance in determining the simulation quality, such as the continuity of stress solution, but till now has not been developed. In addressing the issue, the study proposes to construct coarsened shape functions using B-spline patches (piecewise surfaces in 2D or volumes in 3D). By carefully devising an intermediate interpolation patch that covers the coarse element boundaries, important properties of C 1 C1 -continuity and partition of unity are achieved, being able to produce high simulation stability and accuracy. By being explicitly formulated as two sequent displacement mappings from coarse nodes to the boundary fine nodes and then to the interior fine nodes, the shape functions are cheaply derived with small efforts in solving a small-size linear system for each coarse element. Performance of the coarsened shape functions, implemented within the material point method (MPM), is demonstrated through various numerical examples in comparisons with benchmark results in terms of stability, simulation accuracy, and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the need for more efficient and seamless integration of physical models and data, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have seen a surge of interest in recent years. However, ensuring the reliability of their convergence and accuracy remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an efficient, gradient-less weighting scheme for PINNs that accelerates the convergence of dynamic or static systems. This simple yet effective attention mechanism is a bounded function of the evolving cumulative residuals and aims to make the optimizer aware of problematic regions at no extra computational cost or adversarial learning. We illustrate that this general method consistently achieves one order of magnitude faster convergence than vanilla PINNs and a minimum relative L 2 L2 error of O ( 1 0 − 5 ) O(10−5) , on typical benchmarks of the literature. The method is further tested on the inverse solution of the Navier–Stokes within the brain perivascular spaces, where it considerably improves the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, an ablation study is performed for each case to identify the contribution of the components that enhance the vanilla PINN formulation. Evident from the convergence trajectories is the ability of the optimizer to effectively escape from poor local minima or saddle points while focusing on the challenging domain regions, which consistently have a high residual score. We believe that alongside exact boundary conditions and other model reparameterizations, this type of attention mask could be an essential element for fast training of both PINNs and neural operators.},

This study develops a novel computational framework to elucidate the various mesoscale failure mechanisms of UHPFRC that can occur concurrently or consecutively. A bi-scalar damage-plasticity model (Wu-Li model) is employed to efficiently capture the failure characteristics of mortar. Nonlinear cohesive elements are inserted between fibres and mortar to explicitly simulate the interfacial bonding and debonding behaviour. The UHPFRC models are validated by pullout tests of single steel fibres with different inclination angles and direct tensile tests of UHPFRC samples with many oriented/un-oriented fibres. Afterwards, this work conducts comprehensive parametric analyses to quantify the influences of key material and geometric properties. The developed framework holds promise to enhance the understanding of UHPFRC damage and fracture behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods are widely used for solving hyperbolic conservation laws , supplemented with troubled cell indicators and limiters to capture discontinuous solutions . However, traditional troubled cell indicators, such as the total variation bounded (TVB) minmod indicator and KXRCF indicator, generally rely on a critical parameter that is dependent on the solution of PDEs and needs tuning in a case-by-case manner. Moreover, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, widely deployed as a limiter in RKDG methods to capture shock discontinuities, is highly dissipative and may substantially smear the small-scale flow structures. In this work, a new troubled cell indicator and a new limiter for RKDG methods based on targeted essentially non-oscillatory (TENO) scheme are proposed to overcome the above limitations. The proposed new troubled cell indicator adopts a uniform parameter for different cases, while the new limiter deploys a distinct smoothness indicator for enhancing robustness and a TENO stencil selection strategy to achieve a significantly lower numerical dissipation. A set of benchmark cases including strong shockwaves and a broad range of flow length scales is simulated to demonstrate the performance of the new scheme. The smooth accuracy test cases demonstrate that the new troubled cell indicator does not activate the nonlinear limiter, indicating its ability to accurately identify smooth regions without misjudging critical points as troubled cells. Additionally, more cases with discontinuities show the accuracy of the new troubled cell indicator and the low-dissipation property of the new limiter in comparison to the KXRCF indicator and the WENO limiter.},

We term this type of non-PCMs as ‘enhancer’, which includes materials like graphite and copper foam, usually with a complex skeleton structure (He et al., 2023 [1] ; Yang et al., 2018 [2] ).In this article, we propose a phase field model to describe the solidification and melting phenomena of PCMs with enhancer from a microscopic point of view. Our model is governed by the energy equation coupled with the Allen–Cahn equation. A penalty technique is applied in the Allen–Cahn equation to describe the complex structure of the non-PCMs. We use the concept of thermal resistance to define the boundary condition on the contact interface of two materials to ensure the temperature jump. Thanks to the hybrid dual formulation, the temperature can be solved as a monolithic function while satisfying the temperature jump on the material interface. In temporal discretization, a numerical scheme is developed to decouple the phase field from the temperature. In the spatial discretization, the hybrid finite element method, the Raviart–Thomas (RT0) and P0 elements are used to solve the temperature, to satisfy the temperature jump on the interface. Simulations are performed using the open source finite element software FreeFem++ . To improve computational efficiency, under the framework of FreeFem++ , the mesh refinement is conducted by the Mmg module, and the parallelization is performed by the domain decomposition library ffddm . 2D and 3D simulations are carried out for both melting and solidification processes of a fossil-based organic PCM, CRODATHERM60 in the graphite skeleton on different porous structures to validate our model.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the uncertainty of quantities of interest (QoIs) from physical systems is a primary objective in model validation. However, achieving this goal entails balancing the need for computational efficiency with the requirement for numerical accuracy. To address this trade-off, we propose a novel bi-fidelity formulation of variational auto-encoders (BF-VAE) designed to estimate the uncertainty associated with a QoI from low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) samples of the QoI. This model allows for the approximation of the statistics of the HF QoI by leveraging information derived from its LF counterpart. Specifically, we design a bi-fidelity auto-regressive model in the latent space which is integrated within the VAE’s probabilistic encoder–decoder structure. An effective algorithm is proposed to maximize the variational lower bound of the HF log-likelihood in the presence of limited HF data, resulting in the synthesis of HF realizations with a reduced computational cost. Additionally, we introduce the concept of the bi-fidelity information bottleneck (BF-IB) to provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the proposed BF-VAE model. Our numerical results demonstrate that the BF-VAE leads to considerably improved accuracy, as compared to a VAE trained using only HF data, when limited HF data is available.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution we provide numerical methods to implement full network models with particular application to affine isotropic networks as they are frequently applied in theories of rubber elasticity. Unlike the common approaches, the average of the single chains’ responses is not obtained by spherical integration but by solving a univariate integral expressed in terms of the squared stretch of a fibre’s or chain’s end-to-end vector. In addition to the free energy function of these individual elements the methods are informed by the statistical moments of the distribution of stretch in the network, which throughout the work is assumed to be determined by affine kinematics. We exemplify the proposed procedure for two quadrature methods, which distinguish in terms of the positions of the n n integration points and the corresponding weights. While the first method uses constant equal weights of 1 / n 1/n and hence only requires the computation of n n integration points, the second, Gauss-type method also requires the determination of the corresponding weights and builds on a recent development, previously implemented for up to 3 points (Britt &amp; Ehret, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 415, 2023). However, the structure of the solution strategy applies to a wider range of univariate quadrature rules. Both methods exemplified here can be made exact for polynomial chain free energy functions of arbitrary order, and are illustrated in application to the affine full network model of rubber elasticity with non-Gaussian chains. The results indicate high accuracy of the new methods and therefore identify them as useful and efficient alternatives to the existing approaches for computing the full network response.},

The proposed method couples the IXFEM (Tian and Wen, 2015; Tian et al., 2019) and the level set templated cover cutting method (LSTCCM) previously proposed by the authors (Wen et al., 2023). The issues of the standard XFEM arising in a multiple crack simulation, such as the difficulty of level set combination and the more severe ill-conditioning of the global stiffness matrix , are fundamentally eliminated through the above methodology. The crack-tip singularity enrichment is introduced to maintain high accuracy through an extra-DOF-free PU approximation (Tian, 2013). The LSTCCM is substantially enhanced by introducing novel techniques for treating (a) crack kinking and branching, (b) crack junction and intersection, and (c) crack tip movement and coalescence. After the above treatments, the LSTCCM is extended to model the geometry of 2-D evolving cracks in this paper. In addition, an adaptive interaction integral is empirically established for accurately evaluating the stress intensity factors (SIFs) of crack tips close to other cracks or crack tips. To facilitate the analysis of competing cracks, a prediction–correction scheme is proposed based on a set of turning point search algorithms. A calibration–verification–validation benchmarking system is carefully designed, and it highly demonstrates the accuracy, effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of the present approach.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, a nodal-based continuous-discontinuous deformation analysis (NCDDA) method is proposed to simulate the failure process of rock masses. A strategy of dividing the computational domain into “possible destructive region” and “non-destructive region” is proposed in the context of NCDDA method to model the failure process of jointed rock masses at the concerned region, as well as to reduce the computational consumption. In the non-destructive region, the failure of rock masses is not considered, and three-node triangular (Tria3) elements are adopted to discretize the corresponding physical domain. For the possible destructive area, although the corresponding physical domain is also discretized with Tria3 elements, artificial joint elements are adopted to connect adjacent Tria3 elements, and the failure of joint elements is used to characterize fracture initiation and propagation in rock masses. Furthermore, the contact potential which is used in the finite-discrete element method (FDEM) is adopted in the proposed NCDDA method to model large-scale opening and slipping of discontinuous interfaces. Compared to the traditional discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) method, the difficulty to determine the type of contact can be avoided in the NCDDA method. Several benchmark problems and engineering problems are used to validate the proposed NCDDA method for rock mechanics problems. The numerical results show that the NCDDA method can effectively model the movement of rock block system, as well as rock failure processes from continuous stage to discontinuous stage in both experimental scale and engineering scale.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of non-powder printing additive manufacturing , the removal of supports from enclosed voids has long posed a formidable challenge. In response to this challenge, inspired by the traditional approach of designing either self-supporting or infill-supporting structures, this paper presents a novel topology optimization method that allows for the free choice between the two types of support within same enclosed voids. The infill material not only serves as a support during the additive manufacturing process but also becomes an integral component of the final design, never requiring to be removed. Firstly, a bi-directional nonlinear virtual temperature method (BN-VTM) is introduced to identify enclosed voids. The BN-VTM adds virtual heating material in regions below a predefined temperature threshold and heat-absorbing material in regions exceeding the threshold. This strategy ensures that the maximum temperature within enclosed voids adheres strictly to the specified range, enhancing the precision of enclosed void identification throughout the iterative process. On this basis, by combining the filtering/projection method, an interpolation function for enclosed void structures that encompasses both self-supporting and infill-supporting structures is developed. This function also is applied to identify overhanging interfaces within enclosed voids. Finally, by constraining the overhang angles, the proposed topology optimization method automatically determines whether to design self-supporting structures to achieve steeper boundaries or internal infill support structures within enclosed voids. The problem of minimizing compliance under material volume fraction constraints is investigated, and sensitivity analysis is derived. Several numerical and printing examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization of transient dynamics is of great importance in engineering. However, the computational cost required by the repeated dynamic response and design sensitivity analysis during design iterations is often extremely high for large-scale problems, which significantly limits its practical application. To address this issue, we propose a new method based on successive iteration of analysis and design in conjunction with a quasi-static response-enhanced mode displacement method. The conventional mode displacement method requires an inner-loop iteration in addition to the outer-loop design updating, for finding the eigenmodes of the undamped system. In order to avoid the high computational burden caused by the nested double-loop solution, we employ the concept of successive iteration of analysis and design, which integrates approximate eigenvalue analysis and design variable updating into a single iteration loop. By this means, the eigenmodes are sequentially improved through a one-step inverse iteration in each design iteration, and simultaneous convergence of the eigenmodes and the design is sought during the optimization process. These approximate eigenmodes and the quasi-static response are used as the model reduction basis for each intermediate design, and the direct time integration of the reduced-dimensional system is then performed to calculate the structural responses of interest and their derivatives with respect to the design variables. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. It is shown that the method can be used to solve transient dynamic topology optimization problems up to 15 million degrees of freedom on a desktop computer at affordable time cost.},

In this study, an integrated, density-based multi-material and multi-scale optimization method for compliant structures with embedded movable piezoelectric actuators is proposed. The design variables in the optimization represent the location of the piezoelectric actuators and the layout of the macro/micro host structures. To mitigate the risk of suboptimal designs, the three sets of design variables are simultaneously optimized using gradient-based optimization where the gradients are computed using the adjoint method. A material interpolation model that describes the piezoelectric actuators, multiple lattice materials of the host structure as well as their coating layer is proposed. To illustrate the formulation, several compliant structures embedded with movable piezoelectric actuators are designed such that the displacement at an output port is maximized. Macro and micro volume fractions , and overlapping of piezoelectric actuators are constrained in the optimization.},

The objective is to ensure that the overall error of the method is below some preset tolerance, and we thus control and balance the error coming from the finite element method, and the one introduced by the neural network approximation. Two finite element methods are considered and compared; a fixed grid approach uses the same mesh for all values of the parameters, while an adaptive finite elements approach enforces the same discretization error uniformly in the parameters space. Numerical results are presented for an elliptic model problem. The fixed grid approach shows limitations in terms of error balancing and control, while the adaptive approach allows a better accuracy and more flexibility of the method.

The KRMG algorithm utilizes a new population shrinking mechanism to reduce the population size over subsequent iterations for reducing the computational burden. To evaluate the efficiency of the KRMG algorithm in solving global optimization challenges, it has been tested on IEEE CEC 2014, CEC 2017, CEC 2019, as well as CEC 2022 benchmark test challenges. Also, the performance of the KRMG algorithm has been evaluated for six constraint engineering design optimization problems. Furthermore, the KRMG algorithm has also been evaluated for the parameter identification of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) on three distinct PEMFC modules, including the BCS 500 W, Ballard Mark V, as well as 250 W stack. Experimental and statistical comparison with respect to jDE100, FROBL-GJO, LX-TLA, RW-GWO, LSHADE-EpSin, EBOwithCMAR, jSO, SHADE, SaDE, JADE and others, prove that the proposed KRMG is statistically significant with respect to other algorithms under comparison, and can be considered as a potential candidate for future research.},

Comparative analysis with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reveals the superior performance of GNNs in predicting unseen rock properties.

Finding the analytical form of Green’s function is a non-trivial exercise, especially for a PDE defined on a complex domain or a PDE with variable coefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary integral network to learn the domain-independent Green’s function, referred to as BIN-G. We evaluate the Green’s function in the BIN-G using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based neural network. We train the BIN-G by minimizing the residual of the PDE and the mean squared errors of the solutions to the boundary integral equations for prescribed test functions. By leveraging the symmetry of the Green’s function and controlling refinements of the RBF kernel near the singularity of the Green function, we demonstrate that our numerical scheme enables fast training and accurate evaluation of the Green’s function for PDEs with variable coefficients. The learned Green’s function is independent of the domain geometries, forcing terms, and boundary conditions in the boundary integral formulation. Numerical experiments verify the desired properties of the method and the expected accuracy for the two-dimensional Poisson and Helmholtz equations with variable coefficients.},

Hence, this paper contributes to develop the derivable skeletons with fully tractable sensitivity information for topology optimization. Specifically, an extra set of partial differential equation (PDE) for transient heat analysis is adopted, from which the skeletons are identified by distinguishing the divergence information of the temperatures. Sensitivity analysis of the skeleton-related terms is performed with the adjoint method owing to the existence of the PDE governing equation. The above technique for obtaining derivable skeletons is compatible to the density-based topology optimization method. Then, on top of the derived skeletons, we impose the smoothing PDE filter and Heaviside projection to dilate the skeletons into the final physical structure with desired length scales . A constant dilation radius leads to a unified length scale, while imposing a range of dilation radii achieves the length scale control with minimum-maximum bounds for which, the dilation radius would also be regarded as a design variable. Finally, several numerical 2D examples are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed length scale control method .},

  abstract     = {Fluid–structure interaction (FSI) occurs in a wide range of contexts, from aeronautics to biological systems. To numerically address this challenging type of problem, various methods have been proposed, particularly using implicit coupling when the fluid and the solid have the same density, i.e., the density ratio is equal to 1. Aiming for a computationally efficient approach capable of handling strongly coupled dynamics and/or realistic conditions, we present an alternative to the implicit formulation by employing a fully explicit algorithm. The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is used for the fluid, with the finite element method (FEM) utilized for the structure. The Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is applied to simulate moving and deforming boundaries immersed in fluid flows. The novelty of this work lies in the combination of Laplacian smoothing at the fluid/solid interface, an improved collision model for the LBM, and a reduction of non-physical frequencies on the structure mesh. The use of these adaptations results in a solver with remarkable stability properties, a primary concern when dealing with explicit coupling. We validate the numerical framework on several challenging test cases of increasing complexity, including 2D and 3D configurations, density ratio of 1, and turbulent conditions.},

Yet, the discrepancies arising from incompressibility assumptions often compromise the accuracy of LCSs constructed using Lagrangian particle methods. In this study, we introduce a modified framework to compute Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLEs), addressing the misalignment between the fully incompressible assumption of LCS theory and the inherent incompressibility loss in simulations of particle methods. We begin by examining the correlation between the minimum and maximum FTLEs. By incorporating the deformation gradient and Cauchy-Green strain tensor which account for the time-advancing errors of incompressibility based on continuum theory , we enhance the computational accuracy of FTLEs. Moreover, we introduce the modified FTLE algorithm to the incompressible particle-in-cell (PIC) method for resolving free surface flows and fluid-structure interaction problems. Finally, numerical examples including the Tayler-Green vortices, water sloshing with baffles, an eccentric box sinking in water, and three-dimensional shear-driven cavity problems with high Reynolds numbers are tested to validate the effectiveness of the modified FTLE algorithm and the improved LCSs. These results demonstrate that the proposed modification scheme adeptly counteracts the errors caused by incompressibility loss, enabling accurate computation of FTLEs and detection of LCSs.},

  abstract     = {Stress-minimization topology optimization with multi-phase materials is still an academic challenge, especially for three-dimensional (3D) problems. This paper proposes a novel stress-based multi-material topology optimization method to achieve a 3D stress-minimization design involving unstructured meshes . A comprehensive stair form interpolation model is introduced to address both stiff penalization and stress relaxation issues. In this model, only one type of nodal design variable is introduced to represent the multi-material density field, which is projected to the physical parameter field using smooth Heaviside functions with varied threshold settings. To minimize the global measure of stress, the P-norm stress aggregation function is established and a multi-material topology optimization problem with an arbitrary number of volume constraints is formulated. Additionally, the adjoint sensitivity analysis is performed and the provided interpolation model adaptively updates the interpolation parameters. Finally, the presented methodology is validated by several three-dimensional design examples, including a supported beam , bridge, and airplane bearing bracket.},

  abstract     = {Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate modeling and design optimization by incorporating data from both high- and various low-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed training set, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among models with different fidelities can achieve higher efficiency in the exploration and exploitation of the design space. However, these methods either rely on the hierarchical assumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture their intercorrelation which is critical in quantifying the benefit of future samples for the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose an MF adaptive sampling framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and an associated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlations to quantify the benefit of the candidate samples as the sampling criteria. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes two steps: First, we identify the HF location of interest with the greatest potential improvement of the high-fidelity (HF) model, and then search for the next sample across all fidelity levels that maximizes the improvement per unit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible by a single Latent variable gaussian process (LVGP) model that maps different fidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their correlations without assuming any hierarchy between fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us to assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with a pre-posterior analysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio. Furthermore, the proposed method offers the flexibility to switch between global fitting (GF) and Bayesian optimization (BO) by simply changing the acquisition function. Through test cases, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both MF GF and BO problems in the rate of convergence and robustness.},

Based on the damage gradients, the location of the discrete crack surface is identified, and the crack transition is performed by applying the EBS basis functions. Here, the EBS basis functions are constructed so that the support domain of the basis function contains only a single physical domain separated by the crack surface. Accordingly, the crack transition is achieved without additional degrees of freedom to represent the individual movement of separated domains. Additionally, remeshing with reconfiguration of connectivity and reconstruction of tangent matrices are not needed. To verify the performance of the developed scheme, three representative numerical examples are presented.},

  abstract     = {Shape memory alloys (SMAs) possess considerable complexity in response to thermomechanical load due to their strong dependence on strain, stress, temperature and history. This high complexity is a limiting factor in the fatigue analysis of SMA structures. With this in mind, a comprehensive phenomenological model is developed to address nearly all of the features in SMAs with a particular focus on the development of damage. Due to the fact that many SMA structures experience large deformations , the model is developed in finite strains using the logarithmic strain space approach. Besides the balance of linear momentum , the model includes the heat conduction equation and two micromorphic nonlocal balance laws. The latter are introduced to regularize the softening associated with the damage and transformation. The material model incorporates a damage evolution law that depends on the integration of a simplified dissipation term . The model is applied to a few examples to observe the interaction of the features and to illustrate the applicability of the model for rupture and fatigue analysis. The interaction of the features is shown to produce a reasonable representation of the cyclic loading of wires at different loading rates. Rupture is shown to occur due to a large amount of plastic strain and can be performed due to the nonlocal approach for the damage. The fatigue analysis shows some promising accuracy but only if the dissipated area is captured properly.},

The effect of active control can be equivalent to the damping. Considering the influence of uncertainty, the structural dynamic response of the system will be within the interval range. Due to the monotonicity of the steady-state displacement response on uncertain parameters and the monotonicity of dynamic flexibility on uncertain parameters are both difficult to determine, a more accurate upper and lower limit is obtained using the collocation method. With the constraints of reliability and volume, the robustness index is defined based on the dynamic flexibility of the structure and defined as the objective function to establish the robust topology optimization model. In terms of optimization solution, the reliability index is transformed into the constraint translation distance. The sensitivity of constraint functions and objective functions to design variables is derived by employing the chain derivative method and the adjoint vector method.

  abstract     = {In numerical simulations of cardiac mechanics, coupling the heart to a model of the circulatory system is essential for capturing physiological cardiac behavior. A popular and efficient technique is to use an electrical circuit analogy, known as a lumped parameter network or zero-dimensional (0D) fluid model, to represent blood flow throughout the cardiovascular system. Due to the strong physical interaction between the heart and the blood circulation, developing accurate and efficient numerical coupling methods remains an active area of research. In this work, we present a modular framework for implicitly coupling three-dimensional (3D) finite element simulations of cardiac mechanics to 0D models of blood circulation. The framework is modular in that the circulation model can be modified independently of the 3D finite element solver, and vice versa. The numerical scheme builds upon a previous work that combines 3D blood flow models with 0D circulation models (3D fluid–0D fluid). Here, we extend it to couple 3D cardiac tissue mechanics models with 0D circulation models (3D structure–0D fluid), showing that both mathematical problems can be solved within a unified coupling scheme. The effectiveness, temporal convergence, and computational cost of the algorithm are assessed through multiple examples relevant to the cardiovascular modeling community. Importantly, in an idealized left ventricle example, we show that the coupled model yields physiological pressure–volume loops and naturally recapitulates the isovolumic contraction and relaxation phases of the cardiac cycle without any additional numerical techniques. Furthermore, we provide a new derivation of the scheme inspired by the Approximate Newton Method of Chan (1985), explaining how the proposed numerical scheme combines the stability of monolithic approaches with the modularity and flexibility of partitioned approaches.},

  abstract     = {The small deformation formulation of the thermal field dislocation mechanics model (Upadhyay, J. Mech. Phys. Solids , 145 (2020) 104150) is numerically implemented using the finite element method. The implementation consists of solving a first-order div–curl system to obtain an incompatible plastic distortion from a prescribed polar dislocation density along with three governing partial differential equations (PDE): the dislocation transport equation (a first-order hyperbolic PDE), the static equilibrium equation (an elliptic PDE), and the temperature evolution equation (a parabolic PDE). A combination of continuous Galerkin (for the elliptic and parabolic PDEs) and discontinuous Galerkin (for the hyperbolic PDE) space discretizations and Runge–Kutta time discretizations are used to implement these equations in a staggered algorithm and obtain stable solutions at (quasi-)optimal convergence rates. The implementation is verified by comparing the simulation-predicted temperature evolution of a moving edge dislocation with an analytical solution. Next, the contribution of plastic dissipation and thermoelastic effect to the temperature evolution during the motion of an edge and a screw dislocation, annihilation of two edge dislocations and expansion of a dislocation loop are studied in detail. In the case of a moving edge dislocation, contrary to existing literature, the thermoelastic effect is demonstrated to have a more significant contribution to temperature evolution than plastic dissipation for the studied traction boundary condition and dislocation velocity expression. In the dislocation loop expansion case, the role of free surfaces on temperature evolution is highlighted. As the loop approaches the free surfaces, plastic dissipation is found to have an increasing contribution to temperature evolution due to the growing impact of image stresses.},

The field has long been dominated by high-order finite differences, which lack the flexibility and adaptivity for simulations of complex geometries and flame-turbulence-structure interactions in realistic settings. In this work I introduce a new approach to DNS of premixed combustion, based on a high-order mesh-free discretisation in combination with finite differences, enabling high-order simulations in non-trivial geometries. The approach is validated against a range of two- and three-dimensional flows, both laminar and turbulent, and reacting and inert. The present method (a) has the resolving power for DNS of both laminar flames and inert turbulence with comparable accuracy to high-order finite differences, (b) can capture the dynamics of unsteady bluff body stabilised flames, and (c) is capable of simulating flame-turbulence interactions, with results comparing qualitatively well with published data. This work paves the way for DNS of combustion in complex geometries, offering an alternative approach to methods based on structured grids with immersed boundaries, or unstructured meshes. Further studies with the present method are proposed, which will aid understanding of fundamental flame dynamics in non-trivial geometries. Planned developments in adaptivity and extension of the mesh-free construction to all three dimensions will increase the value of the method, and support the push towards DNS of real geometries.},

  abstract     = {Grid-stiffened structures have excellent performance, such as high specific stiffness and strength, and are widely used as critical load-bearing structures in aerospace equipment, including launch vehicles and spacecraft. It is now a well-established fact that curvilinearly stiffened panels with curved stiffener paths and varying stiffness distributions significantly improve load-bearing efficiency. However, existing methods are usually designed based on two clusters of approximately orthogonal stiffeners, which may limit the design flexibility and load-carrying potential of such structures. In the proposed design method, various complex variations of curved stiffener layouts can be characterized with a simple set of variables by establishing a database of stiffener unit cells and feature dimension reduction, as well as using coordinate transformation and monotonicity preserving interpolation methods for geometric dimension reduction, respectively, which allows simultaneous selection of basic stiffener unit cells and adjustment of stiffener paths. Based on the structure characterization with high design flexibility, the hyperparameter dimension reduction of the Kriging model is introduced, thereby forming an optimization framework through multi-level dimension reduction, while ensuring the efficiency of the optimization process. Moreover, an accurate geometric modeling based on NURBS is proposed to meet the needs of designing stiffened structures on various types of complex surfaces. In two typical aerospace cases, the developed structural concept and design method can improve structural performance by over 80 % compared to initial design schemes with straight stiffeners and constant stiffness. The results demonstrate that both the developed structural concept and design methodology effectively enhance the upper performance design limit of stiffened structures. These findings are practically significant for the application of advanced lightweight thin-walled structures in aerospace equipment.},

Mixed nonlinear kinematics are developed for the reduced-order method using co-rotational and updated von Kármán formulations. The co-rotational kinematics are applied to determine the internal force and tangent stiffness, whereas the third- and fourth-order strain energy derivatives are calculated using the updated von Kármán kinematics. Reduced-order models with one degree of freedom is constructed based on the perturbation theory, the solutions of which are nonlinear predictors of the geometrically nonlinear response. The use of mixed nonlinear kinematics significantly reduces the computational cost of constructing a reduced-order model. Nonlinear predictors are corrected using internal force-based residuals to ensure the accuracy of the geometrically nonlinear analysis. A geometrically nonlinear response with favorable smoothness is efficiently achieved using large step sizes in the path-following analysis. Various numerical examples, including the stiffened plate and wing structure, are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The TFA approach, originally proposed for homogenization purposes, is (i) extended to account for arbitrary boundary conditions (i.e. not only those suitable for homogenization), (ii) endowed with an iterative Newton–Raphson solution scheme involving the consistent tangent matrix and (iii) provided with an arc-length strategy to follow possible snap-back branches. The extension to arbitrary boundary conditions leads to an efficient reduced-order modeling approach for solving complex non-linear problems. Numerical tests demonstrate that the approach performs well in challenging scenarios with several interfaces, and that sharp and multiple snap-back branches can be followed. The comparison with finite element results shows that the proposed technique yields fast yet accurate solutions.},

  abstract     = {The modeling of mixed-mode fracture within the phase field (PF) framework poses a challenge due to the difficulties in incorporating a reasonable mixed-mode cohesive law. This work proposes an innovative phase-field formulation to characterize mixed-mode cohesive fracture behaviors in fiber-reinforced composites (FRCs). The framework commences with the development of a multi-phase-field model capable of considering different failure mechanisms in FRCs within a thermodynamically consistent framework. Subsequently, a mixed-mode cohesive zone model (CZM) featuring the linear traction-separation law (TSL) is derived based on the careful construction of the PF driving force and degradation function. We mathematically prove that the proposed CZM effectively and rigorously characterizes the Hashin failure criteria for crack initiation and the power law criterion for crack propagation. Finally, several benchmark examples involving Mode-I/II and mixed-mode failures are investigated to demonstrate the model&#39;s capability in accurately predicting the cohesive fracture behaviors in FRCs, encompassing both the failure mechanisms dominated by fiber and matrix. This work paves the way for the PF modeling of fracture in FRCs that have previously been analyzed with sophisticated CZM-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {The existing topology optimization methods are mostly based on traditional continuum mechanics approaches to deal with cross-scale and multi-material problems considering interfaces. Unfortunately, the inability of traditional continuum mechanics models to capture the size dependence of microscale structural deformation behavior limits their application in the optimization design of advanced micro and nanostructures. Hence, a new cross-scale optimization of multi-material structures considering interface is proposed based on Wei-Hutchinson strain gradient theory, which could describe and explain the size dependence during optimization process. Firstly, a new interpolation scheme is developed to identify interfaces between two arbitrary materials and ensure precise control of the interface width. Then, through geometric adaptive projection techniques, the behavior at the interface and the macro-micro mechanical behaviors are cleverly projected and solved within a nine-node quadrilateral finite element set. After that, the geometric parameters of adaptive geometric components under the framework of the movable deformable component method introduce non-periodic infill microstructures into multi-material topology optimization considering interfaces, achieving minimization of compliance. Results show that the compliance of the non-periodically infilled microstructure multi-material layout can be significantly improved by considering size effects compared with periodically uniform infilled microstructure multi-material layouts in the process of cross-scale optimization. Furthermore, the new optimization algorithm can effectively control the stress levels of the overall structure as well as the stress at the interfaces of heterogeneous materials, thereby reducing the stress concentration effects in critical stress region.},

  abstract     = {The computational analysis of nanophotonic devices is usually carried out via the standard finite element method (FEM). However, FEM requires meshes that are fitted to the devices’ boundaries, so making changes to the geometry (and thus the mesh) results in an inefficient process at best. Such an approach is therefore at odds when conducting design, which requires the analysis of multiple device geometries until reaching a satisfactory solution. Computational design tools such as topology optimization are often used, but the use of density-based representations of geometry inevitably leads to other issues—e.g., pixelized fuzzy boundaries with “gray material” (that does not correspond to dielectric nor vacuum) have an adverse effect on the devices’ interaction with electromagnetic waves . In this paper we propose an interface-enriched generalized finite element method (IGFEM) for the analysis of two-dimensional electromagnetic scattering and eigenvalue problems . IGFEM enables the use of finite element meshes that are completely decoupled from the problem’s geometry. The analysis procedure is further coupled to a level set description of topology, resulting in a versatile enriched approach to topology optimization; this level set-based interface-enriched topology optimization procedure is devoid of the issues mentioned above regarding density-based methods, and yields crisp “black-and-white” designs that are devoid of jagged fuzzy edges. We first demonstrate that the analysis procedure achieves the same convergence rate as that of standard FEM using geometry-fitted meshes. We then compare the convergence properties of IGFEM with Nitsche’s method on a problem containing an embedded straight interface. Finally, we conduct topology optimization for designing both a 2-D metalens and a 2-D reflector, maximizing their ability to focus light onto a target point.},

  abstract     = {The coupled dynamics of interfacial fluid phases and unconstrained solid particles during the binder jet 3D printing process govern the final quality and performance of the resulting components. The present work proposes a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) framework capable of simulating the complex interfacial fluid–particle interaction that occurs when binder microdroplets are deposited into a powder bed. The CFD solver uses a volume-of-fluid (VOF) method for capturing liquid–gas multifluid flows and relies on block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to localize grid refinement around evolving fluid–fluid interfaces. The DEM module resolves six degrees of freedom particle motion and accounts for particle contact, cohesion, and rolling resistance. Fully-resolved CFD-DEM coupling is achieved through a fictitious domain immersed boundary (IB) approach. An improved method for enforcing three-phase contact lines with a VOF-IB extension technique is introduced. We present several simulations of binder jet primitive formation using realistic process parameters and material properties. The DEM particle systems are experimentally calibrated to reproduce the cohesion behavior of physical nickel alloy powder feedstocks. We demonstrate the proposed model’s ability to resolve the interdependent fluid and particle dynamics underlying the process by directly comparing simulated primitive granules with one-to-one experimental counterparts obtained from an in-house validation apparatus. This computational framework provides unprecedented insight into the fundamental mechanisms of binder jet 3D printing and presents a versatile new approach for process parameter optimization and defect mitigation that avoids the inherent challenges of experiments.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GAN) have recently been used for a design synthesis of mechanical shapes. A GAN sometimes outputs physically unreasonable shapes. For example, when a GAN model is trained to output airfoil shapes that indicate the required aerodynamic performance , significant errors occur in the performance values. This is because the GAN model only considers data but does not consider the aerodynamic equations that lie under the data. This paper proposes the physics-guided training of the GAN model to guide the model to learn physical validity. Physical validity is computed using general-purpose software located outside the neural network model . Such general-purpose software cannot be used in physics-informed neural network frameworks, because physical equations must be implemented inside the neural network models. Additionally, a limitation of generative models is that the output data are similar to the training data and cannot generate completely new shapes. However, because the proposed model is guided by a physical model and does not use a training dataset, it can generate completely new shapes. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model drastically improves the accuracy. Moreover, the output shapes differ from those of the training dataset but still satisfy physical validity, overcoming the limitations of existing GAN models.},

  abstract     = {A composite material typically exhibits complex behavior at the engineer scale, arising from the interactions between its underlying constituent phases, as well as the competitions between micro-processes. It is generally a daunting task to develop an engineering model to adequately capture the essential micro mechanisms that propagate onto the macro scale. To this end, the multiscale computational homogenization (FE 2 2 ) method enables a consistent coupling across length scales, to give results that compare well with direct numerical simulations having the full micro-structural details, without the need for any constitutive assumptions nor calibrations at the macro scale. Despite its predictive capabilities, the typical computational homogenization method is still computationally too expensive for most practical problems, as the coupling between micro and macro scales are solved simultaneously during its numerical implementation. In this presentation, focusing on the elastoplastic behavior of fiber-reinforced composite, we address this bottleneck with an offline development of a microscopic surrogate model for a given micro-structure, to be incorporated into a standard nonlinear FE framework, for rapid online implementations at the macro scale. For the offline training phase, we adopt the transformer-based architecture within a pre-training and fine-tuning framework. The proposed pre-trained transformer model is capable of parallelizing computations to effectively capture global dependencies within the strain-stress data sequences. To reduce the data generation cost, a constructed source representative volume element (RVE) having a single central heterogeneity with an identical volume fraction with the target RVE is utilized, to rapidly generate a huge source dataset for a pre-training process. The performance of the surrogate model is first demonstrated by comparing its predictions under random loading paths against the reference homogenized RVE responses. Next, the surrogate model is incorporated into a macro FE framework, and its predictive capabilities illustrated via the generic loading of two specimens with different microstructures, each having a different loading–unloading path. Finally, a chunking method is discussed as a potential remedy for managing very long load sequences.},

  abstract     = {We present a framework for the multiscale modeling of finite strain magneto-elasticity based on physics-augmented neural networks (NNs). By using a set of problem specific invariants as input, an energy functional as the output and by adding several non-trainable expressions to the overall total energy density functional, the model fulfills multiple physical principles by construction, e.g., thermodynamic consistency, material symmetry and a stress-free and non-magnetized unloaded configuration. Three NN-based models with varying requirements in terms of an extended polyconvexity condition and the growth condition of the magneto-elastic potential are presented. First, polyconvexity, which is a global concept, is enforced via input convex neural networks (ICNNs). Afterwards, we introduce the new concept of a relaxed local version of the polyconvexity and fulfill it in a weak sense by adding a tailored loss term. As an alternative, a loss term to enforce the weaker requirement of strong ellipticity locally is proposed, which can be favorable to obtain a better compatibility with data. Databases for training of the models are generated via computational homogenization for both compressible and quasi-incompressible magneto-active polymers (MAPs). To reduce the computational cost, 2D statistical volume elements and an invariant-based sampling technique for the pre-selection of relevant states are used. All models are calibrated by using the database, whereby interpolation and extrapolation are considered separately. Furthermore, the performance of the NN models is compared to a conventional model from the literature. The numerical study suggests that the proposed NN approach is advantageous over the conventional model for MAPs. Thereby, the two more flexible NN models in combination with the weakly enforced local polyconvexity lead to good results, whereas the model based only on ICNNs has proven to be too restrictive.},

The proposed scheme accurately captures significant lateral deformation , previously ignored by conventional 2D models. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, the effect of time-dependent yield stress on layer deformation is considered by introducing the structuration rate. Further, to leverage advantages in avoiding mesh generation and additional interface tracking, a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method incorporating the regularized Bingham model is equipped in the proposed framework. The simulated cross-sectional shapes exhibit excellent consistency with experimental results and outperform existing numerical results across various nozzle heights, printing velocities, and extrusion velocities . Our exploration of rheological parameters reveals that the final layer deformation is influenced by the yield stress, while its deformation rate is affected by the plastic viscosity .

An important check on the reliability of surrogate models is Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), a self assessed estimate of the model error. Accurate UQ allows for cost savings by reducing both the required size of training data sets and the required safety factors, while poor UQ prevents users from confidently relying on model predictions. We introduce two quality measures for the quantification of uncertainty that are suitable for high dimensional problems: the distribution of normalized residuals on validation data and the distribution of estimated uncertainties. While the distribution of estimated uncertainties evaluates how confident the model is in making predictions, the distribution of normalized residuals evaluates how accurate these uncertainty estimates are We examine several machine learning techniques, including both Gaussian processes and a family UQ-augmented neural networks: Ensemble neural networks (ENN), Bayesian neural networks (BNN), Dropout neural networks (D-NN), and Gaussian neural networks (G-NN). We evaluate UQ accuracy (distinct from model accuracy) We apply these metrics to two model data sets representative of complex dynamical systems: an ocean engineering problem in which a ship traverses irregular wave episodes, and a dispersive wave turbulence system with extreme events, the Majda–McLaughlin–Tabak model.

  abstract     = {Physics-constrained neural networks are commonly employed to enhance prediction robustness compared to purely data-driven models, achieved through the inclusion of physical constraint losses during the model training process. However, one of the major challenges of physics-constrained neural networks consists of the training complexity especially for high-dimensional systems. In fact, conventional physics-constrained models rely on singular-fidelity data necessitating the assessment of physical constraints within high-dimensional fields, which introduces computational difficulties. Furthermore, due to the fixed input size of the neural networks, employing multi-fidelity training data can also be cumbersome. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Scale Physics-Constrained Neural Network (MSPCNN), which offers a novel methodology for incorporating data with different levels of fidelity into a unified latent space through a customised multi-fidelity autoencoder. Additionally, multiple decoders are concurrently trained to map latent representations of inputs into various fidelity physical spaces. As a result, during the training of predictive models, physical constraints can be evaluated within low-fidelity spaces, yielding a trade-off between training efficiency and accuracy. In addition, unlike conventional methods, MSPCNN also manages to employ multi-fidelity data to train the predictive model. We assess the performance of MSPCNN in two fluid dynamics problems, namely a two-dimensional Burgers’ system and a shallow water system. Numerical results clearly demonstrate the enhancement of prediction accuracy and noise robustness when introducing physical constraints in low-fidelity fields. On the other hand, as expected, the training complexity can be significantly reduced by computing physical constraint loss in the low-fidelity field rather than the high-fidelity one.},

Although this switch can cause unwanted numerical diffusion, that problem can be suppressed using periodic or blending options. Several examples illustrate the new methods for heat conduction , solvent transport, poroelasticity, and phase field fracture simulations. In thermal calculations, the new methods improve accuracy for tracking thermodynamics state functions .},

  abstract     = {Creation of new alloys through in-situ alloying in additive manufacturing is being actively explored to improve the properties and performance of manufactured parts. Multiphysics models are often used to investigate the underlying physics controlling AM processes using high-fidelity simulations of individual powder particle melting within the meltpool. In this paper, we present a novel multiphysics-multiphase model for simulating multicomponent powder beds during the AM process. A convection–diffusion formulation for component mass fraction, in conjunction with the Navier–Stokes equations and enthalpy form of the energy equation, enable us to predict the phase evolution in multicomponent beds and the dispersion of solute metals in the melt pool during the process. A non-equilibrium phase diagram (NEPD) model that incorporates the associated phase diagram is introduced to obtain the mass fraction in both solid and liquid phases as well as local temperature and liquid fraction by efficiently solving a set of nonlinear equations locally at each computational cell. This work introduces a numerical method for multicomponent Al-Zr binary material system for light-weight aluminum alloys, specifically demonstrating its efficacy and accuracy for eutectic solidification of this multicomponent.},

In this paper, the added degree of freedom method (ADM) is developed as a novel approach to address absorbing boundary challenges in finite element analysis. In ADM, additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) are introduced within the absorbing domain to attenuate outgoing elastic waves. For the proposed ADM to implement the absorbing boundary, the stiffness and mass properties of both the added DOFs and conventional DOFs within the absorbing domain are adjusted. This adjustment aims to reduce the propagation speed of elastic waves within the medium, and to prolong the duration of interaction between elastic waves and the surrounding medium. Consequently, the vibrations of nodes can be effectively attenuated by applying damping forces to the added DOFs. The numerical results show that the ADM has the ability to absorb one-dimensional and two-dimensional elastic waves across a broad range of frequencies. Therefore, the proposed ADM offers an innovative solution for modeling absorbing boundaries in various scientific and engineering applications, addressing the challenges of simulating wave propagation within finite computational domains.},

  abstract     = {The computational bottleneck of reduced order models (ROMs) in nonlinear homogenization is usually given by the local material laws, which need to be evaluated in a large number of microscopic integration points. Hyper-reduction methods use only a small subset of the integration points and reach tremendous speed-ups at high accuracy. However, the underintegration breaks the overall compatibility of the microscopic strain field and is in this sense disrespecting the microscopic boundary value problem. Here, a new type of generalized integration points is introduced in strain space in order to remedy this shortcoming. Being inspired by results from nonlinear homogenization theory, the concept of statistical compatibility is developed and forms the theoretical basis for the new integration points, which respect the compatibility of the microscopic strain field in a statistical sense. The statistically compatible integration points can be derived offline and replace the conventional ones in a Galerkin-projection based setting with global modes identified via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The method is tested for various reinforced composites, indicating that 10-20 integration points are often sufficient to reach errors smaller than 3 % 3% , with CPU-times in the μ μ s-range (per time step). A possible extension of the method for problems with higher nonlinearity and stronger field fluctuations is discussed within the context of a porous microstructure.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel numerical algorithm to solve frictional contact problems in two-phase porous media, accounting for the large deformation and interface fluid flow, within the framework of the Stable Node-based Smoothed Particle Finite Element Method (SNS-PFEM). The proposed approach builds on our previous work that was only designed for single-phase large deformation contact problems. Within this work, the hydro-mechanical coupling system is discretized using equal-order interpolation, with a polynomial pressure projection method to eliminate the pore pressure instability. Surface-to-surface discretization is then applied to formulate the contact constraint of the two-phase porous medium. Using the dual Lagrange multiplier approach, a coordinate transformation is introduced to enforce the contact constraint of the solid phase. This transformation is subsequently utilized to develop a new interface fluid element, which serves as a tool to model the fluid exchange behaviour between porous media and contact gaps. Different from existing interface fluid elements, the proposed element is constructed based on the contact algorithm, thereby enabling it to handle non-conforming interfaces and tackle challenges associated with large sliding problems. Furthermore, the proposed method can maintain a well-conditioned system matrix throughout the computation process. These distinctive attributes significantly enhance the flexibility of numerical modelling. Finally, the accuracy and performance of our method are verified through four numerical examples . The results show that the proposed method can effectively simulate various geotechnical problems, including multi-layer soil consolidation, fluid-soil-structure interaction, and geological interface-controlled slope failure .},

  abstract     = {Mechanical parts produced via additive manufacturing method often needs a re-evaluation of their strength due to precision challenges. In this study, we introduce an adaptive extended isogeometric analysis (XIGA) method, grounded in an implicit geometric model , to assess structural strength. This method is seamlessly integrated with the phase field fracture theory to appraise part fracture strength and replicate crack propagation . The investigation encompasses both second-order and fourth-order phase-field models. The fourth-order phase-field model entails the computation of higher-order phase-field derivatives, necessitating the utilization of at least C1 continuous shape functions. This prerequisite is readily met through the application of isogeometric analysis. Moreover, we employ polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-splines) within this framework to enable localized hierarchical refinement. The adaptive refinement of boundary elements efficiently furnishes precise stress solutions, while substantially enhancing the computational efficiency of phase-field fracture analysis through adaptively refining the element near the crack. Numerical illustrations validate the method&#39;s exceptional accuracy in stress field solutions and fracture crack predictions. Experimental outcomes underscore the method&#39;s proficiency in faithfully capturing the propagation of cracks within intricate porous structures . Furthermore, we furnish a schematic outlining the process of assessing fracture strength in additively manufactured components, thereby emphasizing the promising utility of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {A numerical model is proposed to simulate significant yarn slippage and unweaving in woven fabrics using the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method. Woven fabrics were modeled at the yarn scale using 1D ALE elements with additional slip displacement degrees of freedom (DOF). The relatively weak bending stiffness of the yarn was included using a rotation-free approach. A weave kinematic constraint between crossing yarns allowed an efficient description of the deformation modes due to the yarn assembly such as in-plane shear. In particular, normal compaction at weave points was taken into account using an additional crimp amplitude DOF and couplings of the fabric’s cohesion with the normal and lateral compaction were considered. To deal with yarn unweaving, a specific void-ALE 1D element was developed in order to avoid remeshing, time-step reduction (explicit scheme) and early deactivation of the weave kinematic constraint. To demonstrate the capabilities of this numerical model, common characterization tests such as in-plane and out-of-plane pullouts, which induced unweaving were simulated. Finally, a first forming simulation on a hemisphere was performed to verify whether the cohesion of the fabric remained well represented in situations without loss of cohesion before simulating forming on a prismatic punch involving significant yarn slippage.},

Since the Mindlin plate is regarded as the research object of this PD model, the transverse shear deformation of laminates is considered. Also, the dilatation term is included in the force density vector, and flaws in Poisson&#39;s ratio of materials can be overcome. In the proposed PD, the critical strain energy density rather than the critical curvature is adopted as the failure criterion. The capability of the developed PD model was demonstrated by the bending examples of composite laminates with different fiber orientations, and damage analysis was further conducted to demonstrate the strong capability of proposed PD model in replicating the damage process of laminates. In addition, a single-layer material point model (SLMPM) can be implemented in the proposed PD algorithm, and the computational efficiency of numerical models will be greatly improved.},

For determining the geometrically nonlinear deformations of laminated composite plates with random fields, the existing intrusive SFEMs have the limitations of low applicability, insufficient accuracy, or low efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a novel and efficient non-intrusive SFEM incorporating direct probability integral method to achieve probability density functions (PDFs) of stochastic responses and reliabilities of laminated composite plates with geometric nonlinearity. Firstly, the von Kármán strain-displacement relation based on the third-order shear deformation theory is employed to model the geometric nonlinearity of laminated plates. The random field is discretized via Karhunen–Loève expansion. Secondly, the probability density integral equation (PDIE) is derived from the new perspective of probability conservation. The proposed non-intrusive SFEM decouples the equilibrium equation and PDIE to compute the response PDFs and reliabilities of uncertain laminated composite plates in a unified way. Moreover, the criterion which can judge the applicability of geometrically nonlinear theory is suggested for performing uncertainty quantification. Finally, comparisons of the results in terms of Monte Carlo simulation and the literature demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. For stochastic laminated plates, the response statistical moments vary nonlinearly with linear increase of load amplitude due to geometric nonlinearity, the deflection variability increases and structural reliability decreases with the increase in variability and correlation length of random field, and the stacking angle significantly affects the stochastic nonlinear deflections and reliabilities.},

To this end, the integral coupled equations for TM-DHPD are firstly derived within the framework of thermodynamics. And then, the alternative dual-horizon peridynamic correspondence principle is used to derive the constitutive bond force state, heat flow state and their general linearizations. Moreover, the unified criterion for bond damage is proposed to characterize the internal bond damage in a single material and the interface bond damage in dissimilar materials. To ensure convergence and accuracy, the coupled equations are solved using the standard implicit method without the use of artificial damping. In both homogeneous and heterogeneous materials, some representative and challenging numerical cases are examined, such as dynamic crack branching in a centrally heated disk and multiple interface failure of thermal barrier coating. The numerical results are in good agreement with the available experimental results or the previous predictions, which shows the great potential of the proposed TM-DHPD in addressing the physics of numerous thermally induced fractures in the real-world engineering problems.},

To deal with both dependent and independent uncertain parameters in engineering problems, an improved multidimensional parallelepiped model (IMPM) is subsequently developed. Compared with traditional methods that entirely based on statistical features, more accurate uncertainty quantification results can be obtained by means of IMPM. To enhance the efficiency of uncertainty propagation analysis under IMPM, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) surrogate model is constructed to replace the original time-consuming finite element simulation model. Eventually, the effectiveness of proposed models and numerical methods is validated through an engineering example involving the coupled vibro-acoustic system considering thermal stress of a hypersonic vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Constructing an efficient high-order nonsmooth time-stepping integration scheme for rigid–flexible multibody systems with frictional contacts and impacts is a challenging task. This paper presents a nonsmooth modified symplectic integration scheme that can automatically achieve second-order convergence if possible. This scheme is obtained in three main steps. Firstly, the position coordinates are used to interpolate midpoint approximated integrals, which include velocity jumps implicitly; Secondly, a two-timestep central difference scheme is formulated to approximate the measure differential inclusions; Thirdly, composing two half-condensed two-timestep schemes leads to a one-timestep scheme, which retains the structure of a second-order scheme. Furthermore, while bilateral constraints are satisfied at the position level, unilateral constraints at the velocity level are subject to constraint drifts. To alleviate this issue, a classified cone complementarity problem is formulated to restrain penetration from deteriorating and sticking contacts from fictitious slipping. After time discretization, a set of nonlinear equations with cone complementarity conditions at each timestep is solved by a two-layer iterative computational strategy, where the outer layer is Newton iteration and the inner layer is a primal–dual interior point method. Several numerical examples demonstrate the high accuracy attained by the proposed method. Nonsmooth dynamics of a rigid–flexible robot involving high-speed and high-friction impacts can be simulated faster than real-time.},

A defeaturing process is often used to simplify the domain in preparation for approximation and analysis at the coarse scale. Herein, a methodology is presented for constructing a coarse-scale reproducing basis on geometrically complex domains given an initial fine-scale mesh of the fully featured domain. The initial fine-scale mesh can be of poor quality and extremely refined. The construction of the basis functions begins with a coarse-scale covering of the domain and generation of weighting functions with local support. Manifold geodesics are used to define distances within the local support for general applicability to non-convex domains. Conventional moving least squares is used to construct the coarse-scale reproducing basis. Applications in quasi-interpolation and linear elasticity are presented.},

Our model is used to investigate heart behaviours with different modelling assumptions including restricted/free valve annular dynamics, and with/without heart-pericardium interactions. Our simulation results capture the interactions between valve leaflet and surrounding flow, typical left ventricular flow vortices, typical venous and transvalvular flow waveform, and physiological heart deformations such as atrioventricular plane movement. The improvement of ventricular filling and atrial emptying at early diastole is evident with free annulus. In addition, we find that the added pericardial forces on the heart have a predominant effect on atrial wall deformation especially during atrial contraction, and further help with the atrial filling process. Most importantly, the current study provides a framework for comprehensive multi-physics whole-heart modelling considering all heart valves and fluid–structure interactions.},

The third represents a hybrid approach where finite volumes are combined with finite elements based on a hierarchical splitting of the ansatz space. All approaches are based on typical finite element function spaces but yield locally mass and momentum conservative discretization schemes that can be interpreted as finite volume schemes. We apply all strategies to the inf-sub stable MINI finite-element pair. Various test cases, including convergence tests and the numerical observation of the boundedness of the number of preconditioned Krylov solver iterations, as well as more complex scenarios of flow around obstacles or through a three-dimensional vessel bifurcation, demonstrate the stability and robustness of the schemes.},

The shape of each contact region is obtained as the intersection of a circle, obtained in the absence of any contact impingement, and a convex polygon, determined by half-plane intersection based on directed lines obtained from the intersection of contact planes. An underlying power diagram is used to subdivide volume and area between particles, but calculations are performed particle-wise, resulting in an efficient algorithm with a structure ideally suited for parallelisation. Numerical tests performed on loose and dense particle assemblies and comparison (of single-particle free area and particle volume) with a reference method (POWERSASA) indicate that the method is robust and highly accurate. The method will be useful not only for geometric analysis but also as a basis for subsequent developments of strain measures and computational procedures for highly deformed granular materials.

The demonstration is based on the IUQ of TRACE physical model parameters using the FEBA benchmark transient experimental data on peak cladding temperatures during reflooding. The quantity-of-interest (QoI) is time-dependent peak cladding temperature (PCT) profiles. Conventional PCA can hardly represent the data precisely due to the sudden temperature drop at the time of quenching. As a result, a functional alignment method is used to separate the phase and amplitude information in the PCT profiles before conventional PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction. The resulting PC scores are then used to build DNN-based surrogate models to significantly reduce the computational cost in Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, while the code/interpolation uncertainty is accounted for using Bayesian neural networks. We compared four IUQ processes with different dimensionality reduction methods and surrogate models. The proposed approach has demonstrated the best performance in reducing the dimensionality of the transient PCT profiles. This approach also produces the posterior distributions of the physical model parameters with which the model predictions have the best agreement with the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Interface problems have long been a major focus of scientific computing, leading to the development of various numerical methods. Traditional mesh-based methods often employ time-consuming body-fitted meshes with standard discretization schemes or unfitted meshes with tailored schemes to achieve controllable accuracy and convergence rate. Along another line, mesh-free methods bypass mesh generation but lack robustness in terms of convergence and accuracy due to the low regularity of solutions. In this study, we propose a novel method for solving interface problems within the framework of the random feature method (RFM). This approach utilizes random feature functions in conjunction with a partition of unity as approximation functions, and solves a linear least-squares system to obtain the approximate solution. In the context of interface problems, two innovative and crucial components are incorporated into the RFM. Firstly, we utilize two sets of random feature functions on each side of the interface, allowing for the inclusion of low regularity or even discontinuous behaviors in the solution. Secondly, the construction of the loss function is based on the assessment of the partial differential equation, initial/boundary conditions, and the interface condition on collocation points. This approach ensures that these conditions are equally satisfied. Consequently, the challenges arising from geometric complexity primarily manifest in the generation of collocation points, a task amenable to standard methods. Importantly, the proposed method retains its meshfree characteristics and robustness when addressing problems featuring intricate geometries. We validate our method through a series of linear interface problems with increasingly complex geometries, including two-dimensional elliptic and three-dimensional Stokes interface problems, a three-dimensional elasticity interface problem, a moving interface problem with topological change, a dynamic interface problem with large deformation, and a linear fluid–solid interaction problem with complex geometry. Our findings show that despite the solution often being only continuous or even discontinuous, our method not only eliminates the need for mesh generation but also maintains high accuracy, akin to the spectral collocation method for smooth solutions. Remarkably, for the same accuracy requirement, our method requires two to three orders of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than traditional methods, demonstrating its significant potential for solving interface problems with complex geometries and predetermined intricate evolution.},

Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogate models to alleviate the computational costs of simulations. However, neural operators applications in 3D remain sparse, mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining training databases for supervised learning and the size of 3D neural operators that poses memory challenges. This work focuses on the propagation of elastic waves in 3D domains and showcases the Factorized Fourier Neural Operator (F-FNO) as an efficient and accurate surrogate model. The F-FNO is trained on the publicly available HEMEW-3D database of 30 000 wavefields simulations in realistic heterogeneous domains. The F-FNO predicts space- and time-dependent (3D) surface wavefields depending on the characteristics of the propagation domain (characterized by the velocity of shear waves). Four FNO variants are compared and extensive investigations on the influence of hyperparameters and training strategies are conducted. The two most influential hyperparameters are the number of layers and the number of channels, meaning that richer models are more accurate. On the contrary, increasing the number of Fourier modes had little influence and did not reduce the spectral bias that causes an underestimation of high-frequency patterns. The F-FNO is sensitive to heterogeneities in the inputs but robust to the addition of noise. Additionally, it possesses good generalization ability to out-of-distribution data and transfer learning is very beneficial to improve the predictions in tailored applications.},

By customizing the anisotropic design of each pore in the porous structure, the strength and stiffness of the structure can be significantly enhanced. In this work, we present a novel method for designing 3D anisotropic Voronoi porous structures (AVPSs). To construct these structures, we propose a novel algorithm for generating 3D anisotropic Voronoi diagrams (AVDs) based on Riemannian distance. The geometries of Voronoi cells are controlled to conform with both the stress distribution and the principal stress directions. The distribution of Voronoi cells are graded using a stress-based site sampling strategy, the orientation of Voronoi cells are modified by introducing stress-mapped Riemann tensor fields. The AVPSs are then modeled by computing implicit surfaces based on AVDs. The AVPSs conform closely to the geometric profile of the input model by clipping AVDs using the tetrahedral mesh. Furthermore, the results obtained from numerical simulations and experimental tests indicate that the AVPSs possess both high strength and high stiffness.},

They are crucial for determining the performance of these machines and essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, mathematical optimization algorithms for labyrinth seals are of high interest. This work concerns the topology optimization of labyrinth seals, which is a challenging task because the optimizer must distribute solids at different velocities to properly model the flow in the cavity of the labyrinth seal. Also, the model must not allow the optimizer to close the fluid channel or to leave free-floating islands of solid elements in the final design. Therefore, the interface identification method based on a series of erosion-dilate projection filters is used to model the fluid channel as the interface between the rotor and stator, allowing the representation of different velocities and avoiding the channel closure. The virtual temperature method is employed as a connectivity constraint to avoid free-floating islands of solid material. Still, thin structural members appear in the optimized designs , so geometric constraints are used to impose the minimum length scale on rotor and stator components. The final topology optimization results are labyrinth seals with contorted channels constricted to the minimum allowed gap size (as expected for low Reynolds flows), showing the success of the proposed formulation. The staggered and stepped labyrinth seal configurations are optimized to show the generality of the method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel method to address the challenge of concurrent topology and anisotropy optimisation of variable-stiffness anisotropic structures with variable thickness from additive manufacturing technologies . The proposed methodology relies on the multi-level optimisation strategy based on non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) entities, density-based method for topology optimisation and the polar formalism to describe the anisotropy of the continuum. Specifically, NURBS entities are used to describe both the density field and the distribution of the polar parameters and the thickness across the design domain. Furthermore, the properties of NURBS entities are efficiently exploited to derive the gradient of the physical responses involved in the problem formulation. The proposed method is applied to the problem of maximising the structural stiffness , while fulfilling design requirements on the lightness and on the feasibility of the polar parameters. In this context, the problem is formulated in the most general case considering inhomogeneous Neumann–Dirichlet boundary conditions. The effectiveness of the approach is tested on benchmark problems taken from literature subjected to both in-plane and out-of-plane loads. Particularly, a large campaign of sensitivity analyses has been carried out to examine the impact of integer parameters of the NURBS entity, the penalty scheme used for the element stiffness matrix , inhomogeneous Neumann–Dirichlet boundary conditions, optimisation strategy (sequential versus concurrent) and initial guess on the optimised solution.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a Nitsche-based CutFEM approach for solving phase change problems while taking natural convection into account in the liquid phase . In the proposed algorithm, the interface is implicitly tracked through a level-set approach, where the level-set function is updated by solving a transport equation. To stabilize the finite element formulation of this equation, we use the continuous interior penalty method (CIP). We use the Backward Euler scheme for the time discretization and the of continuous piecewise linear polynomials ( P 1 P1 ) for the spatial discretization of the temperature and the level-set function. For flow velocity and pressure in the liquid phase , the finite element formulation is based on the inf-sup stable pair of Hood-Taylor finite element function spaces P 2 − P 1 P2−P1 . As we are dealing with unfitted finite element methods, stability issues may arise due to geometry discretization . To address this issue, we incorporate ghost penalty terms into the finite element formulations of the heat and Navier–Stokes equations. According to Stefan’s condition, the normal velocity of the interface is proportional to the jump in the interfacial flux. For an efficient approximation of this jump, we use a ghost penalty-based domain integral approach which has shown to be highly accurate. To validate the proposed method, we first provide two manufactured solutions that confirm optimal convergence in both temporal and spatial discretizations. We next consider challenging problems such as the melting of n-octadecane in a differentially heated cavity, the multi-cellular melting of gallium, and the freezing of water to further validate our algorithm. We compare our results to existing numerical and experimental data .},

  abstract     = {Accurate error estimation is crucial in model order reduction, to obtain small reduced-order models as well as to certify their accuracy when deployed in downstream applications such as digital twins. In existing a posteriori error estimation approaches, knowledge about the time integration scheme is mandatory, e.g., the residual-based error estimators proposed for the reduced basis method. This poses a challenge when automatic ordinary differential equation solver libraries are used to perform the time integration. To address this, we present a data-enhanced approach for a posteriori error estimation. Our new formulation enables residual-based error estimators to be independent of any time integration method. To achieve this, we introduce a corrected reduced-order model which takes into account a data-driven closure term for improved accuracy. The closure term, subject to mild assumptions, is related to the local truncation error of the corresponding time integration scheme. We propose efficient computational schemes for approximating the closure term, at the cost of a modest amount of training data. Furthermore, the new error estimator is incorporated within a greedy process to obtain parametric reduced-order models. Numerical results on three different systems show the accuracy of the proposed error estimation approach and its ability to produce ROMs that generalize well.},

  abstract     = {Because of the best approximation property, traditional Bubnov–Galerkin numerical methods have proven immensely successful in modeling self-adjoint problems, such as heat conduction , elasticity, and so on. However, a numerical instability arises in these (and central finite difference) methods for problems with strong convection. In this class of problems, the convective transport term can lead to large spurious oscillations but can be handled by the class of Petrov–Galerkin methods. In particular, the upwind-type schemes and their variational and subgrid descendants have been substantially developed over the years for an effective weak-form Galerkin solution that precludes these instabilities. Nevertheless, the scale of development of upwind methods for strong-form collocation is substantially smaller, where numerical oscillations are also observed when they are straightforwardly applied to convection-dominated problems without special treatment. To this end, this paper presents a new upwind collocation method. First, the connection between the upwind finite difference scheme and the gradient smoothing technique in meshfree methods is established. It is then shown that selecting the collocation points as meshfree nodal points is not optimal; selecting the collocation points according to the flow direction and Péclet number is then studied. The upwind effect is achieved without introducing artificial parameters and is trivial to generalize for multi-dimensional cases. Cross-wind diffusion is also not observed in the solution. An error analysis is presented, and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is well demonstrated by the steady and unsteady numerical examples .},

To avoid geometric errors caused by the surface approximation and additional approximation errors introduced by numerical methods, for spatial discretization, we consider the recently developed strategy of subdivision-based isogeometric analysis (IGA), where we can accurately represent complex surfaces of arbitrary topology due to its high smoothness and hierarchical refinement properties. By incorporating multiple methods of temporal discretizations, including the Explicit-Invariant-Energy-Quadratization (EIEQ) approach for linearizing nonlinear potentials, the Zero-Energy-Contribution (ZEC) method for decoupling of nonlinear couplings, and the projection method for decoupling of linear couplings between the fluid velocity and pressure, and the finite-element method based on IGA for spatial discretizations, we arrive at a fully discrete scheme that possesses desirable properties such as decoupling, linearity, second-order accuracy in time, and unconditional energy stability. At each time step, only several elliptic equations with constant coefficients are needed to be solved. We also present the rigorous proof of unconditional energy stability, accompanied by numerous numerical examples to verify the stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme, such as the Saffman–Taylor fingering instability occurring on various complex curved surfaces induced by rotational forces.},

The multiphysics variational framework is decoupled into three parts which can be solved in a staggered manner, namely, the mechanical, diffusion, and damage sub-problems. The damage and diffusion sub-problems are treated as reaction–diffusion types of equations. The former is subjected to irreversibility constraints while the latter incorporates a transport term to represent the effect of mechanical loading. An efficient super-convergent patch recovery (SPR) scheme is utilized to determine the coefficient of transport term in the hydrogen diffusion equation. Several qualitative and quantitative benchmark problems are considered to validate the proposed framework’s performance. The results show excellent agreement with the corresponding FEM and experimental studies. Meanwhile, without loss of numerical accuracy, the VEM outperforms the FEM with regards to CPU time &amp; memory efficiency and exhibits remarkable versatility in the selection of different element types for simulation. Moreover, this work demonstrates the potential of facilitating the VEM to solve real-scale fracture mechanics problems with multi-physics coupling.},

When the runoff interacts with storm surge, the resulting floods can be greatly amplified and lead to effects that cannot be correctly modeled by simple superposition of its distinctive sources. In an effort to develop accurate numerical simulations of runoff, surge, and compounding floods, we develop a local discontinuous Galerkin method for modified shallow water equations. In this modification, nonzero sources to the continuity equation are included to incorporate rainfall into the model using parametric rainfall models from literature as well as hindcast data. The discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization is accompanied with a strong stability preserving explicit Runge Kutta time integrator. Hence, temporal stability is ensured through the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition and we exploit the embarrassingly parallel nature of the developed method using MPI parallelization . We demonstrate the capabilities of the developed method though a sequence of physically relevant numerical tests, including small scale test cases based on laboratory measurements and large scale experiments with Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico . The results highlight the conservation properties and robustness of the developed method and show the potential of compound flood modeling using our approach.},

  abstract     = {We present a multiscale framework to systematically reduce the order of fracture-mechanics computations in complex porous microstructures captured by a pore-scale image (e.g., X-ray μ μ CT). The framework allows formulating approximations that are more accurate than classical discrete element methods (DEM) and faster than high-fidelity direct numerical simulation (DNS) techniques, such as phase-field models (PFM). We propose two such approximations called the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and the image-based discrete element method (iDEM), the latter a generalization of classical DEM wherein the solid geometry is not simplified. Unlike iDEM, PLMM is equipped with the ability to iteratively control errors away from, but not at, the cracks. We refer to the uncorrected approximation as M 0 0 , and that with ω ω corrections as M ω ω . Both methods are based on the hypotheses that (H1) cracks nucleate at geometric constrictions of the solid, and (H2) bending/torsion moments at such constrictions are negligible. iDEM additionally assumes that (H3) the geometric enlargements of the solid are rigid. Through a series of benchmarks, performed on complex geometries subject to hydraulic, tensile, shear, and compressive loading, we show that H1 is largely valid under non-compressive loading, and H2 degrades the most under shear loading when bending/torsion moments dominate. H3 has two consequences: (1) M 0 0 predictions can be reproduced by iDEM at a fraction of the cost, (2) but to compute them, iDEM’s parameters (spring constants) must be calibrated to reference data, which may not be available. Moreover, the calibrated parameters are non-unique and depend on the reference data chosen. The foregoing benchmarks are validated against two well-known PFMs, in which inherent uncertainties and deficiencies are also identified, especially under compressive loading. These are attributed to the so-called energy splits used. Lastly, we derive and validate closed-form expressions for the tensile and shear strengths of the solid used by PLMM/iDEM and the length-scale parameter and fracture toughness in PFM. This work provides fundamental insights into how porous materials fail, and how accurate approximations based on such understanding can be constructed and refined in the future.},

First, the OPM utilizes the advantage of the optimization theory rather than sampling technology. By using the augmented Lagrangian approach, it comprehensively considers the objective, constraints, and their relations, thereby automatic identification of important region in the vicinity of the optimum. Second, the accordingly optimum-pursuing function consists of three parts: Kriging mean, Kriging standard deviation, and merit function. Also, the target reliability surface is further considered to enhance the local accuracy of the reliability analysis. The performance of OPM is tested for both deterministic optimization and problems, in which two mathematical and three real-world engineering examples are selected to showcase the feasibility and validity.

While the discrete element method (DEM) has been used to model bio-inspired flexible protective structures, existing DEM models struggle with modeling interactions between elements of complex geometries and finite deformation , making them unsuitable for describing interfacial interlocking and associated failure mechanisms observed in experiments. Here, we propose an interface-enhanced DEM (I-DEM) model that brings about a number of advantages over the existing methods. First, contact-induced geometric nonlinearity is incorporated via a nonlinear interaction function to model interfacial interlocking. Second, finite deformation of interfacial material is taken into account in modeling interfacial failure. Furthermore, contact detection and processing algorithms are utilized to model collision and post-contact behaviors. The utility of I-DEM is demonstrated in modeling bio-inspired flexible protective structures across three distinct interfaces, evidencing its broad applicability to varied interface geometries. FEM simulations of scaled armor structures with segmented helmet and space shield are performed to demonstrate an increase in computational efficiency of the proposed I-DEM model by about four orders of magnitude for static analysis and by two orders of magnitude for dynamic analysis, with numerical discrepancies within about 10%, compared to FEM .},

Recursive multiphase materials interpolation (RMMI) scheme is utilized to establish the relationship between discrete design variables and element elastic modulus and density, and sequential approximate integer programming (SAIP) and canonical relaxation algorithms are constructed to update the discrete design variables. It is shown that this method can obtain multi-material topology design with clear interface display, and has the ability of free material coexistence and degradation, which indicates that the discrete variables have more advantages than the continuous variables in the RMMI scheme. Based on this, the material selection under mass constraints is discussed in depth, and it is pointed out that the traditional determination of material coexistence or degradation in design based on specific stiffness has limitations. Thus, the present work expands the necessary conditions of material coexistence. Then, a minimum size control method of multi-material design based on post-processing is proposed to solve the minimum size geometry constraint problem by SAIP. Numerical examples show that this method can not only precisely control the minimum size of each material phase (including void phase), but also resolve the problem of interface and boundary diffusion of the multi-material phase, and significantly improve the manufacturability of multi-material design. Finally, it is applied to optimization problems with complex design domain and irregular meshes which are closer to engineering design.},

  abstract     = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics using artificial compressibility (ACSPH) is developed, with the inclusion of pressure smoothing terms. Theoretical links between pressure/velocity correction incompressible SPH and artificial compressibility are explored, illustrating that ACSPH may be considered an extension of, or closely related to, the δ δ -SPH method. An implicit dual-time integration procedure is used to enforce an incompressible solution at every time-step, removing acoustic effects arising from the common assumption of weak compressibility. An established weakly-compressible quasi-Lagrangian δ δ -SPH method is used for comparison against ACSPH, and a series of test cases show that ACSPH provides a similar solution cost to δ δ -SPH. However, the residual acoustic effects in δ δ -SPH are removed entirely in ACSPH, providing improved pressure prediction capabilities across all test cases, including intense fluid impacts. Improved modelling of fluid–structure-interaction cases and coupled energy dissipation are also recorded as a result of correctly capturing incompressible flow .},

  abstract     = {In spite of its overall efficiency and robustness for capturing the interface in multiphase fluid dynamics simulations, the well-known shortcoming of the level-set method is associated with the lack of a systematic approach for preserving the regularity of the distance function. This is mainly due to the stretching (or compressing) effect of the strain rate especially in the vicinity of the liquid-gas interface. Level-set re-initialization is an effective treatment for this issue. However, the traditional approach based on the hyperbolic Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a computationally expensive procedure. Crucially, due to the hyperbolic nature of the formulation, the accuracy of the results hinges significantly on the specialized handling of blind spots near the liquid-gas interface intersecting the substrate. The present work proposes a two-step elliptic level-set re-initialization approach that strictly preserves the location of zero level-set via incorporation of an element splitting process. The primary initialization step helps remove any non-smoothness in the to-be regularized level-set function dramatically improving the efficiency of the secondary optimization step. Geometric representation of the boundary conditions is utilized in the initialization step, while the optimization step minimizes the reliance of the results on the treatment of the blind spots. The performance of the proposed method is examined for free and sessile three-dimensional droplets.},

However, the need for extensive data that collate the full state of the material is hindered by traditional experimental observations, which typically provide only small data —sparse and partial material state observations. To address this issue, we develop a novel deep learning algorithm referred to as Neural Integration for Constitutive Equations to discover constitutive models at the material point level from scarce and incomplete observations. It builds upon the solution of the initial value problem describing the time evolution of the material state, unlike the majority of data-driven approaches for constitutive modelling that require large data of increments of state variables. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the method can learn accurate, consistent, and robust constitutive models from incomplete, sparse, and noisy data collecting simple conventional experimental protocols.},

Interestingly, undulatory, crawling and inching/looping gait constitutes a fundamental class of limbless locomotion and is often observed in many species such as caterpillars, earthworms, leeches, larvae, and C. elegans . In this work, we developed a computationally efficient 3D Finite Element (FE) unified framework for the locomotion of limbless organisms on frictional substrates. Muscle activity is simulated with a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, which allows mimicking a broad range of locomotion patterns in 3D contractile elastic solids. We propose a two-field FE formulation based on positions and velocities. Governing partial differential equations are transformed into equivalent time-continuous differential–algebraic equations (DAEs). Next, the optimal locomotion strategies are studied in the framework of optimal control theory. We resort to adjoint-based methods and deduce the first-order optimality conditions, that yield a system of DAEs with two-point end conditions. Hidden symplectic structure is discussed, and Symplectic Euler time integration of optimality conditions are employed. The resulting discrete first-order optimality conditions form a non-linear programming problem that is solved efficiently with the Forward Backward Sweep Method. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the proposed computational framework and investigate the energy-efficient optimal strategy out of distinct locomotion patterns adopted by limbless organisms.},

However, the large complexity of such materials and structures poses a significant challenge to the accurate and efficient prediction of their piezoelectric behavior which is significant for guiding and optimizing their applications. In this paper, a Direct FE 2 2 method was proposed for concurrent multilevel modeling of the coupled electromechanical behavior of multiscale piezoelectric materials and structures. The energy equilibrium and kinematic constraints between macro- and meso-scales were satisfied by prescribing periodic boundary conditions for both displacement and electric potential, which were derived from the governing equation of FEM. Another boundary condition was prescribed to the center node of each RVE , to prevent rigid motion and shifting of electric potential of meso-scale RVEs. All these boundary conditions can be easily prescribed to the Direct FE 2 2 using multiple points constraints (MPCs), a commonly used feature in most commercial software. The accuracy, computational efficiency and ease of numerical implementation of the proposed Direct FE 2 2 method were validated using a series of multiscale simulations, including the quasi-static response of homogeneous piezoelectric panels, an arc honeycomb structure , a regular honeycomb structure and a piezoelectric composite panel , as well as the dynamic response of the piezoelectric composite panel. It shows that the proposed Direct FE 2 2 method will be valuable for large-scale simulations of complicated multiscale piezoelectric materials and structures.},

Interpreted in the context of composite Duffy approximations based on star-shape polytopes ( S S -elements), and using an operator-adapted principle, the shape functions are determined by imposing an energy-orthogonality constraint. In the presence of non-vanishing forcing terms , the SBFEM approximation converges at sub-optimal rates. In the current paper, a strategy is proposed to overcome this drawback by the enrichment of the classic SBFEM spaces with energy-orthogonal bubble Duffy functions. The orthogonality property leads to a decoupling of the approximate solutions into components of boundary trace and interior (bubble) functions. The bubble functions can be solved separately, thus reducing the computational cost. A priori energy-error estimates are provided demonstrating optimal rates of convergence . The convergence rates are confirmed by two and three-dimensional numerical verification tests.},

The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements. The local approach proves to be highly efficient, since the network can be kept (relatively) small and since it can be applied in parallel on all grid patches. However, the main advantage of the local approach is the inherent generalizability of the method. Since the network only processes data of small sub-areas, it never “sees” the global problem and thus does not learn false biases. We describe the method with a focus on the interplay between the finite element method and deep neural networks. Further, we demonstrate with numerical examples the excellent efficiency of the hybrid approach, which allows us to achieve very high accuracy with a coarse grid and thus reduce the computation time by orders of magnitude.},

However, there are often challenges when dealing with situations involving continuous fields or parameters with large-resolution discrete representations. Furthermore, the prior distribution of the unknown parameters is also commonly difficult to determine. Therefore, in this study, an operator learning-based generative adversarial network (OL-GAN) is proposed and integrated into the Bayesian inference framework to address these issues. Compared with classical Bayesian approaches, the distinctive characteristic of the proposed method is that it learns the joint distributions of parameters and responses. By using the trained generative model to handle the prior in Bayes’ rule, the posteriors of the unknown parameters can theoretically be approximated by any sampling algorithms (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) under the proposed framework. More importantly, efficient sampling can be implemented in a low-dimensional latent space shared by the components of the joint distribution. The latent space is typically a simple and easy-to-sample distribution (e.g., Gaussian, uniform), which significantly reduces the computational cost associated with the Bayesian inference while avoiding prior selection. Furthermore, the generator is resolution-independent due to the incorporation of operator learning. Predictions can thus be obtained at desired coordinates, and inversions can be performed even if the observation data are misaligned with the training data. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel modular inference approach combining two different generative models — generative adversarial networks (GAN) and normalizing flows — to approximate the posterior distribution of physics-based Bayesian inverse problems framed in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We dub the proposed framework GAN-Flow. The proposed method leverages the intrinsic dimension reduction and superior sample generation capabilities of GANs to define a low-dimensional data-driven prior distribution. Once a trained GAN-prior is available, the inverse problem is solved entirely in the latent space of the GAN using variational Bayesian inference with normalizing flow-based variational distribution, which approximates low-dimensional posterior distribution by transforming realizations from the low-dimensional latent prior (Gaussian) to corresponding realizations of a low-dimensional variational posterior distribution. The trained GAN generator then maps realizations from this approximate posterior distribution in the latent space back to the high-dimensional ambient space. We also propose a two-stage training strategy for GAN-Flow wherein we train the two generative models sequentially. Thereafter, GAN-Flow can estimate the statistics of posterior-predictive quantities of interest at virtually no additional computational cost. The synergy between the two types of generative models allows us to overcome many challenges associated with the application of Bayesian inference to large-scale inverse problems, chief among which are describing an informative prior and sampling from the high-dimensional posterior. GAN-Flow does not involve Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, making it particularly suitable for solving large-scale inverse problems. We demonstrate the efficacy and flexibility of GAN-Flow on various physics-based inverse problems of varying ambient dimensionality and prior knowledge using different types of GANs and normalizing flows. Notably, one of the applications we consider involves a 65,536-dimensional inverse problem of phase retrieval wherein an object is reconstructed from sparse noisy measurements of the magnitude of its Fourier transform.},

  abstract     = {The Eikonal equation plays a central role in seismic wave propagation and hypocenter localization, a crucial aspect of efficient earthquake early warning systems . Despite recent progress, real-time earthquake localization remains challenging due to the need to learn a generalizable Eikonal operator. We introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Enriched-DeepONet (En-DeepONet), addressing the limitations of current operator learning models in dealing with moving-solution operators. Leveraging addition and subtraction operations and a novel ‘root’ network, En-DeepONet is particularly suitable for learning such operators and achieves up to four orders of magnitude improved accuracy without increased training cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of En-DeepONet in earthquake localization under variable velocity and arrival time conditions. Our results indicate that En-DeepONet paves the way for real-time hypocenter localization for velocity models of practical interest. The proposed method represents a significant advancement in operator learning that is applicable to a gamut of scientific problems, including those in seismology, fracture mechanics , and phase-field problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce the Spectral Coefficient Learning via Operator Network (SCLON), a novel operator learning-based approach for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need for data harnessing. The cornerstone of our method is the spectral methodology that employs expansions using orthogonal functions, such as Fourier series and Legendre polynomials, enabling accurate PDE solutions with fewer grid points. By merging the merits of spectral methods – encompassing high accuracy, efficiency, generalization, and the exact fulfillment of boundary conditions – with the prowess of deep neural networks, SCLON offers a transformative strategy. Our approach not only eliminates the need for paired input–output training data, which typically requires extensive numerical computations, but also effectively learns and predicts solutions of complex parametric PDEs, ranging from singularly perturbed convection–diffusion equations to the Navier–Stokes equations. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing scientific machine learning techniques, offering solutions for multiple instances of parametric PDEs without harnessing data. The mathematical framework is robust and reliable, with a well-developed loss function derived from the weak formulation, ensuring accurate approximation of solutions while exactly satisfying boundary conditions. The method’s efficacy is further illustrated through its ability to accurately predict intricate natural behaviors like the Kolmogorov flow and boundary layers. In essence, our work pioneers a compelling avenue for parametric PDE solutions, serving as a bridge between traditional numerical methodologies and cutting-edge machine learning techniques in the realm of scientific computation.},

The finite element analysis of structures or structural components requires a constitutive model that describes the behaviour of the new materials. The formulation of accurate constitutive equations is generally complex and time consuming. Hence, suitable machine learning strategies may be used to render this process obsolete and bridge the gap between experimental data and finite element analysis . In this work, a generic stress update procedure is presented that is suitable for the modelling of rate-independent, elastic or inelastic, isotropic or anisotropic material behaviour . The proposed strategy is based on a recurrent neural network architecture and must be trained on stress and strain data sequences that represent physical or numerical experiments. A training strategy based on gradient-free optimisation is presented. It is shown that piecewise linear behaviour, such as uniaxial elasto-plasticity, can be represented exactly . Further numerical examples include uniaxial damage mechanics and elasto-plasticity under plane strain conditions . An efficient criterion for the verification of thermodynamic consistency is proposed and applied to the trained stress update models. The strategy is compared to GRU or LSTM based architectures and shown to offer advantages.},

  abstract     = {Predicting dynamic responses of continuous deformable bodies (CDBs) is essential for various research fields, including civil engineering and computer graphics. Machine learning models, unlike traditional physically-based models, learn from data without predefined physical properties and have significantly advanced the simulation of rigid body systems and fluids. Graph neural network (GNN)-based simulators excel in this area due to their ability to naturally represent physical bodies and interactions using graphs composed of nodes and edges. However, predicting the dynamic responses of CDBs remains challenging because interactions in a CDB are complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic. The complexity of interactions arises from the spatial variability of internal stress, making it challenging to encapsulate such multifaceted interactions of one edge into one edge attribute vector. Additionally, those interactions are heterogeneous and dynamic due to the material and geometric nonlinearity of CDBs. CDBs with elastic, plastic, and elastoplastic materials follow different deformation rules during vibrations. These rules also vary under small and large deformations for a single material type. To address these challenges, we introduce a new GNN-based simulator called p hysics- i nformed e dge r ecurrent s imulator ( Piers ) for learning CDB dynamics. We first formulate the CDB simulation as a sequence-to-sequence input–output relationship modeling problem and incorporate a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn edge updates within short timesteps, during which stiffness changes are negligible. To accurately capture complex interactions, we initialize the RNN module’s hidden states with prior physical knowledge and equip Piers with a physics-informed loss function by assigning the physical properties of interactions as the target edge output. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Piers can simulate the dynamics of elastic, plastic, and elastoplastic CDBs with smaller response prediction errors than alternative baselines. Piers reduces prediction errors by 78% to 99% across four typical CDB physical systems.},

  abstract     = {The ability to design materials for wave propagation behaviors has high potential for impact in medical imaging, telecommunications, and signal processing. The dispersion relation is the key mathematical object that describes linear elastic wave propagation behavior in a material. To date, the design of wave propagation behavior in materials has been limited to one or two design objectives, for example, designing for one or two bandgaps or wavespeeds. This is a result of the complicated relationship between a material and its dispersion relation, and the hefty computational cost of traditional dispersion computations. Decreasing the amount of time required to perform dispersion computations will streamline the design process of wave devices, allowing for more thorough design optimization workflows, more highly resolved design features, and multi-functional materials. In this work, we demonstrate a specialized Gaussian Process Regressor as a surrogate model for the computation of dispersion relations to alleviate the immense computational cost of the traditional model. By measuring covariance information from relatively small training sets (10s to 1000s of dispersion relations), our surrogate model efficiently infers the full dispersion relation after solving for the dispersion relation at only a sparse set of wavevector points. Further, we provide a mathematical framework to use this model for material design through gradient-based optimization methods.},

A graph search algorithm is used to select local material databases representative of the incremental material behaviour. This study thus gives the mathematical tools for a structured data-driven representation of the material behaviour, designed to minimise the increase of the problem dimensionality. The performances of the proposed approach applied to elastoplasticity are studied on a single-element structure and a larger truss structure.

A single-layer feedforward neural network is used to account for the dependence of DMN fitting parameters on the microstructural ones. Micromechanical constraints are prescribed both on the architecture and the outputs of this new neural network. The proposed MIpDMN is also recast in a multiple physics setting, where physical properties other than the mechanical ones can also be predicted. In the numerical simulations conducted on three parameterized microstructures, MIpDMN demonstrates satisfying generalization capabilities when morphology varies.

Immersed boundary methods (IBMs) alleviate the usually laborious and time-consuming process of creating body-fitted meshes around complex geometry models (described by CAD or other representations, e.g., STL, point clouds), especially when high levels of mesh adaptivity are required. In this work, we advance the field of IBM in the context of the recently developed Shifted Boundary Method (SBM). In the SBM, the location where boundary conditions are enforced is shifted from the actual boundary of the immersed object to a nearby surrogate boundary, and boundary conditions are corrected utilizing Taylor expansions . This approach allows choosing surrogate boundaries that conform to a Cartesian mesh without losing accuracy or stability. Our contributions in this work are as follows: (a) we show that the SBM numerical error can be greatly reduced by an optimal choice of the surrogate boundary, (b) we mathematically prove the optimal convergence of the SBM for this optimal choice of the surrogate boundary, (c) we deploy the SBM on massively parallel octree meshes, including algorithmic advances to handle incomplete octrees, and (d) we showcase the applicability of these approaches with a wide variety of simulations involving complex shapes, sharp corners, and different topologies.

In extrusion-based bioprinting these are, for instance, the printing pressure, the nozzle diameter, the target extrusion velocity and/or mass flow rate . They should be properly set in order to allow printability of the bio-ink, as well as to ensure high cell viability at the end of the process. In fact, printing procedures expose cells to shear and extensional stresses that can lead to mechanobiological damage mechanisms. Bioprinting planning is then a challenging task since process variables are closely interconnected each other through the physical response of bio-inks. Non-Newtonian characteristics of bio-inks, together with possible complex geometries of the extruding system, generally introduce a strong non-linear coupling among process variables. To date, the bioprinting planning in laboratory practice is generally performed via expensive and time-consuming trial-and-error procedures. The aim of this work is the development of novel methodological approaches for an informed definition of printing process variables such to guarantee target conditions of the outcome. The non-linear coupling among dominant process variables is described via a semi-analytical approach, calibrated through high-fidelity numerical solutions and defined via a reduced-order modeling strategy. A cell damage law depending on bioprinting conditions is also introduced, generalizing state-of-the-art approaches on the basis of available experimental evidence. The proposed framework allows to build operative nomograms, whose practical utility is confirmed via some exemplary applications. The latter address the prediction of extrusion velocity, mass flow rate and cell viability, when both the printing pressure and nozzle diameter vary within typically-adopted ranges. The analyzed case studies highlight soundness and effectiveness of such a modeling strategy in providing a clear and straight pathway for planning and setup of bioprinting processes.},

  abstract     = {Traditional linear subspace-based reduced order models (LS-ROMs) can be used to significantly accelerate simulations in which the solution space of the discretized system has a small dimension (with a fast decaying Kolmogorov n n -width). However, LS-ROMs struggle to achieve speed-ups in problems whose solution space has a large dimension, such as highly nonlinear problems whose solutions have large gradients. Such an issue can be alleviated by combining nonlinear model reduction with operator learning. Over the past decade , many nonlinear manifold-based reduced order models (NM-ROM) have been proposed. In particular, NM-ROMs based on deep neural networks (DNN) have received increasing interest. This work takes inspiration from adaptive basis methods and specifically focuses on developing an NM-ROM based on Convolutional Neural Network-based autoencoders (CNNAE) with iteration-dependent trainable kernels. Additionally, we investigate DNN-based and quadratic operator inference strategies between latent spaces. A strategy to perform vectorized implicit time integration is also proposed. We demonstrate that the proposed CNN-based NM-ROM, combined with DNN-based operator inference, generally performs better than commonly employed strategies (in terms of prediction accuracy) on a benchmark advection-dominated problem. The method also presents substantial gain in terms of training speed per epoch, with a training time about one order of magnitude smaller than the one associated with a state-of-the-art technique performing with the same level of accuracy.},

To tackle this challenge, the proposed BSM fuses the information of the physical mechanism and the implicit features extracted from the captured data to develop the most suitable representation. The model discrepancy of physical information infused modeling is compensated via data-driven modeling. The resultant representation achieves the optimal balance between data fitting and model complexity. In addition, the uncertainties of all estimates are quantified to reflect the quality of the estimation and prediction. To demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed BSM, we present two simulated examples under various modeling conditions and a case study for seismic attenuation modeling utilizing the in-situ seismic records of a strong earthquake.},

  abstract     = {A force reconstruction method for uncertain structures instead of direct measurement is proposed in this paper. Considering the multi-source uncertainties as unknown-but-bounded (UBB) parameters including unknown structural dynamics and measurement errors, this study proposed a novel force reconstruction method using an interval strategy-based regularization approach with truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD). To overcome the drawbacks of incompleted models and limited information, the overall modelling and inversion of the interval force are reconstructed based on the non-probabilistic uncertainty theory. First, The interval uncertainty-based kernel function for force inversion is deduced using the second-order interval perturbation method , in which the uncertainties of the reconstructed force originate from the uncertain singular values and measurement errors. Based on the regularization of the TSVD, the interval bounds of the singular values can be accurately obtained. Combining the two typical regularization approaches, a novel interval strategy-based regularization approach is proposed to optimize the best regularization parameter based on the uncertain interval distribution of singular values. This novel strategy can not only balance the two typical regularization approaches but also reduce the burden of force inversion. Two numerical examples including a truss and space capsule are applied to access the proposed method, and the estimated accurate force can prove the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {A phase-field model for thermomechanically-induced fracture in NiTi at the single crystal level, i.e. , fracture under loading paths that may take advantage of either of the functional properties of NiTi–superelasticity or shape memory effect–, is presented, formulated within the kinematically linear regime . The model accounts for reversible phase transformation from austenite to martensite habit plane variants and plastic deformation in the austenite phase . Transformation-induced plastic deformation is viewed as a mechanism for accommodation of the local deformation incompatibility at the austenite–martensite interfaces and is accounted for by introducing an interaction term in the free energy derived based on the Mori–Tanaka and Kröner micromechanical assumptions and the hypothesis of martensite instantaneous growth within austenite. Based on experimental observations suggesting that NiTi fractures in a stress-controlled manner, damage is assumed to be driven by the elastic energy, i.e. , phase transformation and plastic deformation are assumed to contribute in crack formation and growth indirectly through stress redistribution. The model is restricted to quasistatic mechanical loading (no latent heat effects), thermal loading sufficiently slow with respect to the time rate of heat transfer by conduction (no thermal gradients), and a temperature range below M d Md , which is the temperature above which the austenite phase is stable, i.e. , stress-induced martensitic transformation is suppressed. The numerical implementation of the model is based on an efficient scheme of viscous regularization in both phase transformation and plastic deformation, an explicit numerical integration via a tangent modulus method, and a staggered scheme for the coupling of the unknown fields. The model is shown able to capture transformation-induced toughening, i.e. , stable crack advance attributed to the shielding effect of inelastic deformation left in the wake of the growing crack under nominal isothermal loading, actuation-induced fracture under a constant bias load, and crystallographic dependence on crack pattern.},

  abstract     = {Fluid–structure-interaction (FSI) phenomena with multi-phase flow dynamics and structural damage commonly exist in engineering practice, which however bring great challenges to nowadays numerical FSI algorithms. A novel localized subdomain smoothing MMALE particle method (ls-ALEPM) is proposed in this paper for efficient and accurate simulations of large scale FSI problems. The MMALE method and the MPM are strongly coupled by immersing the MPM particles into the MMALE grid. In order to avoid the spurious strain induced by the mixed FSI velocity field , a decoupled stress updating scheme is proposed to update the stress of solid particles by introducing a virtual velocity field in the vicinity of FSI interface. And specifically, the highly accurate polyhedron intersection based method is employed for its remapping phase, which however is time-consuming. Thus, the localized subdomain smoothing method (LSSM) is put forward to accelerate the remapping phase which only involves the distorted regions of computational grid . The LSSM is composed of a distorted subdomain determination step and a combinated mesh smoothing step. Each iteration of the combinated mesh smoothing step consists of the modified GETMe and the weighted average method, and the transfinite interpolation method is adopted if the quality criteria is still not satisfied after prescribed maximum number of iterations. The validity and efficiency of ls-ALEPM is verified by several benchmark numerical examples and practical engineering simulations.},

We have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed approach through these numerical examples . Specifically, to train the DeepONet for the syngas model, we solve the skeletal kinetic model for different initial conditions. In the first case, we parameterize the initial conditions based on equivalence ratios and initial temperature values. In the second case, we perform a direct numerical simulation of a two-dimensional temporally developing CO/H 2 CO/H2 jet flame with integrated chemistry modeling as a source of training data for the solution propagator. Then, we initialize the kinetic model by the thermochemical states visited by a subset of grid points at different time snapshots. Stiff chemical kinetics are computationally expensive to solve, thus, this work aims to develop a neural operator-based surrogate model to efficiently solve stiff chemical kinetics. The operator, once trained offline, can accurately integrate the thermochemical state for arbitrarily large time advancements , leading to significant computational gains compared to stiff integration schemes.},

  abstract     = {Numerical prediction of melt pool morphology and temperature distribution of thermomechanical processes (welding, additive manufacturing) plays an important role in understanding the relationships between process parameters and the quality of manufactured parts. The heat conduction models are limited in their predictability because the transport phenomena relevant to the melt pool dynamic are ignored. In contrast, the multiphysics model allows consideration of the heat transfer, free surface evolution, and transport phenomena in the melt pool, leading to more accurate predictions. However, the computational cost of multiphysics models makes them impractical for part-scale simulations. In this paper, a local moving thermal-fluid framework based on the finite element method is presented, which allows solving the thermal-fluid problem only in the small moving zone containing the melt pool and the heat transfer problem in the rest part. Therefore, this new proposed moving thermal-fluid (MTF) framework is predictive as well as the full thermal-fluid model, while it is much more efficient than a full thermal-fluid model since there are much fewer degrees of freedom (DOF) to solve. Finally, numerical validation tests in welding and additive manufacturing simulations highlight its computational efficiency and high-fidelity, and a relative error of less than 2.6% was observed in predicting melting pool dimensions compared to full thermal-fluid model. In the part-scale simulation of laser welding benchmark, the MTF model takes only 62 h in place of about three weeks required by a full thermal-fluid model.},

  abstract     = {Computational biomechanical models of organ systems utilizing the finite element (FE) method have been extensively applied to the study of normal and pathophysiological function. While a robust method and providing for many unique pathophysiological insights, traditional FE methods remain prohibitively slow for real-time many-query clinical applications. To meet these demanding computational requirements, we have developed a general neural network finite element (NNFE) approach for hyperelastic soft tissue organ simulations that can produce equivalent accuracy within clinically relevant time frames. However, many organ systems involve contact between structural elements (e.g. heart valve leaflets), which has not been previously addressed in the NNFE and related approaches. In the present work, we developed a NNFE-based method for contact between elastic deformable bodies . We exploited the fact that stable equilibrium solutions in nonlinear hyperelasticity minimize the potential energy to train the neural network , with contact incorporated through an potential energy penalty. This penalty was discretized and computationally implemented in JAX (Google, Inc.) in a way that could be statically allocated and jit compiled for rapid computation on modern GPU hardware. Following our previous NNFE formulation , we represented the problem domain geometry and enforced the necessary boundary conditions using a Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) based geometry scheme. NURBS were chosen for their ability to smoothly represent body and surface geometries. To demonstrate the method, we developed and verified two basic contact problems using a hyperelastic material model: indentation and flap. Both problems were simulated with a fully connected neural network with a parallel linear layer. Training continued until the gradient of the energy with respect to network parameters dropped below 1 0 − 2 10−2 , taking less than six hours in each case studied. Once trained, the NNFE approach was capable of accurately predicting the equilibrium configurations of representative contact problems. Moreover, the NNFE contact approach required nearly six order of magnitude less time to evaluate than an equivalent FEniCSx implementation that utilized a similar mesh of cubic order Lagrange elements (0.01 s compared to 1715 seconds, respectively). Moreover, the solutions were trained over full ranges of loading and were thus able to faithfully represent families of solutions without requiring retraining. While addressing basic problems in contact, this study serves as crucial stepping stone to generate NNFE organ simulations for rapid prediction of patient specific solutions that involve contact.},

  abstract     = {Embedded and immersed methods have become essential tools in computational mechanics, as they allow discretizing arbitrarily complex geometries without the need for boundary-fitted meshes. One of their main challenges is the accurate numerical integration of cut elements. Among the various integration schemes developed for this purpose, moment fitting has proven to be a powerful technique that provides highly efficient and accurate integration rules. This publication presents a framework for the robust and efficient numerical integration of embedded solids described by oriented boundary meshes using moment fitting. The developments include an intersection algorithm that aims to drastically accelerate the computation of the necessary moments while achieving high accuracy. A closed surface parameterization of each cut domain is computed to facilitate the direct application of the divergence theorem. The algorithm is subject to a single quality criterion that guarantees the accurate evaluation of boundary integrals. At the same time, it allows to disregard classical mesh criteria, such as high aspect ratios, strongly varying angles, etc., resulting in extremely fast runtimes. In addition, an existing robust flood fill-based element classification scheme is further developed to initiate filling from arbitrary seed elements and to enable parallel execution, increasing its flexibility and efficiency. The successful application of all proposed algorithms to 4948 valid and flawed STLs from the Thingi10K database (Zhou and Jacobson, 2016) demonstrates their extraordinary robustness. In all cases, the wall-clock time scales at most linearly with the number of elements in the background mesh. We show that higher-order quadrature rules on the boundary elements enable efficient computation of the moments via the divergence theorem with near-machine precision. Finally, the presented methodologies are used to perform direct FE analyses on clean and flawed B-Rep models. All proposed algorithms are publicly available in the open-source C++ framework QuESo – Quadrature for Embedded Solids ( https://github.com/manuelmessmer/QuESo ), where the moment fitting equations are assembled and solved.},

On the contrary, it plays a critical role when static or eigenvalue analyses are required, especially for those cases featuring free motions. While the topic of holonomic constraint equations and their respective Jacobian matrix is not new in literature, this article aims to provide a general and unified formulation based on quaternion parametrization together with a consistent analytical expression of the tangent stiffness matrix derived through linearization. The article includes also the rheonomic contribution to holonomic constraints. The formulations presented in this work are built on a mixed-basis formulation, in use in many engineering applications , and allow to easily derive specialized versions (e.g. revolute, cylindrical, prismatic joints , etc.) from the same equation set. Examples demonstrate the doubly-positive effect of this additional stiffness term: first, static analyses are able to converge to the actual equilibrium position and second, the eigenvalues analyses proved to be more consistent. For this latter set of tests the non-linear dynamic results, observed in the frequency domain, are compared against those coming from eigenvalue analysis , in order to prove the augmented accuracy of the results.},

Deep learning methods usually struggle to reliably decrease the error in their approximate solution . A new methodology to better control the error for deep learning methods is presented here. The main idea consists in computing an initial approximation to the problem using a simple neural network and in estimating, in an iterative manner, a correction by solving the problem for the residual error with a new network of increasing complexity. This sequential reduction of the residual of the partial differential equation allows one to decrease the solution error , which, in some cases, can be reduced to machine precision. The underlying explanation is that the method is able to capture at each level smaller scales of the solution using a new network.

Such interpolation treats position and orientation as a unit and a member of the SE ( 3 ) SE(3) Lie group. This unified approach allows for elegant mathematical manipulation. By adapting the Lie midpoint rule appropriately, it becomes possible to express energy changes in terms of inertial and internal forces, thus enabling the derivation of a momentum conserving and almost energy conserving time integration algorithm. The precision of energy conservation depends solely on the length of the finite elements. With further modification, this algorithm can also become an energy-decaying algorithm. Despite the configuration-dependent nature of the interpolation, the need to deal with its derivatives is avoided, which simplifies the implementation. The method is tested using 3D numerical example with finite rotations which confirms, that the method indeed has the conservation properties and is stable and robust.},

  abstract     = {Artificial rabbits (AR) optimization is a newly proposed swarm intelligence algorithm. The idea of AR optimization (ARO) is inspired by the nature behaviors of the AR including the detour foraging, the random hiding and the energy shrink. Although ARO has better performance than many classical natural heuristic algorithms, it still has some disadvantages such as lacking the diversity of the population and easy to trap in the local optimal. To mitigate the influence of the above defects, this paper respectively introduces the mutation strategy, the prey identification strategy and the elite opposition-based learning strategy into the original algorithm, and proposes a new meta swarm intelligence optimization algorithm termed MNEARO. Firstly, the mutation strategy is introduced into the two natural behaviors of ARO to expand its exploration range in the solution space and increase the probability of finding the global optimal. Secondly, replacing the captured individuals with the predators that take better action trajectories to achieve the population evolution. Another candidate population is generated by the prey identification strategy, thus improving the population diversity and dynamics of ARO. Finally, the elite opposition-based learning strategy improves the exploitation ability of ARO and the overall quality of the population by selecting some individuals with the better fitness values as the elites and using the greedy selection before the end of each iteration. A series of performance tests are conducted on the CEC2020 test set in four dimensions and the CEC2022 test set in the highest dimension respectively to verify that the proposed MNEARO has better convergence and robustness. In addition, the practicality of MNEARO is further highlighted through five mechanical optimization designs, two truss topology optimization designs and the vehicle cruise control system. The experimental results show that the proposed MNEARO has a strong competitiveness in solving complex optimization problems with different dimensions.},

  abstract     = {The work presents a node-moving algorithm for topology optimization (NMTO) in the arbitrarily shaped design domain. Also, we further enhanced a body-fitted mesh generation algorithm to express smooth boundaries more efficiently. In each optimization iteration, a narrowband offset from the structural profile is established, based on which a signed-distance function is constructed to determine the node-moving direction. At the same time, the magnitude of node velocity is derived from the shape derivative of the objective function - the sum of mean compliance and mean curvature. After the signed-distance function is updated based on the new position of the nodes within the narrowband with the abovementioned velocity, boundaries implicitly represented by its zero-level contour are obtained naturally. Such a forward Euler updating scheme is much more efficient than the well-known upwind algorithm for the body-fitted mesh as it avoids the interpolation of triangular nodes to the rectangular nodes and a small time step. Compared with other methods, benchmark numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method can produce elegant structures with smoother boundaries and better objective functions for optimization problems seeking maximal stiffness or displacement at a prescribed node. In addition, the proposed approach prevents, to a large extent, useless void parts from being included in the time-consuming finite element analysis.},

A few works on topological optimization based on FE 2 computational homogenization to concurrently evolve the structure and sub-structure have been reported. However, significant expertise and coding are required in the conventional implementation of FE 2 . It is shown that multiscale FE 2 optimization can be readily implemented on commercial finite element codes using the Direct FE 2 approach. The multiscale analysis is carried out as a single topology optimization job on commercial FE software. Numerical example problems are solved using ABAQUS to demonstrate the proposed method for stiffness optimization.

  abstract     = {We introduce the concept of physics-guided transfer learning to predict the thermal conductivity of an additively manufactured short-fiber reinforced polymer (SFRP) using micro-structural characteristics extracted from tensile tests. Developing composite manufacturing digital twins for SFRP composite processes like extrusion deposition additive manufacturing (EDAM) require extensive experimental material characterization. Even the same material system printed on different EDAM systems can result in significant changes to the printed micro-structure, affecting the mechanical and transport properties. This, in turn, makes characterization efforts expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the objective of the paper is to address this experimental bottleneck and use prior information about the material manufactured in one extrusion system to predict its properties when manufactured in another system. To enable this framework, we assume that changes in properties of the same material when manufactured in different systems arise solely due to microstructural changes. To that end, we present a Bayesian framework that can transfer thermal conductivity properties across extrusion deposition additive manufacturing systems. While we discuss the transfer of thermal conductivity properties, the development is such that the framework can be used for the transfer of other properties that depend on microstructural characteristics defined in the manufacturing process. These include the coefficient of thermal expansion, viscoelastic properties, etc. The framework begins by using thermal conductivity data of the composite printed in one extrusion system to probabilistically infer the constituent thermal properties of the fiber and the polymer. Next, by conducting limited tensile tests of the same material printed in another extrusion system, we infer its orientation tensor. Finally, the inferred constituent thermal conductivity properties and the inferred orientation tensor are coupled using a micromechanics model to predict the thermal conductivity properties of the composite printed in the second extrusion system. We experimentally verify the predictions and show that our method provides a reliable framework for transferring material properties while accounting for epistemic and aleatory uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In order to perform isogeometric analysis with increased smoothness on complex domains, trimming, variational coupling or unstructured spline methods can be used. The latter two classes of methods require a multi-patch segmentation of the domain, and provide continuous bases along patch interfaces. In the context of shell modelling, variational methods are widely used, whereas the application of unstructured spline methods on shell problems is rather scarce. In this paper, we therefore provide a qualitative and a quantitative comparison of a selection of unstructured spline constructions, in particular the D-Patch, Almost- C 1 C1 , Analysis-Suitable G 1 G1 and the Approximate C 1 C1 constructions. Using this comparison, we aim to provide insight into the selection of methods for practical problems, as well as directions for future research. In the qualitative comparison, the properties of each method are evaluated and compared. In the quantitative comparison, a selection of numerical examples is used to highlight different advantages and disadvantages of each method. In the latter, comparison with weak coupling methods such as Nitsche’s method or penalty methods is made as well. In brief, it is concluded that the Approximate C 1 C1 and Analysis-Suitable G 1 G1 converge optimally in the analysis of a bi-harmonic problem, without the need of special refinement procedures. Furthermore, these methods provide accurate stress fields. On the other hand, the Almost- C 1 C1 and D-Patch provide relatively easy construction on complex geometries . The Almost- C 1 C1 method does not have limitations on the valence of boundary vertices , unlike the D-Patch, but is only applicable to biquadratic local bases. Following from these conclusions, future research directions are proposed, for example towards making the Approximate C 1 C1 and Analysis-Suitable G 1 G1 applicable to more complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the computation of the solutions to periodic cell problems that arise in a number of homogenization schemes. Formulated in terms of a generic constitutive relation, encompassing the linear and non-linear cases, a model problem is intended to be discretized on a Fourier-basis and solved using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based iterative scheme . Such a spectral method , which makes use of a uniform grid and global basis functions, has inherent limitations for correctly capturing any localized features of the solution, such as singularities or discontinuities. An adaptive method is proposed here to overcome these shortcomings. It relies on the introduction of a non-homogeneous bijective mapping between the original physical domain and a computational domain, where the Fourier spectral method will be used to solve a transformed problem. This makes it possible both to discretize the original equations on a non-uniform grid, concentrating grid points where necessary to increase computational accuracy , and to maintain the use of standard FFT schemes. To compute the mapping, an approach based on optimal transport is proposed and a numerical scheme based on FFT tools is described. A number of adaptive strategies are then discussed, either based on a priori material-based considerations, or a posteriori using a preliminary solution. The properties of the transported problem in the computational domain are described and the applicability, up to minor modifications, of a number of standard iterative schemes is discussed. A set of numerical examples is included to assess the performances of the method, both in the case of linear conductivity and for a strongly non-linear elastoplastic problem, evaluating its results both qualitatively with full-field comparisons and quantitatively with error measurements relatively to the number of iterations, the discretization and the original material contrast. Overall, these results show that, for a given discretization and compared with a computation on a regular grid, a systematic gain in accuracy is obtained using the adaptive method on a non-uniform grid.},

  abstract     = {When repeated evaluations for varying parameter configurations of a high-fidelity physical model are required, surrogate modeling techniques based on model order reduction are desirable. In absence of the governing equations describing the dynamics, we need to construct the parametric reduced-order surrogate model in a non-intrusive fashion. In this setting, the usual residual-based error estimate for optimal parameter sampling associated with the reduced basis method is not directly available. Our work provides a non-intrusive error-estimator-based optimality criterion to efficiently populate the parameter snapshots, thereby, enabling us to effectively construct a parametric surrogate model. We consider parameter-specific proper orthogonal decomposition subspaces and propose an active-learning-driven surrogate model using kernel-based shallow neural networks (KSNNs), abbreviated as ActLearn-POD-KSNN surrogate model. The center location for each kernel, along with center-dependent kernel widths, can be learned for the KSNN by using an alternating dual-staged iterative training procedure. To demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed ideas, we present numerical experiments using four physical models, including incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The ActLearn-POD-KSNN surrogate model efficiently predicts the solution at new parameter locations, even for a setting with multiple interacting shock profiles and a fluid flow scenario with Hopf bifurcation. We also provide an investigation of the surrogate’s performance when the available data is noisy.},

  abstract     = {In numerical analysis of frame structures, modeling of the connection between structural members often requires the introduction of rigid end offsets to correctly describe the stiffness of the joints. This is typical of beam-to-column connections in civil constructions but is also common in lattice materials, where the element overlapping at the joints locally increases the stiffness of the nodes. However, when nonlinear geometric effects are included, correct simulation of such phenomena is challenging. This paper presents a geometrically nonlinear three-dimensional force-based beam finite element that efficiently accounts for the effects of rigid joint offsets. The model imposes the element equilibrium in the local reference system referring to the element deformed configuration, considering the von Kármán nonlinear terms, and exploits a corotational formulation to account for rigid large displacements and rotations of the beam. Two alternative approaches are used to introduce the rigid offsets. The first derives from an existing proposal where kinematic and static nonlinear operators are adopted to describe the behavior of the rigid portions at the element ends. The second is a novel approach, easier to implement and use, that involves modifying the integration, along the element axis, of the cross-section strains and flexibility. This can be easily defined for beam models under linear geometry assumption but requires particular attention for the analysis of frame structures under large displacements and strains. Both approaches are validated through numerical examples, including comparison with other numerical methods and experimental results available in the literature.},

The solver is developed in the mesoscopic scale framework, where a continuous variation of the physical parameters of the porous medium (e.g., porosity and permeability) is assumed. The Navier–Stokes–Brinkman equations are solved along with the continuity equation, under the hypothesis of incompressible fluid. The porous medium is assumed to be fully saturated and can potentially be anisotropic. The domain is discretized with unstructured meshes allowing local refinements. A fractional time step procedure is applied, where one predictor and two corrector steps are solved within each time iteration. The predictor step is solved in the framework of a marching in space and time procedure, with some important numerical advantages. The two corrector steps require the solution of large linear systems, whose matrices are sparse, symmetric and positive definite, with M M -matrix property over Delaunay-meshes. A fast and efficient solution is obtained using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The discretization adopted for the two corrector steps can be regarded as a Two-Point-Flux-Approximation (TPFA) scheme, which, unlike the standard TPFA schemes, does not require the grid mesh to be K K -orthogonal, (with K K the anisotropy tensor). As demonstrated with the provided test cases, the proposed scheme correctly retains the anisotropy effects within the porous medium. Furthermore, it overcomes the restrictions of existing mesoscopic scale one-domain approaches proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {An efficient computational framework to model the growth of intersecting height-contained hydraulic fractures is proposed. The fracture in solids is modeled by the classical theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics, whereas the injection flow in hydraulic fractures is treated as channel flow. The governing equations of fracture mechanics are formulated in terms of weakly-singular weak-form boundary integral equations, with the knowledge of the fracture surface geometry exploited to reduce the integral dimension. The fluid flow within the fracture is treated using finite element method as one dimensional flow in an arbitrarily curved channel. The symmetric Galerkin boundary element method and finite element method are coupled with the traction continuity condition. The model is then formulated in a variational form and augmented with Lagrange multipliers to prescribe displacement constraints on intersections of hydraulic fractures, while fluid constraints are enforced by a consolidation of associated pressure degrees of freedom. Pertinent numerical implementation techniques, including spatial and temporal discretizations, special crack tip element, crack propagation criteria and remeshing strategy, are presented. The proposed framework is verified by comparing to the numerical results from a three dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator and then verified by comparing the stress intensity factors to the XFEM and Murakami’s results for both star shaped cracks and symmetric branched cracks. The verification shows the utility properly enforces the physical constraints on the intersections of fractures. Three numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the capability of the proposed computational framework modeling the intersecting hydraulic fracturing process in a single or separated height-contained pay zones.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are function approximators that can incorporate physics laws during training. In recent years, PINNs have been shown to be capable of reconstructing fluid behavior using constraints based on the Navier–Stokes equations and field data. On the downside, the lack of time resolution in a wide range of experimental applications severely limits the applicability of PINNs. We propose a novel methodology based on feeding PINNs with time-resolved fields estimated from non-time-resolved field measurements (e.g. particle image velocimetry) and time-resolved pointprobe measurements (e.g. hot-wires). First, the dimensionality of the problem is reduced by using as a target the temporal modes from a truncated proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the velocity fields. Then, using a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a correspondence is established between probe data and the POD time coefficients of the velocity fields. The estimated fields are then fed to the PINN to enhance the data and increase precision. As a further benefit, additional derived quantities not available in the raw data, such as the pressure distribution, can be extracted if suitable boundary conditions are provided. We validate the method on synthetic test cases based on the direct numerical simulation of the wake of a fluidic pinball. Furthermore, we test the algorithm in an experimental case of the wake of a stalled wing. The results show that the PINN is able to reduce the error in the estimated fields, provided that the reference data obtained from the estimation with the MLP are sufficiently accurate.},

However, the current topology optimization design is mostly driven strictly based on mathematical and mechanical models. Although the innovative design can be automated, it mostly lacks effective manual experience guidance. To improve the efficiency of computer-aided structural design models, this work proposes a sketch-guided topology optimization approach based on machine learning. Using neural network-based style transfer techniques, computer-digitized/hand-drawn sketches are explicitly incorporated into topology optimization in the form of constraint functions. The obtained optimization results not only satisfy the requirements of optimal mechanical properties, but also fully demonstrate the design intention and requirements of designers. Numerical examples show that the proposed approach can effectively compensate for the lack of manual experience guidance for topology optimization.},

To obtain accurate distributions, existing methods often need massive calculations of the original response function, especially for highly nonlinear problems. To alleviate the computational burden, this paper proposes a multi-region active learning Kriging method to construct response distributions of highly nonlinear problems. First, a low-precision CDF curve is built based on the one-iteration MPP search and MPP prediction. Multiple regions and response values are then identified to obtain the limit state surfaces for Kriging modeling. To determine the best training points, a multi-region learning strategy including rough and precise selections is developed based on the U learning function and a hybrid index of the reward-based probability and nonlinearity. A two-level stopping criterion is further provided to achieve fast convergence and high accuracy. Finally, the response distributions are constructed using the obtained Kriging model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by four examples.},

The resulting approach for the convective equation is shown to be well-posed. A range of numerical results illustrate the stability and accuracy of the new approach, and its behaviour in comparison with an alternative approach using Taylor–Hood elements.

  abstract     = {This work develops a novel coordinate system transformation scheme to improve the performance of common radial basis function surrogate models . This coordinate system transformation scheme is based on the fact that commonly used basis functions are isotropic. Three main empirical findings are established in this study. Firstly, in general isotropic functions are inadequate to describe anisotropic data manifolds due to a mismatch between the functional form and the form of the data manifold resulting in poor generative performance. Counter-intuitively, utilising additional gradients during surrogate training often worsens the generative capability. Secondly, component-wise scaling of isotropic model forms during cross-validation is inadequate to enhance the functional form of the data manifold form as anisotropic coupling in the data manifold remains coupled. Improving the match between the functional form and the data manifold form requires both rotation and scaling. Thirdly, the coordinate system transformation scheme should predominantly be based on a collection of local curvature estimations and not on global curvature approximations . Gradients are critical to estimating the local curvature for identifying a near-optimal reference frame for surrogate construction, which then translates to additional benefits of gradients in gradient-enhanced surrogates. Based on the above observations, this paper proposes an isotropic transformation for the data coordinate system that performs near-optimal transformations on lower dimensional data without requiring any cross-validation. The method is compared against commonly applied component-wise cross-validation data coordinate system scaling as well as the more modern Active Subspace Method on a carefully crafted decomposable test problem, which has a known optimal coordinate system, that varies between 2 and 16 dimensions. The paper concludes after demonstrating that the developed transformation scheme, as well as the other common methods, will offer little benefit on non-decompose problems and offers some suggestions on future work to create a more general isotropic transformation.},

  abstract     = {Misfolded tau proteins play a critical role in the progression and pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Recent studies suggest that the spatio-temporal pattern of misfolded tau follows a reaction–diffusion type equation. However, the precise mathematical model and parameters that characterize the progression of misfolded protein across the brain remain incompletely understood. Here, we use deep learning and artificial intelligence to discover a mathematical model for the progression of Alzheimer’s disease using longitudinal tau positron emission tomography from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Specifically, we integrate physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and symbolic regression to discover a reaction–diffusion type partial differential equation for tau protein misfolding and spreading. First, we demonstrate the potential of our model and parameter discovery on synthetic data. Then, we apply our method to discover the best model and parameters to explain tau imaging data from 46 individuals who are likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and 30 healthy controls. Our symbolic regression discovers different misfolding models f ( c ) f(c) for two groups, with a faster misfolding for the Alzheimer’s group, f ( c ) = 0 . 23 c 3 − 1 . 34 c 2 + 1 . 11 c f(c)=0.23c3−1.34c2+1.11c , than for the healthy control group, f ( c ) = − c 3 + 0 . 62 c 2 + 0 . 39 c f(c)=−c3+0.62c2+0.39c . Our results suggest that PINNs, supplemented by symbolic regression, can discover a reaction–diffusion type model to explain misfolded tau protein concentrations in Alzheimer’s disease. We expect our study to be the starting point for a more holistic analysis to provide image-based technologies for early diagnosis, and ideally early treatment of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and possibly other misfolding-protein based neurodegenerative disorders.},

  abstract     = {Dehomogenization techniques are becoming increasingly popular for enhancing lattice designs of compliant mechanical systems with ultra-large resolutions. Their effectiveness hinges on computing a deformed periodic grid that enable to reconstruct fine-scale designs with modulated and oriented patterns. In this paper, we propose an approach for extending dehomogenization methods to laminar fluid systems. We initiate our methodology by asymptotically deriving Darcy’s law on a periodically porous medium deformed by a diffeomorphism . Unlike the mechanical context, we reveal that the homogenized permeability matrix depends not solely on local the orientation but also on the local dilation of the deformed periodic medium. This distinction presents one of the several challenges to be tackled when adapting dehomogenization-based topology optimization techniques to porous media. To accommodate existing methodologies, we formulate a simplified “poor man’s” homogenized model, which streamlines various aspects, yet still leans on periodic cell problems to estimate the spatially varying permeability matrix. Specifically, we overlook boundary layer effects, we presume periodic grid deformations, and we neglect local dilation, solely considering the relationship with local cell orientations. Subsequently, we present a numerical approach for designing a system that redistributes an input flow across numerous regularly spaced outlets at an output interface. Leveraging the homogenized model, we deduce optimized geometric arrangements of local channel spacing parameters and orientations. We then use established methods to reconstruct grid deformations and fine-scale designs. The fidelity of these reconstructions is then validated through fine-scale simulations. Our observations indicate that while the proposed designs yield satisfactory performance when subjected to the full-scale model, discernible deviations from the homogenized model persist, appealing to future improvements.},

  abstract     = {Hydraulic fracturing and acidification techniques are important approaches for deep energy recovery engineering. However, the details of the interactions and impacts between acid fluids and solid porous media remain inadequately modelled, necessitating further research in this domain. Building on this need, we present a novel approach for modelling the chemo-hydro-mechanical response in sandstone during fracture propagation which is induced by the injection of acid fluids into the reservoir. Our comprehensive framework integrates various mechanisms including acidified reactions in sandstone, reactive flow transport, pore pressure diffusion, solid deformation, mass exchanges due to chemical reactions, and fracture propagation in poroelastic media, all within the framework of the phase field approach. To accurately capture the system’s behaviour, we derive its total potential energy , taking into account factors such as poroelasticity, fracture forces acting on the fracture sides, and crack dissipation, while also integrating the mechanical–chemical degradation function into the energy derivations. The progress of chemical degradation , which we treat as a damage parameter, is characterized by mass exchanges, and these in turn manifest as changes in porosity. In order to quantify these mass exchanges, we have established a corresponding mass balance equation specifically for the minerals involved. These changes in porosity can be naturally and effectively described through the volumetric relations of the minerals situated within the solid porous media. The proposed coupled framework is verified through multiple numerical examples . Initially, we validate the model using a classical unit-slit crack example for the solid phase and discuss the predominant influences of porosity alterations on the mechanical response of solid cracking. Following this, we verify the model by injecting water/acid and compare the results with analytical solutions. Finally, a chemical benchmark is employed to calibrate the chemical reaction model and simulate acid fluid injection scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes novel and robust stabilization strategies for accurately modeling incompressible fluid flow problems in the material point method (MPM). To address the modeling of Newtonian fluids with incompressibility constraints, a new mixed implicit MPM formulation is proposed. Here, instead of solving the velocity and pressure fields as the unknown variables like the typical Eulerian computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, the proposed approach adopts a monolithic displacement–pressure formulation inspired by the mixed-form updated-Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM). To satisfy the inf–sup stability condition, two stabilization strategies are integrated into the formulation: the variational multiscale method (VMS) and the pressure-stabilization Petrov–Galerkin method (PSPG). By concurrently solving the displacement and pressure fields, the developed monolithic solver obviates the need for free-surface detection as well as Dirichlet and Neumann pressure imposition, in contrast to the fractional-step method. This attribute mitigates spurious pressure and velocity oscillations in simulating dynamic and transient flow problems. This study also addresses other prevalent challenges in MPM simulations, such as the pressure oscillations triggered by cell-crossing errors, particle-distribution-induced quadrature errors, and particle-grid information transfer . To resolve these issues, the quadratic B-Spline basis function, the delta-correction method, and the Taylor particle-in-cell method are incorporated into the proposed mixed MPM formulation, thereby enhancing numerical stability . The efficacy of the proposed stabilized incompressible MPM framework is validated through several benchmark cases, comparing the obtained results with other numerical methods and analytical solutions. Furthermore, the method’s capability in simulating real-world problems involving violent free-surface fluid motion is demonstrated through comparisons with experimental results of water sloshing and dam break scenarios.},

This methodology relies on a harmonic balance method-based solving procedure combined with the application of the Melnikov energy principle. It is able to predict the location of isolated branches of solutions in the vicinity of families of autonomous periodic solutions, namely nonlinear normal modes . The methodology is first applied on a two-degree-of-freedom phenomenological system in order to illustrate its relevance and accuracy. In particular, for this academic application, the proposed methodology yields an understanding of the discontinuous evolution of the first nonlinear resonance frequency as the forcing amplitude increases. Isolated branches of solutions featuring high amplitudes of vibration are detected far beyond nonlinear resonance frequencies obtained with a typical application of the harmonic balance method coupled with an arc-length continuation algorithm. Demonstration of the applicability of the proposed methodology to high-dimensional industrial finite element models is made with the nonlinear vibration analysis of a transsonic compressor blade , NASA rotor 37, subjected to an harmonic loading and blade-tip/casing structural contacts. The proposed methodology yields numerous isolated branches of solutions, which relevance is assessed by means of time integration simulations. In the end, the presented results underline that typical continuation algorithms may yield a significant underestimation of nonlinear resonance frequencies.},

In the present work, different techniques to measure directly the particles’ volumes by their positions are displayed. Thanks to these algorithms, we discussed how volume errors develop when introducing stabilization terms in the standard SPH schemes. Further, we show that the control of these errors can be achieved through two different (non-alternative) stabilization terms: (i) enforcement of dynamic boundary conditions on thin fluid jets and drops; and (ii) a dynamical switch that can impose or not the time variation of the particle masses. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical techniques , four different violent sloshing flows are investigated and compared with experimental data .},

The method belongs to a class of viscosity-splitting procedures and it consists of separating the convection term and incompressibility constraint into two time steps. Unlike the conventional projection methods, the viscosity is not dropped in the last step allowing to enforce the full original boundary conditions on the end-of-step velocity which eliminates any concerns about the numerical boundary layers. We carry out a rigorous error analysis and provide a full first-order error estimate for both the velocity and pressure solutions in the relevant norms. Numerical results are presented for two test examples of non-Newtonian fluid flows to demonstrate the theoretical analysis and confirm the reliability of this viscosity-splitting scheme.},

  abstract     = {The scope of this paper is to propose an appropriate numerical strategy to extend the Mixed Finite Element–Finite Volume (MEV) scheme to adapted meshes composed of both triangular and quadrangular elements, called hybrid meshes (Kallinderis and Kavouklis, 2005; Ito et al., 2013) (also named mixed-element meshes (Marcum and Gaither, 1999; Mavriplis, 2000)). Convective, diffusive and source terms require specific gradient discretization to maintain a global second-order accuracy. The major contributions of this paper concern the specification of these gradients, the convective fluxes’ discretization and an innovative framework for anisotropic metric-based adaptation on hybrid meshes. Particularly, the V4 scheme, traditionally developed for triangular elements, is extended to quadrilateral elements. This method maintains the same order of accuracy as the baseline version when upwind/downwind quadrilateral elements are aligned with the attached edge. Viscous fluxes are discretized using the APproximated Finite Element (APFE) method (Puigt et al., 2010), which is second-order accurate on regular quadrilaterals. Nodal gradients, which are considered at boundaries and for source terms, are discretized with a generalization of Clement ’s L 2 L2 -operator on hybrid meshes. The mesh adaptation relies on a specific metric gradation process to favor the clustering of structured elements at wall boundaries. The proposed scheme is validated on a set of CFD simulations.},

  abstract     = {Detecting and characterising shocks is challenging because they do not occur in isolation but are instead superimposed onto underlying vehicle vibrations which themselves are a result of the interaction with uneven road surfaces. Consequently, shocks are buried within vehicle vibration response measurements (usually acceleration). This paper presents the development and validation of an automated algorithm to detect shocks from vertical acceleration signals measured from road vehicles. To avoid inherent difficulties with experimentation, this initial paper is confined to numerical simulation whereby the response of two typical quarter-car truck models (one with air ride and the other with steel suspension) when travelling on artificially-generated random road elevation profiles laced with Hanning-shaped surface aberrations of known amplitude, lengths and location along the elevation profile. The shock detection algorithm was developed as a dual mode classifier to accommodate the two natural frequencies of each 2DoF quarter car models. Detection was implemented by first passing the vibration response signal through a band-pass filter around the two resonant modes in turn then calculating the filtered signals’ instantaneous frequency (envelope) by means of the Hilbert transform . Shock detection was based on the local peak-to-mean ratio (LPTMR) of the instantaneous magnitude where ‘local’ was defined by the duration of the filtered signal&#39;s impulse response function . Sensitivity analysis and validation were undertaken on artificially-generated roads of varying roughness onto which aberrations of known shape were superimposed. The effectiveness and limitations (detection threshold) of the algorithm were evaluated by creating a range of aberrations with a broad range of lengths (effective frequencies) and diminishing amplitudes. Results show that shocks of ‘significant’ magnitudes are always detected with no detection of false positives . As the road roughness increases relative to the aberration amplitudes, the resulting shocks become increasingly drowned-out by the vibration response due to the underlying road roughness, especially for the quarter-car model with steel suspension. The main conclusion is that the signal analysis approach taken is ultimately effective and needs to be further validated using experimental response data.},

An efficient Euler explicit numerical integration algorithm , based on the inelastic (plastic or plastic-damage) predictor-elastic corrector approach, is utilized to analyze the stress and finite strain loading histories. Detailed discussions are provided on different numerical integration-related consistent tangent operators that achieve convergence within the global Newton–Raphson scheme.

The proposed method employs the developed bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) algorithm. The accuracy of the proposed technique is validated through the solution of benchmark problem and is further demonstrated in its effectiveness and robustness by examining several numerical examples . The optimization process considers various crack conditions, including the absence of cracks, horizontal and vertical cracks of different lengths. The optimized topologies obtained through the proposed algorithm clearly demonstrate the impact of crack presence, crack direction, and crack length on the material distribution. Furthermore, the convergence histories of the objective function, represented by mean compliance, highlight the influence of crack length on the stiffness and converged compliance of the structure.

The thermal and mechanical behaviors are described by continuum multi-phase models of porous materials governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), and the design parameter, material porosity, is an uncertain and spatially correlated field. After finite element discretization, these factors lead to a high-dimensional PDE-constrained optimization problem. The framework employs a risk-averse formulation that accounts for both the mean and variance of the design objectives. It incorporates two regularization techniques, the ℓ 0 ℓ0 -norm and phase field functionals, implemented using continuation numerical schemes to promote spatial sparsity in the design parameters. To ensure efficiency, the framework utilizes a second-order Taylor approximation for the mean and variance and exploits the low-rank structure of the preconditioned Hessian of the design objective. This results in computational costs that are determined by the rank of preconditioned Hessian, remaining independent of the number of uncertain parameters. The accuracy, scalability with respect to the parameter dimension, and sparsity-promoting abilities of the framework are assessed through numerical examples involving various building insulation components.},

In contrast with the standard incremental approach , which solves the (non-linear and computationally intensive) mechanical balance equations at every time step, the proposed PGD approach allows the mechanical balance equations to be solved exclusively for the small-time intra-cyclic response, while the large-time inter-cyclic response is described by simple scalar algebraic equations . Numerical simulations exhibiting complex cyclic responses, including a 2D problem and an application to a monopile foundation , demonstrate that PGD solutions with a limited number of space–time degrees of freedom may be obtained numerically, only requiring a few modes to accurately capture the reference response.},

This paper presents a stochastic LATIN method to solve stochastic and/or parameterized elastoplastic problems. To this end, the stochastic solution is decoupled into spatial, temporal and stochastic spaces, and approximated by the sum of a set of products of triplets of spatial functions, temporal functions and random variables . Each triplet is then calculated in a greedy way using a stochastic LATIN iteration. The high efficiency of the proposed method relies on two aspects: The nonlinearity is efficiently handled by inheriting advantages of the classical LATIN method, and the randomness and/or parameters are effectively treated by a sample-based approximation of stochastic spaces. Further, the proposed method is not sensitive to the stochastic and/or parametric dimensions of inputs due to the sample description of stochastic spaces. It can thus be applied to high-dimensional stochastic and parameterized problems. Five numerical examples demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed stochastic LATIN method.},

The detailed formulation and implementation of the method have been discussed in this work. The controlling parameters in the method include polynomial order, patch size, and dilation. A general choice of the parameters and their potential adaptivity have been discussed. The proposed DIC method has been tested by several representative examples, including the DIC challenge 2.0 benchmark problems, with comparison to the usual FE based DIC.

Moreover, an alternative image-based digital matrix method for generating random assemblies of circular particles of the same size is proposed. In addition, a modified smoothing algorithm to treat the staircase boundaries present in a quadtree mesh is developed in order to accurately and efficiently capture the sinter-neck features of overlapping circular particles. The proposed image-based mesh generation and analysis procedure is used to evaluate the relationship between microstructural parameters and effective Young’s modulus considering a large number of samples.

The unpredictability of the accuracy of neural operators impacts their applications in downstream problems of inference, optimization, and control. A framework based on the linear variational problem that gives the correction to the prediction furnished by neural operators is considered based on earlier work in JCP 486 (2023) 112104. The operator, called Residual-based Error Corrector Operator or simply Corrector Operator, associated with the corrector problem is analyzed further. Numerical results involving a nonlinear reaction–diffusion model in two dimensions with PCANet-type neural operators show almost two orders of increase in the accuracy of approximations when neural operators are corrected using the correction scheme. Further, topology optimization involving a nonlinear reaction–diffusion model is considered to highlight the limitations of neural operators and the efficacy of the correction scheme. Optimizers with neural operator surrogates are seen to make significant errors (as high as 80 percent). However, the errors are much lower (below 7 percent) when neural operators are corrected.},

  abstract     = {Numerical modeling of localizations is a challenging task due to the evolving rough solution in which the localization paths are not predefined. Despite decades of efforts, there is a need for innovative discretization-independent computational methods to predict the evolution of localizations. In this work, an improved version of the neural network-enhanced Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (NN-RKPM) is proposed for modeling brittle fracture . In the proposed method, a background reproducing kernel (RK) approximation defined on a coarse and uniform discretization is enriched by a neural network (NN) approximation under a Partition of Unity framework. In the NN approximation, the deep neural network automatically locates and inserts regularized discontinuities in the function space. The NN-based enrichment functions are then patched together with RK approximation functions using RK as a Partition of Unity patching function. The optimum NN parameters defining the location, orientation, and displacement distribution across location together with RK approximation coefficients are obtained via the energy-based loss function minimization. To regularize the NN-RK approximation, a constraint on the spatial gradient of the parametric coordinates is imposed in the loss function. Analysis of the convergence properties shows that the solution convergence of the proposed method is guaranteed. The NN enrichment allows the modeling of evolving cracks by a fixed coarse RK discretization without adaptive refinement for enhanced computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a series of numerical examples involving damage propagation and branching.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous improvement of structural performance requirements of advanced equipment, the multiscale design of materials and structures is increasingly developing towards refinement and multi-function. Metamaterials have broad application prospects due to their superior mechanical properties. In this paper, a robust topology optimization design strategy for mechanical metamaterials with multiple properties including modulus and Poisson&#39;s ratio is proposed. This method considers the manufacturing size uncertainty on properties of metamaterials and adopts a double-layer mesh technology to improve the efficiency of topology optimization. In addition, a topology optimization model for metamaterials with different mechanical properties is established, and mechanical metamaterials with various properties and configurations have been designed and validated. These can provide technical support and design references for the engineering application of mechanical metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Structural designs in the engineering field commonly require the prior embedding of several fixed-shape components to satisfy desired performance or functional requirements. In the past few decades, topology optimization has been regarded as an effective approach to deal with the optimization problems of continuous structures embedded with multiple components. However, the interfaces between the host supporting structure and embedded components are assumed perfect-bonded, which may result that the optimal design occurs interface failure and structural damage under extreme or long-time service conditions. In this study, a new topology optimization method of structures with embedded components considering the tension/compression-asymmetric interface stress constraint is proposed under the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method framework. This proposed method optimizes simultaneously the topology of the host structure and the layout of embedded components. A new interpolation model is developed to determine interface layers between the host structure and embedded components. Then, interface stress constraints are derived and imposed on each element of interface layers . For relieving the computational burden caused by enormous stress constraints, the global p-norm stress aggregation method is adopted to quantify the peak stresses. Subsequently, the interface stress constraint is introduced into the integrated optimization of multi-component layout and structural topology, the objective function is structural compliance and constraint functions are composed of volume, non-overlapping and tension/compression-asymmetric interface stress constraints. The corresponding sensitivity analyses are computed by using the adjoint method. Several two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient optimization algorithms is crucial across various scientific disciplines. As the complexity and diversity of optimization problems continue to grow, researchers seek faster and stronger algorithms capable of optimizing a wide range of functions. This paper introduces Lung performance-based optimization (LPO), a novel and efficient algorithm inspired by the regular and intelligent performance of lungs in the human body. LPO draws inspiration from the intricate mechanisms and adaptability of the respiratory system. The lungs exhibit remarkable efficiency in oxygen exchange, demonstrating a high level of optimization in their function. The forced oscillation technique measures air pressure and airflow rate to evaluate the respiratory system as an electrical impedance. The impedance curves have two distinct components, respiratory resistance (ZR) and respiratory reactance (ZX), which can be analyzed clinically and from an engineering perspective to gain insights into the respiratory system&#39;s workings. LPO aims to provide an innovative approach to solving complex optimization problems by emulating and harnessing this natural efficiency. To evaluate the effectiveness of LPO, experiments were conducted using the unconstrained optimization functions CEC2005 and CEC2014, as well as engineering design optimization problems. These problems were compared against numerous contemporary algorithms proposed in the literature. The results demonstrate that LPO excels in handling these optimization problems and exhibits the potential to tackle a wide range of modern optimization challenges. The findings highlight the power and effectiveness of LPO as a new optimization algorithm. With its inspiration rooted in the sophisticated performance of the lungs, LPO offers a unique perspective in the optimization landscape. Its ability to handle diverse optimization problems and its potential for application in various domains make LPO a promising algorithm for future research and practical implementation. Note that the source code of the LPO is publicly available at https://www.optim-app.com/projects/lpo .},

  abstract     = {The method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been recently developed to study the coupled flow-deformation problems in porous material and considerable success has been achieved comparing to traditional mesh-based method, especially for treating large deformation and post-failure. However, computational challenges remain for the hydro-mechanical boundary treatment as well as the accuracy and stability of the numerical scheme. It is shown that the use of conventional SPH operator for the solution of the coupled problem can lead to several issues including numerical instabilities, inaccuracies and unphysical particle clumping as well as particle disorders near the boundary. To address these issues, a general SPH scheme with enhanced accuracy for saturated/unsaturated porous material is proposed in this paper. An improved SPH formulation for seepage analysis is proposed to allow an accurate prediction of liquid flow in porous material. A new stabilisation technique that combines the use of a density diffusion term, a modified particle shifting algorithm, and a new viscous damping term is developed to further improve the accuracy, stability and robustness of the proposed method. The implementations of stress boundary conditions and hydraulic boundary conditions in SPH, such as confining stress, hydraulic head, infiltration/evaporation, and potential seepage face, using either wall boundary particles or free-surface domain particles, are discussed in detail. A range of benchmark examples is adopted to verify the validity of the present coupled framework. The proposed model is finally applied to simulate the failure process of embankment dam due to rapid drawdown. Results indicate that the methodology proposed herein can be a promising tool for the analysis of the coupled hydro-mechanical process in porous material involving large deformations.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel computational approach for modelling fluid-driven fracturing in quasi-brittle solids using peridynamics . The approach leverages a rigorous coupling of the total- and semi-Lagrangian formulations of peridynamics. Specifically, the total-Lagrangian formulation, whch is based on classical peridynamics theory used for modelling fractures in solids, is combined with the semi-Lagrangian formulation to solve the Navier-Stokes equation using a non-local differential operator for weakly compressible fluid flow . The proposed approach offers a unified peridynamics-based framework that enables simulations of a wide range of fluid-driven fracturing problems in solids. The framework can model the solid as either an ordinary or non-ordinary material and quantify the fluid with different equations of state . To prevent unphysical inter-penetration, a fluid-solid interaction scheme that assumes fictitious fluid points in the solid domain is proposed to quantify the forces at the fluid-solid interface. The proposed computational approach is validated through simulations of several classic problems, including the dam break and the Kristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD) problem. The predictive capability of the proposed approach is further demonstrated by numerical examples of fractures induced by fluid injection in sandstone, which reasonably capture the fracture patterns compared to experimental results. The presented approach offers an alternative to explicit modelling of fluid-driven fracturing processes and may find wide and useful applications to a variety of industrial and geophysical processes.},

  abstract     = {The turbulent flow characteristics , such as its multiscale and nonlinear nature, make the solution to turbulent flow problems complex. To simplify these problems, traditional methods have employed simplifications, such as RANS and LES models for dealing with the multiscale aspect and linear approximation theories for dealing with the nonlinear aspect. We designed a multiscale and nonlinear turbulence characteristic extraction model using a graph neural network with spatial convolutions and nonlinear fitting capabilities. Unlike traditional methods, this model computes turbulence data directly without resorting to simplified formulas. The multiscale problem is addressed by an anisotropic filter operator, and the nonlinear problem is dealt with through nonlinear correlation and nonlinear activation functions . To enhance the training efficiency of the model, a single training framework was implemented. This framework allows models trained on turbulent data with different Reynolds numbers to be applied. The relative errors for the X-axis velocity ( U ), Y-axis velocity ( V ) and pressure ( P ) are 0.932 %, 1.020 % and 0.594 %, respectively, when using turbulence data with the Reynolds number (Re) of 5×10 5 as the training set. Using Re = 1 × 10 3 and Re = 5 × 10 5 as training data and Re = 1× 10 5 as test data , the relative errors for U, V and P were found to be 2.527 %, 6.284 % and 0.799 % (Re = 1× 10 5 ). The study also analysed the impact of the anisotropic filter operator and nonlinearity on turbulence simulation and found that both play a critical role in turbulence calculation. These experiments demonstrate that the multiscale nonlinear turbulence simulator has a high computational performance in turbulence calculation.},

  abstract     = {In recent years operator networks have emerged as promising deep learning tools for approximating the solution to partial differential equations (PDEs). These networks map input functions that describe material properties, forcing functions, and boundary data to the solution of a PDE. This work describes a new architecture for operator networks, called the variationally mimetic operator network (VarMiON ), that mimics the form of the numerical solution obtained from an approximate variational or weak formulation of the problem. Like the conventional Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) the VarMiON is also composed of a sub-network that constructs the basis functions for the output and another that constructs the coefficients for these basis functions. However, in contrast to the DeepONet, the architecture of these sub-networks in the VarMiON is precisely determined. An analysis of the error in the VarMiON solution reveals that it contains contributions from the error in the training data, the training error, the quadrature error in sampling input and output functions, and a “covering error” that measures the distance between the test input functions and the nearest functions in the training dataset. It also depends on the stability constants for the exact solution operator and its VarMiON approximation. The application of the VarMiON to a canonical elliptic PDE and a nonlinear PDE reveals that for approximately the same number of network parameters, on average the VarMiON incurs smaller errors than a standard DeepONet and a recently proposed multiple-input operator network (MIONet). Further, its performance is more robust to variations in input functions, the techniques used to sample the input and output functions, the techniques used to construct the basis functions, and the number of input functions. Moreover, it consistently outperforms baseline methods at various dataset sizes. The data and code accompanying this manuscript are publicly available at https://github.com/dhruvpatel108/VarMiON .},

Herein, we shed light on the lesser-discussed aspects of their proposed model, referred to as the extended model . Firstly, we show how the extended model facilitates real-time tracking of specific interfacial area. Secondly, we compare numerical solutions of the extended model to that of the traditional multiphase flow model with capillary dispersion and the analytical Buckley–Leverett solution. Thirdly, we provide a sensitivity analysis for the additional unknown parameters of the extended model - specific interfacial permeability and specific interfacial area generation. Lastly, a stability analysis is performed for the numerical solutions. As an auxiliary outcome, we provide an approach to solve the non-linear partial differential equations of the extended model by using torch.autograd as the automatic differentiation engine of PyTorch . Our results demonstrate that the extended model can provide saturation profiles similar to those generated by traditional models, but with the added benefit of real-time tracking of specific interfacial area. The generated specific interfacial area profiles were comparable to expected trends from previous numerical and experimental studies and highlighted the importance of the capillary pressure relationship and specific interfacial area generation term. The results also demonstrate an important balance between the permeability of the porous media and the interfacial permeability that must be maintained; otherwise, generated profiles become physically unrealistic. Overall, the extended model explains the evolution of specific interfacial area during multiphase flow at the cost of additional non-linearity and unknown parameters.},

The coarse model of the network is expressed by a Galerkin formulation and can be used to perform simulations with different source and boundary data, at a low computational cost. We prove optimal convergence to the micro-scale solution of the proposed method under mild assumptions on the homogeneity, connectivity, and locality of the network on the coarse scale.

An immersed boundary technique is adopted to reconstruct the solution in the vicinity of the immersed surface and the time integration of the fluid-structure interaction problem is obtained by following an explicit procedure. The effectiveness of the framework is validated by means of several test cases involving: flows between two parallel plates for Reynolds numbers in the range 1 ÷ ÷ 100; capsules immersed in a fluid at Stokes regime exhibiting small and large deformations under shear; capsules migrating in a long straight microchannel with square cross-section at low-to-moderate Reynolds number. A very good agreement between the present results and literature data obtained using different numerical methods is found for all test cases. Finally, the method allowed to accurately simulate incompressible flows subjected to large pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet, characteristic of long curved microchannels, obtaining very smooth particle dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We discuss the software implementation of a finite element method, intended for the simulation of complex-geometry 3D flows, using hardware resources effectively, including problems with a priori unknown, heterogeneous, and dynamic parallel computational load. Our fundamental choices of data structures, algorithm, and software design specifically target engineering resolution and accuracy requirements. Some of these choices are: unstructured grids (to explicitly resolve complex 3D geometries), tetrahedra-only computational elements (to enable automatic mesh generation), edge-based finite element scheme (to reduce indirect addressing for increased performance), distributed-memory parallel computing paradigm (to enable large problems), and Charm++ ( https://charmplusplus.org ) as the runtime system (to effectively use computing resources even in the presence of hardware heterogeneities and dynamic application requirements). We discuss aspects of the implementation that enable exercising unique features of the runtime system, e.g., the single Charm++ programming abstraction, overdecomposition, asynchronous execution, latency-hiding parallel communication and computation, task-parallelism, and dynamic load balancing via object migratability. Multiple test problems are used to verify and validate the numerical solutions and computational performance and scalability to high-performance computing environments are discussed. For maximum transparency and reproducibility, and to encourage future research, development, and use, the full source code, together with regression tests and documentation, is publicly available at https://xyst.cc .},

This work proposes a predictive digital twin approach to the health monitoring, maintenance, and management planning of civil engineering structures. The asset-twin coupled dynamical system is encoded employing a probabilistic graphical model, which allows all relevant sources of uncertainty to be taken into account. In particular, the time-repeating observations-to-decisions flow is modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network. Real-time structural health diagnostics are provided by assimilating sensed data with deep learning models. The digital twin state is continually updated in a sequential Bayesian inference fashion. This is then exploited to inform the optimal planning of maintenance and management actions within a dynamic decision-making framework. A preliminary offline phase involves the population of training datasets through a reduced-order numerical model and the computation of a health-dependent control policy. The strategy is assessed on two synthetic case studies, involving a cantilever beam and a railway bridge, demonstrating the dynamic decision-making capabilities of health-aware digital twins.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a nonlocal multiscale damage model that considers the effect of a strain rate is presented. Moreover, this model is combined with the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) and quadtree mesh for dynamic crack propagation in quasi-brittle materials. The scaling centre of each SBFEM subdomain was selected as the material point, and the bond connecting two material points was referred to as the material bond. Microscopic damage was quantified based on the stretch rate of the material bond, and macroscale topological damage was calculated by taking the weighted average of the microscopic damage over the bonds within the influence domain. The bell distribution function is utilised as the weight function in the calculation of the nonlocal weight function. To account for the impact of the strain rate during dynamic loading, an effective rate R is introduced to enhance multiscale damage by modifying the damage threshold and bond softening coefficient throughout the analysis process. By analysing the energetic degradation function of the phase field, which establishes a connection between the macroscale topological damage and energy-based damage, a nonlocal multiscale damage model was incorporated into the framework of the SBFEM. Quadtree mesh discretization was employed to achieve rapid and high-quality multilevel mesh generation by effectively utilising the hanging nodes. Three typical dynamic cracking examples were simulated using the proposed model, and the results were compared with the relevant experimental results and references. The results show that the method is suitable for accurate dynamic cracking simulation in quasi-brittle materials. Moreover, the results indicate that the proposed method can spontaneously simulate dynamic crack bifurcation without introducing additional crack bifurcation criteria. For a compact tensile test of concrete under different loading rates, the method proposed in this study can accurately simulate the corresponding failure modes. The results also show that without considering the effect of the strain rate, the damage develops rapidly in an unconstrained state, which is inconsistent with the actual case.},

  abstract     = {We present two effective methods for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDE) based on randomized neural networks. Motivated by the universal approximation property of this type of networks, both methods extend the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach from low to high dimensions. With the first method the unknown solution field in d d dimensions is represented by a randomized feed-forward neural network, in which the hidden-layer parameters are randomly assigned and fixed while the output-layer parameters are trained. The PDE and the boundary/initial conditions, as well as the continuity conditions (for the local variant of the method), are enforced on a set of random interior/boundary collocation points. The resultant linear or nonlinear algebraic system, through its least squares solution, provides the trained values for the network parameters. With the second method the high-dimensional PDE problem is reformulated through a constrained expression based on an Approximate variant of the Theory of Functional Connections (A-TFC), which avoids the exponential growth in the number of terms of TFC as the dimension increases. The free field function in the A-TFC constrained expression is represented by a randomized neural network and is trained by a procedure analogous to the first method. We present ample numerical simulations for a number of high-dimensional linear/nonlinear stationary/dynamic PDEs to demonstrate their performance. These methods can produce accurate solutions to high-dimensional PDEs, in particular with their errors reaching levels not far from the machine accuracy for relatively lower dimensions. Compared with the physics-informed neural network (PINN) method, the current method is both cost-effective and more accurate for high-dimensional PDEs.},

A piecewise continuous time-step variation function is incorporated into the peridynamic framework that dynamically adjusts the time-step size, which ranges from a small value to a maximum value that remains below the critical stable time-step. The advantages of this variable timestep strategy are threefold: (1) The exceptional computational efficiency of this approach is mainly manifested in enabling peridynamic simulation that is 20 times faster compared to that employing a constant time step; (2) Taking advantage of the proposed method, both two- and three-dimensional peridynamic modeling of thermomechanical deformation and crack propagation has been demonstrated to be of great accuracy and robustness; (3) Facilitated with this variable timestep strategy, we achieve a remarkable advancement in peridynamics to capture intricate 3D crack patterns with complex topological structures in homogeneous specimens subjected to water quenching. Furthermore, the effects of the temperature difference, specimen geometrical configurations and the initial water entry velocity on the crack patterns of the specimens under water quenching are systematically explored.},

  abstract     = {Solving stochastic problems based on multimodal distributions with high accuracy and efficiency is the focus of current research in the stochastic field. However, since exact statistical results in practical engineering problems are unknown, how to efficiently obtain statistical results with high credibility is of great importance. Therefore, a high-credible statistical results calculation scheme is proposed in this paper. First, the multimodal model is transformed into a weighted sum form of multiple unimodal models by Gaussian mixture model . Then, a high-credible statistical results calculation scheme is designed based on the reusability of low-discrepancy sequences in the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method. The scheme calculates the coefficient of variation for the random response statistical results of the unimodal model across various sample ranges. When the coefficient of variation is less than the tolerance error, which indicates low fluctuation, the statistical results are deemed to have converged to the exact solution. In order to further accelerate the calculation efficiency of the proposed scheme, this paper proposes a least squares quasi-Monte Carlo (LSQMC) method to yield high accuracy statistical moments. Compared with the averageness weights in the QMC method, the non-averageness weights obtained by LSQMC method can more effectively reflect the numerical Characteristics of the random variables and the location distribution of the sampling points in the probability space. Finally, numerical examples have demonstrated that the high-credible statistical results calculation scheme based on the LSQMC method can obtain the high accuracy statistical moments with high efficiency in multimodal stochastic problems.},

  abstract     = {This work focuses on the representation of model-form uncertainties in phase-field models of brittle fracture. Such uncertainties can arise from the choice of the degradation function for instance, and their consideration has been unaddressed to date. The stochastic modeling framework leverages recent developments related to the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems and relies on the construction of a stochastic reduced-order model. In the latter, a POD-based reduced-order basis is randomized using Riemannian projection and retraction operators, as well as an information-theoretic formulation enabling proper concentration in the convex hull defined by a set of model proposals. The model thus obtained is mathematically admissible in the almost sure sense and involves a low-dimensional hyperparameter, the calibration of which is facilitated through the formulation of a quadratic programming problem. The relevance of the modeling approach is further assessed on one- and two-dimensional applications. It is shown that model uncertainties can be efficiently captured and propagated to macroscopic quantities of interest. An extension based on localized randomization is also proposed to handle the case where the forward simulation is highly sensitive to sample localization. This work constitutes a methodological development allowing phase-field predictions to be endowed with statistical measures of confidence, accounting for the variability induced by modeling choices.},

The method is a mesh-less/mesh-based chimera-type approach that utilises a coarse finite element mesh to discretise the problem geometry, while a separate set of overlapping nodes (patch nodes) moves with the heat source to capture the marked thermal gradients with higher accuracy using the Improved Element-Free Galerkin (IEFG) technique. Outside of the heat source area, where accuracy requirements are significantly lower, the thermal problem is solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The approach involves solving the problem over these two overlapping computational domains and transferring numerical information between the approximations performed on both. Such transfer of information occurs through immersed boundaries that are properly defined, enabling straightforward achievement of accurate results. The proposed Ov-IEFG-FEM is conceived to provide an enriched solution by appropriately coupling the temperature fields computed on the patch nodes and the coarse background mesh using IEFG and FEM, respectively. A comprehensive explanation concerning the appropriate coupling between the temperature fields of both the coarse background finite element mesh and the fine arrangement of moving patch nodes for the IEFG computations, is also provided in this communication. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method effectiveness in accurately and efficiently solving transient heat conduction problems with concentrated moving heat sources.},

  abstract     = {We model acoustic oscillations driven by velocity-coupled heat release rate fluctuations. We obtain an inhomogeneous wave equation and convert it to the frequency domain with a modal decomposition. We impose acoustic boundary conditions and, using a finite element discretization with Lagrange elements, express this as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the complex angular frequency, ω ω . We solve this using the open source platform FEniCS combined with the SLEPc, PETSc and OpenMPI libraries. In Hadamard form we write the derivative of the eigenvalue, ω ω , with respect to generic geometry changes. This requires the solution of the adjoint equation, which we obtain with the same method as the direct equation. The output is a thermoacoustic Helmholtz solver that cheaply calculates the effect of generic shape changes on the growth rate and frequency of thermoacoustic oscillations. We then consider symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking geometry modifications. For demonstration we model a 30kW laboratory-scale annular combustor (MICCA from EM2C). We parametrize the surfaces of the three-dimensional geometry with NURBS using control points. For the plenum and the combustion chamber, we find the eigenvalue shape derivatives with respect to the parameters of these control points. We apply two different strategies, perpendicular boundary movements and control point perturbations, to implement shape changes proportional to these shape derivatives, thereby reducing the growth rate of the unstable mode by increasing the phase shift between the pressure and the heat release rate oscillations. This computational method shows how to significantly alter thermoacoustic oscillations by making small geometry changes. The framework in this paper can handle arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries, which will be useful for the design of industrial combustion systems.},

  abstract     = {A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model is developed to extract material behavior from full-field displacement data. The PINN model consists of independent networks describing mechanical fields such as displacement, deformation gradient, stress, and strain energy density function. The displacement and deformation gradient networks learn from the deformation data of a specimen, while the stress and material networks predict the stress distribution within the specimen and learn the behavior of the target material, respectively. Each mechanical field should satisfy the physics laws of momentum balance, compatibility, constitutive relations, and boundary conditions. The constraints are wrapped up in the loss function, and the weights and biases of each hidden layer are determined by minimizing the loss function. This study introduces a two-stage learning strategy to deal with the minimization process, which is a multi-objective optimization problem. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified for linear elastic, power-law, and incompressible hyperelastic materials. The data-driven identification method successfully identifies the response of target materials in uniaxial tension, simple shear, and tension-shear-coupled loading cases. The robustness of the proposed method is verified on full-field data with noise and missing points. Data-driven identification can handle full-field data with missing points and maintain a reasonable accuracy level as the noise amplitude increases. Furthermore, data-driven identification results of an incompressible hyperelastic material are compared with conventional parametric identification results. The proposed method has advantages over the conventional method as it requires no predefined model. The results indicate that the data-driven identification method can be applied to new materials without a developed constitutive model or materials with manufacturing uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Subjected to external loadings, polymeric materials, e.g., biological tissues, hydrogels, and elastomers , may undergo extreme, nearly incompressible, (self-)contact deformations. For numerical modeling employing mesh-based techniques such as the finite element method (FEM), these deformations pose significant challenges due to large distortions in the deformed geometry, accuracy issues stemming from volumetric locking effects, and increased computational cost from complex contact searches. As an alternative to mesh-based methods, the material point method (MPM), a continuum-based particle technique, is gaining attention for its ability to handle extreme distortions and capture no-slip contact without added cost. For nearly incompressible material behaviors , while mixed formulations can address locking effects by treating displacements and pressure as independent fields, they can suffer from numerical instabilities close to the incompressibility limit due to the violation of the inf-sup condition, leading to inaccurate nodal pressure solutions. Here we propose an efficient and stable mixed B-spline material point method with highest achievable regularity for quasi-compressible polymeric materials. Using the two-scale relation of B-splines, we introduce a subdivision-stabilization for the two-field mixed MPM and obtain numerically stable, oscillation-free nodal solutions with equal-order interpolations with optimal regularity. Building on the Eulerian-Lagrangian nature of MPM, a previously-converged solution framework is adopted to mitigate issues related to cell-crossing and numerical fracture artifact present in standard MPM. We assess the stability and accuracy of the developed mixed MPM at large deformations for soft materials through the benchmark Cook’s membrane problem. Additionally, we test the robustness of the proposed MPM by modeling several examples, including the compression and indentation of a circular block into a quasi-compressible substrate and the twisting deformation of a rectangular block. The findings demonstrate the MPM’s capabilities for modeling practical soft material applications.},

To improve the understanding and ultimately find more effective treatments, researchers leverage computer simulations mimicking the tumor growth in silico . The challenge here is to account for the many phenomena influencing the disease progression and treatment protocols. This work introduces a computational model to simulate vascular tumor growth and the response to drug treatments in 3D. It consists of two agent-based models for the tumor cells and the vasculature. Moreover, partial differential equations govern the diffusive dynamics of the nutrients, the vascular endothelial growth factor, and two cancer drugs. The model focuses explicitly on breast cancer cells over-expressing HER2 receptors and a treatment combining standard chemotherapy (Doxorubicin) and monoclonal antibodies with anti-angiogenic properties (Trastuzumab). However, large parts of the model generalize to other scenarios. We show that the model qualitatively captures the effects of the combination therapy by comparing our simulation results with previously published pre-clinical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of the model and the associated C++ code by simulating a vascular tumor occupying a volume of 400 mm 3 using a total of 92.4 million agents.},

The advent of computational tools to simulate additive manufacturing has provided a robust way to predict part quality during the entire process. In this paper, a multiphysics model is introduced for the novel additive manufacturing technique of frontal polymerization-based direct ink writing, which enables rapid printing of complex free-form thermoset polymeric structures with excellent strength and stiffness. In direct ink writing, the fluid should possess suitable yield stress behavior to be successfully extruded and cured, and swelling of the fluid upon extrusion impacts the dimension of the printed filament. This model describes the thermo-chemo-rheological behavior of the printing gel during extrusion and polymerization, based on experimental measurements of the nonlinear viscoelastic and cure kinetics behavior. This model is applied to the FP-based printing process by considering an Eulerian domain that follows the motion of the printer head. Simulation results are presented for the vertical printing of both cylindrical filaments and annular tubes. The effect of process parameters on the dimensional accuracy of the printed part and the position of the polymerization front downstream from the printer head are investigated under steady and unsteady print speeds. Measurements from printing experiments validate the accuracy of the model.},

Our methodology centers around the inner product test (IPT), enabling precise and efficient interior/exterior determination for intersected Cartesian cells. For this purpose, we enhance the k-d tree based intersection determination process to provide essential information of surface mesh for IPT, while concurrently improving the efficiency of the determination process. Our new methods offer automatic generation capabilities for arbitrary complex geometries. Through a series of tests, the new methods illustrate the notable performance improvements with the generation time of less than 4 min for the Cartesian mesh with 10 8 cells.

  abstract     = {As a new approach for solving partial differential equations , physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have received extensive attention in recent years and have made breakthroughs in various fields. Serving as a neural network-based universal solver, they possess advantages such as high continuity and being meshless . However, an increasing number of studies have pointed out that PINNs may fail to converge to accurate results when dealing with complex tasks. In this paper, we highlight the differences between training PINNs and regular neural network tasks, summarizing three key characteristics of training PINNs. Based on these findings, we propose a strategy of task decomposition and progressive learning, which successfully explains the effectiveness of existing methods for time-dependent problems and reveals their limitations. For time-dependent and time-independent problems, we partition the tasks into physically complete and progressively challenging sub-tasks. The division is based on the resolution requirements for time-independent problems and the coverage of the time domain for time-dependent problems. Through task parameters and the decomposition of the loss terms, we adaptively control the progressive increase in task complexity during the training process. The proposed method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, incurs no additional computational cost, and is applicable to both time-dependent and time-independent problems, demonstrating higher generality. Furthermore, building upon the concepts of task decomposition and progressive learning, we introduce a stable and efficient minibatch training method for the first time.

The model is constructed by identifying a minimal number of parameters from the tomography and includes further assumptions about the textile properties ( e.g. , equally-spaced vertical yarn columns). A novel registration procedure called Model-based Digital Image Correlation (MDIC) is introduced for mapping the whole textile image onto its own model. It leads to a realignment of the yarn columns after deforming the textile image, from which the model is updated. Model extraction and registration steps are iterated up to a stationary solution . The final result is a perfect textile geometry with straight and orthogonal yarn columns and its mapping onto the original tomography image. The proposed procedure is applied successfully to a 3D woven textile and a 3D-injected woven composite. This novel technique is useful as a pre-processing step to image segmentation procedures or to ease the visual inspection performed by operators in correcting the yarn paths and yarn column deformations occurring during composite material manufacturing. Additionally, this alignment procedure could be used to deform a numerical ideal model to better fit the geometry of a real weave.},

  abstract     = {In the dynamic topology optimization of structures with single-phase material, isolated structures, often appear, resulting in the occurrence of local modes. Each isolated structure has three or six zero eigenvalues for 2D or 3D problems, but are meaningless and harmful to the topology optimization. Furthermore, these zero eigenvalues will cause extra unneeded huge computational cost, especially for large-scale problems. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for eliminating local modes caused by isolated structures. Firstly, the Nonlinear Virtual Temperature Method (N-VTM) is introduced to identify isolated structures. Subsequently, a new mass interpolation is developed to eliminate the local modes caused by the isolated structures. Since the developed method has an explicit and simple formulation, and the sensitivity of eigenfrequencies with respect to the design variables can be derived. Typical application examples, including vibrating structures and phononic crystals, are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively identify and eliminate isolated structures in the optimization process, avoiding local mode problems, and ensures stable convergence of the optimization iterations.},

Two unknowns are introduced for each of them, representing its amplitudes in two directions tangent to the shell surface. NURBS are used to approximate reference surface displacement and warping amplitudes in the weak form. The transverse shear strains are linear functions of the warping parameters only and naturally free from locking. A patch-wise reduced integration avoids membrane locking and improves efficiency. Particular attention is paid to the modeling of composites made up of multiple stiff layers coupled with soft interlayers. The alternating layup with high stiffness ratios induces a significant sectional warping with transverse shear strains concentrated in the soft layers. Two warping models are investigated: (WI) all stiff layers maintain the same director orthogonal to the deformed surface with independent transverse shear deformations of the soft layers; (WZ) a single zigzag function linking these deformations. The numerical tests confirm the great accuracy of the hierarchic shell model in reproducing the solid solution with a small number of discrete parameters, provided that the correct warping model is chosen. WI is reliable for all alternating layups. WZ reduces the unknowns to five per surface point, regardless of the number of layers, and is accurate for uniform soft layers.},

However, the challenges for full PCE lie in the “curse of dimensionality” of the expansion coefficients. In this paper, we propose a new sparse PCE approach by introducing active learning technique and sequence relevance vector machine (SRVM). As an active learning technique, efficient loss function based on expected improvement (EI-based ELF) is introduced to search for the best next sampling point and enrich the training samples. Relevance vector machine (RVM) is a superior machine learning technique due to the sparsity of its adopted model. SRVM leads to the maximization of marginal likelihood by sequentially selecting basis functions. To assess the performance of the proposed method, four examples are investigated, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the classical sparse PCE in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a computational approach to obtain nonlinearly elastic constitutive relations of strip/ribbon-like structures modeled as a special Cosserat rod. Starting with the description of strips as a general Cosserat plate, the strip is first subjected to a strain field which is uniform along its length. The Helical Cauchy–Born rule is used to impose this uniform strain field which deforms the strip into a six-parameter family of helical configurations — the six parameters here correspond to the six strain measures of rod theory. Two vector variables are introduced to model the position of the deformed centerline of the strip’s cross-section and to model orientation of thickness lines along the strip’s width. The minimization of the strip’s plate energy under the constraint of the aforementioned uniformity in strain field reduces the partial differential equations of plate theory from the entire mid-plane of the strip to just a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations along the strip’s width line for the above mentioned two vector variables. A nonlinear finite element formulation is further presented to solve this set of ordinary differential equations. This, in turn, yields the strip’s stored energy per unit length as well as the induced internal force, moment and stiffnesses of the strip for every prescribed set of six strain measures of rod theory. The proposed scheme is used to study uniform bending, twisting and shearing of a strip. For the case of uniform twisting and shearing, the strip is also seen to buckle along its width into a more complex configuration which are accurately captured by the presented scheme. We demonstrate that the presented scheme is more general and accurate than the existing schemes available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We propose a method for finding optimal quadrature/cubature rules with positive weights for parameterized functions in 1D, 2D or 3D spatial domains. The method takes as starting point the values of the functions at the Gauss points of a finite element (FE) mesh of the spatial domain for a representative sample of input parameters, and then construct an elementwise continuous orthogonal basis for such functions using the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) along with element polynomial fitting. To avoid possible memory bottlenecks in computing the SVD, we propose a Sequential Randomized SVD (SRSVD) in which the matrix is provided in a column-partitioned format, and which uses randomization to accelerate the processing of each individual block. After computing the basis functions, the method determines an exact integration rule for such functions, featuring as many points as functions, and in which the points are selected among the Gauss points of the FE mesh. Finally, the desired optimal rule is obtained by an sparsification process in which the algorithm zeroes one weight at a time while readjusting the positions and weights of the remaining points so that the constraints of the problem are satisfied. We apply this methodology to multivariate polynomials in cartesian domains to demonstrate that the method is indeed able to produce optimal rules – i.e., Gauss product rules –, and to a 2-parameters, 3D sinusoidal–exponential function to illustrate the use of the SRSVD in scenarios in which the standard SVD cannot handle the operation because of memory limitations. Lastly, the fact that the method does not require the analytical expression of the integrand functions – just their values at the FE Gauss points – makes it suitable for dealing with the so-called hyperreduction of parameterized finite element models. We exemplify this by showing its performance in the derivation of low-dimensional surrogate models in the context of the multiscale FE method. The Matlab source codes of both the CECM and the SRSVD, along with the scripts for launching the numerical tests, are openly accessible in the public repository https://github.com/Rbravo555/CECM-continuous-empirical-cubature-method .},

By utilising a continuous and periodic representation of the translation at each intermediate step, appropriate length-scale and thicknesses can be obtained. Numerical tests verifies the performance of the proposed methodology compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, and the dehomogenised designs achieve structural performance within a few percentages of the optimised homogenised solution.

Firstly, the mathematical description model for the topology of hierarchical structures and the interpolation model for material are established at both the macro and substructural levels. Then the concurrent topology optimization formulation for hierarchical structures is proposed based on EMsFEM. After that, the sensitivity analysis scheme of the objective function and constraint functions is given, based on which the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) is employed to update design variables. The assumption of separation of length scales is not required in the proposed method, which avoids the disconnection between adjacent substructures. Besides, without limiting the topology and spatial distribution of substructures in advance, the concurrent topology optimization for hierarchical structures with multiple substructures can be realized using this method. The provided numerical examples verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed sensitivity analysis method as well as the feasibility, effectiveness and scalability of the proposed concurrent topology optimization method for hierarchical structures.

The adaptive algorithm detects a subset of global nodes with trivial enrichments, which are exactly or close to linearly dependent from the underlying coarse FEM basis, at each time step, and then removes them from the global system. It is based on the calculation of the ratio between the largest and smallest singular values of small sub-matrices extracted from the global system of equations which introduces little overhead over the non-adaptive GFEM gl gl for transient PDEs. Compared to existing adaptive multiscale approaches, where either an a-posterior error estimate, a change in physical quantities, or a local problem residual is calculated, the proposed approach provides an innovative framework based on singular values. The proposed approach is shown to be robust for solving advection–diffusion problems that require detecting initial conditions with spikes and capturing moving/morphing/merging mass plumes in heterogeneous media and non-uniform flow with sharp fronts. Specific examples are provided for applications in groundwater contaminant and heat dissipation. The accuracy of the proposed adaptive GFEM gl gl closely matches reference fine-scale FEM solutions in the L ∞ L∞ norm.},

The approach adopted incorporates principal invariants as inputs for the surrogate of the strain energy density. This integration enables the surrogate to inherently enforce fundamental physical constraints, such as material frame indifference and material symmetry, right from the outset. The proposed approach provides accurate interpolation for energy and the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor (e.g. first order derivatives with respect to inputs). The paper presents three notable innovations. Firstly , it introduces the utilisation of Gradient-Enhanced Kriging to approximate a diverse range of phenomenological models, encompassing numerous isotropic hyperelastic strain energies and a transversely isotropic potential. Secondly , this study marks the inaugural application of this technique for approximating the effective response of composite materials. This includes rank-one laminates, for which analytical solutions are feasible. However, it also encompasses more complex composite materials characterised by a Representative Volume Element (RVE) comprising an elastomeric matrix with a centred spherical inclusion. This extension opens the door for future application of this technique to various RVE types, facilitating efficient three-dimensional computational analyses at the macro-scale of such composite materials, significantly reducing computational time compared to FEM 2 2 . The third innovation , facilitated by the integration of these surrogate models into a 3D Finite Element computational framework, lies in the assessment of these models scenarios encompassing intricate cases of extreme twisting and more importantly, buckling instabilities in thin-walled structures, thereby highlighting both the practical applicability and robustness of the proposed approach.},

While WNO has proven to be a promising method for operator learning, the data-hungry nature of the framework is a major shortcoming. Relying completely on conventional solvers for data generation and subsequently training operators with generated data leads to a time-consuming and challenging implementation of the operators in practical applications. In this work, we propose a physics-informed WNO for learning the solution operators of families of parametric PDEs without labeled training data.

Most widespread within the vast family of Runge–Kutta methods are the diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (DIRK) methods. In particular, the new low-order explicit last-stage diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta (ELDIRK) methods are investigated, combining implicit schemes with an additional explicit evaluation as an explicit last stage. This results in Butcher tableaus with two solutions of different convergence orders suitable for embedded methods, where the higher-order solution is achieved by additional explicit evaluations. Thus, the iterative solution of non-linear systems is omitted for the additional stage, presenting a major reduction in computational cost for the determination of a local error estimate. The key contribution is the application of the novel Butcher tableaus to phase-field problems, solved with the finite-element method, leading to substantial numerical investigations with an efficient approach for diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta schemes. The most important aspects are the extension towards fourth-order methods, the study of the convergence orders for the ELDIRK schemes, their respective stability regions and computational efficiency. A local error estimator is presented capturing the evolution of the phase-field problems, such that adaptive step size control for the new low-order embedded schemes based on an empirical approach for error estimation is achieved. A suitable parallel algorithm is presented with conclusive two-dimensional phase-field simulations based on a Kobayashi–Warren–Carter model including benchmarks for computational efficiency. The higher-order convergence suggested by the novel schemes is confirmed, and their effective results are demonstrated, resulting in a valuable semi-explicit addition to the family of Runge–Kutta time integration schemes.},

  abstract     = {Kriging is a powerful surrogate modeling method for the analysis and optimization of computationally expensive problems. However, the efficient construction of high-precision models for high-dimensional expensive problems is an important challenge for Kriging method and has received much attention recently. To address this challenge, we propose an improved sufficient dimension reduction-based Kriging modeling method (KISDR) for high-dimensional evaluation-expensive problems. First, the martingale difference divergence is introduced into the sufficient dimension reduction to obtain a more accurate and stable estimate of the projection matrix , which can project the high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional latent space while maintaining sufficient information for response prediction. Second, we propose to utilize the ladle estimator to identify the dimension of latent space. The ladle estimator combines both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix and can identify the latent dimensionality more precisely. After that, a new Kriging correlation function is constructed by integrating the information of dimension reduction into the correlation structure, which significantly reduces the number of hyperparameters to be estimated. Finally, we devise a local optimization approach to fine-tune the Kriging hyperparameters to further improve the modeling accuracy. In this study, six mathematical examples and three engineering examples with dimensions varying from 30-D to 100-D are employed for performance analysis and comparison.

  abstract     = {A two-phase one-layer stabilised node-based strain-smoothing Particle Finite Element Method (SNS-PFEM) was previously proposed, but it lacked the capability to simulate water-soil coupling. To address this limitation, this study presents an improved approach called the two-phase two-layer SNS-PFEM, specifically designed to handle such problems. In this method, two overlapping mesh layers are employed to independently represent the two phases. Within this framework, the water phase is characterised as an incompressible Newtonian fluid solved using the PFEM-T3 method, while the soil phase is described using an elastoplastic constitutive model, effectively addressed through a modified SNS-PFEM. To obtain the solution for the proposed two-phase two-layer approach, a fractional step algorithm is utilised, allowing efficient and accurate computations. To validate the proposed method, it is applied to various soil-water coupling problems, encompassing both quasi-static and large deformation scenarios. The first set of simulations are (1) simulation of 1D Terzaghi&#39;s consolidation test and (2) simulation of fully submerged soil subjected to gravitational load. Next, the proposed method is applied to simulate cases involving large deformation problems: (1) flow passing through a porous dam, (2) a submerged granular landslide and its induced waves and (3) a submarine progressive landslide. The results of all simulations demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the proposed method in effectively analysing large deformation multi-phase problems in the field of geotechnical engineering. This advancement is a significant step forward in accurately simulating complex interactions between water and soil, opening up new possibilities for research and analysis in geotechnical applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an efficient formulation for the topology optimization of extruded beams is developed considering linearized buckling, displacement, and stress constraints. The proposed method relies on a computationally efficient extended\generalized finite element (XFEM\GFEM) formulation for the forward problem , recently developed for the analysis of beams. In this method, a coarse 3D finite element (FE) mesh is enhanced with global enrichment functions, enabling a substantial reduction in the number of degrees of freedom with comparable accuracy to a traditional 3D FE fine mesh. The material distribution at the cross-section is optimized utilizing the material density approach with the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method. Our objective is to minimize the total weight of the beam, subject to performance constraints including buckling, displacement, and stress. The forward problem enables the application of general loading and boundary conditions. Thus, both buckling and lateral–torsional buckling are automatically considered. The optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based optimization approach, with analytical gradients derived by using the adjoint variable method. Several numerical examples are presented to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed formulation. A parametric study showed that the optimized cross-section is strongly dependent on the length and permissible buckling load. In addition, it is shown that a simultaneous formulation leads to significantly different designs, with different structural behavior , compared to results obtained by considering only a subset of the performance constraints. Finally, we verify the model on a beam warping problem under pure torsion , in which the cross-section optimization converges to a known analytical solution. Compared with traditional FEM, two orders of magnitude in terms of execution time are reported in favor of the proposed XFEM\GFEM approach.},

Based on the unified phase field theory, the model introduces a linear viscoelastic constitutive relation in effective stress space to consider the macro-viscosity of the bulk material. Additionally, the micro-force balance concept is utilized with the micro-viscosity to derive a parabolic phase field evolution law that accurately describes the dynamic micro-crack development. Explicit numerical solution schemes are established for the governing equations by developing VUEL and VUMAT subroutines in ABAQUS. This eliminates the convergence issue in implicit phase field modelling. Four typical benchmarks are investigated to validate the proposed model for macroscale and mesoscale heterogeneous problems. It is found that the proposed model can well capture the crack branching, delaying characteristic of micro-crack growth, and increase of macroscopic strength under higher strain rates. Using real meso‑structures from CT images, the complicated dynamic behaviour of concrete is investigated which yields deeper insight into stress wave propagation, crack evolution and load-carrying capacities.},

The resulting method, termed stochastic domain decomposition based on variable-separation (SDD-VS) alleviates the challenge commonly known as the “curse of dimensionality” notably by leveraging explicit representations of stochastic functions derived from physical systems. The primary objective of the proposed SDD-VS method is to obtain a separate representation of the solution for the stochastic interface problem. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a two-phase approach consisting of offline and online computation. In the offline phase, we establish an affine representation of stochastic algebraic systems by systematically applying the VS method. During the online phase, we estimate the interface unknowns of SPDEs using a quasi-optimal separated representation, facilitating the construction of efficient surrogate models for subproblems. We substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through numerical experiments involving three specific instances, demonstrating its capability to provide accurate solutions.},

  abstract     = {Numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be challenging and computationally expensive. This has led to the development of reduced-order models (ROMs) that are accurate but faster than full order models (FOMs). Recently, machine learning advances have enabled the creation of non-linear projection methods, such as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI). LaSDI maps full-order PDE solutions to a latent space using autoencoders and learns the system of ODEs governing the latent space dynamics. By interpolating and solving the ODE system in the reduced latent space, fast and accurate ROM predictions can be made by feeding the predicted latent space dynamics into the decoder. In this paper, we introduce GPLaSDI , a novel LaSDI-based framework that relies on Gaussian process (GP) for latent space ODE interpolations. Using GPs offers two significant advantages. First, it enables the quantification of uncertainty over the ROM predictions. Second, leveraging this prediction uncertainty allows for efficient adaptive training through a greedy selection of additional training data points . This approach does not require prior knowledge of the underlying PDEs. Consequently, GPLaSDI is inherently non-intrusive and can be applied to problems without a known PDE or its residual. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Burgers equation , Vlasov equation for plasma physics, and a rising thermal bubble problem. Our proposed method achieves between 200 and 100,000 times speed-up, with up to 7% relative error .},

  abstract     = {Constitutive modeling is the cornerstone of computational and structural mechanics. In a finite element analysis, the constitutive model is encoded in the material subroutine, a function that maps local strains onto stresses. This function is called within every finite element , at each integration point, within every time step, at each Newton iteration . Today’s finite element packages offer large libraries of material models to choose from. However, the scientific criteria for appropriate model selection remain highly subjective and prone to user bias. Here we fully automate the process of model selection, autonomously discover the best model and parameters from experimental data , encode all possible discoverable models into a single material subroutine, and seamlessly integrate this universal material subroutine into a finite element analysis . We prototype this strategy for incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic soft matter systems that we characterize through a combination of twelve possible terms. These terms feature the first and second invariants, raised to the first and second powers, embedded in the identity, exponential, and logarithmic functions , generating 2 2 × 2 × 3 = 2×2×3= 4096 models in total. We demonstrate how to integrate these models into a single universal material subroutine that features the classical neo Hooke, Blatz Ko, Mooney Rivlin, Demiray, Gent, and Holzapfel models as special cases. Finite element simulations with our new universal material subroutine show that it specializes well to these widely used models, generalizes well to newly discovered models, and agrees excellently with both experimental data and previous simulations. It also performs well within realistic finite element simulations and accurately predicts stress concentrations in the human brain for six different head impact scenarios. We anticipate that integrating automated model discovery into a universal material subroutine will generalize naturally to more complex compressible, anisotropic , inelastic materials and to other nonlinear finite element platforms. Replacing dozens of individual material subroutines by a single universal material subroutine that is populated directly via automated model discovery – entirely without human interaction – makes finite element analyses more accessible, more robust, and less vulnerable to human error. This could forever change how we simulate materials and structures. Our source code , data, and examples are available at https://github.com/LivingMatterLab .},

All formulations are based on the unified S E ( 3 ) SE(3) framework, whose prominent advantage lies in its frame invariance property. For solid body, the geometry surface can be implicitly described by a moving SDF. Consequently, the interaction between beams and rigid solids can be viewed as immersion in a field-described force. The contact force is formulated using SDF interpolation, and exact tangent matrices are provided to facilitate implicit iteration. Notably, this approach eliminates the need for contact detection during simulation, because the SDF database is constructed before the simulation. To enhance the spatial adaptivity of the SDF algorithm, we introduce an octree refinement strategy. Besides, we incorporate the concept of contact potential volume into the subdivided stopping criterion. Compared to the uniform SDF, this approach demonstrates higher generation speed and smaller errors. Several examples are used to verify the accuracy, convergence and efficiency of the proposed formulation. It is observed that the invariance property of S E ( 3 ) SE(3) description leads to enhanced computational performance. Both frame invariance and SDF-based approach are expected to improve efficiency for large-scale problems. The presented method is easily applicable to other types of flexible bodies.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in topology optimization of functionally graded microstructures, characterized by an array of microstructures with varying volume fractions. However, microstructures optimized at slightly different volume fractions do not necessarily connect well when placed adjacently. Furthermore, optimization is commonly performed on a finite set of volume fractions, limiting the number of microstructure configurations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of differentiable microstructures , which are parameterized microstructures that exhibit continuous variations in both geometry and mechanical properties. To construct such microstructures, we propose a novel formulation for topology optimization. In this approach, a series of 2-dimensional microstructures is represented using a height field, and the objective is to maximize the bulk modulus of the entire series. Through this optimization process, an initial microstructure with a small volume fraction undergoes non-uniform transformations, generating a series of microstructures with progressively increasing volume fractions. Notably, when compared to traditional uniform morphing methods, our proposed optimization approach yields a series of microstructures with bulk moduli that closely approach the theoretical limit.},

  abstract     = {Homogenized models are widely used in multiscale analysis for their computational efficiency, but they often fail to provide sufficient accuracy in regions exhibiting high variations in the solution fields. One way to address this limitation is to adaptively couple the homogeneous model with a full field, heterogeneous one in designated zones of interest. Within the framework of finite-element based higher-order asymptotic homogenization, this work introduces a modeling error estimator in order to detect regions where refining the material model is necessary. We also analyze the competition between discretization and modeling errors. We finally propose a multiscale enhancement of the classical displacement-based submodeling technique in order to adequately couple the homogeneous and heterogeneous domains. The promise of the proposed methods and the overall associated strategy is illustrated on various numerical examples of elastic fiber–matrix composites.},

  abstract     = {The usage of numerical homogenization to obtain structure–property relations by applying the finite element method at both the micro- and macroscale has gained much interest in the research community. The computational cost of this so-called FE 2 method, however, is typically so high that algorithmic modifications and reduction methods are essential. In the present contribution, a monolithic solution algorithm is combined with reduced order modeling (ROM) and the empirical cubature method (ECM) for hyper integration. It is further complemented by a clustered training strategy, which lowers the training effort and the number of necessary ROM modes immensely. The applied methods can be combined modularly as desired in finite element approaches. An implementation in terms of an extension to the previously established MonolithFE 2 code is provided. Numerical examples show the efficiency and accuracy of the monolithic hyper ROM FE 2 method and the advantages of the clustered training strategy. Even for two-scale problems with complex geometry and complex, inelastic material behaviors it was shown that speedup factors of almost 1000 (i.e., three orders of magnitude) regarding the online simulation time and of up to 30 regarding all necessary computing effort are obtainable in comparison to the conventional FE 2 scheme. The training stage requires only around 3% of that time, meaning that the offline phase is relatively inexpensive, in contrast to many Neural Network approaches , whose employment, in terms of total computational efficiency, only pays off if a large number of online simulations is to be conducted, without requiring additional training.},

This study shows how state-of-the-art semi-empirical models can be endowed with additional defect descriptors to probabilistically predict the occurrence of fatigue failures by exploiting advanced Bayesian Physics-guided Neural Network (B-PGNN) approaches. A B-PGNN is thereby developed to predict the fatigue failure probability of a sample containing defects, referred to a given fatigue endurance limit . In this framework, a robustly calibrated El Haddad’s curve is exploited as the prior physics reinforcement of the probabilistic model, i.e., prior knowledge. Following, a likelihood function is built and the B-PGNN is trained via Bayesian Inference , thus calculating the posterior of the parameters. The arbitrariness of the choice of the related architecture is circumvented through a Bayesian model selection strategy. A case-study is analysed to prove the robustness of the proposed approach. This methodology proposes an advanced practical approach to help support the probabilistic design against fatigue failure.},

However, the effect of anisotropic yield strength of these AM-fabricated parts on topology optimization of multi-material structures has so far received little attention. In the current work, an anisotropic strength-based topology optimization method for multi-material structures is developed for maximizing strength performance under total mass constraint, which allows for the consideration of directional dependence and tension-compression asymmetry of yield strengths based on the Tsai-Wu yield criterion. Another challenge for multi-material structures design is that the possible permutations of numerous candidate materials are unlimited, it is impossible that all combinations of multiple candidate materials are tested for the optimal strength performance of multi-material structures. To solve this problem, we propose a preselection method for the inclusion or exclusion of candidate materials based on their elastic properties, yield strengths and densities before optimization. Afterwards, our topology optimization method can automatically find the optimal combination of volume fractions of different candidate materials. Several 2D and 3D numerical examples are investigated for minimizing the maximum of failure indexes of strength for fixed total mass. The advantages of multi-material structures are verified by comparing to single-material designs. The effectiveness of the preselection method of candidate materials is also verified.},

Iterative methods, such as genetic algorithms and response surface models, have a high computational burden for these problems.

The enhanced method, refined Efficient Global Optimisation or rEGO, exploits a two-step refinement and selection technique to expand the global search capability of the original method to a global–local, or hybrid, search capability. rEGO is tested and validated on four optimisation test functions against the original methods and genetic algorithms with different settings. Good results in terms of precision and computational performance are achieved, so an application for model updating is sought. A penalty function for the finite element model updating is identified in residuals of the modified total modal assurance criterion. Finally, rEGO for finite element model updating is implemented on a hybrid, numerical and experimental, case study based on a well-known experimental dataset and on a higher dimension finite element model of a wing spar. Satisfactory results in terms of precision and computational performance are achieved when compared to the original methods and genetic algorithms, needing two orders of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieving comparable results in terms of precision.},

Such convolution integral equations take an algebraic form in the reciprocal Fourier space that can be solved iteratively. In this vein, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is leveraged to accelerate the numerical solution, resulting in a mesh-free formulation in which the periodic unit cell representing the heterogeneous material can be discretized by a regular grid of pixels in two dimensions (or voxels in three dimensions). For verification, the numerical solutions obtained with the micropolar FFT solver are compared with analytical solutions for a matrix with a dilute circular inclusion subjected to plane strain loading. The developed computational framework is then used to study length-scale effects and effective (micropolar) moduli of composites with various topological configurations.},

To recover the flux, we derive a formulation directly from the boundary-value problem’s finite element formulation. Since the boundary may not align with the mesh, we compute the approximate flux using piecewise linear polynomials on cut elements. We then deduce the desired flux as the trace of the solution on the boundary. To ensure that the condition number of the resulting system matrix is independent of the boundary’s position on the mesh, we add a ghost penalty term. This term acts on the jumps of the gradients over interior facets belonging to elements intersected by the boundary. Two and three-dimensional numerical examples are provided, and show that the method is accurate and has optimal convergence regardless of the immersed boundary position.},

A constrained optimization problem is formulated with reduced order objective functions and un-reduced constraints to solve for the separation. To make the optimization process more feasible, an integrated form of the constraint is introduced, enabling the use of only one constraint regardless of the crack morphology. The model is verified against direct numerical simulations (DNS) with crystal plasticity as the constitutive relation. The use of priori knowledge in building crack separation field basis functions as well as sampling strategies in the absence of prior knowledge are discussed.

  abstract     = {In the context of adaptive remeshing , the virtual element method provides significant advantages over the finite element method . The attractive features of the virtual element method, such as the permission of arbitrary element geometries, and the seamless permission of ‘hanging’ nodes, have inspired many works concerning error estimation and adaptivity. However, these works have primarily focused on adaptive refinement techniques with little attention paid to adaptive coarsening (i.e. de-refinement) techniques that are required for the development of fully adaptive remeshing procedures. In this work novel indicators are proposed for the identification of patches/clusters of elements to be coarsened, along with a novel procedure to perform the coarsening. The indicators are computed over prospective patches of elements rather than on individual elements to identify the most suitable combinations of elements to coarsen. The coarsening procedure is robust and suitable for meshes of structured and unstructured/Voronoi elements. Numerical results demonstrate the high degree of efficacy of the proposed coarsening procedures and sensible mesh evolution during the coarsening process. It is demonstrated that critical mesh geometries, such as non-convex corners and holes, are preserved during coarsening, and that meshes remain fine in regions of interest to engineers, such as near singularities .},

To reduce such expenses, model training methods based on simulation data is a suitable approach, for instance, model order reduction using proper orthogonal decomposition. However, such approaches require extensive offline training and a complete replacement of full-order modelling will hinder damage evolution that requires accurate modelling of local stress states. To overcome these problems, this works presents an adaptive reduced-order modelling framework without the need for offline training whilst having the ability to vary the level of approximations within a solution. This is achieved by adaptively calculating the reduced-bases and the hyper-reduction parameters after solving the full-order model for a few increments. Domain decomposition is enabled to separate damage modelling from reduced-order modelling and a computationally efficient method for history recovery is presented. To model the non-linearities, the reduced-order modelling parameters are updated as the solution progresses. The reduced-order modelling approximation switches to full-order modelling at regular intervals to achieve the linear momentum balance between the spatially same but dimensionally different domains. The performance of the developed method is demonstrated using benchmark composites damage modelling examples. In these examples, strong discontinuities are modelled using adaptively initiated cohesive segments and the overall framework requires minimal user intervention.},

Compared to standard electromagnet shape optimization, our method has the advantage that the nonlinearity in the Biot–Savart law with respect to position is avoided, enabling convex cost functions and a useful reformulation of topology optimization as sparse regression. To demonstrate, we consider the application of designing electromagnetic coils for a class of plasma experiments known as stellarators . We produce topologically-exotic coils for several new stellarator designs and show that these solutions can be interpolated into a filamentary representation and then further optimized.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of the second-order-type time integration methods family encompassing the linear multistep (LMS) methods, the single-step methods, and the LMS equivalent single-step methods for structural dynamics. An analytical accuracy framework for algorithm design, convergence, and optimization is developed, where the obstacles encountered in algorithms construction, convergence accuracy, algorithms equivalence, accuracy measurement, and accuracy optimization in traditional accuracy frameworks are well addressed. Rigorous accuracy analysis successively to the second-order-type LMS (LMS2) methods, the single-step methods, and the LMS2 equivalent single-step methods aims to reveal optimal algorithms with desirable numerical properties. First, independent implicit algorithms including the velocity type and the acceleration type LMS2 methods except the displacement type ones are newly revealed in the LMS2 methods family with second-order convergence and A-stability, and three error constants that can play essential roles in the accuracy measurement and algorithm optimization are developed. Second, a single-step methods family where the displacement, velocity, and acceleration can achieve the same order of accuracy simultaneously is revealed in a generalized 16-parameters methods family, which contains numerous conventional single-step single-solve methods as subfamily methods. It is found that the unit consistent and non-consistent representations show a significant difference in the local truncation error, stability, and convergence performances. Third, a family of accuracy-improved single-step methods with algorithmic equivalence, which is stricter than the traditional spectral equivalence, to the LMS2 methods is revealed. It is clarified that the difference between the methods with equivalence can significantly influence their convergence accuracy, and the error constants concept of the LMS2 methods can be extended to the single-step method with algorithmic equivalence. Last, an algorithm optimization strategy is developed based on the error constants and the ultimate spectral radius, and an optimal single-step method with a single parameter to control the accuracy and numerical dissipation is revealed analytically without empirical assumptions. The optimal method is second-order accurate, unconditionally stable, overshooting acceptable, and equivalent to an optimal route between the Houbolt method and the trapezoidal rule, and its numerical performance is verified by the spectral accuracy and two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Because of physical assumptions and numerical approximations, low-order models are affected by uncertainties in the state and parameters, and by model biases. Model biases, also known as model errors or systematic errors, are difficult to infer because they are ‘unknown unknowns’, i.e., we do not necessarily know their functional form a priori . With biased models, data assimilation methods may be ill-posed because either (i) they are ‘bias-unaware’ because the estimators are assumed unbiased, (ii) they rely on an a priori parametric model for the bias, or (iii) they can infer model biases that are not unique for the same model and data. First, we design a data assimilation framework to perform combined state, parameter, and bias estimation. Second, we propose a mathematical solution with a sequential method, i.e., the regularized bias-aware ensemble Kalman Filter (r-EnKF), which requires a model of the bias and its gradient (i.e., the Jacobian). Third, we propose an echo state network as the model bias estimator. We derive the Jacobian of the network, and design a robust training strategy with data augmentation to accurately infer the bias in different scenarios. Fourth, we apply the r-EnKF to nonlinearly coupled oscillators (with and without time-delay) affected by different forms of bias. The r-EnKF infers in real-time parameters and states, and a unique bias. The applications that we showcase are relevant to acoustics, thermoacoustics, and vibrations; however, the r-EnKF opens new opportunities for combined state, parameter and bias estimation for real-time and on-the-fly prediction in nonlinear systems.},

  abstract     = {Strong-form meshless methods received much attention in recent years and are being extensively researched and applied to a wide range of problems in science and engineering. However, the solution of elasto-plastic problems has proven to be elusive because of often non-smooth constitutive relations between stress and strain. The novelty in tackling them is the introduction of virtual finite difference stencils to formulate a hybrid radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method, which is used to solve small-strain von Mises elasto-plasticity for the first time by this original approach. The paper further contrasts the new method to two alternative legacy RBF-FD approaches, which fail when applied to this class of problems. The three approaches differ in the discretization of the divergence operator found in the balance equation that acts on the non-smooth stress field. Additionally, an innovative stabilization technique is employed to stabilize boundary conditions and is shown to be essential for any of the approaches to converge successfully. Approaches are assessed on elastic and elasto-plastic benchmarks where admissible ranges of newly introduced free parameters are studied regarding stability, accuracy, and convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {We introduce Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) to learn finite dimensional input–output maps encoding complex physical processes. A BLNM is defined by a simple and compact feedforward partially-connected neural network that structurally disentangles inputs with different intrinsic roles, such as the time variable from model parameters of a differential equation, while transferring them into a generic field of interest. BLNMs leverage latent outputs to enhance the learned dynamics and break the curse of dimensionality by showing excellent in-distribution generalization properties with small training datasets and short training times on a single processor. Indeed, their in-distribution generalization error remains comparable regardless of the adopted discretization during the testing phase. Moreover, the partial connections, in place of a fully-connected structure, significantly reduce the number of tunable parameters. We show the capabilities of BLNMs in a challenging test case involving biophysically detailed electrophysiology simulations in a biventricular cardiac model of a pediatric patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The model includes a 1D Purkinje network for fast conduction and a 3D heart-torso geometry. Specifically, we trained BLNMs on 150 in silico generated 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) while spanning 7 model parameters, covering cell-scale, organ-level and electrical dyssynchrony. Although the 12-lead ECGs manifest very fast dynamics with sharp gradients, after automatic hyperparameter tuning the optimal BLNM, trained in less than 3 h on a single CPU, retains just 7 hidden layers and 19 neurons per layer. The resulting mean square error is on the order of 1 0 − 4 10−4 on an independent test dataset comprised of 50 additional electrophysiology simulations. In the online phase, the BLNM allows for 5000x faster real-time simulations of cardiac electrophysiology on a single core standard computer and can be employed to solve inverse problems via global optimization in a few seconds of computational time. This paper provides a novel computational tool to build reliable and efficient reduced-order models for digital twinning in engineering applications.

  abstract     = {We consider a high-dimensional nonlinear computational model of a dynamical system, parameterized by a vector-valued control parameter, in the presence of uncertainties represented by an uncontrolled parameter modeled by a vector-valued random variable, and possibly with stochastic excitation. The objective is to construct a statistical surrogate model where the input is any deterministic value of the control parameter, and the output is a vector-valued observation of the computational model, which is a random vector whose probability measure is updated using a target dataset. To construct this statistical surrogate model, the stochastic response of the computational model must be built, which is a vector-valued time-discretized stochastic process in high dimension, depending on the control parameter. It is assumed that the computational cost of a single evaluation of the deterministic model is high. For the probabilistic updating, we consider a subset of the components of the observation of the computational model, defined as the “identification observation” of the computational model, for which a small target dataset is available. Therefore, the target dataset is associated with partial observability, corresponding to an incomplete data case. Given a prior probability model of the random control and uncontrolled parameters, a training dataset is constructed, consisting of realizations of the random triplet composed of the stochastic response, the random identification observation, and the random control parameter. Since the computational cost of a single evaluation of the deterministic model is assumed to be large, the training dataset is also of small size. The main challenges in this problem are the high dimensionality, partial observability leading to incomplete data in the target dataset for the identification observation of the computational model (which is not sufficient to identify the computational stochastic responses), and the availability of a small training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose a methodology based on statistical methods for constructing necessary reduced representations, direct probabilistic learning under constraints using probabilistic learning on manifolds (PLoM) constrained by the target dataset, and the use of a weak formulation of the Fourier transform of probability measures. Statistical conditioning is also employed to explore the learned dataset. The constructed predictive statistical surrogate model can be implemented in the context of online computation. We apply this approach to a problem of nonlinear stochastic dynamics in high dimensions within the framework of deformable solids mechanics.},

While these frameworks have been developed extensively and applied successfully to numerous contact problems, they generally require complex algorithms for contact detection and resolution. These challenges become particularly important when contact appears between solids with evolving boundaries, such as in systems where crystals grow in a constrained space. In this work, we introduce a fully Eulerian finite element framework for modeling contact between elastic solids tailored towards problems including evolving and intricate surfaces. The proposed approach uses a phase-field method that involves a diffuse representation of geometries on a fixed mesh, simplifying the modeling of evolving surfaces. Our methodology introduces a novel volumetric contact constraint based on penalty body forces , efficiently resolving the interpenetration of solids. We showcase the validity and versatility of our method through numerical examples , highlighting its ability to accurately capture complex solid–solid interactions. The Eulerian phase-field formulation greatly simplifies contact detection and its resolution. Furthermore, the framework can be straightforwardly coupled with other physical phenomena through the inclusion of multiple energy terms in the evolution of the phase-field. This enables multiphysics modeling, potentially providing a valuable tool for a wide range of applications involving chemically or physically evolving deformable solids in contact, as they commonly occur in deterioration processes of porous media.},

Within the partitioned approach, we adopt separate field solvers to compute the dynamics of the immersed structures and the evolution of the flow field over time, considering finite Reynolds numbers . We employ a geometrically exact, nonlinear Cosserat rod formulation in the context of the isogeometric analysis (IGA) technique to model the elastic responses of each rod in three dimensions (3D). The Navier–Stokes equations are resolved using a pressure projection method on a standard staggered Cartesian grid . The direct-forcing immersed boundary method is utilized for coupling the IGA-based structural solver with the finite-difference fluid solver. In order to fully exploit the accuracy of the IGA technique for FSI simulations, the proposed framework introduces a new procedure that decouples the resolution of the structural domain from the fluid grid. Uniformly distributed Lagrangian markers with density relative to the Eulerian grid are generated to communicate between Lagrangian and Eulerian grids consistently with IGA. We successfully validate the proposed computational framework against two- and three-dimensional FSI benchmarks involving flexible filaments undergoing large deflections/motions in an incompressible flow . We show that six times coarser structural mesh than the flow Eulerian grid delivers accurate results for classic benchmarks, leading to a major gain in computational efficiency. The simultaneous spatial and temporal convergence studies demonstrate the consistent performance of the proposed framework, showing that it conserves the order of the convergence, which is the same as that of the fluid solver.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a special type of Finite Element (FE) technology – the Empirical Interscale FE method – for modeling heterogeneous structures in the small strain regime, for both dynamic and static analyses. The method combines a domain decomposition framework, where interface conditions are established through “fictitious” frames, with dimensional hyperreduction at subdomain level. Similar to other multiscale FE methods, the structure is assumed to be partitioned into coarse-scale elements, each of these elements is equipped with a fine-scale subgrid, and the displacements of the boundaries of the coarse-scale elements are described by standard polynomial FE shape functions . The distinguishing feature of the proposed method is the employed “interscale” variational formulation , which directly relates coarse-scale nodal internal forces with fine-scale stresses, thereby avoiding the typical nested local/global problems that appear, in the nonlinear regime, in other multiscale methods. This distinctive feature, along with hyperreduction schemes for nodal internal and external body forces , greatly facilitate the implementation of the proposed formulation in existing FE codes for solid elements. Indeed, one only has to change the location and weights of the integration points, and to replace a few polynomial-based FE matrices with “empirical” operators, i.e., derived from the information obtained in appropriately chosen computational experiments. We demonstrate that the elements resulting from this formulation are not afflicted by volumetric locking when dealing with nearly-incompressible materials, and that they can handle non-matching fine-scale grids as well as curved structures. Last but not least, we show that, for periodic structures, this method converges upon mesh refinement to the solution delivered by classical first-order computational homogenization . Thus, although the method does not presuppose scale separation, it can represent solutions in this limiting case by taking sufficiently small coarse-scale elements.},

  abstract     = {The inverse homogenization method can tailor some mechanical and physical effective properties by laying out materials in a periodic representative volume element. However, studies on strength design are yet to be developed because of the difficulties in numerically retrieving its value. Unlike traditional asymptotic homogenization, the fast Fourier transform-based homogenization method based on the augmented Lagrangian approach uses a Green operator in the frequency domain to replace time-consuming finite element analysis and inherently meet the periodic boundary conditions. Thus, it is developed in this work to retrieve material strength in terms of the von Mises yield criterion. The zero-level contour of a linear combination of cubic B-spline basis functions with repeated knots is used to represent the microstructure profile in the design of material strength. The effective strength or its squared difference with a prescribed target is minimized within the framework of the reaction diffusion-based B-spline level set method. The filtered, non-consistent discrete Green operator is adopted to avoid slow convergence of porous material. Examples of porous material demonstrate that the proposed method guarantees surface smoothness, optimization flexibility, and structural periodicity in strength design.},

This article introduces a reliability-based structural optimization with non-probabilistic credibility (NCRSO) method, to characterize the credibility of the optimization process. First the concept of uncertainty quantification for credible set is introduced. By utilizing a limited number of sample points, structural parameters with a high level of credibility are obtained and maintained throughout the optimization procedure . Additionally, a reliability index is established based on area ratio and credible feature distance, and a credible sequential optimization strategy is developed. Implementation of the proposed method significantly enhances the overall computational efficiency of structural optimization. The reliability index can directly utilized as the translation distance for deterministic constraints in the sequential strategy, minimizing unnecessary calculations and leading to improved convergence. Three engineering examples are eventually presented to effectively illustrate and emphasize the necessity of considering credibility when utilizing the structural optimization method under complex uncertainty from different perspectives.},

  abstract     = {We propose a methodology for improving the accuracy of surrogate models of the observable response of physical systems as a function of the systems’ spatially heterogeneous parameter fields, with applications to uncertainty quantification and parameter estimation in high-dimensional problems. Practitioners often formulate finite-dimensional representations of spatially heterogeneous parameter fields using truncated unconditional Karhunen–Loève expansions (KLEs) for a certain choice of unconditional covariance kernel and construct surrogate models of the observable response with respect to the KLE coefficients. When direct measurements of the parameter fields are available, we propose improving the accuracy of these surrogate models by representing the parameter fields via conditional Karhunen-Loève expansions (CKLEs). CKLEs are constructed by conditioning the covariance kernel of the unconditional expansion on the direct measurements of the parameter field via Gaussian process regression, and then truncating the corresponding KLE. We apply the proposed methodology to constructing surrogate models via the Basis Adaptation (BA) method of the stationary hydraulic head response, measured at spatially discrete observation locations, of a groundwater flow model of the Hanford Site, as a function of the 1000-dimensional representation of the model’s log-transmissivity field. We find that BA surrogate models of the hydraulic head based on CKLEs are more accurate than BA surrogate models based on unconditional expansions for forward uncertainty quantification tasks. Furthermore, we find that inverse estimates of the hydraulic transmissivity field computed using CKLE-based BA surrogate models are more accurate than those computed using unconditional BA surrogate models.},

For the static surface case, with the aid of a level set function, the surface normal and mean curvature used in the surface differential expressions can be computed easily. So, instead of imposing the normal extension constraints used in literature, we write the surface differential operators in the form of traditional Cartesian differential operators and use them in the loss function directly. We demonstrate a series of performance study for the present methodology by solving Laplace–Beltrami equations and surface diffusion equations on complex static surfaces. With just a moderate number of neurons used in the hidden layer, we are able to attain satisfactory prediction results. We then extend the present methodology to solve the advection–diffusion equation on an evolving surface with a given velocity. To track the deforming surface, we additionally introduce a network, in which a prescribed hidden layer is employed to enforce the topological structure of the surface and learn the homeomorphism between the surface and the prescribed topology. The proposed network structure is designed to track the surface and solve the equation simultaneously. Again, the numerical results show comparable accuracy as the static cases. As an application, we simulate surfactant transportation on a droplet surface under shear flow and obtain some physically plausible results.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a systematic design optimization approach for shells with pattern-guided infills, aiming to address both intuitive design requirements and considerations for additive manufacturing . The approach utilizes a density-based topology optimization method and assigns two sets of design variables to distinctly define the base, coating, and infill structures. By evolving the solid shells and enriched infills concurrently, the design optimization process ensures a cohesive integration of both components. To guide the infill design towards matching the geometrical features of a predefined pattern, a geometrical constraint is imposed on the infill field. Enhanced by an updated and approximate volume constraint, the infill materials with prescribed appearance performances are accordingly distributed in the base region. The simultaneous optimization of shell geometry and infill layout is then performed within the framework of minimum compliance topology optimization. A range of numerical results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. The topology optimized results demonstrate that a given pattern can directly control the design features of the infill in a visually explicit manner and the shell-infill composites ensure convenient manufacturability.},

The linearity of the operator is exploited to devise low-dimensional problems with only few active boundary parameters. An overlapping Schwarz method is used to glue the local surrogate models, solving a linear system for the nodal values of the parametric solution at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange multipliers to enforce the continuity in the overlapping region. The proposed DD-PGD methodology relies on a fully algebraic formulation allowing for real-time computation based on the efficient interpolation of the local surrogate models in the parametric space , with no additional problems to be solved during the execution of the Schwarz algorithm. Numerical results for parametric diffusion and convection–diffusion problems are presented to showcase the accuracy of the DD-PGD approach, its robustness in different regimes and its superior performance with respect to standard high-fidelity DD methods.},

The equivalent Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio of the liquid inclusions embedded in flexoelectric composites considering the surface tension are derived for the first time. An extended isogeometric analysis (XIGA) based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) is developed to model and solve the electromechanical response of weak discontinuities in flexoelectric composites. The interface between liquid and solid materials is implicitly represented by the level set method. Several numerical examples are presented as linear dielectric solids embedded with liquid inclusions under mechanical compression and different electric circuit configurations, including square matrixes and truncated pyramids. The simulation results indicate that a significant enhancement in the electromechanical coupling coefficient can be obtained by considering the effect of surface tension in open- and closed-circuit configurations. The maximum electric potential and energy conversion are higher in the open-circuit configuration. In addition, the XIGA simulation shows that the energy conversion of the flexoelectric devices increases as the size of the structural system and Young’s modulus of the flexoelectric material decrease. The maximum energy conversion capability of the flexoelectric composite, including the effect of surface tension, is enhanced by 32.4% with a central inclusion and 57% or higher with random inclusions.

  abstract     = {The data-driven cluster-based reduced-order model (CROM) methods[47–50] are very effective for predicting the nonlinear effective properties of heterogeneous materials. The Cluster Interaction Matrix (CIM) in these methods can be regarded as a clustered discrete Green&#39;s function and is the critical part of CROM methods, which more and more scholars have realized. However, the explicit expression of Green&#39;s function is available only for homogeneous material. The CIM for heterogeneous materials needs to be calculated through numerical approaches, which face the challenge of computational efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient method to construct the CIM of heterogeneous materials. By deriving the Green&#39;s function in Fourier space under the governing equation of FCA, the CIM of homogeneous materials that can provide the self-equilibrium stress field is calculated efficiently. Then, to avoid the effects of stress averaging on clusters, we augment the proposed cluster-element interaction matrix with the self-equilibrium stress basis vector of heterogeneous material without introducing additional computational cost. Based on the augmented cluster-element interaction matrix, the self-equilibrium stress space is improved, and the CIM of highly heterogeneous materials is calculated using the minimum complementary energy principle. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the offline computational accuracy of FCA, enabling efficient prediction of nonlinear effective properties and yield surface under complex load paths. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. In addition, we provide the relationship between the CIMs of a homogeneous material of FCA and SCA. Based on the proposed algorithm in this paper, it can be helpful for other CROM methods.},

The scale transitions are achieved through the extended Hill-Mandel theorem so that the microscopic fluid and solid dynamic effects are fully incorporated. The two-scale simulations are solved in a monolithic manner and the microscopic problems of all macroscopic integration points are decoupled from each other to prevent size of the system of equations from soaring to exceedingly large. By conveying microscale unbalanced forces and tangent operators to the macroscale level, the micro- and macroscale problems are solved in the same Newton loop such that unnecessary microscopic iterations based on estimated macroscopic variables in the conventional nested homogenization m are avoided. By solving benchmark numerical examples, the proposed model proves to be capable of capturing transient hydro-mechanical responses accurately. Moreover, in contrast to the conventional nested homogenization model, the proposed model saves around 40% of computational costs for nonlinear hydro-mechanical analysis. Using the framework of numerical manifold, the presented model can be easily extended to multiscale analyses involving complex boundaries, interfaces and fractures.},

The main issue of one-step simulations is the convergence of the Newton–Raphson scheme, which relies on an appropriate initial solution estimation. This problem is addressed by a sequential initial solution estimation, based on successive sub-problems with increasing difficulty up to the actual one. Applications of the proposed method on elementary test cases show fast and robust convergence, with CPU times comparable to those of the geometrical method. The proposed method is able to predict the influence of external forces and material hyperelastic mechanical behavior laws on the strain components of interest of woven fabrics, such as the shearing angles between yarns and the yarn elongations.},

  abstract     = {Time-dependent reliability-based design optimization (TRBDO) has attracted intensive research attentions in recent years by virtue of its unique ability to allow consideration of dynamic uncertainties caused by stochastic processes and material property degradation. However, existing TRBDO methods are generally too intricate to be practically applicable for practical engineering application. On top of that, extremely high computational cost for complex TRBDO problems further hinders its practicability. To facilitate smooth implementation via enhancing computational efficiency in solving TRBDO problems, this study proposes an innovative and efficient solution framework. The strategy is that time-dependent performance function in each probabilistic constraint is discretized into a series of instantaneous performance functions to transform the original TRBDO problem into a RBDO problem. The reliability of each probabilistic constraint in the transformed RBDO problem is then considered under extreme value condition. With engagement of the first-order reliability method, the RBDO problem is transformed into two different triple-loop timeindependent RBDO problem. However, the issue of expensive computational cost still persists due to the triple-loop structure and identification of temporal variables under extreme value condition. To this gap, a decoupled strategy is adopted to resolve the triple-loop structure into a series of cycles of double-loop reliability analyses and deterministic optimization. Two numerical examples and three engineering applications are employed to demonstrate the supreme computational performance of the currently proposed solution framework. Results show that the proposed framework is capable of achieving a reliable optimal design at a fast convergence speed.},

Generalized shear deformation theory (GSDT) in the framework of isogeometric analysis is employed as the analyzer for efficiency and accuracy, and a non-uniform rational B-spline function is used for depicting the material distribution. As the number of control points in fine 3D design meshes, i.e., the number of optimization variables, can be too large for an algorithm to find a practically feasible design, we propose an adaptive variable selection mechanism. It gradually selects control points at important regions as variables by considering neighbor material variance, hence accelerates the optimization process. Various plate geometries are considered to validate the present approach. The findings confirm that the design mesh should be fine, and that the proposed variable selection strategy enables the optimization algorithm to find much more refined designs even in cases of large dimensions while also reducing computation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and efficient evaluations of fatigue fracture is of great importance for the design and evaluation of viscoelastic materials in critical applications subject to cyclic load . In this study, an efficiency-enhanced phase-field model for viscoelastic fatigue fracture is proposed, allowing for fast evaluations of high-cycle fatigue damage. Based on the Boltzmann superposition principle , the cyclic fatigue load is decomposed into a mean load and a zero-mean cyclic load. The response of the mean load is solved numerically, while the response of the zero-mean cyclic load is solved analytically. The phase-field driving force is obtained analytically by combining the responses of the two independent parts, and the phase-field evolution is calculated numerically. In addition, both the dissipated energy and the elastic energy are decomposed using the volumetric-deviatoric decomposition to avoid unrealistic damage under the compression portion of the cyclic load. The proposed efficiency-enhanced model satisfies the energy conservation law as it does not require the fracture toughness degradation or additional fatigue energy treatments. The computational efficiency of the overall fatigue fracture can be greatly improved by leveraging the analytical solution for the response associated with the cyclic load. Numerical investigations are performed, and comparisons with the conventional cycle-by-cycle computation method are made. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the exponential computational demand to a constant or a linear one while achieving an accuracy comparable to that of the conventional method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further demonstrated using an actual rubber component with testing data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding complex microstructures and their effect on macroscopic properties . In general, it is difficult to derive an effective constitutive law for such microstructures with reasonable accuracy and meaningful parameters. One numerical approach to bridge the scales is computational homogenization , in which a microscopic problem is solved at every macroscopic point, essentially replacing the effective constitutive model. Such approaches are, however, computationally expensive and typically infeasible in multi-query contexts such as optimization and material design. To render these analyses tractable, surrogate models that can accurately approximate and accelerate the microscopic problem over a large design space of shapes, material and loading parameters are required. In this work, we develop a reduced order model based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Empirical Cubature Method (ECM) and a geometrical transformation method with the following key features: (i) large shape variations of the microstructure are captured, (ii) only relatively small amounts of training data are necessary, and (iii) highly non-linear history-dependent behaviors are treated. The proposed framework is tested and examined in two numerical examples , involving two scales and large geometrical variations. In both cases, high speed-ups and accuracies are achieved while observing good extrapolation behavior.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has developed rapidly in recent years and has the potential to enable fabrication of structurally optimized components that have hitherto been impossible to manufacture. When the degree of design freedom is high it can be observed that structurally optimized components are often truss-like in form, such that truss topology (or ‘layout’) optimization methods can be used to rapidly and directly identify optimal forms. However, these forms are often geometrically complex, and the presence of overhanging elements means that they generally need to be manufactured with support structures when traditional 3-axis AM machines are employed. To reduce, or even completely eliminate, the need for support structures, multi-axis AM machines with 5 or more axes can instead be used. In this contribution a novel process-aware truss layout optimization strategy tailored for multi-axis AM machines is proposed, which involves combining curved printing surface identification with truss layout and geometry optimization . Due to the non-linear and non-convex nature of the resulting optimization formulation , two strategies are proposed: (i) performance-based, to obtain highly materially-efficient structures, though which have as little need for support structures as possible; (ii) printability-based, to obtain fully self-supportable structures, though which consume as little material as possible. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It is shown that fully self-supporting optimized structures can often be identified, with little or no sacrifice in terms of structural performance.},

Challenges remain in modeling and understanding the complicated multiphysics processes of porous media subjected to THM loads and undergoing large deformation. In this study, we develop a stabilized material point method (MPM) for modeling the THM responses of large deformation problems in biphasic solid–fluid mixtures. A novel and efficient staggered solution scheme is proposed to solve the governing equations of the coupled system formulated in terms of four primary variables: solid displacement ( u ), liquid velocity ( v ), pore pressure ( p ), and temperature ( T ). The scheme solves the energy balance equation first and employs the resulting temperature to further advance the calculation of the momentum and mass balance equations using a semi-implicit fractional step method to facilitate equal-order interpolations. Both the incompressible and weakly compressible fluid are considered in the presented fractional step formulations. We also develop the axisymmetric form of the coupled MPM to increase the applicability and efficiency of the method in THM problems. The validity, stability, and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated through three benchmark problems, including the heating of a saturated half-space, the non-isothermal consolidation of a soil column, and a three-dimensional axisymmetric problem pertaining to the thermoelastic response around a point heat source. The predictive capability of the proposed method for large deformation problems is further showcased by the simulation of the progressive failure process of a thermal-sensitive slope.},

  abstract     = {Precise determination of thermal diffusivity at high temperatures is crucial for aerospace and energy industries. Periodic heating techniques such as Å ngström’s method are data-rich and commonly used for measuring thermal diffusivity of a solid material. In previous Å ngström’s method studies, regression techniques have been used to solve the associated inverse problem and to estimate thermal diffusivity by minimizing the residual between measurements and model predictions. This approach lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification and does not allow incorporation of prior knowledge for parameters. Adopting a Bayesian framework addresses these issues; however, probing the Bayesian posterior distribution is prohibitively expensive using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, especially when the physical model is computationally expensive, as in the present study for which an analytical solution does not exist. This study employs a parametric surrogate model in the form of polynomial chaos to accelerate the physical model by several orders of magnitude to support Bayesian analysis. Moreover, high-temperature testing environments are difficult to control precisely, and many unknown parameters exist beyond the quantity of interest. Previous studies have employed random walks to set new parameters in the MCMC sampling process. However, random walks are inefficient in exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces and thus suffer high auto-correlation and poor convergence. To improve the efficiency of the MCMC sampler, this study employs a No-U-Turn sampler that explores the parameter space thoroughly and efficiently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this Bayesian framework by analyzing experimental results on a graphite sample at approximately 1000 K.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel infill-sampling strategy for adaptive gradient-enhanced Kriging (AGEK) that delivers superior results on a limited budget. The primary innovation of this method is the adaptive use of gradient information, blurring the line between Kriging and gradient-enhanced Kriging. To construct a flexible AGEK model that automatically determines whether to incorporate gradients, our proposed method unfolds in three stages: (1) primary infill-sampling, (2) secondary infill-sampling, and (3) modeling time stages. In the first stage, the primary infill-sampling technique identifies potential sample point sites. In the second stage, the secondary infill-sampling process decides whether to obtain only the response or both the response and gradient at the selected sample point. During this stage, a newly defined pseudo expected improvement reduction, pseudo integrated uncertainty reduction, and weight functions are incorporated into the secondary infill-sampling criteria. In the third stage, we propose a strategy to manage instances where training time becomes overly demanding. Benchmark test results validate the excellent performance of the proposed method. Finally, in application to an engineering problem, our method outperforms conventional approaches by producing more accurate results within a limited computational budget.},

  abstract     = {In the last decades, there has been an increase in the number of successful machine learning models that have served as a key to identifying and using linkages within the process-structure–property-performance chain for vastly different problems in the domains of materials mechanics. The consideration of physical laws in data-driven modelling has recently been shown to enable enhanced prediction performance and generalization while requiring less data than either physics-based or data-driven modelling approaches independently. In this contribution, we introduce a simulation-assisted machine learning framework applied to the solid-state layer deposition technique friction surfacing, suitable for solid-state additive manufacturing as well as repair or coating applications. The objective of the present study is to use machine learning algorithms to predict and analyse the influence of process parameters and environmental variables, i.e. substrate and backing material properties, on process behaviour and deposit geometry. The effects of maximum process temperatures supplied by a numerical heat transfer model on the predictions of the targets are given special attention. Numerous different machine learning algorithms are implemented, optimized and evaluated to take advantage of their varied capabilities and to choose the optimal one for each target and the provided data. Furthermore, the input feature dependence for each prediction target is evaluated using game-theory related Shapley Additive Explanation values. The experimental data set consists of two separate experimental design spaces, one for varying process parameters and the other for varying substrate and backing material properties, which allowed to keep the experimental effort to a minimum. The aim was to also represent the cross parameter space between the two independent spaces in the predictive model, which was accomplished and resulted in an approximately 44 % reduction in the number of experiments when compared to carrying out an experimental design that included both spaces.},

  abstract     = {The joint probability density function (PDF) of multiple response processes of a system is a crucial topic in the fields of science and engineering. It is adopted to describe the dependent uncertainty propagation in complex stochastic dynamical systems, including the displacement and velocity of one degree of freedom (DOF), and the nonlinear probabilistic dependencies between multiple variables. However, the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the time evolution of joint PDFs for multiple stochastic processes are often high-dimensional and coupled, making them analytically or numerically intractable for systems with high dimensionality. The probability density evolution method (PDEM) has provided a new perspective from the standpoint of random events description of the principle of preservation of probability. For an n-dimensional system, if merely the joint PDF of m processes is needed, where m is not larger than n, then it is sufficient to solve the generalized density evolution equation (GDEE), i.e., the Li–Chen equation, in m dimensions. This approach is particularly convenient for cases where n is large while m is small. However, for cases where m is not less than two, it is still challenging to avoid solving high-dimensional PDEs. This paper proposes a new method for the determination of joint PDF of multiple responses based on the principle of preservation of probability. To capture the joint PDF of m processes, the m-dimensional PDE can be transformed into m one-dimensional PDEs, significantly reducing the computational complexity of numerical implementation. The proposed method gives an enhanced version to the PDEM, enabling it to not only determine the individual probabilistic response, but also efficiently determine the dependent probabilistic distribution of multiple responses of high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems without solving the coupling PDE. It reduces the computational cost from exponential growth of m powers to linear growth. Some numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, problems for future investigations are discussed.},

  abstract     = {We present a new first order particle method on lagrangian and moving Voronoï meshes for the numerical simulation of compressible flows with shocks and internal interfaces between different gas. The method is based on the closed form formula of the partial derivative of the volume of Voronoï cells with respect to the generators. The mathematical proof of the formula seems original with respect to the literature. A corollary is that the volume of Voronoï cells is generically of class C 1 C1 with respect to the generators. The final scheme is conservative in local mass, total momentum and total energy, and it is endowed with an entropy inequality which insures the correctness of shocks calculations. Numerical illustrations in dimension d = 2 d=2 are displayed for basic problems on coarse meshes. The implementation developed to obtain the numerical illustrations uses a freely available library for the generation of the Voronoï cells at all time steps.},

  abstract     = {The present study focuses on the applications of energy decomposition in diverse nonlocal models , such as elasticity, thin plates, and gradient elasticity, with the aim of establishing bond-based nonlocal models in which the bond force is solely dependent on the deformation of a single bond . Through the adoption of an appropriate bond force form and the application of energy equivalence between local and nonlocal models, several kinds of highly succinct bond-based models are obtained. The present study involves a reexamination of nonlocal operator methods, with a particular focus on the simplified version within a symmetric support domain. A three-point bent-bond model has been proposed to characterize the curvature and bending moment. A crack criterion for normal strain of the bond based on Griffith theories is proposed. This approach is analogous to the phase field model and allows for individual application to each bond, resulting in strain localization . By implementing this rule, the path of the crack can be predicted in an automated manner through the act of cutting the bond, yielding outcomes that are akin to those obtained via the phase field method. Simultaneously, a crack rule for critical shear strains in shear fractures is presented. Moreover, an incremental version of the plasticity model associated with bond force has been formulated. The nonlocal bond-based models are further validated through several numerical examples .},
