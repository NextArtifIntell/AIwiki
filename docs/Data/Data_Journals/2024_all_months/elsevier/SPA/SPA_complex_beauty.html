  abstract     = {The generalization of fractional Brownian motion in the white and grey noise spaces has been recently carried over, following the Mandelbrot–Van Ness representation, through Riemann–Liouville type fractional operators. Our aim is to extend this construction by means of more general fractional derivatives and integrals, which we define as Fourier-multiplier operators and then specialize by means of Bernstein functions. More precisely, we introduce a general class of kernel-driven processes which encompasses, as special cases, a number of models in the literature, including fractional Brownian motion, tempered fractional Brownian motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. The greater generality of our model, with respect to the previous ones, allows a higher flexibility and a wider applicability. We derive here some properties of this class of processes (such as continuity, occupation density, variance asymptotics and persistence) according to the conditions satisfied by the Fourier symbol of the operator or the Bernstein function chosen. On the other hand, these processes are proved to display short- or long-range dependence, if obtained by means of a derivative or an integral type operator, respectively, regardless of the kernel used in their definition. Finally, this kind of construction allows us to define the corresponding noise and to solve a Langevin-type integral equation.},

The large n asymptotic properties of the Ewens–Pitman model have been the subject of numerous studies, with the focus being on the number K n of partition sets and the number K r , n of partition subsets of size r , for r = 1 , … , n . While for α = 0 asymptotic results have been obtained in terms of almost-sure convergence and Gaussian fluctuations, for α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) only almost-sure convergences are available, with the proof for K r , n being given only as a sketch. In this paper, we make use of martingales to develop a unified and comprehensive treatment of the large n asymptotic behaviours of K n and K r , n for α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , providing alternative, and rigorous, proofs of the almost-sure convergences of K n and K r , n , and covering the gap of Gaussian fluctuations.

At each step, with a fixed probability p p , the positively step-reinforced random walk repeats one of its preceding steps chosen uniformly at random, and with complementary probability 1 − p 1−p , it has an independent increment. The negatively step-reinforced random walk follows the same reinforcement algorithm but when a step is repeated its sign is also changed. Strong laws of large numbers and strong invariance principles are established for positively and negatively step-reinforced random walks in this work. Our approach relies on two general theorems on the invariance principles for martingale difference sequences and a truncation argument. As by-products of our main results, the law of iterated logarithm and the functional central limit theorem are also obtained for step-reinforced random walks.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by a general principle governing regulation mechanisms in biological cells, we investigate a general interaction scheme between different populations of particles and specific particles, referred to as agents. Assuming that each particle follows a random path in the medium, when a particle and an agent meet, they may bind and form a pair which has some specific functional properties. Such a pair is also subject to random events and it splits after some random amount of time. In a stochastic context, using a Markovian model for the vector of the number of paired particles, and by taking the total number of particles as a scaling parameter, we study the asymptotic behavior of the time evolution of the number of paired particles. Two scenarios are investigated: one with a large but fixed number of agents, and the other one, the dynamic case, when agents are created at a bounded rate and may die after some time when they are not paired. A first order limit theorem is established for the time evolution of the system in both cases. The proof of an averaging principle of the dynamic case is one of the main contributions of the paper. The impact of dynamical arrivals of agents on the level of pairing of the system is discussed.},

Using a non-Stein approach, we determine the convergence rate in the Kolmogorov metric. When the long-memory parameter exceeds 1/2, the limit is a chi-distributed random process, and the convergence rate in the Wasserstein metric is determined using multidimensional Stein’s method. Notable differences in convergence rate upper bounds are observed for long-memory parameters within (1/2,3/4) and (3/4,1).},

  abstract     = {In the field of computational finance, one is commonly interested in the expected value of a financial derivative whose payoff depends on the solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). For multi-dimensional SDEs with non-commutative diffusion coefficients in the globally Lipschitz setting, a kind of one-half order truncated Milstein-type scheme without Lévy areas was recently introduced by Giles and Szpruch (2014), which combined with the antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) gives the optimal overall computational cost O ( ϵ − 2 ) O(ϵ−2) for the required target accuracy ϵ ϵ . Nevertheless, many nonlinear SDEs in applications have non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients and the corresponding theoretical guarantees for antithetic MLMC are absent in the literature. In the present work, we aim to fill the gap and analyze antithetic MLMC in a non-globally Lipschitz setting. First, we propose a family of modified Milstein-type schemes without Lévy areas to approximate SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients. The expected one-half order of strong convergence is recovered in a non-globally Lipschitz setting, where even the diffusion coefficients are allowed to grow superlinearly. This then helps us to analyze the relevant variance of the multilevel estimator and the optimal computational cost is finally achieved for the antithetic MLMC. Since getting rid of the Lévy areas destroys the martingale properties of the scheme, the analysis of both the convergence rate and the desired variance becomes highly non-trivial in the non-globally Lipschitz setting. By introducing an auxiliary approximation process, we develop non-standard arguments to overcome the essential difficulties. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Optimal transport (OT) based data analysis is often faced with the issue that the underlying cost function is (partially) unknown. This is addressed in this paper with the derivation of distributional limits for the empirical OT value when the cost function and the measures are estimated from data. For statistical inference purposes, but also from the viewpoint of a stability analysis, understanding the fluctuation of such quantities is paramount. Our results find direct application in the problem of goodness-of-fit testing for group families, in machine learning applications where invariant transport costs arise, in the problem of estimating the distance between mixtures of distributions, and for the analysis of empirical sliced OT quantities. The established distributional limits assume either weak convergence of the cost process in uniform norm or that the cost is determined by an optimization problem of the OT value over a fixed parameter space. For the first setting we rely on careful lower and upper bounds for the OT value in terms of the measures and the cost in conjunction with a Skorokhod representation. The second setting is based on a functional delta method for the OT value process over the parameter space. The proof techniques might be of independent interest.},

In a log-normal market model with the asset specialization, we characterize one mean field equilibrium in analytical form in each problem, allowing us to understand some quantitative properties of the equilibrium strategy and conclude some financial implications caused by consumption habits from a mean-field perspective. In each problem with n n agents, we construct an approximate Nash equilibrium for the n n -player game using the obtained mean field equilibrium when n n is sufficiently large.

By a now classical approach, the first stage of the invasion is well approximated by a branching process. The macroscopic phase, when the mutant population is of the same order as the resident population, is described by the limiting dynamical system. We capture the intermediate mesoscopic phase for the invasive population and obtain sharp approximations. It allows us to describe the fluctuations of the hitting times of thresholds, which inherit a large variance from the first stage. We apply our results to two models which are original motivations. In particular, we quantify the hitting times of critical values in cancer emergence and epidemics.},

Each pair of neighboring particles has a negative binding energy − U &lt; 0 −U&amp;lt;0 , while each particle has a positive activation energy Δ &gt; 0 Δ&amp;gt;0 . The initial configuration is drawn from the grand-canonical ensemble restricted to the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is to describe, in the metastable regime Δ ∈ ( U , 2 U ) Δ∈(U,2U) and in the limit as β → ∞ β→∞ , how and when the system nucleates, i.e., grows a supercritical droplet somewhere in Λ β Λβ . In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random walks. In the present paper we use the results in the first paper to analyze how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space–time scales when the volume is moderately large , namely, | Λ β | = e Θ β |Λβ|=eΘβ with Δ &lt; Θ &lt; 2 Δ − U Δ&amp;lt;Θ&amp;lt;2Δ−U . In the third paper we consider the setting where the volume is very large , namely, | Λ β | = e Θ β |Λβ|=eΘβ with Δ &lt; Θ &lt; Γ − ( 2 Δ − U ) Δ&amp;lt;Θ&amp;lt;Γ−(2Δ−U) , where Γ Γ is the energy of the critical droplet in the local model, i.e., when Λ β Λβ has a fixed volume not depending on β β and particles can be created and annihilated at the boundary, and use the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time. We will see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as homogeneous nucleation . Since Kawasaki dynamics is conservative , i.e., particles move around and interact but are preserved, we need to control non-local effects in the way droplets are formed and dissolved. This is done via a deductive approach : the tube of typical trajectories leading to nucleation is described via a series of events, whose complements have negligible probability, on which the evolution of the gas can be captured by a coarse-grained Markov chain on a space of droplets, which we refer to as droplet dynamics .},

  abstract     = {A birth and death process is a continuous-time Markov chain with minimal state space N N , whose transition matrix is standard and whose density matrix is a birth–death matrix. Birth and death process is unique if and only if ∞ ∞ is an entrance or natural. When ∞ ∞ is neither an entrance nor natural, there are two ways in the literature to obtain all birth and death processes. The first one is an analytic treatment proposed by Feller in 1959, and the second one is a probabilistic construction completed by Wang in 1958. In this paper we will give another way to study birth and death processes using the Ray–Knight compactification. This way has the advantage of both the analytic and probabilistic treatments above. By applying the Ray–Knight compactification, every birth and death process can be modified into a càdlàg Ray process on N ∪ { ∞ } ∪ { ∂ } N∪{∞}∪{∂} , which is either a Doob processes or a Feller Q Q -process. Every birth and death process in the second class has a modification that is a Feller process on N ∪ { ∞ } ∪ { ∂ } N∪{∞}∪{∂} . We will derive the expression of its infinitesimal generator, which explains its boundary behaviours at ∞ ∞ . Furthermore, by using the killing transform and the Ikeda–Nagasawa–Watanabe piecing out procedure, we will also provide a probabilistic construction for birth and death processes. This construction relies on a triple determining the resolvent matrix introduced by Wang and Yang in their work (Wang and Yang, 1992).},

One of the key arguments relies on discrete extrapolation that allows us to relate lower moments of discrete maximal processes. We show that, if the generic spatial discretization is constraint conforming, then the velocity approximation satisfies a best-approximation property in the natural distance. Moreover, we present an example such that the resulting velocity approximation converges with rate 1 / 2 1/2 in time and 1 in space towards the (unknown) target velocity with respect to the natural distance.

We show that there exists a unique solution, which we call the causal feedback solution, to the closed-loop system of a controlled SVIE associated with a causal feedback strategy. Furthermore, introducing two novel equations named a Type-II extended backward stochastic Volterra integral equation and a Lyapunov–Volterra equation, we prove a duality principle and a representation formula for a quadratic functional of controlled SVIEs in the framework of causal feedback strategies.},

  abstract     = {We consider a parametric version of the UST (Uniform Spanning Tree) measure on arbitrary directed weighted finite graphs with tuning (killing) parameter q &gt; 0 q&amp;gt;0 . This is obtained by considering the standard random weighted spanning tree on the extended graph built by adding a ghost state † † and directed edges to it, of constant weights q q , from any vertex of the original graph. The resulting measure corresponds to a random spanning rooted forest of the graph where the parameter q q tunes the intensity of the number of trees as follows: partitions with many trees are favored for q &gt; 1 q&amp;gt;1 , while as q → 0 q→0 , the standard UST of the graph is recovered. We are interested in the behavior of the induced random partition, referred to as Loop-erased partitioning, which gives a correlated cluster model, as the multiscale parameter q ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ) q∈[0,∞) varies. Emergence of giant clusters in this correlated percolation model as a function of q q has been recently explored on certain dense growing graphs Avena et al. (2022). Herein we derive two types of results. First, we explore monotonicity properties in q q of this forest measure on general graphs showing in particular some counter-intuitive subtleties in non-reversible settings where the electrical-network interpretation of the UST observables gets partially lost. Second, by analyzing 2-points correlations on trees and various very sparse growing graph models, we characterize emerging macroscopic clusters, as q q scales with the graph size, and derive related phase diagrams.},

The connection between these two models is not only theoretically important but also plays an essential role in applications. This paper considers the macroscopic limits of the chemical reaction–diffusion master equation for first-order chemical reaction systems in highly heterogeneous environments. More precisely, the diffusion coefficients as well as the reaction rates are spatially inhomogeneous and the reaction rates may also be discontinuous. By carefully discretizing these heterogeneities within a reaction–diffusion master equation model, we show that in the limit we recover the macroscopic reaction–diffusion system with inhomogeneous diffusion and reaction rates.},

The shot noise processes have a renewal arrival process, non-stationary noises (with arrival-time dependent distributions) and a general shot response function of the noises. The rate function in the MDP exhibits a memory phenomenon in this asymptotic regime, which is in contrast with that in the conventional time–space scaling regime. To prove the sample-path MDP, we first establish that this is equivalent to establishing the sample-path MDP of another process that is easier to study. We prove its finite-dimensional MDP and then establish the exponential tightness under the Skorohod J 1 J1 topology. This results in the sample-path MDP in D D under the Skorohod J 1 J1 topology with a rate function that is derived from the rate function in the finite-dimensional MDP using the tools of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In the proofs, because of the non-stationarity of shot noise process, we establish a new exponential maximal inequality and use it to prove exponential tightness and the aforementioned equivalence.},

We demonstrate that the stochastic control/stopping problem with expectation constraints (CSEC) is independent of a specific probability setting and is equivalent to the constrained stochastic control/stopping problem in weak formulation (an optimization over joint laws of Brownian motion, state dynamics, diffusion controls and stopping rules on an enlarged canonical space). Using a martingale-problem formulation of controlled SDEs in spirit of Stroock and Varadhan (2006), we characterize the probability classes in weak formulation by countably many actions of canonical processes, and thus obtain the upper semi-analyticity of the CSEC value function. Then we employ a measurable selection argument to establish a dynamic programming principle (DPP) in weak formulation for the CSEC value function, in which the conditional expected costs act as additional states for constraint levels at the intermediate horizon. This article extends (El Karoui and Tan, 2013) to the expectation-constraint case. We extend our previous work (Bayraktar and Yao, 2024) to the more complicated setting where the diffusion is controlled. Compared to that paper the topological properties of diffusion-control spaces and the corresponding measurability are more technically involved which complicate the arguments especially for the measurable selection for the super-solution side of DPP in the weak formulation.},

  abstract     = {Statistical inference for stochastic processes based on high frequency observations has been an active research area for more than two decades. One of the most well-known and widely studied problems has been the estimation of the quadratic variation of the continuous component of an Itô semimartingale with jumps. Several rate- and variance-efficient estimators have been proposed in the literature when the jump component is of bounded variation. However, to date, very few methods can deal with jumps of unbounded variation. By developing new high-order expansions of the truncated moments of a locally stable Lévy process, we propose a new rate- and variance-efficient volatility estimator for a class of Itô semimartingales whose jumps behave locally like those of a stable Lévy process with Blumenthal–Getoor index Y ∈ ( 1 , 8 / 5 ) Y∈(1,8/5) (hence, of unbounded variation). The proposed method is based on a two-step debiasing procedure for the truncated realized quadratic variation of the process and can also cover the case Y &lt; 1 Y&amp;lt;1 . Our Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the method outperforms other efficient alternatives in the literature in the setting covered by our theoretical framework.},

After postulating a suitable model for such functional data, we present three tests focusing, respectively, on changes in the shape, the magnitude and arbitrary changes in the sequences of the curves of interest. We justify the respective procedures by showing that they have asymptotically correct size and by deriving consistency rates for all tests. These rates involve the sample size (the number of trading days) and the grid size (the number of observations per day).

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore the metastable behavior of the Glauber dynamics associated with the three-state Potts model with an asymmetrical external field at a low-temperature regime. The model exhibits three monochromatic configurations: a unique stable state and two metastable states with different stability levels. We investigate metastable transitions, which are transitions from each metastable state to the ground state, separately and verify that the two transitions exhibit different behaviors. For the metastable state with greater stability, we derive large deviation-type results for metastable transition time, both in terms of probability and expectation. On the other hand, a particularly intriguing phenomenon emerges when starting from the other metastable state: the process may fall into the deep valley of another metastable state with a low probability but remains trapped there for an exponentially long time. We identify specific conditions on the external field under which this rare event contributes to the mean hitting time. To this end, we conduct a detailed analysis of the energy landscape, revealing a sharp saddle configuration analogous to the Ising model.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to study the impact of resistance acquisition on the distribution of neutral mutations in a cell population under therapeutic pressure. The cell population is modeled by a bi-type branching process. Initially, the cells all carry type 0, associated with a negative growth rate. Mutations towards type 1 are assumed to be rare and random, and lead to the survival of cells under treatment, i.e. type 1 is associated with a positive growth rate, and thus models the acquisition of a resistance. Cells also carry neutral mutations, acquired at birth and accumulated by inheritance, that do not affect their type. We describe the expectation of the ”Site Frequency Spectrum” (SFS), which is an index of neutral mutation distribution in a population, under the asymptotic of rare events of resistance acquisition and of large initial population. Precisely, we give asymptotically-equivalent expressions of the expected number of neutral mutations shared by both a small and a large number of cells. To identify the influence of relatives on the SFS, our work also lead us to study in detail subcritical binary Galton–Watson trees, where each leaf is marked with a small probability. As a by-product of this study, we thus provide the law of the generation of a randomly chosen leaf in such a Galton–Watson tree conditioned on the number of marks.},

Infected individuals all recover at rate one but infect nearby individuals at a rate that depends on whether they show the symptoms of the disease or not. Newly infected individuals are always asymptomatic and may or may not show the symptoms before they recover. The analysis of the corresponding mean-field model reveals that, in the absence of local interactions, regardless of the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic, there is an epidemic whenever at least one of the infection rates is sufficiently large. In contrast, our analysis of the interacting particle system shows that, when the rate at which asymptomatic individuals become symptomatic is small and the asymptomatic individuals are not infectious, there cannot be an epidemic even when the symptomatic individuals are highly infectious.},

  abstract     = {The distribution of a one-dimensional drifted Brownian motion conditioned on its first hitting time to 0 is the same as a three-dimensional Bessel bridge. By applying the time change in Lamperti’s relation to this result, Matsumoto and Yor (2001) showed a relation between Brownian motions with opposite drifts. In two subsequent papers (Matsumoto and Yor, 2000; 2001), they established a geometric lifting of the process 2M-B in Pitman’s theorem, known as the Matsumoto–Yor process. They also established an equality in law involving Inverse Gaussian distribution and its reciprocal (as processes), known as the Matsumoto–Yor property, by conditioning some exponential Wiener functional. Sabot and Zeng (2020) generalized some results on drifted Brownian motion conditioned on its first hitting. More precisely, they introduced a family of Brownian semimartingales with interacting drifts, for which when conditioned on the vector τ τ (the hitting times to 0 of each component), their joint law is the same as for independent three-dimensional Bessel bridges. The distribution of τ τ is a generalization of Inverse Gaussian distribution in multi-dimension and it is related to a random potential β β that appears in the study of the Vertex Reinforced Jump Process. The aim of this paper is to generalize the results of Matsumoto and Yor (2001, 2000) in the context of these interacting Brownian semimartingales. We apply a Lamperti-type time change to the previous family of interacting Brownian motions and we obtain a multi-dimensional opposite drift theorem. Moreover, we also give a multi-dimensional counterpart of the Matsumoto–Yor process and its intertwining relation with interacting geometric Brownian motions.},

We show the so-called moment formula, i.e. a representation of the conditional marginal moments via a system of finite dimensional linear PDEs. Furthermore, we characterize the corresponding infinitesimal generators obtaining a representation analogous to polynomial diffusions on R + m R+m , in cases where their domain is large enough. In general the infinite dimensional setting allows for richer specifications strictly beyond this representation. As a special case, we recover measure-valued affine diffusions, sometimes also called Dawson–Watanabe superprocesses. From a mathematical finance point of view, the polynomial framework is especially attractive since it allows to transfer many famous finite dimensional models and their tractability properties to an infinite dimensional measure-valued setting.},

It is well-known that the empirical measure of the roots converges to the uniform measure on the unit disk. On the other hand, at any point on the unit disk, there is a hole in which there are no roots, with high probability. In a beautiful work (Michelen, 2020), Michelen showed that the holes at ± 1 ±1 are of order 1 / n 1/n . We show that in fact, all the hole radii are of the same order. The same phenomenon is established for the derivatives of the Kac polynomial as well.},

A stable central limit theorem shows that this estimator is consistent and asymptotically mixed normal. By taking into account the quadratic variation, we propose two new estimators. Their limiting distributions exhibit a smaller (conditional) variance and the last estimator also works for vanishing noise levels. The proofs are based on local approximation results to overcome the intricate nonlinearities and on a stable central limit theorem for stochastic integrals with respect to cylindrical Brownian motion.

Existing research focuses on a particular class of hypo-elliptic Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), with components split into ‘rough’/‘smooth’ and noise from rough components propagating directly onto smooth ones, but some critical model classes arising in applications have yet to be explored. We aim to cover this gap, thus analyse the highly degenerate class of SDEs, where components split into further sub-groups. Such models include e.g. the notable case of generalised Langevin equations. We propose a tailored time-discretisation scheme and provide asymptotic results supporting our scheme in the context of high-frequency, full observations. The proposed discretisation scheme is applicable in much more general data regimes and is shown to overcome biases via simulation studies also in the practical case when only a smooth component is observed. Joint consideration of our study for highly degenerate SDEs and existing research provides a general ‘recipe’ for the development of time-discretisation schemes to be used within statistical methods for general classes of hypo-elliptic SDEs.},

The present work aims at clarifying when the agents can asymptotically polarize , i.e. when the common limit inclination can take the extreme values, 0 or 1, with probability zero, strictly positive, or equal to one. Moreover, we present a suitable technique to estimate this probability that, along with the theoretical results, has been framed in the more general setting of a class of martingales taking values in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] and following a specific dynamics.},

We place ourselves in a Peaks-Over-Threshold framework where a functional extreme is defined as an observation X X whose L 2 L2 -norm ‖ X ‖ ‖X‖ is comparatively large. Our goal is to propose a dimension reduction framework resulting into finite dimensional projections for such extreme observations. Our contribution is double. First, we investigate the notion of Regular Variation for random quantities valued in a general separable Hilbert space, for which we propose a novel concrete characterization involving solely stochastic convergence of real-valued random variables. Second, we propose a notion of functional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accounting for the principal ‘directions’ of functional extremes. We investigate the statistical properties of the empirical covariance operator of the angular component of extreme functions, by upper-bounding the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of the estimation error for finite sample sizes. Numerical experiments with simulated and real data illustrate this work.},

In this work we consider integral equations featuring kernels which may be expressed as scalar multiples of conservative (i.e. Markov) kernels and we adopt a variational point of view by considering a minimization problem in the space of probability measures with an entropic regularization. Contrary to classical approaches which discretize the domain of the solutions, we introduce an algorithm to asymptotically sample from the unique solution of the regularized minimization problem. As a result our estimators do not depend on any underlying grid and have better scalability properties than most existing methods. Our algorithm is based on a particle approximation of the solution of a McKean–Vlasov stochastic differential equation associated with the Wasserstein gradient flow of our variational formulation. We prove the convergence towards a minimizer and provide practical guidelines for its numerical implementation. Finally, our method is compared with other approaches on several examples including density deconvolution and epidemiology.},

We show that the proposed scheme converges strongly with orders 1 2 12 in time and 2 in space. To investigate the numerical asymptotic behavior, we establish the large deviation principle for the numerical solution. This is the first result on the study of the large deviation principle for the numerical scheme of stochastic partial differential equations with superlinearly growing drift.

Our approach relies on a combination of the existence of a weak decoupling field (see Delarue and Guatteri, 2006), the integration with respect to space time local time (see Eisenbaum, 2006), the analysis of the backward Kolmogorov equation associated to the forward component along with an Itô-Tanaka trick (see Flandoli et al., 2009). The framework of this paper is beyond all existing papers on density analysis for Markovian BSDEs and constitutes a major refinement of the existing results. We also derive a comonotonicity theorem for the control variable in this frame and thus extending the works (Chen et al., 2005; Dos Rei and Dos Rei 2013). As applications of our results, we first analyse the regularity of densities of solution to coupled FBSDEs. In the second example, we consider a regime switching term structure interest rate models (see for e.g., Ma et al. (2017)) for which the corresponding FBSDE has discontinuous drift. Our results enables us to: firstly study classical and Malliavin differentiability of the solutions for such models, secondly the existence of density of such solutions. Lastly we consider a pricing and hedging problem of contingent claims on non-tradable underlying, when the dynamic of the latter is given by a regime switching SDE (i.e., the drift coefficient is allowed to be discontinuous). We obtain a representation of the derivative hedge as the weak derivative of the indifference price function, thus extending the result in Ankirchner et al. (2010).},

The latter is established for a large class of weakly dependent functional time series, which admit expansions as Bernoulli shifts and the weak dependence is quantified by the condition of L 4 L4 - m m -approximability.},

We establish the existence of the Snell envelope by employing a penalization technique and the primary challenge we encounter is demonstrating the regularity of the limit for the scheme. Additionally, we relate the Snell envelope to a finite horizon, zero-sum stochastic differential game, where one player controls a path-dependent stochastic system by invoking impulses, while the opponent is given the opportunity to stop the game prematurely. Importantly, by developing new techniques within the realm of control randomization, we demonstrate that the value of the game exists and is precisely characterized by our non-linear Snell envelope.},

Choosing two balls from the urn with replacement, observe their labels, and perform a group multiplication on the respective group elements to obtain a group element. Then, we put a ball labeled with that resulting element into the urn. This model was formulated by P. Diaconis while studying a group theoretic algorithm called MeatAxe (Holt and Rees, 1994). Siegmund and Yakir (2005) partially investigated this model. In this paper, we further investigate and generalize this model. More specifically, we allow a random number of balls to be drawn from the urn at each stage in the Diaconis urn model. For such a case, we verify that the normalized urn composition converges almost surely to the uniform distribution on the group G G . Moreover, we obtain the asymptotic joint distribution of the urn composition by using the martingale central limit theorem.},

This approach simplifies the determination of the optimal policy, transforming it into an analysis of ordinary first-order optimality conditions.

We study the asymptotic behavior of the first hitting time from any metastable state to the stable configuration as β → ∞ β→∞ in probability, in expectation, and in distribution. We also identify the exponent of the mixing time and find an upper and a lower bound for the spectral gap.

We comment on two different numerical algorithms to compute the free-boundary equation and discuss illustrative cases that shed light on the boundary’s shape. In particular, the free boundary generally does not share the monotonicity of the Brownian bridge case.},

In particular, our results are applicable to the singular setups concerned with not only the Lennard-Jones-like interaction potentials but also the Coulomb potentials. In addition to Harris’ theorem, the approach is based on novel constructions of proper Lyapunov functions (which are completely different from the setting for Langevin dynamics driven by Brownian motions), on invoking the Hörmander theorem for non-local operators and on solving the issue on an approximate controllability of the associated deterministic system as well as on exploiting the time-change idea.},

Our bounds are expressed using the stochastic characteristics of ( X t ) t ∈ [ 0 , T ] (Xt)t∈[0,T] and the jump-diffusion coefficients of ( X t ∗ ) t ∈ [ 0 , T ] (Xt∗)t∈[0,T] evaluated in X t Xt , and apply in particular to the case of different jump characteristics. Our approach uses stochastic calculus arguments and L p Lp integrability results for the flow of stochastic differential equations with jumps, without relying on the Stein equation.},

  abstract     = {We define and analyze an extension to the d d -dimensional hyperbolic space of the Radial Spanning Tree (RST) introduced by Baccelli and Bordenave in the two-dimensional Euclidean space (2007). In particular, we will focus on the description of the infinite branches of the tree. The properties of the two-dimensional Euclidean RST are extended to the hyperbolic case in every dimension: almost surely, every infinite branch admits an asymptotic direction and each asymptotic direction is reached by at least one infinite branch. Moreover, the branch converging to any deterministic asymptotic direction is unique almost surely. To obtain results for any dimension, a completely new approach is considered here. Our strategy mainly involves the two following ingredients, that rely on the hyperbolic Directed Spanning Forest (DSF) introduced and studied in Flammant (2019). First, the hyperbolic metric allows us to obtain fine control of the branches’ fluctuations in the hyperbolic DSF without using planarity arguments. Then, we couple the hyperbolic RST with the hyperbolic DSF and conclude thanks to the precise estimates mentioned before.},

The particles at the origin are active , all other ones being assumed as dormant , or sleeping , hence not active. Active particles perform a simple symmetric continuous-time random walk in Z Z (that is, a random walk with exp ( 1 ) exp(1) -distributed jump times and jumps − 1 −1 and 1, each with probability 1 / 2 1/2 ), independently of all other particles. Sleeping particles stay still until the first arrival of an active particle to their location; upon arrival they become active and start their own simple random walks. Different sets of conditions are given ensuring explosion, respectively non-explosion, of the continuous-time frog model. Our results show in particular that if μ μ is the distribution of e Y ln Y eYlnY with a non-negative random variable Y Y satisfying E Y &lt; ∞ EY&amp;lt;∞ , then a.s. no explosion occurs.

Based on a modified sample of an instrumental Markov chain targeting an instrumental distribution (typically via a MCMC kernel), the Importance Markov chain produces an extended Markov chain where the marginal distribution of the first component converges to the target distribution. For example, when targeting a multimodal distribution, the instrumental distribution can be chosen as a tempered version of the target which allows the algorithm to explore its modes more efficiently. We obtain a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem as well as geometric ergodicity for this extended kernel under mild assumptions on the instrumental kernel. Computationally, the algorithm is easy to implement and preexisting librairies can be used to sample from the instrumental distribution.},

In order to apply the technique, we take the union of the SLE curve with two open boundary arcs, which share two boundary points other than the endpoints of the SLE curve. The Green’s function of interest is, for any z 0 z0 in the domain, the limit as r ↓ 0 r↓0 of the r − α r−α times the probability that { | z − z 0 | &lt; r } {|z−z0|&amp;lt;r} contains a cut point of the above union, where α = 3 8 κ − 1 α=38κ−1 . We prove the limit exists, obtain an exact formula up to a multiplicative constant , and derive a rate of convergence.},

The switch of the internal state , that can freely be interpreted as a molecular switch, is modelled as a Markov jump process that depends on the location of the motor. Rescaling space and time, the limit of the trajectory of the diffusion process homogenises over the periodic potential as well as over the internal degree of freedom. Around the homogenised limit, we prove the large deviation principle of trajectories with a method developed by Feng and Kurtz based on the analysis of an associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation with an Hamiltonian that here, as an innovative fact, depends on both position and momenta.},

This model is known to exhibit a wetting phase transition, from a localized phase (with trajectories pinned to the wall) to a delocalized phase (with unpinned trajectories). As a preamble, we take the opportunity to present an overview of the model, collecting and complementing well-known and other folklore results. Then, we investigate a version with elevated boundary conditions, which has been studied in various contexts both in the physics and the mathematics literature; it can alternatively be seen as a wetting model in a square well. We complement here existing results, focusing on the equilibrium properties of the model, for a general underlying random walk (in the domain of attraction of a stable law). First, we compute the free energy and give some properties of the phase diagram; interestingly, we find that, in addition to the wetting transition, a so-called saturation phase transition may occur. Then, in the so-called Cramér’s region, we find an exact asymptotic equivalent of the partition function, together with a (local) central limit theorem for the fluctuations of the left-most and right-most pinned points, jointly with the number of contacts at the bottom of the well.},

  abstract     = {To sample from a given target distribution , Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling relies on constructing an ergodic Markov chain with the target distribution as its invariant measure . For any MCMC method , an important question is how to evaluate its efficiency. One approach is to consider the associated empirical measure and how fast it converges to the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov process. Recently, this question has been considered from the perspective of large deviation theory, for different types of MCMC methods, including, e.g., non-reversible Metropolis–Hastings on a finite state space, non-reversible Langevin samplers, the zig-zag sampler, and parallel tempering. This approach, based on large deviations, has proven successful in analysing existing methods and designing new, efficient ones. However, for the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm on more general state spaces, the workhorse of MCMC sampling, the same techniques have not been available for analysing performance, as the underlying Markov chain dynamics violate the conditions used to prove existing large deviation results for empirical measures of a Markov chain. This also extends to methods built on the same idea as Metropolis–Hastings, such as the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Method or ABC-MCMC. In this paper, we take the first steps towards such a large-deviations based analysis of Metropolis–Hastings-like methods, by proving a large deviation principle for the empirical measures of Metropolis–Hastings chains. In addition, we also characterize the rate function and its properties in terms of the acceptance- and rejection-part of the Metropolis–Hastings dynamics.},

These processes are akin to a continuous-space version of the classical Eden growth model (but with local backtracking of the occupied area allowed when k k is finite), while being associated with a dual process encoding ancestry. In this article, we focus on the growth properties of the area occupied by individuals of type 1 (type 0 encoding units of empty space). To do so, we first define the quantities that we shall use to quantify the speed of growth of the occupied area. Using the associated dual process and a comparison with a first-passage percolation problem, we show that the growth of the occupied region in the infinite-parent SLFV is linear in time. Because of the possibility of local backtracking of the occupied area, the result we obtain for the k k -parent SLFV is slightly weaker. It gives an upper bound on the probability that a given location is occupied at time t t , which also shows that growth in the k k -parent SLFV is linear in time. We use numerical simulations to approximate the growth speed for the infinite-parent SLFV, and we observe that the actual speed may be higher than the speed expected from simple first-moment calculations due to the characteristic front dynamics.},

The classical theory of weak convergence of empirical processes is extended along these lines to that of the thus created randomly weighted empirical processes, via conditioning on the weights, when N , m N → ∞ N,mN→∞ so that m N = o ( N 2 ) mN=o(N2) .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce the long-range dependent completely correlated mixed fractional Brownian motion (ccmfBm). This is a process that is driven by a mixture of Brownian motion (Bm) and a long-range dependent completely correlated fractional Brownian motion (fBm, ccfBm) that is constructed from the Brownian motion via the Molchan–Golosov representation. Thus, there is a single Bm driving the mixed process. In the short time-scales the ccmfBm behaves like the Bm (it has Brownian Hölder index and quadratic variation). However, in the long time-scales it behaves like the fBm (it has long-range dependence governed by the fBms Hurst index). We provide a transfer principle for the ccmfBm and use it to construct the Cameron–Martin–Girsanov–Hitsuda theorem and prediction formulas. Finally, we illustrate the ccmfBm by simulations.},

This problem is motivated by an example from fintech where we look for the super-replication price of options on blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. We first state a dynamic programming principle for the value function of the stochastic target problem. Next, we show that the value function can be simplified into a novel function with the use of a finite-dimensional argument through a concept known as the branching property.

The AMP algorithms studied in this part are those where the measurement matrix has independent elements, up to the symmetry constraint when this matrix is symmetric, with a variance profile that can be sparse. The AMP problem is solved by adapting the approach of Bayati, Lelarge, and Montanari (2015) to this matrix model . The Lotka–Volterra (LV) model is the standard model for studying the dynamical behavior of large dimensional ecological food chains. The second part of this paper is focused on the study of the statistical distribution of the globally stable equilibrium vector of a LV system in the situation where the random symmetric interaction matrix among the living species is sparse, and in the regime of large dimensions. This equilibrium vector is the solution of a Linear Complementarity Problem , which distribution is shown to be characterized through the AMP approach developed in the first part. In the large dimensional regime, this distribution is close to a mixture of a large number of truncated Gaussians.},

Our proof uses a Doob h h -transform, for the transient process conditioned to return, and we show that the conditioned process is also of Lamperti type with appropriately transformed parameters. To do so, we obtain an asymptotic expansion for the ratio of two return probabilities, evaluated at two nearby starting points; a consequence of this is that the return probability for the transient Lamperti process is a regularly-varying function of the starting point.},

When the frequency window includes a number of eigenfunctions that grows linearly, the variance of the nodal length is linear with respect to the frequency, while it is logarithmic when a single eigenfunction is considered. Then, it is natural to conjecture that there exists a smooth transition with respect to the number of eigenfunctions in the frequency window; however, we show here that the asymptotic variance is logarithmic whenever this number grows sublinearly, so that the window “shrinks”. The result is achieved by exploiting the Christoffel–Darboux formula to establish the covariance function of the field and its first and second derivatives. This allows us to compute the two-point correlation function at high frequency and then to derive the asymptotic behaviour of the variance.},

This provides a fresh approach to an entropy first developed by Rassoul-Agha and Seppäläinen as a large deviation rate function of empirical measures along paths. In their 2014 paper, variational formulas are developed for the point-to-point/point-to-level Gibbs Free Energies as the convex conjugates of this entropy. We rework these formulas in our new framework and explicitly link our descriptions of grid entropy to theirs. We also improve on a known bound for this entropy by introducing a relative entropy term in the inequality. Furthermore, we show that the set of measures with finite grid entropy coincides with the deterministic set of limit points of empirical measures studied in a 2020 paper by Bates.

Finally, we establish a connection between the Liouville property of V V -harmonic maps and the recurrence property of Δ V ΔV -diffusion processes on manifolds. Our results are new even in the case V = ∇ f V=∇f for f ∈ C 2 ( M ) f∈C2(M) .},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on a system of sticky Brownian motions, also known as Howitt–Warren martingale problem, and correlated Brownian motions and shows that infinite-dimensional orthogonal polynomials intertwine the dynamics of infinitely many particles and their n n -particle evolution. The proof is based on two assumptions about the model: information about the reversible measures for the n n -particle dynamics and consistency. Additionally, explicit formulas for the polynomials are used, including a new explicit formula for infinite-dimensional Meixner polynomials, the orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Pascal process. As an application of the intertwining relations, new reversible measures for the infinite-particle dynamics are obtained.},

  abstract     = {We consider the task of filtering a dynamic parameter evolving as a diffusion process , given data collected at discrete times from a likelihood which is conjugate to the reversible law of the diffusion, when a generic dual process on a discrete state space is available. Recently, it was shown that duality with respect to a death-like process implies that the filtering distributions are finite mixtures, making exact filtering and smoothing feasible through recursive algorithms with polynomial complexity in the number of observations. Here we provide general results for the case where the dual is a regular jump continuous-time Markov chain on a discrete state space, which typically leads to filtering distribution given by countable mixtures indexed by the dual process state space. We investigate the performance of several approximation strategies on two hidden Markov models driven by Cox–Ingersoll–Ross and Wright–Fisher diffusions, which admit duals of birth-and-death type, and compare them with the available exact strategies based on death-type duals and with bootstrap particle filtering on the diffusion state space as a general benchmark.},

This allows some extensions to the recurrent case of the ballistic “environment’s method” dating back to Kozlov and Molchanov (1984).

More specifically, singular kernels yield rough affine processes. This paper extends the theory by considering affine stochastic Volterra equations with jumps. This extension is not straightforward because the jump structure and possible singularities of the kernel may induce explosions of the trajectories. This study also provides exponential affine formulas for the conditional Fourier–Laplace transform of marked Hawkes processes.},

Repeatedly, the individual whose opinion is furthest from the centre of mass of the N N current opinions chooses a new opinion, sampled uniformly at random from B B . Kennerberg and Volkov showed that the set of opinions that are not furthest from the centre of mass converges to a random limit point. We show that the distribution of the limit opinion is absolutely continuous, thus proving the conjecture made after Proposition 3.2 in Grinfeld et al.},

By sparse we intend to mean that the number of measurements per path can be arbitrary (as small as two), and can remain constant with respect to n n . We focus on time-inhomogeneous SDE of the form d X ( t ) = μ ( t ) X ( t ) α d t + σ ( t ) X ( t ) β d B ( t ) dX(t)=μ(t)X(t)αdt+σ(t)X(t)βdB(t) , where α ∈ { 0 , 1 } α∈{0,1} and β ∈ { 0 , 1 / 2 , 1 } β∈{0,1/2,1} , which includes prominent examples such as Brownian motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, geometric Brownian motion and Brownian bridge . Our estimators are constructed by relating the local (drift/diffusion) parameters of the SDE to its global parameters (mean/covariance, and their derivatives) by means of an apparently novel Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This allows us to use methods inspired by functional data analysis, and pool information across the sparsely measured paths. The methodology we develop is fully non-parametric and avoids any functional form specification on the time-dependency of either the drift function or the diffusion function. We establish almost sure uniform asymptotic convergence rates of the proposed estimators as the number of observed paths n n grows to infinity. Our rates are non-asymptotic in the number of measurements per path, explicitly reflecting how different sampling frequency might affect the speed of convergence . Our framework suggests possible further fruitful interactions between FDA and SDE methods in problems with replication.},

In particular, with the right drift, Brownian motion can be used to reconstruct any scenery. To this end, we prove an injectivity property of an infinite Vandermonde matrix .},

We show that the densities are space–time bounded on [ t 1 , ∞ ) × [ x 1 , ∞ ) [t1,∞)×[x1,∞) for each t 1 &gt; 0 t1&amp;gt;0 and x 1 &gt; 0 x1&amp;gt;0 , and the supremum of the densities with respect to space variable tends to zero as time goes to infinity.

  abstract     = {We introduce a class of one-dimensional positive Markov processes generalizing continuous-state branching processes (CBs), by taking into account a phenomenon of random collisions. Besides branching, characterized by a general mechanism Ψ Ψ , at a constant rate in time two particles are sampled uniformly in the population, collide and leave a mass of particles governed by a (sub)critical mechanism Σ Σ . Such CB processes with collisions (CBCs) are shown to be the only Feller processes without negative jumps satisfying a Laplace duality relationship with one-dimensional diffusions on the half-line. This generalizes the duality observed for logistic CBs in Foucart (2019). Via time-change, CBCs are also related to an auxiliary class of Markov processes, called CB processes with spectrally positive migration (CBMs), recently introduced in Vidmar (2022). We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundaries 0 or ∞ ∞ to be attracting and for a limiting distribution to exist. The Laplace transform of the latter is provided. Under the assumption that the CBC process does not explode, the Laplace transforms of the first passage times below arbitrary levels are represented with the help of the solution of a second-order differential equation, whose coefficients express in terms of the Lévy–Khintchine functions Σ Σ and Ψ Ψ . Sufficient conditions for non-explosion are given.},

An example is Walsh’s Brownian spider where the process on each edge behaves as a Brownian motion. In this paper we calculate firstly the density of the resolvent kernel in terms of the characteristics of the underlying diffusion. Excessive functions are studied via the Martin boundary theory. A crucial result is an expression for the representing measure of a given excessive function. These results are used to solve optimal stopping problems for diffusion spiders.},

  abstract     = {We provide a deep connection between elastic drifted Brownian motions and inverses to tempered subordinators. Based on this connection, we establish a link between multiplicative functionals and dynamical boundary conditions given in terms of non-local equations in time. Indeed, we show that the multiplicative functional associated to the elastic Brownian motion with drift is equivalent to a functional associated with non-local boundary conditions of tempered type. By exploiting such connections we write some functionals of the drifted Brownian motion in terms of a simple (positive and non-decreasing) process, the inverse of a tempered subordinator. In our view, such a representation is useful in many applications and brings new light on dynamic boundary value problems .},
