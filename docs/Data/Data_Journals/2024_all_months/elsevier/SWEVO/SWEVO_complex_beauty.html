  abstract     = {Metaheuristics have been the dominant approach for tackling complex optimization challenges across diverse disciplines. Numerous studies have sought to enhance the performance of existing metaheuristics by identifying their limitations and modifying their frameworks. Despite these efforts, many resulting strategies remain overly complex, often narrowly focused on a single algorithm and a specific problem domain. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive optimization scheme (AOS) designed as an algorithm-independent mechanism for enhancing the performance of metaheuristics by addressing various optimization challenges. This scheme is developed through a comprehensive integration of three substructures, each aimed at mitigating common deficiencies in metaheuristics across three optimization pillars: high exploration capabilities, effective avoidance of local optima, and strong exploitation capabilities. Three prominent approaches—Lévy Flights, Chaotic Local Search, and Opposition-based Learning—are skillfully combined to overcome these shortcomings in various metaheuristic algorithms, establishing a straightforward unit. Through rigorous testing on 50 diverse mathematical benchmark functions, we assessed the performance of original metaheuristics and their AOS-upgraded versions. The results confirm that the proposed AOS consistently elevates algorithmic effectiveness across multiple optimization metrics. Notably, four AOS-upgraded algorithms—EO-AOS, HBA-AOS, DBO-AOS, and PSO-AOS—emerge as the leading performers among the 16 algorithms under evaluation. Comparisons between the upgraded and baseline metaheuristics further reveal the substantial impact of AOS, as each upgraded variant demonstrably surpasses its original algorithm in various optimization capabilities.},

  abstract     = {This paper delves into solving the two-stage non-linear fixed-charge transportation problem (two-stage NFCTP), where each arc is associated with fixed and variable costs that increase proportionally to the square of the units transported. The presence of fixed charges and non-linear components categorizes this problem as N P − hard, leading to computational challenges, inefficiencies, and the risk of local optima. To address these challenges, a feasibility restoration particle swarm optimizer with chaotic maps (CEPSO) is presented. The proposed algorithm introduces (i) non-linear adaptive inertia weight and acceleration coefficients to maintain better exploration and exploitation rates during the search. (ii) Ten chaotic maps are integrated into the acceleration coefficients to enhance optimization capabilities further. (iii) Feasibility restoration mechanisms, including constraint compliance adjustment and ratio adjustment procedures, are incorporated to ensure the feasibility of solutions generated by CEPSO. The algorithm’s performance is evaluated across small and large-scale NFCTPs, ranging from 35 to 1044 dimensions, and compared to existing PSO variants using various evaluation metrics. Experimental analyses demonstrate CEPSO’s superior optimization performance for two-stage NFCTPs, positioning it as an advanced framework in this domain and contributing to the novelty of this study.

  abstract     = {This investigation holds significant pragmatic implications for endeavors aimed at curbing energy losses stemming from diverse factors. A neural network propelled by artificial intelligence, employing the Levenberg-Marquardt technique (ANN-LMM) has been devised for integrating ternary hybrid nanoparticles into a partially ionized hyperbolic tangent liquid flowing over an extended melting surface (PIHTL-SMS). The substance motion equivalence is delineated, considering the rotational outcome. The heat energy is formulated by amalgamating viscous intemperance and Joule heat contributions. To streamline complexity, the resulting PDEs are transmuted into a series of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through resemblance transformations. A reference dataset for ANN-LMM is produced encompassing diverse significant model permutations and pretending situations utilizing the Lobatto III-A statistical technique. This reference data undergoes verification, evaluation and training procedures to refine the estimated explanation towards achieving anticipated outcomes. The precision, constancy, capability and resilience of ANN-LMM are substantiated concluded mean squared error (MSE)-based fitness curves, error histograms, regression plots and absolute error evaluations. A relative examination elucidates the correctness of the suggested solver, exhibiting entire errors within the array of 10 -10 to 10 -06 for all significant constraints. Resulting differential equations are also solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach. In PSO several parameters are optimized to enhance the performance of the algorithm. Optimizing these parameters help to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the PSO algorithm for given problem. PSO converges quickly to optimal or near-optimal solutions, making it efficient for problems with large domain. Several pivotal graphs are constructed to illustrate the impact of emergent constraints on fluid temperature and velocity profiles. The outcomes underscore the numerical technique as a potent instrument for tackling the intricate conjoined ODEs system prevalent in fluid mechanism and allied intemperance presentations in technology. Additionally, improvements in the Forchheimer constraint and the Weissenberg number are deemed imperative for regulating fluid velocity. Unlike prior research that mostly concentrated on single or binary nanofluids, this work presents the integration of ternary hybrid nanoparticles into a partly ionized hyperbolic tangent liquid, a unique technique. Improved accuracy and processing efficiency are also provided by using an ANN-LMM neural network to solve the complicated transformed ODEs. Comparison of ANN, PSO results and existing results are done which shows validity of the current analysis. This work is unique in that it offers a deeper understanding of fluid behavior at advanced thermal settings by including emergent restrictions, viscous dissipation, and Joule heating.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on addressing a multi-objective Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Automated Guided Vehicles (FJSP-AGVs) and variable processing speed constraints. First, a position-based mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is proposed to optimize simultaneously the maximum completion time and the total energy consumption. Then, we decompose FJSP-AGVs into four interrelated subproblems and design a Multi-Population Coevolutionary Algorithm (MCEA) to solve them. In MCEA, (1) The effective encoding and decoding methods are used to accurately reflect the characteristics of the problem, and generate feasible scheduling solutions. (2) A multi-rule-based heuristic is proposed to enrich the diversity of four populations. (3) A disjunctive graph is constructed to depict and obtain the critical path(s). On this basis, (4) two cooperative evolution strategies based on critical paths are proposed to facilitate collaborative evolution between different populations and improve the global search capability of the algorithm. Furthermore, (5) a consumption reduction strategy is proposed by reducing the processing speed of operations on non-critical paths while ensuring that it does not affect the makespan. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of MCEA by GD, and IGD, and set coverage metrics on the four typical benchmark datasets. Based on the average GD (IGD) metric across 65 instances, MCEA shows reductions of 77.63% (93.60%), 95.30% (97.27%), and 96.17%(97.89%) relative to EHA, EMOEA, and mop-BRKGA, respectively. The set coverage metric, MCEA outperforms EHA, EMOEA, and mop-BRKGA in 59, 64, and 64 instances, respectively. These results clearly indicate that MCEA can solve the FJSP-AGVs with variable processing speed constraints.},

In this paper, the many-objective energy-efficient distributed heterogeneous hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with lot-streaming (DHHFSPLS) is investigated, where the number of sublots is variable. To settle this challenging issue, a mathematical model is established, and a knowledge-driven many-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (KDMaOEA) is proposed for minimizing makespan, total earliness, total tardiness and total energy consumption. In the KDMaOEA, a knowledge-driven multiple populations collaborative search strategy is devised to strengthen exploitation capabilities. Specifically, the population is divided into five subpopulations, where four superior subpopulations are employed to facilitate the optimization of each objective and one inferior subpopulation learns from four superior subpopulations to effectively utilize the optimization knowledge. Furthermore, an adaptive switching-based environmental selection strategy is fulfilled to guarantee the distribution and convergence of the solution set. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are undertaken to verify the effectiveness of the KDMaOEA in solving the many-objective energy-efficient DHHFSPLS.},

The novelty computation mechanism quantifies the novelty of each policy based on its dissimilarity to the population and historical data, promoting exploration and diversity. The adaptive novelty-fitness selection strategy balances exploration and exploitation by considering policies&#39; novelty and fitness during selection. The imitation-guided experience fusion mechanism incorporates expert knowledge and demonstrations into the learning process, accelerating the discovery of effective solutions. The adaptive stability preservation module ensures the stability and reliability of the learning process by dynamically adjusting the algorithm&#39;s hyperparameters and preserving elite policies across generations. These components work together to enhance the exploration, diversity, and stability of the learning process. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize medical data analysis, leading to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments.

However, the correlation and negative transfer problems between tasks are the main challenges faced by multi-task optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a new multi-task optimization algorithm, named Multifactorial Whale Optimization Algorithm (MFWOA). MFWOA uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) as a search mechanism and designs an adaptive knowledge transfer strategy to effectively exploit the correlation between tasks. This strategy includes two ways: one is to exchange search experience by adding distance terms from other tasks; the other is to generate new random individuals or optimal individuals through crossover and mutation operations and use them to guide position updates. By combining these two methods, MFWOA can explore a wider area. In addition, in order to better balance the useful information transfer between and within tasks, MFWOA also designs a random mating probability parameter adaptive strategy. Experimental results show that MFWOA can achieve effective and efficient knowledge transfer, and outperforms other multi-task optimization algorithms in terms of convergence speed and accuracy. It is a promising multi-task optimization algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignant tumors and the fourth largest malignant tumor endangering the life and health of women worldwide. The lesion areas of cervical cancer usually show complexity and diversity. To distinguish different cervical lesion sites and assist doctors in diagnosis and decision-making, this paper first proposes a multi-strategy integrated particle swarm optimization algorithm (GSRPSO, for short). The four strategies in GSRPSO work together to improve its optimization capabilities. Among them, the dynamic parameters balance the exploration and exploitation phases. The gaining sharing strategy and the random position updating strategy accelerate the convergence process while enhancing the diversity of the population. The vertical crossover mutation strategy improves local exploitation and avoids premature stagnation of the algorithm. The optimization performance of GSRPSO is validated by comparison experiments with 15 state-of-the-art algorithms on the CEC2020 test set. In addition, we established a MIS method based on the GSRPSO algorithm by combining the non-local mean algorithm and 2D Kapur entropy. This method is compared with the MIS methods combining 2D Renyi entropy, 2D Tsallis entropy, and 2D Masi entropy in a comparison experiment with four sets of thresholds on six BSDS500 images. The experimental results show that this MIS method exhibits obvious advantages in segmentation quality and stability. Finally, nine cervical cancer images are segmented using the GSRPSO-based MIS method, and experiments are conducted with nine excellent optimization algorithms under six different sets of thresholds. The experimental results show that this MIS method demonstrates better segmentation quality and accuracy than similar methods with the optimal evaluation indexes PSNR=28.3645, SSIM=0.8996, FSIM=0.9494, AD=8.1939, and NAE=0.0710.

Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) algorithms can improve the overall performance of multiple multiobjective optimization tasks through transferring knowledge among tasks. Negative transfer resulting from the indeterminacy of the transferred knowledge may bring about the degradation of the algorithm performance. Identifying the valuable knowledge to transfer by learning the historical samples is a feasible way to reduce negative transfer. Taking this into account, this paper proposes a budget online learning based EMT algorithm for MO-MTO problems. Specifically, by regarding the historical transferred solutions as samples, a classifier would be trained to identified the valuable knowledge. The solutions which are considered containing valuable knowledge will have more opportunity to be transfer. For the samples arrive in the form of streaming data, the classifier would be updated in a budget online learning way during the evolution process to address the concept drift problem. Furthermore, the exceptional case that the classifier fails to identify the valuable knowledge is considered. Experimental results on two MO-MTO test suits show that the proposed algorithm achieves highly competitive performance compared with several traditional and state-of-the-art EMT methods.},

  abstract     = {When tackling large-scale multi-objective problems (LSMOPs), the computational budget could be wasted by traditional offspring generators that explore the search space in a nearly directionless manner, impairing the efficiency of many existing algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel two-level large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called LMOEA-LGCS that incorporates neural network (NN) learning-guided cross-sampling for offspring generation in the first level and a layered competitive swarm optimizer in the second level. Specifically, in the first level, two NNs are trained online to learn promising vertical and horizontal search directions, respectively, against the Pareto Set, and then a batch of candidate solutions are sampled on the learned directions. The merit of learning two explicit search directions is to devote the employed NNs to concentrating on separate or even conflicting targets, i.e., the convergence and diversity of the population, thus achieving a good trade-off between them. In this way, the algorithm can thus explore adaptively towards more promising search directions that have the potential to facilitate the convergence of the population while maintaining a good diversity. In the second level, the layered competitive swarm optimizer is employed to perform a deeper optimization of the solutions generated in the first level across the entire search space to increase their diversity further. Comparisons with six state-of-the-art algorithms on three LSMOP benchmarks, i.e., the LSMOP, UF, and IMF, with 2-12 objectives and 500-8000 decision variables, and the real-world problem TREE demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In human-centred manufacturing, deploying collaborative robots (cobots) is recognized as a promising strategy to enhance the inclusiveness and resilience of production systems. Despite notable progress, current production scheduling methods for human-robot collaboration (HRC) still fail to adequately accommodate workforce heterogeneity, significantly reducing their adoption and implementation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for the Assembly Line Worker Integration and Balancing Problem considering Multi-skilled Human-Robot Collaboration (ALWIBP-mHRC). This model aims to optimize task scheduling between semi-skilled workers and cobots, aiming to maximize productivity and minimize costs. It features a multi-skilled human-robot collaboration (mHRC) task assignment scheme that selects the optimal assembly/collaboration mode from seven scenarios, based on specific task requirements and resource-skill availability, thus maximizing resource-skill complementarity. To tackle the complexities of this problem, we propose an adaptive multi-objective cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (a-MOCC) that incorporates a sub-problem decomposition and decoding framework tailored for ALWIBP-mHRC, enhanced by an adaptive evolutionary strategy based on Q-learning (Q-Coevolution). Experimental tests demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other established metaheuristic algorithms across various instance sizes, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing the productivity of production systems for semi-skilled workers. The findings are significant for investment decision-making and resource planning, as they highlight the strategic value of integrating cobots in large-scale heterogeneous workforce production. This work underscores the potential of cobots to mitigate skill gaps in assembly systems, laying the groundwork for future research and industrial strategies focused on enhancing productivity, inclusivity, and adaptability in a dynamically changing labour market.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a crucial data preprocessing technique that effectively reduces the dataset size and enhances the performance of machine learning models. Evolutionary computation (EC) based feature selection has become one of the most important parts of feature selection methods. However, the performance of existing EC methods significantly decrease when dealing with datasets with thousands of dimensions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method called importance-guided particle swarm optimization based on MLP (IGPSO) for feature selection. IGPSO utilizes a two stage trained neural network to learn a feature importance vector, which is then used as a guiding factor for population initialization and evolution. In the two stage of learning, the positive samples are used to learn the importance of useful features while the negative samples are used to identify the invalid features. Then the importance vector is generated combining the two category information. Finally, it is used to replace the acceleration factors and inertia weight in original binary PSO, which makes the individual acceleration factor and social acceleration factor are positively correlated with the importance values, while the inertia weight is negatively correlated with the importance value. Further more, IGPSO uses the flip probability to update the individuals. Experimental results on 24 datasets demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, IGPSO can significantly reduce the number of features while maintaining satisfactory classification accuracy, thus achieving high-quality feature selection effects. In particular, compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, there is an average reduction of 0.1 in the fitness value and an average increase of 6.7% in classification accuracy on large-scale datasets.},

Although evolutionary reinforcement learning partially addresses this issue, it fails to consider the real-time status of the agent, resulting in inflexible policy updating modes that can negatively affect algorithm performance. To address this issue, we propose an evolutionary reinforcement learning based on non-cooperative games that leverages the benefits of various algorithms in cooperative and non-cooperative settings. Firstly, a competition framework is established between the evolutionary algorithm and reinforcement learning using a non-cooperative game. The policy updating mode is dynamically selected based on the game’s outcome, ensuring diverse algorithms through differentiated population evolution guided by Nash equilibrium. Secondly, the evolutionary algorithm collaborates with the non-cooperative game to establish a cooperative framework that balances exploration and convergence. Since the exploration of the evolutionary algorithm does not rely on the environment, it is used to guide the non-cooperative game, which helps the algorithm successfully overcome the local optimum. This synergy significantly enhances algorithm performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms individual algorithms.},

However, ontology heterogeneity obstructs the communications among different ontologies, which is a key hindrance in realizing Semantic Web. To leverage different ontologies, it is important to match ontologies by identifying their semantically related entities. Given the vast number of entities and rich vocabulary semantics, this task presents considerable challenges. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Compact Linear Genetic Programming with Surrogate-Assisted Local Search (CLGP-SALS). First, a compact multi-program encoding mechanism is developed to reduce the computational cost while ensuring the reusability of building blocks in Linear Genetic Programming. Moreover, it coordinates multiple programs within one solution to improve the quality of ontology alignment. Second, to enhance convergence speed, a new Surrogate-Assisted Local Search is designed, incorporating semantic distance and fitness discrepancies for a focused local search process. The surrogate model presents a superior approach for approximating the fitness of individuals, thereby improving search efficiency in the ontology matching task. Experimental results demonstrate that CLGP-SALS outperforms the state-of-the-art ontology matching methods on the ontology alignment evaluation initiative’s benchmark. The results show that our method can efficiently determine high-quality ontology alignments, and its performance outperforms the compared methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

Group and transportation activities are two important aspects of OSSPs that still need attention. This work considers an OSSP with group and transportation operations to minimize maximum completion time by solving three key sub-problems: job assignment among groups, job sequence in groups and group sequence on machines. Firstly, an integer programming model is formulized to define the problem. Secondly, a learning-driven hyper-heuristic algorithm is developed by incorporating a Q-learning method and four meta-heuristics, i.e., genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony optimization, variable neighborhood search method and Jaya algorithm. The Q-learning method is devised to select the most promising meta-heuristic for performing at each iteration. Three neighborhood structures are designed by integrating critical machines and critical paths. Finally, the developed model is verified by an exact solver CPLEX, and the comparison results exhibit that CPLEX is effective for instances with ten jobs. For the instances with more than ten jobs, the developed algorithm wins CPLEX in terms of computation accuracy and efficiency, signifying its excellent performance in finding better solutions. Furthermore, four meta-heuristics mentioned above and three state-of-the-art meta-heuristics are employed for comparisons in solving a set of benchmark test instances.

  abstract     = {Real-time insulator leakage current classification is crucial in preventing the pollution flashover phenomenon and providing appropriate maintenance schedules in high-voltage transmission towers. However, current methodologies only utilize traditional artificial neural networks, which have limitations when performing big data analysis. This research developed a novel cloud 15kV-HDPE insulator leakage current classified framework, utilizing a long short-term memory convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN). The hybrid model structure is optimized through hyperparameter fine-tuning based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO), which reduces human effort and considerable time compared with PSO and random search (RS) techniques. The IPSO-LSTM-CNN model can productively identify correlations between selected weather features and target leakage current levels of 15kV-HDPE insulators. LSTM efficiently captures long-term patterns in sequential data, while CNN layers competently extract high-level dependency in time-invariant information. Four 15kV-HDPE insulators’ datasets, collected in high-voltage transmission lines in the coastal area of Taiwan for more than one year, are deployed for analyzing and comparing classified performance. Other conventional models are developed to evaluate and compare classified performance with the proposed IPSO-LSTM-CNN approach, which acquires the most significant enhancement of 48.08 % loss, 45.91 % validating loss, 52.57 % MAE, 35.47 % validating MAE, 47.34 % MSE, 27.02 % validating MSE, 9.15 % PRE, 3.40 % validating PRE, 4.76 % REC, and 6.17 % validating REC.

  abstract     = {In reality, there are many extremely complex nonlinear optimization problems. How to locate the roots of nonlinear equation systems (NESs) more accurately and efficiently has always been a major numerical challenge. Although there are many excellent algorithms to solve NESs, which are all limited by the fact that the algorithm can solve at most one NES in a single run. Therefore, this paper proposes a historical knowledge transfer driven self-adaptive evolutionary multitasking algorithm framework (EMSaRNES) with hybrid resource release to solve NESs. Its core is that in one run, EMSaRNES can efficiently and accurately locate the roots of multiple NESs. In EMSaRNES, self-adaptive parameter method is proposed to dynamically adjust parameters of the algorithm. Secondly, adaptive selection mutation mechanism with historical knowledge transfer is designed, which dynamically adjusts the evolution of populations with or without knowledge sharing according to changes in the current population diversity, thereby balancing population diversity and convergence. Finally, hybrid resource release strategy is developed, which archives the roots that meet the accuracy requirements, and then three distributions are selected to generate new populations, thus ensuring that the population diversity is maintained at high level. After a variety of experiments, it has been proven that compared to comparative algorithms EMSaRNES has superior performance on 30 general NESs test sets. In addition, the results on 18 extremely complex NESs test sets and two real-life application problems further prove that EMSaRNES finds more roots in the face of complex problems and real-life problems.},

This paper examines a distributed heterogeneous flexible job shop scheduling problem (DHFJSP) with varying processing times. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model of the DHFJSP is formulated with the objective of minimizing the makespan. To solve the DHFJSP, we propose a deep Q network-aided automatic design of a variable neighborhood search algorithm (DQN-VNS). By analyzing schedules, sixty-one types of scheduling features are extracted. These features, along with six shaking strategies, are used as states and actions. A DHFJSP environment simulator is developed to train the deep Q network. The well-trained DQN then generates the shaking procedure for VNS. Additionally, a greedy initialization method is proposed to enhance the quality of the initial solution. Seven efficient critical path-based neighborhood structures with three-vector encoding scheme are introduced to improve local search. Numerical experiments on various scales of instances validate the effectiveness of the MILP model and the DQN-VNS algorithm. The results show that the DQN-VNS algorithm achieves an average relative percentage deviation (ARPD) of 3.2%, which represents an approximately 88.45% reduction compared to the best-performing algorithm among the six compared, with an ARPD of 27.7%. This significant reduction in ARPD highlights the superior stability and performance of the proposed DQN-VNS algorithm.},

To address this issue, this paper introduces an evolutionary algorithm based on population hierarchy to address LMaOPs. The algorithm employs different strategies for offspring generation at various population levels. Initially, the population is categorized into three levels by fitness value: poorly performing solutions with higher fitness ( P h ), better solutions with lower fitness ( P l ), and excellent individuals stored in the archive set ( P a ). Subsequently, a hierarchical knowledge integration strategy (HKI) guides the evolution of individuals at different levels. Individuals in P l generate offspring by integrating differential knowledge from P a and P h , while individuals in P h generate offspring by learning prior knowledge from P a . Finally, using a cluster-based environment selection strategy balances population diversity and convergence. Extensive experiments on LMaOPs with up to 10 objectives and 5000 decision variables validate the algorithm’s effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing is increasingly attracting workflow applications, where workflows need to satisfy execution deadlines and energy consumption is to be minimized. So far, numerous studies have adopted evolutionary algorithms to optimize the energy consumption of workflow execution. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been widely employed to save energy on computing devices running workflow tasks. However, most existing evolutionary algorithms focus on evolving task execution order or mapping from tasks to resources, while neglecting the evolution of task runtime to leverage the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technology for further energy saving. To compensate for that deficiency, this paper designs a tri-chromosome-based evolutionary algorithm, namely TCEA, to evolve three types of decision vectors (i.e., task order, task and resource mapping, and task runtime) simultaneously using three problem-specific mechanisms. Firstly, we construct a search space by using the tasks’ minimum and optimal runtime, and propose a solution representation mechanism to simplify the decision vector for task runtime between 0 and 1. Secondly, we design a deadline constraint handling mechanism to distribute those durations exceeding the deadline to each task based on their extension of the minimum runtime. Thirdly, we exploit the workflow structure to cluster decision variables without direct constraints into the same group. During each iteration, only the order of tasks within a group evolves to avoid precedence constraints, thus performing searches within the feasible space. At last, we conduct comparison experiments on five types of real-world workflows with 30 to 1000 tasks. The energy consumed by TCEA is much less than those consumed by the state-of-the-art workflow scheduling algorithms, demonstrating the superior performance of TCEA in energy saving.},

  abstract     = {Energy-aware scheduling has emerged as a well-defined research topic for achieving sustainable development. However, unexpected disruptions in workshop pose several challenges to the manufacturing process, causing the original schedules to become non-optimal or even infeasible, resulting in significant energy waste. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate the robust scheduling problem with energy-awareness. The energy-efficient robust flexible job shop scheduling problem (ERFJSP) aims to simultaneously optimize scheduling efficiency, total energy consumption, and robustness. A two-stage mixed-integer linear programming model considering machine breakdown and job insertion is formulated in this paper for the first time. To solve this problem, a double Q-learning (DQL)-assisted competitive evolutionary algorithm (DQCEA) is proposed. In DQCEA, a heuristic initialization strategy is first designed, which allows it to obtain high-quality and diverse solutions. Subsequently, a multi-objective competitive mechanism is proposed to classify search individuals into inferiors and superiors. Moreover, an inferior-pushing and superior-pulling-based crossover is designed for inferior members, facilitating knowledge transfer within the population and enhancing global diversification capability. Meanwhile, a hyper-mutation operator is devised for superior members, which incorporates eight search strategies to improve local intensification ability. Furthermore, DQL is employed to learn and recommend the most suitable strategy for each superior individual. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the correctness of the formulated MILP model and the performance of DQCEA. Experimental analysis confirms that DQCEA effectively provides promising schedules under different scenarios, demonstrating its reliability in addressing unexpected disruption challenges.},

  abstract     = {Interval many-objective optimization problems (IMaOPs) involve more than three conflicting objectives with interval parameters. Various real-world applications under uncertainty can be modeled as IMaOPs to solve, so effectively handling IMaOPs is crucial for solving practical problems. This paper proposes an adaptive interval many-objective evolutionary algorithm with information entropy dominance (IMEA-IED) to tackle IMaOPs. Firstly, an interval dominance method based on information entropy is proposed to adaptively compare intervals. This method constructs convergence entropy and uncertainty entropy related to interval features and innovatively introduces the idea of using global information to regulate the direction of local interval comparison. Corresponding interval confidence levels are designed for different directions. Additionally, a novel niche strategy is designed through interval population partitioning. This strategy introduces a crowding distance increment for improved subpopulation comparison and employs an updated reference vector method to adjust the search regions for empty subpopulations. The IMEA-IED is compared with seven interval optimization algorithms on 60 interval test problems and a practical application. Empirical results affirm the superior performance of our proposed algorithm in tackling IMaOPs.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzing has become the focus of research in the field of software testing due to its advantages such as simple testing process, easy deployment, and easy reproduction of crashes. However, fuzzing also suffers from the disadvantages of poor test purpose and invalid generated seeds. To solve the above problems, researchers proposed the Memory Usage Guided Fuzzing (MUGF). To further optimize the performance of MUGF, this paper proposes a fuzzing method named Memory Usage Guided Fuzzing based on Particle Swarm Optimization (MUGF-PSO). MUGF-PSO will guide the selection of mutation operators for subsequent testing by learning the effectiveness of each mutation operators during previous testing. Specifically, MUGF-PSO regards each mutation operator as a particle in the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the coverage change is regarded as an important factor to evaluate the seed’s local and global best position. In addition, the efficient selection probability distribution of mutation operator is constantly iteratively searched to make the MUGF tends to select the mutation operator that is more able to trigger new coverage. Furthermore, the MUGF-PSO is integrated into MemLock developed by MUGF, that is, MemLock-PSO is developed. We conduct a comparison experiment with 5 fuzzers (including AFL, MemLock, EcoFuzz, HavocMAB and Darwin), and the results show that MemLock-PSO is able to find more paths and crashes in 12 widely used program with different functions from 10 tools, with a significant gap of around 12 h. Meanwhile, the MemLock-PSO have a significant difference in the number of paths and crashes compared to other fuzzers with a good stability. Our work also proves the remarkable significance of applying swarm intelligence optimization algorithms in fuzzing in order to solve the problem of selection of mutation operators.},

In order to effectively balance the three indicators, from the aspects of the handling of infeasible solution and the quality of individuals, a multi-population co-evolutionary competitive particle swarm optimization algorithm hybridized with infeasible solution transfer and an adaptive technique (ACCPSO) is proposed. Firstly, the information of feasible and infeasible individuals is fully utilized and the individuals are classified by Hamming distance. Then, a novel constraint handling technique based on learning from the promising feasible direction is designed to make individuals cross large infeasible regions and explore more potential feasible regions. Moreover, aiming to provide robust search capability and consequently further generate high-quality solutions, the genetic operators and the particle swarm optimization operator with the competitive mechanism are introduced as operators with an adaptive mechanism. Finally, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified on LIR-CMOP, MW and DTLZ, as well as two real-world problems. The results indicate that ACCPSO exhibits stronger competitiveness in terms of convergence, the solution quality, and distribution diversity on the feasible Pareto front.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is very popular for solving low-dimensional expensive optimization problems. Extending Bayesian optimization to high dimension is a meaningful but challenging task. One of the major challenges is that it is difficult to find good infill solutions as the acquisition functions are also high-dimensional. In this work, we propose the expected coordinate improvement (ECI) criterion for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. The proposed ECI criterion measures the potential improvement we can get by moving the current best solution along one coordinate. The proposed approach selects the coordinate with the highest ECI value to refine in each iteration and covers all the coordinates gradually by iterating over the coordinates. The greatest advantage of the proposed ECI-BO (expected coordinate improvement based Bayesian optimization) algorithm over the standard BO algorithm is that the infill selection problem of the proposed algorithm is always a one-dimensional problem thus can be easily solved. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better results than the standard BO algorithm and competitive results when compared with five high-dimensional BOs and six surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms. This work provides a simple but efficient approach for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization. A Matlab implementation of our ECI-BO is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Expected_Coordinate_Improvement .},

The challenge lies in efficiently identifying equivalent CPSs while maintaining a balance among convergence, diversity, and constraints. Addressing this challenge, we propose a dynamic-ranking-based constraint handling technique implemented in a co-evolutionary algorithm, named DRCEA, specifically designed for solving CMMOPs. To search for equivalent CPSs, we introduce a co-evolutionary framework involving two populations: a convergence-first population and a constraint-first population. The co-evolutionary framework facilitates knowledge transfer and sustains diverse solutions. Subsequently, a dynamic ranking strategy is employed with dynamic weight parameters that consider both dominance and constraint relationships among individuals. Within the convergence-first population, the weight parameter for convergence gradually decreases, while the constraint parameter increases. Conversely, in the constraint-first population, the weight parameter for constraints gradually decreases, while the convergence parameter increases. This approach ensures a well-balanced consideration of convergence and constraints within the two distinct populations. Experimental results on the CMMOP test suite and the real-world CMMOP test scenario validate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic-ranking-based constraint handling technique, demonstrating the superiority of DRCEA over seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is a key data pre-processing method in machine learning tasks. It aims to obtain better classification accuracy of an algorithm with the smallest size of selected feature subset. Particle Swarm Optimization has been widely applied in FS tasks. However, when solving FS task on high-dimensional datasets, most of the PSO-based FS methods are easy to get premature convergence and fall into the local optimum. To address this issue, a leader-adaptive particle swarm optimization with dimensionality reduction strategy (LAPSO-DR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a hybrid initialization strategy based on feature importance is formulated. The population is divided into two parts, which have different initialization ranges. It can not only improve the diversity of the population but also eliminate some redundant features. Secondly, the leader-adaptive strategy is proposed to improve the exploitation ability of the population, in which each particle can have a different learning exemplar selected from the elite sub-swarm. Finally, the dimensionality reduction strategy based on Markov blanket is introduced to reduce the size of the optimal feature subset. LAPSO-DR is compared with 8 representative FS methods on 18 benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that LAPSO-DR can obtain smaller sizes of feature subsets with highest classification accuracies on 17 out of 18 datasets. The classification accuracies of LAPSO-DR are over 90% on 14 datasets and the feature elimination rates are higher than 60% on 18 datasets.},

These problems are referred to as constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). Many meta-heuristics for solving CMOPs, called constrained multi-objective meta-heuristics (CMOMHs) have been introduced in the literature, including those using particle swarm optimization (PSO)(Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995), genetic algorithms (GAs)(Man et al., 1996), and differential evolution (DE)(Storn and Price, 1997). CMOMHs can be grouped into four different classes: classic CMOMHs, co-evolutionary approaches, multi-stage approaches, and multi-tasking approaches. An extensive comparative study of twenty different CMOMHs on a wide variety of test problems, including real-world CMOPs in the fields of science and engineering, is conducted. A multi-swarm PSO approach called constrained multi-guide particle swarm optimization (ConMGPSO) is introduced and compared to the best-performing previous approaches according to the comparative study. The performance of each algorithm was found to be problem dependent, however the best overall approaches were ConMGPSO, paired-offspring constrained evolutionary algorithm (POCEA)(He et al., 2021), adaptive non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (A-NSGA-III)(Jain and Deb, 2014), and constrained multi-objective framework using Q-learning and evolutionary multi-tasking (CMOQLMT)(Ming and Gong, 2023). ConMGPSO and POCEA had the best performance on the CF benchmark set, which contains examples of bi-objective and tri-objective CMOPs with disconnected CPOFs. The CMOQLMT approach had the best performance on the DAS-CMOP benchmark set, which contain additional difficulty in terms of feasibility-, convergence-, and diversity-hardness. For the selected real-world CMOPs, A-NSGA-III had the best performance overall. ConMGPSO was shown to have the best performance on the process, design, and synthesis problems, and had competitive performance for the power system optimization problems.},

Surrogate-assisted selection plays a pivotal role in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), especially in addressing expensive optimization problems by reducing the number of real function evaluations. However, whether LLMs can serve as surrogate models remains an unknown. In this study, we propose a novel surrogate model based purely on LLM inference capabilities, eliminating the need for training. Specifically, we formulate model-assisted selection as a classification problem or a regression problem, utilizing LLMs to directly evaluate the quality of new solutions based on historical data. This involves predicting whether a solution is good or bad, or approximating its value. This approach is then integrated into EAs, termed LLM-assisted EA (LAEA). Detailed experiments compared the visualization results of 2D data from 9 mainstream LLMs, as well as their performance on 5-10 dimensional problems. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have significant potential as surrogate models in evolutionary computation, achieving performance comparable to traditional surrogate models only using inference. This work offers new insights into the application of LLMs in evolutionary computation. Code is available at: https://github.com/hhyqhh/LAEA.git .},

Unlike conventional artificial neural networks with floating-point calculations, the LCC operates entirely in binary so it can be easily implemented in hardware, which has significant advantages in dealing with a high velocity of data due to its high computational speed. However, oversimplifying the model architecture will lead to the performance degeneration of LCC, and how to balance the architecture and performance is not well understood in practical applications. Therefore, the primary motivation of this study is twofold. First, a theoretical analysis is presented that the transition of LCCs from DNM can be regarded as a specific regularization problem. Second, a multiobjective optimization framework that can simultaneously optimize the classification performance and model the complexity of LCC is proposed to solve the problem.

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML) features are extensively applied in various domains, notably in the context of Metaheuristic (MH) optimization methods. While MHs are known for their exploitation and exploration capabilities in navigating large and complex search spaces, they are not without their inherent weaknesses. These weaknesses include slow convergence rates and a struggle to strike an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, as well as the challenge of effective knowledge extraction from complex data. To address these shortcomings, an AI-based global optimization technique is introduced, known as the Intelligent Cross-Entropy Optimizer (ICEO). This method draws inspiration from the concept of Cross Entropy (CE), a strategy that uses Kullback–Leibler or cross-entropy divergence as a measure of closeness between two sampling distributions, and it uses the potential of Machine Learning (ML) to facilitate the extraction of knowledge from the search data to learn and guide dynamically within complex search spaces. ICEO employs the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to train and map the intricate, high-dimensional relationships within the search space onto a reduced lattice structure. This combination empowers ICEO to effectively address the weaknesses of traditional MH algorithms. To validate the effectiveness of ICEO, a rigorous evaluation involving well-established benchmark functions, including the CEC 2017 test suite, as well as real-world engineering problems have been conducted. A comprehensive statistical analysis, employing the Wilcoxon test, ranks ICEO against other prominent optimization approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of ICEO in achieving the optimal balance between computational efficiency, precision, and reliability. In particular, it excels in enhancing convergence rates and exploration-exploitation balance.},

  abstract     = {The multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) pertain to characteristic of the decision space that exhibit multiple sets of Pareto optimal solutions that are either identical or similar. The resolution of these problems necessitates the utilization of optimization algorithms to locate multiple Pareto sets (PSs). However, existing multi-modal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) encounter difficulties in concurrently enhancing solution quality in both decision space and objective space. In order to deal with this predicament, this paper presents an Archive-assisted Multi-modal Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm, called A-MMOEA. This algorithm maintains a main population and an external archive, which is leveraged to improve the fault tolerance of individual screening. To augment the quality of solutions in the archive, an archive evolution mechanism (AEM) is formulated for updating the archive and an archive output mechanism (AOM) is used to output the final solutions. Both mechanisms incorporate a comprehensive crowding distance metric that employs objective space crowding distance to facilitate the calculation of decision space crowding distance. Besides, a data screening method is employed in the AOM to alleviate the negative impact on the final results arising from undesirable individuals resulting from diversity search. Finally, in order to enable individuals to effectively escape the limitation of niches and further enhance diversity of population, a diversity search method with level-based evolution mechanism (DSMLBEM) is proposed. The proposed algorithm’s performance is evaluated through extensive experiments conducted on two distinct test sets. Final results indicate that, in comparison to other commonly used algorithms, this approach exhibits favorable performance.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of 6G communication technology, user expectations for service quality have correspondingly risen. This is particularly evident in rural areas, where the challenge of ensuring signal coverage across diverse terrains is pressing. Consequently, the intelligent placement of base stations becomes a critical issue. To address this, our paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of terrain environments and village distributions in rural settings and develops a sophisticated objective function. We introduce a novel approach termed Multi-strategy Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Forgetting (AFMPSO), designed to optimize the layout of base stations. This algorithm incorporates a forgetting mechanism and a center-of-mass traction strategy, which enable particles to update their positions responsively and maintain optimal individual information. Such features effectively prevent premature convergence and the risk of entrapment in local optima, thereby enhancing the efficacy of traditional particle swarm optimization techniques. In the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2022, AFMPSO was benchmarked against other particle swarm variants and the year’s winning algorithm. It demonstrated superior optimization capabilities. Further, our experiments utilizing both fixed and randomly configured village models revealed that AFMPSO achieved a signal coverage rate exceeding 90% in both setups, underscoring its substantial advantages and practical applicability in enhancing base station coverage. This research not only delivers an effective technical solution but also establishes a robust foundation for the future development of intelligent base station layouts.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) and differentiable architecture search (DARTS) are all prominent algorithms in neural architecture search, enabling the automated design of deep neural networks. To leverage the strengths of both methods, there exists a framework called continuous ENAS, which alternates between using gradient descent to optimize the supernet and employing evolutionary algorithms to optimize the architectural encodings. However, in continuous ENAS, there exists a premature convergence issue accompanied by the small model trap, which is a common issue in NAS. To address this issue, this paper proposes a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm for neural architecture search (SaDENAS), which can reduce the interference caused by small models to other individuals during the optimization process, thereby avoiding premature convergence. Specifically, SaDENAS treats architectures within the search space as architectural encodings, leveraging vector differences between encodings as the basis for evolutionary operators. To achieve a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, we integrate both local and global search strategies with a mutation scaling factor to adaptively balance these two strategies. Empirical findings demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance with superior convergence compared to other algorithms.},

In solving CMOPs, existing algorithms encounter difficulties in balancing conflicting objectives and constraints. Worse still, the performance of the algorithms deteriorates drastically when the size of the decision variables scales up. To address these issues, this study proposes a competitive and cooperative swarm optimizer for large-scale CMOPs. To balance conflict objectives and constraints, a bidirectional search mechanism based on competitive and cooperative swarms is designed. It involves two swarms, approximating the true Pareto front from two directions. To enhance the search efficiency in large-scale space, we propose a fast-converging competitive swarm optimizer. Unlike existing competitive swarm optimizers, the proposed optimizer updates the velocity and position of all particles at each iteration. Additionally, to reduce the search range of the decision space, a fuzzy decision variables operator is used. Comparison experiments have been performed on test instances with 100–1000 decision variables. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over five peer algorithms.},

This paper proposes addressing these uncertainties through the application of Stackelberg game models, a novel approach involving the interaction of two players. The Leader searches for optimal and robust solutions and the Follower generates uncertainties based on the Leader’s chosen solutions. The Follower seeks to tackle the most challenging uncertainties associated with the Leader’s candidate solutions. Additionally, this paper introduces a novel metric to assess the robustness of a given set of solutions concerning specified uncertainties. Based on the proposed approach, a co-evolutionary algorithm is developed. A numerical study is then conducted to evaluate the algorithm by comparing its performance with those obtained by four benchmark algorithms on nine benchmark MORO problems. The numerical study also aims to assess its sensitivity to run parameter variations. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach’s effectiveness in identifying a non-dominated robust set of solutions.},

Existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) cross infeasible regions by ignoring constraints. However, these methods might neglect promising search directions, leading to insufficient exploration of the search space. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning assisted constrained multi-objective quality-diversity algorithm. The proposed algorithm designs a diversity maintenance mechanism to promote evenly coverage of the final solution set on the constrained Pareto front. Specifically, first, a novelty-oriented archive is created using a centroid Voronoi tessellation, which divides the search space into a desired number of Voronoi regions. Each region acts as a repository of non-dominated solutions with different phenotypic characteristics to provide diversity information and supplementary evolutionary trails. Secondly, to improve resource utilization, a deep Q-network is adopted to learn a policy to select suitable Voronoi regions for offspring generation based on their novelty scores. The exploration of these regions aims to find a set of diverse, high-performing solutions to accelerate convergence and escape local optima. Compared with eight state-of-the-art CMOEAs, experimental studies on four benchmark suites and nine real-world applications demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior or at least competitive performance, especially on problems with discrete and narrow feasible regions.},

This paper introduces a surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with dimensionality reduction to address high-dimensional expensive optimization problems. The proposed algorithm includes two key insights. Firstly, we propose a dimensionality reduction framework containing three different feature extraction algorithms and a feature drift strategy to map the high-dimensional decision space into a low-dimensional decision space; this strategy helps to improve the robustness of surrogates. Secondly, we propose a sub-region search strategy to define a series of promising sub-regions in the high-dimensional decision space; this strategy helps to improve the exploration ability of the proposed SA-MOEA.

These problems are known as expensive constraint multi-objective optimization problems (ECMOPs). This paper combines the push and pull search (PPS) framework and proposes a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to solve ECMOPs through Bayesian active learning, naming it the surrogate-assisted PPS (SA-PPS). Specifically, during the push search stage, candidate solutions are selected based on two indicators: hypervolume improvement and objective uncertainty. These aim to quickly guide the population towards the unconstrained Pareto front while ensuring diversity. During the pull search stage, the population is partitioned into many subregions through reference vectors, and different selection strategies are assigned to each subregion based on its state, aiming to guide the population towards the constrained Pareto front while ensuring diversity. Furthermore, we introduce a batch data selection strategy that utilizes Bayesian active learning to enable the surrogate model to focus on regions of interest in the pull search stage. Extensive experimental results have shown that the proposed SA-PPS algorithm exhibits superior convergence and diversity compared to 9 state-of-the-art algorithms across a variety of benchmark problems and a real-world optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the challenges of constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) with evolutionary algorithms requires balancing constraint satisfaction and optimization objectives. Coevolutionary multitasking (CEMT) offers a promising strategy by leveraging synergies from distinct, complementary tasks. The primary challenge in CEMT frameworks is constructing suitable auxiliary tasks that effectively complement the main CMOP task. In this paper, we propose an adaptive CEMT framework (ACEMT), which customizes two adaptive auxiliary tasks to enhance CMOP-solving efficiency. The first auxiliary task dynamically narrows constraint boundaries, facilitating exploration in regions with smaller feasible spaces. The second task focuses specifically on individual constraints, continuously adapting to expedite convergence and uncover optimal regions. In solving the main CMOP task, this dual-auxiliary-task strategy not only improves search thoroughness but also clarifies the balance between constraints and objectives. Concretely, ACEMT incorporates an adaptive constraint relaxation technique for the first auxiliary task and a specialized constraint selection strategy for the second. These innovations foster effective knowledge transfer and task synergy, addressing the key challenge of auxiliary task construction in CEMT frameworks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark suites and real-world applications demonstrate ACEMT’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary algorithms. ACEMT sets a new standard in CMOP-solving by strategically constructing and adapting auxiliary tasks, representing a significant advancement in this research direction.},

However, randomly diversifying a population cannot always guarantee that an algorithm exploits or explores promising regions. To address this issue, a general framework is proposed in this paper for learning promising regions that are made up of subspaces to guide where to exploit and explore by two reinforcement learning systems. The learning mechanism is as follows: (1) To enhance the efficiency of exploitation, an exploitative reinforcement learning system is constructed to estimate the exploitative potential values of subspaces. Accordingly, basins of attraction are approximated by clustering subspaces and historical solutions are selected within the same basin of attraction to generate new solutions. (2) To efficiently explore the solution space, an explorative reinforcement learning system is established to estimate the explorative potential values of subspaces. Accordingly, algorithms are guided to explore subspaces with higher explorative potential values, promoting the discovery of unexploited promising basins of attraction. The framework is implemented into three conventional evolutionary algorithms, and the mechanism and effectiveness of the implemented algorithms are investigated by comprehensive experimental studies. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have competitive performances over the other twelve popular evolutionary algorithms.},

Along with a novel repair strategy to handle the complex constraints of large-scale problems.

In the experimental part, the algorithm effectiveness experiment of FDVSA was first conducted using the large-scale global optimization test sets IEEE congress on evolutionary computation 2010 and 2013 (CEC2010, CEC2013). The results show that: (1) Compared with other comparison algorithms, the comprehensive average optimization rate of FDVSA in CEC2010 and CEC2013 is 88 % and 78 %, respectively. (2) The experimental results of FDVSA showed that each improvement strategy has advantages in dealing with large-scale problems. (3) The post-hoc analysis showed that there are significant differences between FDVSA and other comparison algorithms, and FDVSA is significantly better. Finally, FDVSA and other comparison algorithms are solved on three different scale and complexity of SLA cases. The results show that: (1) FDVSA has significant advantages in solving large-scale SLA problem, and the comprehensive average optimization rate is 19 %. (2) The convergence curve and boxplot showed that FDVSA has good convergence speed and solving stability. (3) The effectiveness of the repair strategy was verified by experiments in the large-scale SLA problems.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal multiobjective optimization problems are widely prevalent in real life. Addressing these challenges is crucial as they directly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of solutions across various domains. This paper proposes a novel Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (MMOP-AOA), aimed at achieving a high balance between diversity and convergence in both decision and objective spaces. Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA) is a highly competitive metaheuristic optimization algorithm with strong exploration and exploitation capabilities. MMOP-AOA extends the AOA for the first time to solve multimodal multiobjective problems, with the following ideas: Firstly, a new exploration and exploitation strategy (NBC NEE) is designed based on the characteristics of AOA.The strategy utilizes Neighborhood-Based Clustering (NBC) to partition the decision space into multiple clusters, aiding MMOP-AOA in capturing more equivalent Pareto subsets (ePSs). Secondly, a convergence and diversity balance mechanism (CDBM) is developed. This mechanism involves comparing the convergence indicator and diversity indicator to select different mutation strategies. Thirdly, an improved crowding distance (ICD) is proposed to address the deficiencies of existing special crowding distance measures. The effectiveness of CDBM and ICD is demonstrated in the paper through experiments on 22 benchmark functions from CEC-2019 and a real-world problem of signal timing optimization at road intersections. The research also reveals that compared to four other advanced multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms, MMOP-AOA exhibits superior search capability and stability. Furthermore, MMOP-AOA utilizes Neighborhood-Based Clustering (NBC) to partition the decision space into multiple clusters, aiding MMOP-AOA in capturing more equivalent Pareto subsets (ePSs) and provides a theoretical framework for other metaheuristic optimization algorithms to tackle multimodal multiobjective problems.},

  abstract     = {Digital watermarking serves as a crucial tool for tracing copyright infringements and ensuring the authenticity and integrity of sensitive information. The fundamental concept involves embedding a watermark in the host information, ensuring its undetectability by unauthorized parties. The efficacy of a watermarking scheme mainly depends on achieving high levels of imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding capacity. These attributes are intricately linked to both the selection of the host information segment and the embedding factor. Existing schemes often (i) employ the entire host information for embedding, incurring computational expenses, and (ii) optimize the embedding factor without considering imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding capacity simultaneously, resulting in less secure watermarks. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel watermarking scheme leveraging elliptic curves (ECs) and genetic algorithms (GA). We model the choice of the embedding part by generating pseudo-random numbers over ECs, taking advantage of their proven sensitivity, security, and low computational complexity. Due to parallel search and adaptability to non-linear relationships of GA, the scheme employs genetic optimization with a multivariate objective function to establish a balance between imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding capacity for optimal watermarked generation. Rigorous analysis and comparisons demonstrate that our proposed scheme attains significantly higher imperceptibility, robustness, and embedding capacity compared to existing optimized schemes. Furthermore, our scheme exhibits a speed advantage, being up to 278 and 21 times faster than optimized and non-optimized schemes, respectively, thereby affirming its practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {In the real world, a class of common problems such as supply chain management, project scheduling, portfolio optimisation and facility location design are multi-objective combinatorial optimisation problems (MOCOPs), where there are multiple objectives and the set of feasible solutions is discrete. In MOCOPs, corner solutions are solutions in which at least one objective reaches the optimal value. Corner solutions are important as they are likely to be preferred by the decision maker and are able to help improve algorithm performance. In this paper, we first reveal that in decomposition-based MOEAs, improving the corner weights (as opposed to improving the middle weights) significantly enhances the generation of corner solutions, thereby enhancing the overall performance of algorithms. Based on this, we propose a method to enhance the search for corner solutions in MOCOPs. We act on a class of popular MOEAs, decomposition-based MOEAs, and in their evolutionary mechanism we intensify the weights in the corner areas. To verify the proposed method, we conduct experiments by incorporating the method into three decomposition-based MOEAs, MOEA/D, MOEA/D-DRA-UT and MOEA/D-LdEA (the latter two were designed specifically for enhancing the search of corner solutions). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the spread of solution sets found, without compromising the quality of internal solutions.},

As a part of it, query-focused summarization is becoming increasingly important in recent times.

This can be achieved by developing and applying a multi-objective optimization approach. In this paper, an Indicator-based Multi-Objective Variable Neighborhood Search (IMOVNS) algorithm has been designed, implemented, and tested for the query-focused extractive multi-document summarization problem. Experiments have been carried out with datasets from Text Analysis Conference (TAC). The results were evaluated using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics. IMOVNS has greatly improved the results presented in the scientific literature, providing improvement percentages in ROUGE metric reaching up to 69.24% in ROUGE-1, up to 57.70% in ROUGE-2, and up to 77.37% in ROUGE-SU4 scores. Hence, the proposed IMOVNS offers a promising solution to the query-focused summarization problem, thus highlighting its efficacy and potential for enhancing automatic summarization techniques.},

  abstract     = {Clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, aims to group patterns into clusters where similar patterns are grouped together, while dissimilar ones are placed in different clusters. This task can present itself as a complex optimization problem due to the extensive search space generated by all potential data partitions. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have emerged as efficient tools for addressing this task. Consequently, significant advancements and numerous proposals have been developed in this field. This work offers a comprehensive and critical review of state-of-the-art mono-objective Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for partitional clustering. From a more theoretical standpoint, it examines 22 well-known proposals in detail, covering their encoding strategies, objective functions, genetic operators, local search methods, and parent selection strategies. Based on this information, a specific taxonomy is proposed. In addition, from a more practical standpoint, a detailed experimental study is conducted to discern the advantages and disadvantages of approaches. Specifically, 22 different cluster validation indices are considered to compare the performance of clustering techniques. This evaluation is performed across 94 datasets encompassing diverse configurations, including the number of classes, separation between classes, and pattern dimensionality. Results reveal interesting findings, such as the key role of local search in optimizing results and reducing search space. Additionally, representations based on centroids and labels demonstrate greater efficiency and crossover and mutation operators do not prove to be as relevant. Ultimately, while the results are satisfactory, real-world clustering problems introduce additional complexity, especially for algorithms aiming to determine the number of clusters, resulting in diminished performance and the need for new approaches to be explored. Code, datasets and instructions to run algorithms in the LEAL library are available in an associated repository, in order to facilitate future experiments in this environment.},

Deicing drones are an effective method in response to these freezing events due to their fast speed and high environmental tolerance. However, the large disaster-affected area and the large scale and complexity of catenary networks make deicing drone scheduling a very difficult problem. In this paper, we formulate two versions of deicing drone scheduling problem, one for single drone scheduling and the other for multiple drone scheduling. Unlike most existing vehicle/drone routing problems, our problem aims to minimize the total negative effect caused by the freezing events on train operations, which reflects the prime concern of the decision-maker and is highly complex. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a reinforcement learning assisted memetic optimization algorithm, which integrates global mutation and a set of neighborhood search operators adaptively selected by deep reinforcement learning. Computational results on real-world problem instances demonstrate its significant performance advantages over selected popular optimization algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Stagnant evolution is a problem frequently encountered by the population in differential evolution (DE). Aiming at the stagnation phenomenon, a comprehensive interpretation is provided in this paper. Our experiment confirms that the individuals that continuously stop evolving can be classified into two categories: global and local stagnant individuals, whose causes and exhibited characteristics are associated with the search behavior of the population. Based on the above findings, we propose a chaotic individual regeneration framework (CIR) for DEs. In the CIR-DE, a monitor is designed to recognize different types of stagnant individuals by evaluating the whole population’s convergence speed and specific individual’s location. Besides, two chaotic regeneration techniques are proposed to guide the above two types of individuals away from stagnation using the knowledge from solution and objective spaces. The CIR framework is implemented in nine representative DEs and tested in the CEC 2014, CEC 2017, CEC 2022 theoretical benchmarks and five real-world problems. The results reveal that our framework can significantly improve original DEs’ performance and alleviate stagnation in both theoretical and practical scenarios. The CIR framework also shows strong competitiveness compared to the other stagnation-related frameworks and the state-of-the-art DE variants.},

  abstract     = {In constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs), constraints often fragment the Pareto solution space into multiple feasible and infeasible regions. This fragmentation presents a challenge for evolutionary optimization methods as feasible regions can be discrete and isolated by infeasible areas, making exploration difficult and leading to populations getting trapped in local optima. To address these issues, this paper introduces a manifold assisted coevolutionary algorithm for solving CMOPs. Firstly, a guided feasible search strategy is proposed to explore feasible regions, especially those isolated by infeasible barriers. This is achieved by estimating directions to the Constrained Pareto Set (CPS). Secondly, a manifold learning-based exploration strategy is employed to spread the population along the Pareto Set (PS) manifold by estimating the manifold distribution. Moreover, two populations are exploited, where the first population serves as the primary population, considering both constraints and objectives to explore the feasible region and search along the CPS. The second population, on the other hand, does not consider constraints and serves as an auxiliary population to explore the Unconstrained PS. By cooperating, these two populations effectively approach and cover separated CPS segments. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against seven state-of-the-art algorithms on 37 CMOP test functions and 5 CMOPs with fraudulent constraints. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our algorithm can reliably locate multiple CPSs and is considered state-of-the-art in handling CMOPs.},

An implicit assumption is that the adopted set of benchmark problems is representative.

In this paper, we first define three different levels of representativeness, and open up a window for addressing step by step the issue of representativeness-measuring. Then we turn to address the Type-III representativeness-measuring problem, and provide a metric for this problem. To illustrate how to use the proposed metric, the representativeness-measuring problem of benchmark problems for single-objective unconstrained continuous optimization is examined. The analysis covers as many as 1141 single-objective unconstrained continuous benchmark problems, primarily focusing on existing benchmark problems. Based on the defined representativeness metric, some classical features and calculations are used to assess the representativeness of the benchmark problems. Assessment results show that most of the benchmark problems of high representativeness are non-separable problems from the CEC and BBOB test suites. We select the top 5% of most representative problems to build a new test suite, providing a more representative and rigorous reference in verifying the overall performance of the optimization algorithms.},

Despite its importance, the constantly increasing search space of high-dimensional datasets poses significant challenges to FS methods, including issues like the &quot;curse of dimensionality,&quot; susceptibility to local optima, and high computational and memory costs. To overcome these challenges, a new FS algorithm named Uniform-solution-driven Binary Feature Selection (UniBFS) has been developed in this study. UniBFS exploits the inherent characteristic of binary algorithms-binary coding-to search the entire problem space for identifying relevant features while avoiding irrelevant ones. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the UniBFS algorithm, Redundant Features Elimination algorithm (RFE) is presented in this paper. RFE performs a local search in a very small subspace of the solutions obtained by UniBFS in different stages, and removes the redundant features which do not increase the classification accuracy. Moreover, the study proposes a hybrid algorithm that combines UniBFS with two filter-based FS methods, ReliefF and Fisher, to identify pertinent features during the global search phase. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on 30 high-dimensional datasets ranging from 2000 to 54676 dimensions, and their effectiveness and efficiency are compared with state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating their superiority.},

  abstract     = {Handling constrained multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (CMMOPs) is a tremendous challenge as it involves the discovery of multiple equivalent constrained Pareto sets (CPSs) with the identical constrained Pareto front (CPF). However, the existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are rarely suitable for solving CMMOPs due to the fact that they focus solely on locating CPF and do not intend to search for multiple equivalent CPSs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a framework of clustering-based constrained multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, termed FCCMMEA. In the proposed FCCMMEA, we adopt a clustering method to separate the population into multiple subpopulations for locating diverse CPSs and maintaining population diversity. Subsequently, each subpopulation evolves independently to produce offspring by an evolutionary algorithm. To balance the convergence and feasibility, we develop a quality evaluation metric in the classification strategy that considers the local convergence quality and constraint violation values, and it divides the populations into superior and inferior populations according to the quality evaluation of individuals. Furthermore, we also employ a diversity maintenance methodology in environmental selection to maintain the diverse population. The proposed FCCMMEA algorithm is compared with seven state-of-the-art competing algorithms on a standard CMMOP test suite, and the experimental results validate that the proposed FCCMMEA enables to find multiple CPSs and is suitable for handling CMMOPs. Also, the proposed FCCMMEA won the first place in the 2023 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation competition on CMMOPs.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, an increasing number of prediction-based strategies have shown promising results in handling dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs), and prediction models are also considered to be very favorable. Nevertheless, some linear prediction models may not always be effective. In particular, when the motion direction trends of different individuals are not aligned, these models can yield inaccurate prediction results. Inverted generational distance (IGD) is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of algorithms. This paper proposes a prediction model based on the IGD metric. Specifically, we assume that the pareto optimal front (POF) of the population at the previous time step is the true POF, and the POF at the current time step is the approximate POF. We cluster the current population with reference to the euclidean distances from uniform points on the true POF to the current POF points, with slight overlap between adjacent clusters, enables a better tradeoff between convergence and diversity in the prediction process. We consider the movement directions of individuals within each cluster separately through different cluster distributions, while balancing the individual movement directions and the overall population movement direction by overlaying cluster coverage areas, thereby helping to avoid the clustered prediction population from getting trapped in local optima. Experimental results and comparisons with other algorithms demonstrate that this strategy exhibits strong competitiveness in handling DMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution (DE), as a population-based meta-heuristic global optimization technique, has shown excellent performance in handling optimization problems in continuous spaces. Despite its effectiveness, the DE algorithm suffers from shortcomings such as complexity of parameter selection and limitations of the mutation strategy. Therefore, this paper presents a new strategy for generating trial vectors based on a hierarchical archive, which integrates promising information during evolution with current populations to obtain a good perception of the objective landscape. Moreover, to mitigate mis-scaling by scale factor, an adaptive parameter generation mechanism with hierarchical selection (APSH) is proposed. Furthermore, a novel population diversity metric technique and a restart mechanism based on wavelet functions is introduced in this paper. Comparative experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using 100 benchmark functions from the CEC2013, CEC2014, CEC2017, and CEC2022 test suites. The results demonstrate that the HAPI-DE algorithm outperforms or is on par with 6 recent powerful DE variants. Additionally, HAPI-DE was utilized in parameter extraction for the photovoltaic model STP6-120/36. The findings suggest that our algorithm, HAPI-DE, demonstrates competitiveness when compared to the 6 other DE variants.},

  abstract     = {This paper tackles the challenges of computation offloading in the cloud–edge paradigm. Although many solutions exist for enhancing the server’s computational and communication efficiency, they mainly focus on reducing latency and often neglect the impact of overlapping multi-request processing on scheduling reliability. Additionally, these approaches do not account for the preemptive characteristics of applications running in the VMs that lead to higher energy consumption. We propose a novel hybrid integer multi-objective dynamic decision-making approach enhanced with the gravity reference point method. This method determines the proportion of computations executed on cloud servers versus those handled locally on edge servers. Our hybrid approach leverages the gravitational potential reference point and crowding degrees to improve the characteristics of whale populations, addressing the limitations of the traditional whale algorithm, which depends on individual whales’ varying foraging behaviors influenced by a random probability number. By evaluating the crowding level around the prey, the foraging behavior of individual whales is adjusted to enhance the algorithm’s convergence speed and optimization accuracy, thereby increasing its reliability. The results show that our hybrid computation offloading model significantly improves time latency by 76.45%, energy efficiency by 63.12%, reliability by 82%, quality of service by 83.78%, distributor throughput by 87.31%, asset availability by 73.05%, and guarantee ratio by 89.72% compared to traditional offloading methods.},

Due to the high computational or financial cost associated with evaluating fitness, expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs) further complicate the optimization process. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have emerged as a promising approach to address EMOPs by substituting costly evaluations with computationally efficient surrogate models. This paper introduces the self-organizing surrogate-assisted non-dominated sorting differential evolution (SSDE), which uses surrogate model based on a self-organizing map (SOM) to approximate the fitness function. SSDE offers advantages such as reduced computational cost, improved accuracy, and the speed of enhanced convergence. The SOM-based surrogate models effectively capture the underlying structure of the Pareto optimal set and Pareto optimal front, leading to superior approximations of the fitness function. Experimental results on benchmark functions and real-world problems, including Model-Free Adaptive Control (MFAC) and the Yagi-Uda Antenna design, demonstrate the competitiveness and efficiency of SSDE compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Network Intrusion Detection (NID) becomes significantly important for protecting the security of information systems, as the frequency and complexity of network attacks are increasing with the rapid development of the Internet. Recent research studies have proposed various neural network models for NID, but they need to manually design the network architectures based on expert knowledge, which is very time-consuming. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-objective Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (MENAS) method, which can automatically design neural network models for NID. First, a comprehensive search space is designed and then a weight-sharing mechanism is used to construct a supernet for NID, allowing each subnet to inherit weights from the supernet for direct performance evaluation. Subsequently, the subnets are encoded as chromosomes for multi-objective evolutionary search, which simultaneously optimizes two objectives: enhancing the model’s detection performance and reducing its complexity. To improve the search capability, a path-based crossover method is designed, which can iteratively refine the subnets’ architectures by simultaneously optimizing their accuracy and complexity for NID. At last, our MENAS method has been validated through extensive experiments on three well-known NID datasets: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017. The experiments show that our MENAS method obtains an average 1.45% improvement on accuracy and an average 68.70% reduction on floating-point operations through multi-objective optimization process on six scenarios, which outperforms some state-of-the-art NID methods.},

  abstract     = {The increasing accessibility of extensive datasets has amplified the importance of extracting insights from high-dimensional data. However, the task of selecting relevant features in these high-dimensional spaces is made more difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. Although Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have shown promise in the literature for feature selection, creating EAs for high dimensions is still challenging. To address the problem of feature selection in high dimensions, a novel concept of Evolutionary Reinforced Markov Chain is proposed in this paper. The proposed work has the following contributions and merits: (i) The paradigms of evolutionary computation, reinforcement learning, and Markov chain are incorporated into an integrational framework for feature selection in high dimensional spaces in a recursive manner. (ii) To support the global convergence of the algorithm and manage its computational complexity, a restricted group of the most effective agents is maintained within the evolutionary population. (iii) The dynamic Markov chain process efficiently manages agent evolution and communication, ensuring effective navigation through the search space. (iv) Agents moving in the right way are rewarded with an increase in their associated transition probability, while the agents going in the wrong direction are discouraged with a decrease in their associated transition probabilities; this promotes the establishment of an equilibrium state and leads to convergence. (v) The effective size of successful agents is reduced recursively while progressing through different states to further facilitate the speed of convergence and decrease the number of features. (vi) The performance comparison with state-of-the-art feature selection methods shows a significant improvement and promise of the proposed method over the existing methods.},

In addressing this pivotal aspect, this paper introduces a pioneering methodology known as batch subproblem coevolution with Gaussian process-driven linear models (BSCo-GPLM). Specifically, from a modeling perspective, BSCo-GPLM decomposes the MOP into single-objective subproblems. Following this decomposition, for each subproblem, a Gaussian process-driven linear model (GPLM) is collaboratively trained to prevent overfitting and improve prediction accuracy. Regarding infill sampling, collaborative optimization of all GPLMs yields optimal candidate solutions for each subproblem, organized into coherent clusters. Within each cluster, only the solution with the highest utility is evaluated. Relying on the heightened prediction accuracy of the GPLM model and an efficient batch sampling strategy, BSCo-GPLM exhibits clear superiority over state-of-the-art SAMOEAs in effectively addressing expensive MOPs. The source code of BSCo-GPLM is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/EvolutionaryAlgorithm_Codes/tree/main/BSCo-GPLM .},

Therefore, this paper establishes a fuzzy multi-objective supply chain configuration problem model to minimize the lead time and product cost oriented towards real supply chain environments. To solve the fuzzy problem, the theories of membership and closeness degree in fuzzy mathematics are adopted, and a multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA) with crowding-based local search method is proposed. The MPGA algorithm uses two populations for optimizing the two objectives separately and effectively, and is characterized by three main innovative aspects. Firstly, a radical-and-radial selection operator is designed to balance the convergence speed and diversity of population. In the early stage of the algorithm, two populations are both optimized towards the ideal knee point, and then are separately optimized towards the two ends of the Pareto front (PF). Secondly, an elitist crossover operator is devised to promote information exchange within two populations. Thirdly, a crowding-based local search is proposed to speed up convergence by improving the crowded solutions, and to enhance diversity by obtaining new solutions around the uncrowded ones. Comprehensive experiments are tested on a fuzzy dataset with different sizes, and the integral of the hypervolume of PF is used for the evaluation of the fuzzy PF. The results show that MPGA achieves the best performance over other comparative algorithms, especially on maximum spread metric, outperforming all others by an average of 39 % across all test instances.},

CPPTAP permits multiple UAVs to conduct pesticide spraying on the same field. The completion time for each task fluctuates due to the cooperation among UAVs. We present a mathematical model and learning-based memetic algorithm (L-MA) to maximize the total area of the fields to be sprayed. In the evolutionary stage, mutation and repair operators based on value information are applied to balance the exploration and exploitation, while a problem-specific local search strategy is designed to enhance exploitation capability. A knowledge-based UAV allocation method (KUAM) is employed to maximize UAV utilization efficiency and minimize conflicts. Throughout the search process, Q-learning is utilized to assist the aforementioned operators and make decisions on the number of cooperative UAVs on fields. The effectiveness of L-MA is validated by comparing it against other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that L-MA outperforms the compared algorithms at a considerable margin in a statistical sense.},

Since the number of PSs may vary in different problems, if the population is restricted to a fixed size, the number of solutions found for each PS will inevitably fluctuate widely, which is undesirable for decision makers. To address the issue, this paper proposes a clustering-assisted adaptive evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (CA-MMEA/D), whose search process can be roughly divided into two stages. In the first stage, an initial exploration of decision space is carried out, and then solutions with good convergence are used for clustering to estimate the number and location of multiple PSs. In the second stage, new search strategies are developed on the basis of clustering, which can take advantage of unimodal search methods. Experimental studies show that the proposed algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms, and CA-MMEA/D can keep the number of solutions found for each PS at a relatively stable level for different problems, thus making it easier for decision makers to choose the desired solutions.

This situation worsens when dealing with large, voluminous big and high-dimensional datasets. To address these challenges, we propose parallel, fractional dominance-based MOEAs for FSS under Spark. Further, to improve the exploitation of MOEAs, we introduce a novel batch opposition-based learning (BOP) along with a cardinality constraint on the opposite solution. Accordingly, we propose two variants, namely, BOP1 and BOP2. In BOP1, a single neighbour is randomly chosen in the opposite solution space, whereas in BOP2, a group of randomly chosen neighbours in the opposite solution space. In either case, the opposite solutions are evaluated to improve the exploitation capability of the underlying MOEAs. We observe that in terms of mean optimal objective function values and across all datasets, the proposed BOP2 variant of parallel fractional dominance-based algorithms emerges as the top performer in obtaining efficient solutions. Further, we introduce a novel metric, namely the ratio of hypervolume (HV) and inverted generated distance (IGD), HV/IGD, that combines both diversity and convergence. With respect to the mean HV/IGD computed over 20 runs and Formula 1 racing, the BOP1 variants of fractional dominance-based MOEAs outperformed other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely employed to solve complex constrained optimization problems (COPs). However, numerous EAs treat constraints as a collective black box, employing a uniform processing technique for all constraints. Generally, there exists variability in the significance of each constraint within COPs. To address this issue, this paper is the first attempt to investigate the significance of each constraint spontaneously during the evolution process, and then proposes a co-directed evolutionary algorithm (CdEA-SCPD) for exploring interpretable COPs. First, CdEA-SCPD develops an adaptive penalty function designed to assign different weights to constraints based on their violation severity, thereby varying the significance of each constraint to enhance interpretability and facilitate the algorithm to converge more rapidly toward the global optimum. In addition, a dynamic archiving strategy and a shared replacement mechanism are developed to improve the population diversity of CdEA-SCPD. Extensive experiments on benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2006, CEC2010, and CEC2017 and three engineering problems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CdEA-SCPD compared to existing competitive EAs. Specifically, on the benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2010, the proposed method yields ρ ρ values lower than 0.05 in the multiple-problem Wilcoxon&#39;s signed rank test and ranks first in the Friedman&#39;s test. Furthermore, ablation analysis and parameter analysis have demonstrated the beneficial effects of the proposed strategies.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) networks consist of physical devices connected to the Internet, embedded with actuators, sensors, and communication components that exchange data. To enhance IoT security, accurately identifying and assessing the safety of connected devices is essential. To improve IoT security, this research proposes the IoT Device Type Identification utilizing Memristor-based Magnetized Hopfield Neural Network with Tuna Swarm Optimization Algorithm (IOT-DTI-MHNN-TSOA). It includes data collection, feature extraction, IoT device type identification. In data collection, an actual network traffic dataset amassed through 10 various IoT device categories is used. In the feature extraction phase, optimal features such as TCP packets&#39; time-to-live by server, packets&#39; inter-arrival time by client, packets&#39; inter-arrival time by server, TCP packets&#39; time-to-live by client, packets&#39; inter-arrival time, packet size, number of bytes sent and received, packet size by client, and total number of packets are extracted using a 2-Dimensional Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform (2D-FAWT). These extracting features are provided to the IoT device type identification phase. In this phase, a Memristor-based Magnetized Hopfield Neural Network (MHNN) method is employed to perceive the categories of IoT device as known/seen or unknown/unseen categories. The Tuna Swarm Optimization Algorithm (TSOA) enhances the weight parameters of MHNN. The efficacy of the IOT-DTI-MHNN-TSOA classification framework is assessed using performance metrics, like precision, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, error rate, computational time, ROC, Computational Complexity. The IOT-DTI-MHNN-TSOA method provides higher accuracy of 99.97 %, higher sensitivity of 99.95 %, and higher precision of 99.92 % compared to the existing models.},

Additionally, a Q-learning is integrated to select appropriate neighborhood operators, thereby enhancing the algorithm&#39;s exploration ability. To prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum, the restart strategy is offered.

Instead, a self-adaptive probability is obtained based on the population&#39;s degree of concentration, and the sparsity relationship among individuals&#39; fitness.

This paper presents a new model for the RRAP of a system with a mixed redundancy strategy, in which all components can be heterogeneous. This formulation leads to a more precise solution for the problem; however, RRAP is an np-hard problem, and the new mixed heterogeneous model will be more complicated to solve. After formulating the issue, a novel design of an evolutionary strategy optimization algorithm is proposed to solve that. The problem consists of discrete and continuous variables, and different mutation strategies are designed for each. The new formulation of the problem and the new method for solving it lead to better results than those reported in other recent papers.

The predictive mechanism is effective in detecting the patterns of change in a problem and is often used to track the Pareto Frontier (PF) in a new environment. However, these methods often rely on the historical optimization results to approximate new environmental solutions, which can lead to back-predictions and mislead population convergence because of the low quality of historical solutions. This paper proposes a dual mechanism of prediction and archive (DMPA_DMOEA) to address the problem. The improvements include: (1) The well-distributed solutions from the previous environment be retained to ensure that reliable solutions exist in the new environment. (2) An LSTM neural network model is used to construct the predictor, which makes full use of the historical information and fits the nonlinear relationship between the pareto set (PS), thus improving the accuracy of the predicted solution. (3) These archived solutions and the predicted solutions collectively form the initial population for the new environment, which improves the quality of the initial population and maintains excellent tracking performance. Finally, Multiple benchmark problems and different variation types are tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively handle DMOPs and has shown its remarkable superiority in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The successful deployment of Deep learning in several challenging tasks has been translated into complex control problems from different domains through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Although DRL has been extensively formulated and solved as single-objective problems, nearly all real-world RL problems often feature two or more conflicting objectives, where the goal is to obtain a high-quality and diverse set of optimal policies for different objective preferences. Consequently, the development of Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning (MODRL) algorithms has gained a lot of traction in the literature. Generally, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been demonstrated to be scalable alternatives to the classical DRL paradigms when formulated as an optimization problem. Hence it is reasonable to employ Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to handle MODRL tasks. However, there are several factors constraining the progress of research along this line: first, there is a lack of a general problem formulation of MODRL tasks from an optimization perspective; second, there exist several challenges in performing benchmark assessments of MOEAs for MODRL problems. To overcome these limitations: (i) we present a formulation of MODRL tasks as general multi-objective optimization problems and analyze their complex characteristics from an optimization perspective; (ii) we present an end-to-end framework, termed DRLXBench, to generate MODRL benchmark test problems for seamless running of MOEAs (iii) we propose a test suite comprising of 12 MODRL problems with different characteristics such as many-objectives, degenerated Pareto fronts, concave and convex optimization problems, etc. (iv) Finally, we present and discuss baseline results on the proposed test problems using seven representative MOEAs.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affects elective surgery and healthcare resources. Efficient management of resources, like ward capacity and operating theaters, is crucial. The operations research community explores solutions, notably leveraging artificial intelligence, to address scheduling challenges amid COVID-19 restrictions. In this situation, applying AI becomes essential to getting the best results. In this paper, we address the problem of daily scheduling elective surgeries while accounting for hospital ward capacity. It is possible to reduce this issue to a scheduling puzzle that, given a variety of restrictions, resembles a four-stage hybrid flow shop. These limitations include the availability of resources, patient flow control, wait time avoidance, patient prioritizing, and resource coordination. With the crucial aid of artificial intelligence, our main goal is to assign patients to different surgical resources to minimize the length of time they spend on average in the hospital ward. We suggest putting into practice effective optimization strategies that make use of AI-based algorithms, particularly the variable neighborhood search (VNS) and variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithms, which are inextricably linked with artificial intelligence concepts. Our studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the general VNS in addressing the daily elective surgical scheduling issue (SSP) with the priceless assistance of artificial intelligence. The experiments are based on novel data instances that were inspired by current literature guidelines. The test results conclusively demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to find virtually perfect solutions. Moreover, our results highlight that the use of these methods, strengthened by AI, can significantly increase the size of the solved issue by a remarkable factor of 19.54. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, AI thus becomes a key factor in optimizing the scheduling of elective surgeries and the allocation of resources.},

  abstract     = {Fast and accurate parameter identification of the photovoltaic (PV) model is crucial for calculating, controlling, and managing PV generation systems. Numerous meta-heuristic algorithms have been applied to identify unknown parameters due to the multimodal and nonlinear characteristics of the parameter identification problems. Although many of them can obtain satisfactory results, problems such as premature convergence and population stagnation still exist, influencing the optimization performance. A novel variant of Differential Evolution, namely, Diversity Improvement-Oriented Differential Evolution (DIODE), is proposed to mitigate these deficiencies and obtain reliable parameters for PV models. In DIODE, an adaptive perturbation strategy is employed to perturb current individuals to mitigate premature convergence by enhancing population diversity. Secondly, a diversity improvement mechanism is proposed, where information on the covariance matrix and fitness improvement of individuals is used as a diversity indicator to detect stagnant individuals, which are then updated by the intervention strategy. Lastly, a novel parameter adaptation strategy is employed to maintain a sound balance between exploration and exploitation. The proposed DIODE algorithm is applied to parameter identification problems of six PV models, including single, double, and triple diode and three PV module models. In addition, a large test bed containing 72 benchmark functions from CEC2014, CEC2017, and CEC2022 test suites is employed to verify DIODE’s overall performance in terms of optimization accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate that DIODE can secure accurate parameters of PV models and achieve highly competitive performance on benchmark functions.},

  abstract     = {When evolutionary algorithms are employed to tackle constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), constraint handling techniques (CHTs) play a pivotal role. To date, several CHTs have been designed, but they are only effective for certain types of constraint landscapes. For CMOPs with unknown properties, their optimization performance and efficiency remain uncertain. To tackle this issue, we attempt to mine and utilize the knowledge of constraint landscape to solve CMOPs. Specifically, the evolutionary process can be divided into three stages: learning stage, classification stage, and evolving stage. During the learning stage, the two populations, namely mainPop and auxPop , cooperatively evolve with and without considering constraints, respectively. The mainPop can locate the feasible regions, while the auxPop is employed to evaluate the size of the feasible regions. Subsequently, in the classification stage, based on the learned landscape knowledge, the category of problem can be determined: CMOP with small feasible regions or CMOP with large feasible regions. Then, in the evolving stage, for CMOPs with small feasible regions, CHTI, which includes a population exchange method and a feasible regions relaxation method, is proposed, while for CMOPs with large feasible regions, CHTII, which encompasses a dynamic resource allocation method and a coevolutionary method, is designed. The proposed framework is executed on extensive benchmark test suites. It has achieved superior or at least competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully implemented on the robotic manipulator path planning problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has received widespread attention for its remarkable ability to design neural networks. However, existing NAS works have mainly focused on network search, with limited emphasis on downstream applications after discovering efficient neural networks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight search strategy based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm and apply the searched network as backbone for object detection tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight search space based on Ghostconv modules and improved Mobileblocks, achieving comprehensive exploration within the search space using variable-length encoding strategy. During the search process, to balance network performance and resource consumption, we propose a multi-objective fitness function and incorporated the classification accuracy, parameter size, and FLOPs of candidate individuals into optimization. For particle performance evaluation, we propose a new strategy based on weight sharing and dynamic early stopping, significantly accelerating the search process. Finally, we fine-tune the globally optimal particle decoded as the backbone, adding Ghost PAN feature fusion modules and detection heads to build an object detection model, and we achieve a 17.01% mAP on the VisDrone2019 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithm in terms of search time and the balance between accuracy and efficiency, and also confirm the effectiveness of object detection models designed through NAS methods.},

  abstract     = {Compared with common multi-objective optimization problems, constrained multi-objective optimization problems demand additional consideration of the treatment of constraints. Recently, many constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been presented to reconcile the relationship between constraint satisfaction and objective optimization. Notably, evolutionary multi-task mechanisms have also been exploited in solving constrained multi-objective problems frequently with remarkable outcomes. However, previous methods are not fully applicable to solving problems possessing all types of constraint landscapes and are only superior for a certain type of problem. Thus, in this paper, a novel dynamic-multi-task-assisted constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm, termed DTCMO, is proposed, and three dynamic tasks are involved. The main task approaches the constrained Pareto front by adding new constraints dynamically. Two auxiliary tasks are devoted to exploring the unconstrained Pareto front and the constrained Pareto front with dynamically changing constraint boundaries, respectively. In addition, the first auxiliary task stops the evolution automatically after reaching the unconstrained Pareto front, avoiding the waste of subsequent computational resources. A series of experiments are conducted with eight mainstream algorithms on five benchmark problems, and the results confirm the generality and superiority of DTCMO.},

However, effectively finding a high-quality and evenly distributed Pareto sets (PSs) remains a challenge for researchers. This paper introduces a multimodal multiobjective differential evolution algorithm based on enhanced decision space search (MMODE_EDSS). By adopting two types of strategies to enhance the decision space search capability, the algorithm generates multiple high-quality non-dominated solutions. In the early stages of evolution, neighborhood information is used to enhance search capabilities, while in the later stages, data interpolation methods following clustering are employed for searching. Moreover, to improve the overall population distribution, an environmental selection mechanism based on dual-space crowding distance is adopted. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, MMODE_EDSS, is evaluated by comparing it with eight state-of-the-art multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs).

The production model, characterized by multiple varieties and small batches, is widely observed in the industrial sector. Additionally, in various real-world scenarios, batches often undergo repeated processes across multiple stages. This paper addresses the research gap by introducing the reentrant nature of batches and the heterogeneity of factories into the DHFSP, resulting in a novel problem referred to as the distributed reentrant heterogeneous hybrid flowshop batch scheduling problem (DRHHFBSP). To tackle this problem, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Given that this problem falls into the NP-hard category, an iterative construction-local search-reconstruction algorithm (ICLSRA) is designed. Specifically designed by incorporating construction, local search, and reconstruction processes that have different roles, this algorithm strikes a balance between local and global search. Comparative analysis with the MILP model and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates the superiority of ICLSRA in achieving efficient solutions for the DRHHFBSP.},

Based on the integrated energy reduction perspective, a bi-objective model is subtly constructed by minimizing the total energy consumption of each path (including flight altitude, horizontal turns, and path length), and minimizing the costs of the total threats (including ground radar, anti-aircraft gun, missile and geological hazard threat areas). Moreover, a two-stage knowledge-assisted coevolutionary NSGA-II algorithm is novelly proposed to enhance collaboration and avoid collision. The first stage is designed for population convergence, where the considered constrained problem is solved with the help of the designed problem without the constraints of threats and obstacles. The second stage emphasizes the quality and diversity of solutions. In this stage, a double-population coevolution approach is developed. Additionally, a multi-mode strategy is introduced for the inferior population, leveraging reinforcement learning. This strategy aids in selecting the optimal mode from random swing, directed guidance, and potential dominance exploration. Furthermore, experimental results in two different environments show that the proposed algorithm can better solve the collaborative path planning problem for multiple UAVs compared with other five classical or recent proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the stochastic resource-constrained project scheduling problem with transfer and idle costs (SRCPSP-TIC) under uncertain environments, where the resource transfer and idle take time and costs. Priority rule (PR) based heuristics are the most commonly used approaches for project scheduling under uncertain environments due to their simplicity and efficiency. For PR-based heuristics of the SRCPSP-TIC, activity priority rules (APRs) and transfer priority rules (TPRs) are necessary to decide the activity sequence and resource transfer. Traditionally, APRs and TPRs need to be manually designed, which is time-consuming and difficult to adapt to different scheduling scenarios. Therefore, based on two individual representation methods, we propose two co-evolution genetic programming (CGP) based hyper-heuristics to evolve APRs and TPRs automatically. Furthermore, a fitness function surrogate-assisted method and a transfer learning mechanism are designed to improve the efficiency and solution quality of the CGP. Based on the instances with different stochastic activity duration distributions, we test the performance of different CGP-based hyper-heuristics and compare the evolved PRs with the classical PRs to demonstrate the effectiveness of evolved PRs. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can automatically evolve efficient PRs for the SRCPSP-TIC.},

This paper proposes a hybrid genetic tabu search algorithm (HGTSA) for solving DJSP. The proposed HGTSA combines the global search ability of the genetic algorithm (GA) and the local search ability of the tabu search (TS) well. In GA part, a crossover operation and a mutation operation are devised based on the critical factory. The two operations can effectively improve the discreteness of the population. In TS part, a tabu search procedure is performed on the critical factory. The procedure can effectively enhance the local search ability of HGTSA. For evaluating the performance of HGTSA, it has been compared with five classical algorithms on 240 benchmark instances. The computational results show the efficiency and effectiveness of HGTSA for solving DJSP. In particular, the proposed HGTSA updates the upper bounds for 235 out of these difficult instances.},

A hierarchical reinforcement learning-aware hyper-heuristic algorithm with fitness landscape analysis (HRLHH) is proposed to flexibly configure the suitable algorithms under various optimization scenarios. Two kinds of fitness landscape analysis techniques improved based on specific problem characteristics construct the state spaces for hierarchical reinforcement learning. Among them, an adaptive classification based on dynamic ruggedness of information entropy is designed to discern the complexity of problems, which serves as the basis for decision-making actions in upper-layer space. Additionally, an online dispersion metric based on knowledge is further presented to distinguish the precise landscape features in lower-layer space. In light of the characteristics of the state spaces, the hierarchical action spaces composed of meta-heuristics with disparate exploration and exploitation are designed, and various action selection strategies are introduced. Taking into account the real-time environment and algorithm evolution behavior, dynamic reward mechanisms based on evolutionary success rate and population convergence rate are utilized to enhance search efficiency. The experimental results on the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017, CEC 2014, and large-scale CEC 2013 test suites demonstrate that the proposed HRLHH exhibits superiority in terms of accuracy, stability, and convergence speed, and possesses strong generalization.},

Discrepancies in the processing environment and types of machines of each factory during various production stages cause diverse processing paths and scheduling.

The mathematical model of DHMNWFSP-SDST is established. A cooperative learning-aware dynamic hierarchical hyper-heuristic (CLDHH) is proposed to solve the DHMNWFSP-SDST. In CLDHH, a cooperative initialization method is developed to promote diversity and quality of solutions. A hierarchical hyper-heuristic framework with reinforcement learning (RL) is designed to select the algorithm component automatically. Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) guides the upper-layer RL to select four neighborhood structures. A dynamic adaptive neighborhood switching constructs the lower-layer RL to accelerate exploitation with the dominant sub-neighborhoods. An elite-guided hybrid path relinking achieves local enhancement.

However, in high-dimensional spaces, traditional decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms struggle to ensure population diversity. Conversely, traditional Pareto dominance-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms face challenges in ensuring population convergence. In this paper, we propose a novel many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on interaction force and hybrid optimization mechanism (MaOEAIH) for effectively addressing the difficulty in balancing convergence and diversity. First, we use the concept of interaction force to simulate the convergence (akin to gravity) and diversity (repulsion) of the population. Subsequently, we design an optimization mechanism that combines decomposition and Pareto dominance to enhance the convergence and diversity of the population separately. Simultaneously, to eliminate dominance resistance solutions, we propose a quartile method based on boundary solutions. Additionally, Random perturbations are also introduced to certain individuals within the population to facilitate their escape from local optima. MaOEAIH is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms on 31 well-known test problems with 3-15 objectives. The experimental results show that, compared to other algorithms, MaOEAIH not only obtains solution sets of higher quality when dealing with different types of many-objective optimization problems, but also effectively addresses key challenges including insufficient selection pressure, difficulty balancing convergence and diversity, and susceptibility to population entrapment in local optima within many-objective optimization scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Many real multi-objective optimization problems with 20-50 decision variables often have only a small number of function evaluations available, because of their heavy time/money burden. Therefore, surrogate models are often utilized as alternatives for expensive function evaluations. However, the approximation error of the surrogate model is inevitable compared to the real function evaluation. The approximation error has a similar impact on the algorithm as noise, i.e., different optimization stages suffer from various impacts. Therefore, the current optimization stage can be indirectly detected via measuring the impact of the noise formulated by the approximation error. In addition, the rising dimension of the search space leads to an increase in the approximation errors of the surrogate models, which poses a huge challenge for existing surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose a stage-adaptive surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to solve the medium-scale optimization problems. In the proposed algorithm, the ensemble model consisting of the latest and historical models is used as the surrogate model, on the basis of which a set of potential candidates can be discovered. Then, a stage-adaptive infill sampling strategy selects the most suitable sampling strategy by analyzing the demand of the current optimization stage on convergence, diversity, model accuracy to sample from the candidates. As for the current optimization stage, it is detected by a noise impact indicator, where the approximation errors of surrogate models are formulated as noise. The experimental results on a series of medium-scale expensive test problems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over six state-of-the-art compared algorithms.},

However, the huge dimension and information volume brought by the abundant bands may give rise to a negative influence on the efficiency of subsequent processing on hyperspectral images. Band selection (BS) is a commonly adopted to reduce the dimension of HSIs. Different from the previous work, in this paper, hyperspectral band selection problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the band distribution uniformity among the selected bands and inter-class separation distance from a few labeled samples are optimized simultaneously. To fully exploit the relation between the band subsets with different sizes, we construct a multi-objective evolutionary multi-tasking algorithm for hyperspectral band selection (namely MEMT-HBS) to achieve the selected band subsets for all the selected band sizes in one run. To implement MEMT-HBS, the intra-task pairwise learning based solution generation strategy is suggested to evolve the population for each task to achieve high-quality offspring whose selected band size is restricted to a fixed scope. The inter-task band coverage based knowledge transferring strategy is utilized to choose useful individuals from adjacent tasks to further enhance the performance of current task. Compared with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised and unsupervised BS algorithms, empirical results on different standard hyperspectral datasets show that our proposed MEMT-HBS can determine the superior band subset which has a higher image classification accuracy over the comparison algorithms.},

An Adaptive Multi-meme Memetic Algorithm (AMMA) is proposed to tackle PC-GMSTP, which combines an adaptive reproduction procedure and a collaborated local search procedure. The adaptive reproduction procedure uses either crossover or mutation to produce offspring to maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space, and the probability to use crossover or mutation is adaptively adjusted based on the diversity of population. The collaborated local search procedure, which includes two efficient local search operators, can effectively enhance the intensification ability of AMMA due to their complementary features. Extensive computational experiments on 126 challenging instances demonstrate the superiority of AMMA, outperforming 23 best-known solutions from existing literature while achieving similar solutions for the remaining 103 instances. Wilcoxon’s signed rank test confirms that the performance of AMMA is significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Two-sided assembly lines are typically employed in the production of medium and large-sized products with the aim of reducing the length of the assembly line, enhancing assembly efficiency and consequently reducing the time required for product assembly. However, traditional Two-sided assembly lines lack effective resource scheduling management methods in production scheduling, which results in low productivity and high resource costs. In order to address this issue, we propose a new two-sided resource-constrained assembly line balancing problem (TRCLBP) model. The model takes the minimum number of workstations and the minimum assembly cost as its objective function and proposes an improved genetic algorithm (I-GA) to solve it. A three-layer chromosome initialization method is proposed for the assembly tasks and resource decisions, which effectively improves the diversity and quality of the initial population. Furthermore, the algorithm employs strategies such as matching crossover and redistributing variants to ensure rapid convergence of the populations and to prevent them from falling into local optimums. Finally, the efficacy of the model and algorithm proposed in this paper is validated through a comprehensive analysis of arithmetic case studies and enterprise engineering examples. This analysis reveals a reduction of approximately 18 % in the total cost of assembly. Furthermore, the model enables enterprises to make informed decisions regarding the optimal allocation of resources, thereby reducing production costs and improving the efficiency of assembly operations during periods of expansion.},

This type of disruption often creates production chaos and scheduling problems. This paper takes new job insertion and random machine failure as dynamic events. It establishes an optimization model for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSP) problems to cope with this issue. A two-stage double deep Q-network, TS-DDQN algorithm is proposed based on an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the complex multi-objective DFJSP optimization problem by adopting two-stage decision-making.

Moreover, the solutions on the Pareto front are used to train the network parameters. Extensive experimentation is conducted on benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against the existing scheduling methods. The outcomes underscore the superior efficacy of the proposed algorithm concerning solution quality, convergence speed, and adaptability within dynamic environments. This research contributes to advancing the methods in solving multi-objective DFJSP problems and highlights the potential of deep reinforcement learning to yield managerial advantages in manufacturing industries.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) aim to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, and as the number of objectives increases, the quantity of these optimal solutions grows exponentially. However, a plethora of optimal solutions can impose significant decision stress on decision-makers. Subset selection, as the extension of a model, can extract a representative set of solutions, thereby alleviating the decision-makers’ choice pressure. In addition, extending a model undoubtedly incurs additional time costs. To cope with the foregoing issues, a fast subset selection method named ranking-based subset selection (RBSS) is proposed in this paper. It can efficiently select a small number of optimal solutions within an unbounded external archive and can be directly applied to any multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. This allows it to maintain good distribution and diversity with very little time investment. We employed a ranking-based approach to map the objective space to a ranking space (an integer space) defined by us and then selected the corresponding subset in the ranking space. The well-behaved mathematical properties of the ranking space and the advantages of using integer calculations accelerated the subset selection process. Experimental results indicate that compared to several state-of-the-art subset selection methods, RBSS is capable of selecting a set of representative and diverse solutions across different types of MOPs, while consuming significantly less time. Specifically, for problems where the Pareto front is a two-dimensional manifold and a one-dimensional manifold, the time consumption of RBSS is approximately only 0.028% to 27.5% and 4.6e−4% to 0.15% of that required by other algorithms, respectively.},

The existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) still face the issue of striking a good balance when solving CMOPs with diverse characteristics. To alleviate this issue, in this paper we develop a two-stage different evolution with a dynamic population assignment strategy for CMOPs. In this approach, two cooperative populations are used to provide feasible driving forces and infeasible guiding knowledge. To adequately utilize the infeasibility information, a dynamic population assignment model is employed to determine the primary population, which is used as the parents to generate offspring. The entire search process is divided into two stages, in which the two populations work in weak and strong cooperative ways, respectively. Furthermore, multistrategy-based differential evolution operators are adopted to create aggressive offspring. The superior exploration and exploitation ability of the proposed algorithm is validated via some state-of-the-art CMOEAs over artificial benchmarks and real-world problems. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm gained a better, or more competitive, performance than the other competitors, and it is an effective approach to balancing objective optimization and constraint satisfaction.},

But, simultaneously optimizing these two indicators encounters various challenges, such as elastic resources, large-scale decision variables, and sophisticated workflow structures. To handle these challenges, we design an adaptive evolutionary scheduling algorithm, namely AESA, with three innovative strategies. First, a heuristic population initialization strategy is devised to gather workflow tasks onto limited potential resources, thereby alleviating the negative impact of redundant cloud resources on evolutionary search efficiency. Then, a variable analysis strategy is designed to dynamically measure the contribution of each decision variable in pushing the population towards Pareto-optimal fronts. Moreover, AESA embraces an adaptive strategy to reward more evolutionary opportunities for decision variables with higher contributions to handle large-scale decision variables in a targeted manner, further improving the efficiency of evolutionary search. Finally, extensive experiments are performed based on real-world cloud platforms and workflow traces to verify the effectiveness of the proposed AESA. The comparison results validate its superior performance by significantly outperforming five representative baselines in optimizing makespan and energy consumption. Also, the results of ablation experiments demonstrate that all three components contribute to AESA’s overall performance, with the adaptive reward mechanism being the most significant.},

Furthermore, we employ the mINFO algorithm to optimize the connection weights and biases of feedforward neural networks (FNNs) to improve their accuracy. The efficacy of FNNs for classification tasks is mainly dependent on hyperparameter tuning, such as the number of layers and nodes. The mINFO was evaluated using the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation held in 2020 (CEC’2020) for optimization tests, and ten chemical data sets were applied to validate the performance of the FNNs classifier. The proposed algorithm’s results have been evaluated with those of other well-known optimization methods, including Runge Kutta optimizer’s (RUN), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), Harris hawks optimization (HHO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), slime mould algorithm (SMA) and the standard weighted mean of vectors (INFO).

An essential challenge in solving CMMOPs is how to balance exploration and exploitation in searching for the CPSs. To tackle this issue, a dynamic constrained co-evolutionary multimodal multi-objective algorithm termed DCMMEA is developed in this paper. DCMMEA involves a constraint-relaxed population for handling constraints and a convergence-relaxed population for improving convergence quality. Subsequently, a constraint-relaxed epsilon strategy that considers the constraint violation degree between individuals is designed and applied dynamically in the constraint-relaxed population to develop equivalent CPSs. Similarly, a dynamic convergence-relaxed epsilon strategy that considers the differences between objective values is developed and used dynamically in the convergence-relaxed population. It explores CPSs with high convergence quality and transfers the convergence knowledge to the constraint-relaxed population. Additionally, the constraint- relaxed population size is dynamically increased and the convergence-relaxed population size is dynamically decreased to balance the exploration and exploitation procedures. Experiments are performed on standard CMMOP test suites and validate that DCMMEA obtains superior performance on solving CMMOPs in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, DCMMEA is implemented on standard CMOPs and demonstrated good performance in handling CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of &quot;Industry 4.0&quot;, more matrix manufacturing workshops have adopted automated guided vehicle (AGV) for material handling. AGV transportation has become a key link in manufacturing production. Traditional AGVs scheduling problem (AGVSP) is studied in depth. However, most research overlooks an important problem, in production with limited resources, the number of AGVs is insufficient. Therefore, the wait time of workstations is longer than expected. The service time of the task is delayed and the cost is increased. To solve above problem, this paper proposes the binary discrete enhanced Jaya (BDE-Jaya) algorithm. The main goal is to minimize transportation cost, including AGV traveling cost, service early penalty, and total tardiness (TTD). A key-task shift method is proposed to reduce TTD and task service early penalty. Two heuristics based on the problem features are designed to generate the initial solution. In the evolutionary stage, three offspring generation methods are used to improve the algorithm exploitation capability and exploration capability. Then, an insertion-based repair method is designed to prevent the exploitation process falling into local optimum. Furthermore, three parameters are proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. Finally, simulation experiment shows that the proposed BDE-Jaya algorithm has significant advantages compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To address the inflexibility of the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) in adjusting the network structure and the difficulty of accurately delineating complex class boundaries in power load data, a particle swarm optimization deep clustering method (DC-PSO) is proposed. First, a particle swarm optimization algorithm for automatically searching the optimal network architecture and hyperparameters of CAE (AHPSO) is proposed to obtain better reconstruction performance. Then, an end-to-end deep clustering model based on a reliable sample selection strategy is designed for the deep clustering algorithm to accurately delineate the category boundaries and further improve the clustering effect. The experimental results show that the DC-PSO algorithm exhibits high clustering accuracy and higher performance for the power load profile clustering.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic and multimodal properties are simultaneously possessed in the dynamic multimodal optimization problems (DMMOPs), which aim to find multiple optimal solutions in a dynamic environment. However, more work still needs to be devoted to solving DMMOPs, which still require significant attention. A niching-based brain storm optimization with two archives (NBSO2A) algorithm is proposed to solve DMMOPs. The two niching methods, i.e. , neighborhood-based speciation (NS), and nearest-better clustering (NBC), are incorporated into a BSO algorithm to generate new solutions. The two archives preserve the optimal solutions that meet the requirements and practical, inferior solutions discarded during the generation. Improved taboo area (ITA) removes highly similar individuals from the population. An evolution strategy with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES) is adopted to enhance the local search ability and improve the quality of the solutions. The NBSO2A algorithm and four other algorithms were tested on 12 benchmark problems to validate the performance of the NBSO2A algorithm on DMMOPs. The experimental results show that the NBSO2A algorithm outperforms the other compared algorithms on most tested benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) widely appear in various real-world applications and have attracted increasing attention worldwide. However, how to obtain both good population diversity and fast convergence speed to efficiently solve DMOPs are two challenging issues. Inspired by that the multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework can provide algorithms with good population diversity and fast convergence speed, this paper proposes a new efficient algorithm called a co-evolutionary multi-population evolutionary algorithm (CMEA) based on the MPMO framework together with three novel strategies, which are helpful for solving DMOPs efficiently from two aspects. First, in the evolution control aspect, a convergence-based population evolution strategy is proposed to select the suitable population for executing the evolution in different generations, so as to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Second, in the dynamic control aspect, a multi-population-based dynamic detection strategy and a multi-population-based dynamic response strategy are proposed to help the algorithm maintain the population diversity, which are efficient for detecting and responding to the dynamic changes of environments. Integrating with the above strategies, the CMEA is proposed to solve the DMOP efficiently. The superiority of the proposed CMEA is validated in experiments on widely-used DMOP benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {Industrial internet of things (IIoT) connects traditional industrial devices with the network to provide intelligent services, which is regarded as the key technology for achieving Industry 4.0 and enabling the transformation of the manufacturing sector. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has brought significant opportunities to expedite the development of IIoT. However, the unique task characteristics and dense deployment of IIoT devices, coupled with the resource starvation problem (RSP) arising from the limited resources of edge servers, pose challenges to the direct applicability of existing MEC algorithms in MEC-assisted IIoT scenarios. To this end, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to simultaneously optimize delay and energy consumption for multi-workflow execution in resource-limited IIoT. First, the initialization of execution location based on delay and the initialization of execution order satisfying the priority constraint can generate high-quality initial solutions. Then, the improved crossover and mutation operations guide the population evolution, which can span the large infeasible solution region. Finally, dynamic task scheduling (DTS) dynamically changes the execution location of tasks affected by RSP according to the execution efficiency, so as to avoid the tasks blindly waiting for server resources. The comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving a balance between the execution delay and energy consumption of IIoT devices.},

Inspired by this, this paper proposes a general random projection enhancement method (RPE) aimed at improving surrogate model performance. Taking least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) as an example, we conducted numerical experiments to evaluate the feasibility of the RPE method. The RPE-enhanced LSSVR demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and robustness compared to the unenhanced model and other benchmark models. The results show that the RPE method can not only enhance the predictive accuracy of the model but also improve the robustness of the model. Meanwhile, analysis of optimization experiments indicated that the enhanced LSSVR model obtained better solutions compared to the unenhanced LSSVR model. Even when extended to high-dimensional problems, the RPE method remains effective. Furthermore, the applicability of RPE method extends from the LSSVR model to other models, as demonstrated by the enhancement of the extreme learning machine, regression kriging, and radial basis function neural network. More importantly, the feasibility of the RPE method is also verified in engineering problems, obtaining the same results. This method offers a reliable alternative for real-world engineering optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {There are various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), and the significant difference between them lies in the way they generate offspring, which are the so-called variation operators. Since different variation operators have their own characteristics, it is often tedious to select a suitable EA for a given MOP. Even if the optimal operator is assigned, the fixed operator and hyper-parameters make it difficult to balance exploration and exploitation during the evolutionary process. It is imperative to configure variation operators and hyper-parameters automatically during the evolutionary process, which can improve the efficiency of algorithm search. However, numerous configurations only consider operators or discretize hyper-parameters, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, we formulate the operator configuration as a continuous Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use a suitable Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm to realize the online configuration of EAs. To simplify the deployment of MDP, we adopt a decomposition-based framework and use a one-dimensional vector with a combination of weights and objectives as state spaces. In addition, we take the selection of crossover and mutation operators and the fine-tuning of their hyper-parameters as joint action spaces. With an RL technique, we expect to achieve maximum improvement in the performance of offspring on each preference by selecting an action in a given state. We further explore the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on different characteristic MOPs. Experimental results show that our method is more competitive than other configurations and state-of-the-art EAs.},

  abstract     = {Production scheduling and maintenance planning are two interactive factors in modern manufacturing system. However, at present, almost all studies ignore the impact of unpunctual maintenance activities on the integrated production and maintenance scheduling since the unavailabilities of repairmen are dynamically changed, e.g., repairmen increase, decrease and their unavailable intervals update. Under these contexts, this paper addresses a novel integrated optimization problem of condition-based preventive maintenance (CBPM) and production rescheduling with multi-phase processing speed selection and dynamic repairman assignment. More precisely, (1) a novel multi-phase-multi-threshold CBPM policy with remaining-useful-life-based inspection and multi-phase processing speed selection is proposed to obtain some selectable maintenance plans for each production machine; (2) a hybrid rescheduling strategy (HRS) that includes three rescheduling strategies is designed for responding to the dynamic changes of repairman; and (3) an adaptive clustering- and Meta-Lamarckian learning-based bi-population co-evolutionary algorithm (ACML-BCEA) is developed to deal with the concerned problem. In the numerical simulations, the effectiveness of designed operators and proposed ACML-BCEA algorithm is first verified. Next, the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed CBPM policy and HRS are separately demonstrated by comparing with other CBPM policies and rescheduling strategies. After that, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the effect of optional range of processing speed, skill level of selectable repairmen and total number of processing phases, and the analyzing results show that these factors all have a significant impact on the integrated optimization.},

  abstract     = {Many real world optimization problems are formulated as mixed-variable optimization problems (MVOPs) which involve both continuous and discrete variables. MVOPs including dimensional variables are characterized by a variable-size search space. Depending on the values of dimensional variables, the number and type of the variables of the problem can vary dynamically. MVOPs and variable-size MVOPs (VMVOPs) are difficult to solve and raise a number of scientific challenges in the design of metaheuristics. Standard metaheuristics have been first designed to address continuous or discrete optimization problems, and are not able to tackle VMVOPs in an efficient way. The development of metaheuristics for solving such problems has attracted the attention of many researchers and is increasingly popular. However, to our knowledge there is no well established taxonomy or comprehensive survey for handling this important family of optimization problems. This paper presents an unified taxonomy for metaheuristic solutions for solving VMVOPs in an attempt to provide a common terminology and classification mechanisms. It provides a general mathematical formulation and concepts of VMVOPs, and identifies the various solving methodologies than can be applied in metaheuristics. The advantages, the weaknesses and the limitations of the presented methodologies are discussed. The proposed taxonomy also allows to identify some open research issues which needs further in-depth investigations.},

A straightforward way to overcome this undesirable issue is to adapt the weights during the evolutionary process. However, existing methods, which typically adapt many weights at a time, may hinder the convergence of the population since changing weights essentially means changing sub-problems to be optimised. In this paper, we aim to tackle this issue by designing a steady-state weight adaptation (SSWA) method. SSWA employs a stable approach to maintain/update an archive (which stores high-quality solutions during the search). Based on the archive, at each generation, SSWA selects one solution from it to generate only one new weight while simultaneously removing an existing weight. We compare SSWA with eight state-of-the-art weight adaptative decomposition-based MOEAs and show its general outperformance on problems with various Pareto front shapes.},

In the literature, as a derivative of this type of optimization issue, hyperparameter optimization of transfer learning (TL) architectures is not efficiently analyzed as a detailed survey in the literature. In this paper, the optimized TL-based models are effectively examined to handle this issue which constitutes the main aim of our study. For evaluation, knee osteoarthritis (KOA – a chronic degenerative joint disorder) dataset is handled to perform two challenging classification tasks which reveal the second aim of our study, i.e. binary- and multi-categorizations on KOA X-ray images. To fine-tune the hyperparameters of TL models, state-of-the-art optimization methods are chosen and compared on this competitive – NP-hard problem. Sixteen optimized architectures are designed using four efficient optimization methods (ASPSO, CDW-PSO, CSA, MSGO) and four oft-used TL models (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, ResNet50, ShuffleNet) to classify the X-ray KOA images. Regarding the experiments on both categorization tasks, the MSGO algorithm arises as more robust to be considered for hyperparameter tuning of TL-based models by achieving reliable performance. In addition, it&#39;s seen that MobileNetV2 and ResNet-based models come to the forefront for X-ray imaging-based classification by achieving high accuracy rates due to the usage of residual blocks. Consequently, in terms of mean accuracy, ResNet50-MSGO and MobileNetV2-CSA respectively record 93.15 % and 93.29 % success rates on multiclass categorization, while ResNet18-CDW-PSO and MobileNetV2-MSGO provide the same highest score of 99.43 % on binary categorization.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization problems (DCMOPs) involve objectives, constraints, and parameters that change over time. This kind of problem presents a greater challenge for evolutionary algorithms because it requires the population to quickly track the changing pareto-optimal set (PS) under constrained conditions while maintaining the feasibility and good distribution of the population. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm based on co-evolution and diversity enhancement (CEDE), in which we have made improvements to both the static optimization and dynamic response parts, innovatively utilizing the valuable information latent in the optimization process to help the population evolve more comprehensively. The static optimization involves the co-evolution of three populations, through which their mutual synergy can more comprehensively identify potential true PS and provide more useful historical information for dynamic response. Additionally, to prevent the elimination of potentially valuable infeasible individuals (i.e., individuals that are not dominated by feasible individuals) due to pareto domination, we employ an archive set to store and update these individuals. When the environment changes, to effectively enhance population diversity under complex dynamic constraints and help the population to respond quickly to changes, we propose a diversity enhancement strategy, which includes a diversity maintenance strategy and a center point-based exploration strategy. This strategy effectively enhances population diversity in complex and changing environments, helping the population respond quickly to changes. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through two test sets. The experimental results show that CEDE can effectively use valuable information to cope with complex dynamic constraint environments. Compared with several of the most advanced algorithms, it is superior in 94% of the test problems, demonstrating strong competitiveness in handling DCMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Most studies in dynamic multi-objective optimization have predominantly focused on rapidly and accurately tracking changes in the Pareto optimal front (POF) and Pareto optimal set (POS) when the environment undergoes changes. However, there are real-world scenarios where it is necessary to simultaneously solve changing objective functions and satisfy the preference of Decision Makers (DMs). In particular, the DMs may be only interested in a partial region of the POF, known as the region of interest (ROI), rather than requiring the entire POF. To meet the challenge of simultaneously predicting a changing POF and/or POS and dynamic ROI, this paper proposes a new dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEAs) based on the preference. The proposed algorithm consists of three key components: an evolutionary direction adjustment strategy based on changing reference points to accommodate shifts in preferences, an angle-based search strategy for tracking the varying ROI, and a hybrid prediction strategy that combines linear prediction models and population manifold estimation within the ROI to ensure convergence and distribution in scenarios where preferences remain unchanged. Experimental studies conducted on 30 widely used benchmark problems in which it outperforms contrasting algorithms on 71% of test suits. Empirical results demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed algorithm over existing state-of-the-art DMOEAs.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution multi-objective algorithms effectively address problems with two or three objectives. However, many-objective problems with more than three objectives are challenging because of inadequate selection pressure in environment selection, excessive variation in mutation, and difficulties in representing the Pareto front. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines differential evolution with a knee-oriented strategy to address the mentioned challenges. The approach allows the algorithm to focus on trade-off solutions for representing the surface instead of searching the entire Pareto front. Specifically, the algorithm consists of two stages: knee exploration stage and knee exploitation stage. Each stage utilizes different dominance relationships and mutation operators to enhance selection pressure in high-dimensional spaces. Moreover, a Manhattan distance-domination range is designed to update the reference vector by identifying multiple localized knee points in high-dimensional space. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance to other state-of-the-art algorithms on 50 knee-oriented benchmark problem test sets, including CKP, DO2DK, DEB2DK, DEB3DK, and PMOPs.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the bi-level multi-objective optimization problems (MOP) that raise in robust design and optimization of engineering systems through establishing a state-of-the-art game theoretic scenario. A novel leader-follower decentralized decision-making scenario is proposed, leveraging the synergy of game theory, Robust Design Optimization (RDO), Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The proposed algorithm can be employed for optimum robust Pareto design of a wide range of dynamical systems. In order to achieve a robust design, both the mean and variance of each objective function are considered as players in a multi-agent game setting. In this approach, both Stackelberg and cooperative games are utilized to model the behaviors of the players. Genetic Programming (GP) meta-models are employed to capture the Stackelberg protocol between two levels specifically for constructing the follower&#39;s rational reaction set (RRS). Additionally, the Nash bargaining function is -utilize to model the cooperative behaviors among players in each level. The proposed approach is applied and demonstrated through a case study involving multi-objective robust design of planar four-bar linkages. In this manner, four objective functions are assigned to four players within the system. Each player is responsible for optimizing a specific objective criterion, namely the mean of tracking error (TE), variance of tracking error, mean of transmission angle and variance of transmission angle (TA) of the linkage. As a result, the four-objective optimization problem of mechanism is transformed into a single-objective robust synthesis problem. The comparisons of the results show a significant enhancement in the robust behavior of the linkage, while ensuring that deterministic criteria such as quality of motion and precision are preserved.},

  abstract     = {To improve the effectiveness of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) in solving high-dimensional expensive optimization problems with multi-polar and multi-variable coupling properties, a new approach called DRBM-ASRL is proposed. This approach leverages restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) for feature learning and reinforcement learning for adaptive strategy selection. DRBM-ASRL integrates four search strategies based on three heterogeneous surrogate modeling approaches, each catering to different preferences. Two of these strategies focus on generative sampling in the subspaces with varying dimensions, while the other two aim to explore the local and global landscapes in the high-dimensional source space. This allows for more effective tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation in the solution space. Reinforcement learning is employed to adaptively prioritize the search strategies during optimization , based on the online feedback information from the optimal solution. In addition, to enhance the representation of potentially optimal samples in the solution space, two task-driven RBMs are separately trained to construct a feature subspace and reconstruct the features of the source space. DRBM-ASRL has been evaluated on various high-dimensional benchmarks ranging from 50 to 200 dimensions, as well as 14 CEC 2013 complex benchmark problems with 100 dimensions and a power system problem with 118 dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate its superior convergence performance and optimization efficiency compared to eight state-of-the-art SAEAs.},

However, the majority of multi-objective algorithms (MOEAs) are unable to achieve good performance on the TREE problems due to their huge search space with complicated decision variable interactions. In this paper, we propose a problem knowledge driven bi-population cooperative framework, where the knowledge (i.e., the optimal values of most decision variables in each TREE problem are similar) is exploited to enhance the convergence of algorithm for the huge search space. The proposed framework holds a weak cooperation between two populations to achieve the assistance in tackling the original TREE problems. To this aim, when the proposed framework evolves one population by a general MOEA, it evolves the other population by a sparse MOEA to assist generation of solutions that have many similar decision variables, thus promoting the convergence towards the Pareto optimal fronts of TREE problems. In the experiments, we investigate the performance of the proposed framework on five TREE problems with their number of decision variables ranging from 3000 to 15000. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms seven competitors, both in terms of final results and convergence performance.},

Furthermore, the pressure of computing resources and complex evolution processes pose challenges to search and balancing strategy. In this paper, an agent-assisted heterogeneous learning swarm optimizer is proposed. First, a global and local search collaborative particle learning structure is proposed, called a heterogeneous learning structure. The population distribution in the decision and objective spaces are used to select global and local search examples, respectively. Secondly, an agent-assisted evolutionary search is proposed, which evaluates the individual’s state in decision space and objective space and controls the global and local search structures to adapt to the evolutionary requirements of individuals in different evolutionary states. Finally, hierarchical resource allocation and level-based global search example selection mechanisms are proposed on the local and global search structures to maintain the balance between diversity and convergence. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, comprehensive and extensive experiments were conducted on a commonly used large-scale benchmark suite. Experiments show that compared with ten state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior performance in most cases.},

Allowing such features increases the usual diversity obtained by the communication topologies and migration policies by homogeneous PIMs (HoPIMs). Previous (non-reconfigurable) heterogeneous PIMs (HePIMs) were able to provide competitive solutions regarding the HoPIMs. By adding the reconfiguration capability, PIMs can change dynamically from executing one evolutionary algorithm to another. In this manner, the required diversity and flexibility to outperform HoPIMs and HePIMs is achieved. This paper discusses policies to profit from the feature of reconfigurability on HePIM models and provides an innovative and successful stagnation-based reconfiguration policy.

The proposed method was used to create a ranking for contestants of the CEC 2022 competition on single objective bound constrained numerical optimization. The resulting ranking is different from the official one. The ranks of some algorithms differ by up to five. As the proposed ranking is more focused on the results at the end of the budget, winning algorithms are better suited for most real-world applications. Since the tuning effort influences the algorithm’s results, the paper also examines the influence of parameter tuning on the place achieved in both rankings by the top four algorithms. The parameters to tune were extracted from the papers that introduced the algorithms and from the source codes. The results showed that all considered algorithms were not carefully tuned for CEC. Generally, tuning using the target performance metric helps, but tuning using the other metric is harmful. The profit of tuning is up to a 33% increase in the number of trails that found the global optimum. The ablation analyses of the algorithms’ parameters showed that only a few parameters strongly influence the results. Frequently, parameters not listed in the papers are among the most important.},

Due to the large number of decision variables involved, it is not easy for existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to search the entire decision variable space with limited computation resources. To address the above problem, a large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on problem transformation, called LSMOEA/PT, is presented in this paper. LSMOEA/PT uses an improved problem transformation strategy to transform LSMOPs into small-scale multi-objective problems to accelerate convergence speed and reduce computational resources. Specifically, The transformation strategy selects reference solutions to initialize a weight population by applying the opposite individual method. After optimizing the weight population, a dual line strategy is implemented to combine the weight vectors with the decision variables from the original population, thereby generating a new population. The new population is combined with the original population for environment selection. In LSMOEA/PT, a double learning swarm optimizer is introduced to speed up the convergence of the population. A uniform distribution strategy is conducted to update transformed solutions after the problem transformation process, increasing the diversity of the population. Experimental results show that LSMOEA/PT is competitive with eleven state-of-the-art algorithms on large-scale multi-objective optimization test problems with up to 2000 decision variables.},

However, balancing convergence and diversity is challenging as a single strategy can only address a particular type of DMOP. To solve this issue, a dynamic multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm with adaptive boosting (AB-DMOEA) is proposed in this paper. In the AB-DMOEA, an adaptive boosting response mechanism will increase the weights of high-performing strategies, including those based on prediction, memory, and diversity, which have been improved and integrated into the mechanism to tackle various problems. Additionally, the dominated solutions reinforcement strategy optimizes the population to ensure the effective operation of the above mechanism. In static optimization, the static optimization boosting mechanism selects the appropriate static multi-objective optimizer for the current problem. AB-DMOEA is compared with the other seven state-of-the-art DMOEAs on 35 benchmark DMOPs. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of the AB-DMOEA is superior or comparable to that of the compared algorithms.

  abstract     = {The role of multi-area economic dispatch (MAED) in power system operation is increasingly significant. It is a non-linear and multi-constraint problem with many local extremes when considering the valve point effects, posing challenges in obtaining a globally optimal solution, especially for large-scale systems. In this study, an improved variant of differential evolution (DE) called CLDE based on comprehensive learning strategy (CLS) is proposed to solve this problem. Three improved strategies are employed to enhance the performance of CLDE. (1) A CLS-based guided mutation strategy is proposed, in which learning exemplars constructed by competent individuals are used to generate mutant vectors to prevent the searching away from global optimum and speed up convergence. (2) A time-varying increasing crossover rate is devised. It can endow CLDE with a larger probability at the later stage to help individuals escape from local extremes. (3) A CLS-based crossover strategy is presented. Trial vectors directly utilize the information from learning exemplars for evolving, which can ensure the search efficiency and population diversity. CLDE is applied to six MAED cases. Compared with DE, it approximately consumes 32 %, 35 %, 10 %, 22 %, 62 %, and 20 % of evaluations to attain comparable results, saves 126.2544$/h, 81.8173$/h, 152.0660$/h, 360.7907$/h, 65.5757$/h, and 1732.8544$/h in fuel costs on average, and exhibits improvements of 34.77 %, 1.80 %, 0.00 %, 76.09 %, 95.15 %, and 16.76 % in robustness, respectively. Moreover, it also outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms significantly in statistical analysis. Furthermore, the effects of improved strategies on CLDE are thoroughly investigated.},

  abstract     = {Precast scheduling is a special case of optimization problem, in which the curing stage requires parallel processing of a batch of jobs. In this study, distributed flexible job shop scheduling with crane transportation, fuzzy processing, and curing constraints is modeled for precast scheduling. Three objectives are considered simultaneously, namely, fuzzy makespan, energy consumption, and economic cost. To solve this complex problem, a bi-level collaborative multi-objective optimization evolution algorithm (BCMOEA) is developed. First, a double-Q network is designed considering different groups of features to generate valuable solutions for the second-level components. Then, a dynamic-adjusted reference point set is embedded to divide the current population into three sub-populations. Furthermore, a collaboration mechanism is developed to learn different knowledge from these sub-populations to balance the convergence and diversity abilities. Moreover, a knowledge driven curing batching heuristic is designed to improve the fuzzy makespan. Finally, a set of instances generated based on the realistic precast process is tested, and detailed comparisons with the state-of-the-art algorithms show the competitive performances of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) plays a crucial role in high-dimensional classification problems by identifying relevant features that contribute to model performance. Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has recently shown success in FS problems. However, existing EMT-based FS methods have limitations in terms of diversity in task construction, evolutionary search, and knowledge transfer, leading to inadequate acquisition, exploration, and utilization of knowledge. To this end, this paper develops a novel EMT framework for multi-objective high-dimensional FS problems, namely MO-FSEMT. In particular, multiple auxiliary tasks are constructed by distinct formulation methods to provide diverse search spaces and information representations and then simultaneously addressed with the original task by leveraging multiple evolutionary solvers with different biases and search preferences. A task-specific-based knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to leverage the advantageous information from each task, facilitating the discovery and effective transmission of high-quality solutions during the search process. Comprehensive experimental results on 27 real high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the superiority of MO-FSEMT over state-of-the-art FS methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of key components of the proposed MO-FSEMT.},

  abstract     = {Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning and meta-heuristic techniques represents a new research direction for enhancing the search capabilities of meta-heuristic methods in the context of production scheduling. Q-learning is a prominent reinforcement learning in which its utilization aims to direct the selection of actions, thus preventing the necessity for a random exploration in the iterative process of the metaheuristics. In this study, we provide Q-learning guided algorithms for the Bi-Criteria No-Wait Flowshop Scheduling Problem (NWFSP). The problem is treated as a bi-criteria combinatorial optimization problem where total flow time and makespan are optimized simultaneously. Firstly, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is provided. Then, Q-learning guided algorithms are developed: Bi-Criteria Iterated Greedy Algorithm with Q-Learning (BC-IG QL ). Bi-Criteria Block Insertion Heuristic Algorithm with Q-Learning (BC-BIH QL ). Moreover, the performance of the proposed Q-learning guided algorithms is compared over a collection of Bi-Criteria Genetic Local Search Algorithms (BC-GLS), Bi-Criteria Iterated Greedy Algorithm (BC-IG), Bi-Criteria Iterated Greedy Algorithm with a Local Search (BC-IG ALL ) and Bi-Criteria Variable Block Insertion Heuristic Algorithm (BC-VBIH). The complete computational experiment, performed on 480 problem instances of Vallada et al. (2015), which is known as the VRF benchmark set, indicates that the BC-BIH QL and the BC-IG QL algorithms outperform the BC-GLS, BC-IG, BC-IG ALL, and BC-VBIH algorithms in comparative performance metrics. More specifically, the proposed BC-BIH QL and BC-IG QL algorithms can yield more non-dominated bi-criteria solutions with the most substantial competitiveness than the remaining algorithms. At the same time, both are competitive with each other on the benchmark problems. Moreover, the BC-IG QL algorithm dominates almost 97% and 99% of the solutions reached by the BC-IG, BC-IG ALL , and BC-VBIH algorithms in small and large datasets. Similarly, The BC-BIH QL algorithm dominates almost 98% and 99% of the solutions reached by the BC-IG, BC-IG ALL , and BC-VBIH algorithms in small and large datasets, respectively. This means that, among all the features that have been compared, the Q-learning-guided algorithms demonstrate the highest level of competitiveness. The outcomes of this study encourage us to discover many more bi-criteria NWFSPs to reveal the trade-off between other conflicting objectives, such as makespan &amp; the number of early jobs, to overcome various industries&#39; problems.},

  abstract     = {When dealing with optimisation problems, Metaheuristics (MHs) quickly come to our minds. A quick literature review reveals a vast universe of MHs. Although the metaphors behind these MHs are always presented as ‘unique’ to justify their novelty, the truth is that many MHs just recombine elements from other techniques. Then, instead of proposing MHs based on what already exists in nature, it is better to follow a standard model for the automatic metaheuristic design by employing simple heuristics. Many approaches have designed algorithms that probe the combination of such heuristics, generating astonishing results compared to generic MHs. Following this idea, our work examines Neural Network (NN) architectures over several control variables to tailor MHs. Our results render an architecture that enhances the results compared to generic MHs at 91%, those MHs produced by Random Search at 81%, and the current state-of-the-art NN model at 66%. We notice a big gap for NN-based models with different architectures, which are worth investigating. Among the benefits of our proposed approach is that it reduces the dependence on human knowledge, moving towards the automatic generation of solving methods that learn from empirical data how to succeed in various continuous optimisation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach for improving gas source localization in dynamic urban environments, employing a swarm of nano-Crazyflie drones through a hybrid strategy that integrates Adaptive Robotic Particle Swarm Optimization (ARPSO) with Bidirectional Brain Emotional Learning (BBEL). The proposed method refines the ARPSO algorithm into two phases: an initial exploration phase and a subsequent seeking phase. The exploration phase activates when no gas is detected, seamlessly transitioning to the seeking phase upon gas detection. This facilitates efficient information exchange and desired velocity generation within the particle swarm. During the seeking phase, particles conduct measurements, share the global best position, intelligently navigate obstacles, and avoid collisions while directly identifying the global concentration field maximum. Unlike conventional methods, the ARPSO algorithm autonomously adapts its parameters online, mitigating algorithmic failures and local optima challenges. It also considers the limited communication of robots in complex environments, a factor often overlooked in recent methods. To enhance plume tracking robustness, facilitate the controller gain tuning process, and ensure system resilience against environmental disturbances and uncertainties, the BBEL method incorporates a sophisticated fuzzy neural network structure with reinforcement learning-based adaptation mechanisms. The stability of the closed-loop control system is rigorously proven using Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations in complex urban scenarios validate the algorithm’s effectiveness, showcasing a significant 20% improvement in turnaround time and a flawless 100% success rate with no collisions, in addition to enhanced capabilities in handling uncertainties and disturbances compared to benchmarks like ARPSO-BBEL with unlimited communication range and no delayed communications (ARPSO-BBELU), Sniffy Bug (SB)-BBELU, and ARPSO-PIDU.},

  abstract     = {Band selection (BS) is an important technique in remote sensing hyperspectral image (HSI) classification that captures informative bands and removes redundant bands, thereby reducing the computational overhead of the model and improving classification performance. Recently, evolutionary algorithm (EA) with good search capability has been successfully extended as an efficient BS method for processing HSIs. However, most of the existing EA-based BS methods still face following challenges: 1) Most of them are designed based on a single search strategy, which may not be sufficient to find the promising subset of bands and tend to fall into the local optimum; 2) Most of them ignore the problem of potential duplicate bands existing in the solution vectors, which leads to some performance degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes an effective unsupervised multiobjective BS approach through an adaptive particle swarm optimizer (PSO), called APSO-BS. First, a new robust unsupervised multiobjective BS model is designed, which applies information entropy to measure the amount of information contained in bands and uses the structural similarity measure to evaluate the correlation among bands. Second, to effectively solve the multiobjective BS model constructed above, an adaptive particle swarm optimizer is proposed, which first applies a pre-scoring mechanism to estimate the evolutionary states (i.e., diversity and convergence degree) of particles, and then adaptively selects different PSO search strategies for different particles according to their corresponding evolutionary states. In addition, a self-repair mechanism is designed to correct the violating individuals with duplicate bands. Therefore, our proposed method can reasonably address the two major challenges mentioned above. Finally, to evaluate the performance of APSO-BS, four common HSI datasets are adopted in our experiments, and extensive results under three different classifiers show that our proposed APSO-BS outperforms several state-of-the-art BS methods.},

The DNN model is gradually generated in an adaptive updating manner, and is used to indicate the truss design problem. In addition, the transformed minimization problem can be efficiently solved by DNN computation and a population of trusses can be optimized accordingly. Through the investigation of four truss design problems (two standard optimization problems and two optimization problems considering the design diversity), the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated. In addition, three aspects affecting the performance of the proposed method are also investigated, and the robustness and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated.},

Extensive research has been conducted by numerous scholars on the identification of bottleneck machines; however, there is a relative scarcity of research, particularly in the context of flexible manufacturing systems, regarding how to effectively alleviate the identified bottlenecks. In this paper, a novel hyper-heuristic evolutionary scheduling algorithm with a bottleneck alleviation strategy based on the information-energy flow model (HESA-BA-IEF) is proposed for training dispatching rules and optimizing decision-making in flexible job shops with bottleneck machines. HESA-BA-IEF constructs an information-energy flow model for flexible job shops based on complex networks. Through this model, dynamic changes in machine processing status and energy consumption during the scheduling process can be effectively simulated, facilitating the accurate identification of bottleneck machines. Moreover, the algorithm adopts the genetic programming hyper-heuristics and introduces a scheduling mechanism considering the alleviation of bottleneck machines to optimize the makespan and total energy consumption, while simultaneously alleviating bottlenecks. Experiments show that HESA-BA-IEF generates dispatching rules that optimize scheduling and alleviate bottlenecks simultaneously. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals a 7.71% reduction in bottleneck metrics of production line due to 30.40% scheduling rounds with bottleneck alleviation mechanism in effect.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration (PCR) is an important task in both computer vision and pattern recognition. However, since the success of most existing two-stage PCR methods largely depends on the implicit assumption that the first coarse registration stage can provide an approximately optimal initial transformation for the second fine stage, these methods suffer from low success rate when the assumption is not satisfied. Evolutionary multitasking can find better solutions for multiple tasks simultaneously by transferring knowledge among multiple related tasks. Inspired by evolutionary multitasking, this study proposes a sampling-based multitask optimization method for PCR, which solves the problem of low registration success rate by sharing knowledge between two related tasks generated by a dataset. Specifically, one task is for roughly aligning the sampled point cloud, and the other is for the original unsampled point cloud. The main purpose of the first task is to continuously provide useful knowledge to the second task so that it can achieve precise alignment. Then, a new knowledge transfer mechanism guided by historical information is proposed, which can effectively adjust the search behavior of the original unsampled task. In addition, we develop a dynamic task complement strategy to complement the accuracy that may be lost by downsampling. The results on five different datasets show that the proposed method can achieve higher registration accuracy with higher success rate compared to other state-of-the-art PCR methods.},

  abstract     = {UAV technology is rapidly advancing and widely utilized, particularly in social and military domains, due to its extensive motion and maneuverability. Coordinating multiple UAVs enables more rapid and efficient task execution compared to a single UAV. The proliferation of UAVs across various sectors, including entertainment, transportation, delivery, and social domains, as well as military applications such as surveillance, tracking, and attack, has spurred research in swarm systems. In this study, a new swarm topology is presented by combining the Consensus-Based Virtual Leader Tracking Swarm Algorithm (CBVLTSA), which provides formation control in swarm systems, with the Goal Distance-based Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree with Particle Swarm Optimization (GDRRT*-PSO) route planning algorithm. Recently proposed, GDRRT* is notable for its efficient operation in expansive environments and rapid convergence to the goal. Within this framework, the path generated by GDRRT* is optimized using PSO to yield the shortest current route. CBVLTSA employs a potential push and pull function to facilitate cooperative, coordinated flight among swarm members. While applying pushing force to avoid collisions with each other and obstacles, members also exert pulling force to maintain flight formation while navigating to target points. This ensures controlled flight formation and collision-free traversal along the GDRRT*-PSO route. Consequently, unlike the others, the proposed algorithm achieves faster target reach with pre-planned routes, demonstrating a robust and flexible swarm topology with CBVLTSA. Moreover, we anticipate the significant utility of this algorithm across various swarm applications, including target detection, observation, tracking, trade and transportation logistics, and collective defense and attack strategies.},

Here, we develop a general model to explore the evolution of direct and indirect reciprocity on networks. Drawing on our model, we derive a simple rule for cooperation to evolve through reciprocity. Applying this rule to 1 million random networks, we investigate how network topology influences evolutionary outcomes. We find that, in general, direct reciprocity is easier to promote cooperation on these networks. Additionally, direct reciprocity remains robust when a population adapts to the environment through social learning. Notably, environmental fluctuations significantly lower the threshold for cooperation through indirect reciprocity. Overall, our work sheds light on a fresh framework for comprehending the evolution of reciprocity.},

  abstract     = {A series of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed to handle expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs). However, the surrogate of these SAEAs is underutilized to a large extent, which limits the search efficiency of these algorithms. To be specific, existing algorithms do not sufficiently exploit the estimated solution quality information from the surrogate models during offspring generation. To address this issue, this paper proposes an SAEA framework named EXO-SAEA (EXplanation Operator based Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm). First, it divides the current population into two populations according to the a priori knowledge from the surrogate model. Then, for each solution in the first population, EXO-SAEA employs the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model to estimate the contribution of each decision variable to the fitness values. After that, the Shapley values are then normalized for the offspring generation of the first population, while the second population uses generic GA operators. Two representative surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are used to instantiate the proposed framework. Experimental results on the synthetic benchmark problems and three real-world problems involving six state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Influence Maximization (IM) is a critical problem in social network analysis and marketing. It involves identifying a subset of nodes in a social network whose activation or influence can lead to the maximal spread of information, ideas, or behaviors within the network. Although many approaches have been developed in the literature to deal with this problem, most of these approaches are ineffective in dealing with large-scale social networks due to free parameters and computational complexity. Embeddings are used to learn low-dimensional representations of nodes in a social network. These embeddings capture the structural and semantic information of nodes and their relationships within the network. By training deep learning models on graph-structured data, node embeddings can capture complex patterns and dependencies in social networks, enabling more effective downstream tasks such as IM. Accordingly, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm to address the IM problem in social networks using deep learning-based Node Embedding (IMNE), which includes shell decomposition, graph/node embedding, and search space reduction as well as the use of local structural features. Our approach combines the power of deep learning for representation learning with the rich structural information present in social networks to address the challenge of IM in complex and dynamic social networks. IMNE uses the Independent Cascade (IC) information diffusion model to determine the labels needed to train the model by calculating the influence of nodes. Experimental results on several real-world networks considering different performance metrics show that IMNE performs better compared to existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The fixed-charge transportation (FCT) problem, an extension of the classical transportation problem, holds significance in practical logistics scenarios where fixed charges play a crucial role. Fixed charges categorize it as an NP-hard problem, posing challenges for conventional methods due to their inefficiency, high computational costs, and susceptibility to local optima. This paper introduces an enhanced evolutionary algorithm, offline learning-based competitive swarm optimization (OLCSO), tailored to address the FCT problems efficiently. OLCSO draws inspiration from offline learning, where particles benefit from the experiences of high performers. The algorithm incorporates (i) a ranking-based mechanism where losers learn from peer-to-peer winners based on their ranks, (ii) a two-phase cooperative evolutionary mechanism enhancing searchability and convergence of the algorithm. In the first phase, losers learn from personal best experiences and the shifted center of the population, boosting diversity. In the second phase, losers learn from winners and the center of the population, improving exploitation, (iii) a mutation strategy is embedded to update winner locations in each evolutionary procedure, and (iv) to ensure a feasible solution to FCT problems, the paper also introduces negative and fractional repair mechanisms. OLCSO is applied to solve two sets of FCT problems, linear and non-linear. Experimental results are compared with various heuristic and metaheuristic techniques, commonly used for these problems, using diverse metrics. A comparative analysis of OLCSO’s design elements is also conducted. The results demonstrate OLCSO’s superiority over existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Ethylene is one of the important basic raw materials for the modern chemical production, accounting for over 75 % of petrochemical products. And the ethylene cracking furnace is subject to coking problems that can impede the thermal conductivity of the reaction tube. Therefore, an improved multi-objective dragonfly optimization algorithm based on quantum behavior is proposed. The particle evolutionary model introduces the quantum bound state δ-potential well model, which improves the global convergence ability and the convergence speed of the dragonfly optimization algorithm. In addition, the calculation formulas for parameters are improved by introducing natural logarithm and the iterative search method is changed to a triple search. Moreover, the global convergence and local search ability of the quantum behavior enhancement algorithm is assisted by adaptively selecting the search strategy according to the current number of iterations of the improved dragonfly algorithm. Compared with other multi-objective optimization algorithms on the ZDT and CEC test functions, the proposed algorithm has good global convergence and local search capabilities in terms of the inverted general distance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied in the multi-objective optimization of an ethylene cracking furnace, with the ethylene yield and the propylene yield as optimization objectives. The experimental results show that the ethylene yield can be increased by 1.5498 %, while the propylene yield decreases by only 0.0081 %, which proves that the proposed algorithm achieves better effect in optimizing the main product yield under fixed cycle adjustment operating conditions compared to original operating conditions.},

Existing sparse evolutionary algorithms utilize single or multiple guiding vectors to direct the generation of offspring solutions in a constant manner according to human experience, which are difficult to determine the best guiding vector for various population states and prone to falling into premature convergence. To address the dilemma in guiding vector adaptation, this paper proposes a novel guiding vector selection method based on reinforcement learning. In the proposed method, the features extracted from the current population are regarded as states, the overall degrees of improvement in population convergence and diversity are regarded as rewards, and the candidate guiding vectors are regarded as actions. By using deep neural networks to establish the mapping model between population states and the expected cumulative rewards of guiding vectors, the proposed method can determine the best guiding vector for the current population at each generation. The selected guiding vector inspires the development of novel genetic operators, which can approximate sparse Pareto optimal solutions in high-dimensional decision spaces. Experimental results on both benchmark and real-world SMOPs demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages when compared with the state-of-the-art.},

By decomposing the MOFJSP into distinct sub-problems based on preferences and leveraging a parallel multi-objective training algorithm, our method efficiently produces high-quality Pareto sets, significantly outperforming MOEA methods in both solution quality and speed, especially for large-scale problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach, with remarkable results on large instances, showcasing its potential for real-time scheduling in dynamic manufacturing environments. Notably, for large instances (50 × 20), our approach outperforms MOEA baselines with remarkably shorter computation time (less than 1% of that of MOEA baselines). The robust generalization performance across various instances also highlights the practical value of our method for decision-makers seeking optimized production resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {For the blocking flowshop group scheduling problem (BFGSP), this study addresses its high computational burden associated with insertion operations due to over-much objective function calculations as the number of groups and jobs increases. Unfortunately, the existing rapid evaluation methods exhibit limitations when handling group-based insertion, blocking constraint, total flow time, and total tardiness time criteria. We emphasize the need for improved rapid evaluation techniques tailored to these limitations and propose the theoretical analysis and methods of a critical machine-based rapid evaluation for total flow time and tardiness criteria of BFGSP. More specifically, first, under the two scenarios of the group and job scheduling, we propose the concept of the critical machines, three theorems, one corollary, and their corresponding proofs, respectively. Secondly, we present rapid evaluation methods for group insertion and job insertion, respectively, namely R a p i d _ g r o u p Rapid_group and R a p i d _ j o b Rapid_job based on the above theorems and corollary. We find that it is unnecessary to start the computation from the first machine when scheduling the changed groups or jobs, and it suffices to begin the computation from the critical machine, thus reducing the computational cost. Finally, we conduct five experiments on four well-known benchmarks (a total of 6000 instances). Through statistical analysis, it becomes evident that our computational efforts have decreased significantly in computing both the total flow time and the total tardiness time for group-based and jobs-based insertion operations. The development of rapid evaluation mechanisms is a promising approach to mitigate the time complexity by reducing the number of machines involved in the evaluation, and makes up for gaps in existing accelerated evaluation methods for BFGSP.},

  abstract     = {With the development of science and technology, high-dimensional global optimization problems have become increasingly prevalent for scientific research and engineering, such as gene recognition, vehicle routing, job scheduling, and network topology. These problems are typically characterized by enormous and complex search spaces and numerous local minima, making it challenging to find the global optimal solution with limited computing resources. This paper introduces an enhanced sparrow search swarm optimizer (ESSSO) based on a bio-mimetic method. The ESSSO employs an adaptive sinusoidal walk strategy based on the von Mises distribution, a learning strategy utilizing roulette wheel selection, a two-stage evolution strategy, and a selection mutation strategy to address these issues. The proposed sinusoidal walk strategy, grounded in the von Mises distribution, supports a balanced evolutionary search. This mechanism disperses the individuals in a swarm in various directions based on a circular normal distribution. It then leads the search and adaptively adjusts their step sizes according to the size of the search domain during each generation of evolution. The learning strategy, based on roulette wheel selection, enhances the diversity of the population and improves the global search capability of the algorithm during the initial iterations. The two-stage evolution strategy involves a sine-learning mechanism based on the von Mises distribution and an adaptive mutation mechanism. The former is designed to boost the convergence speed of ESSSO, while the latter prevents ESSSO from getting trapped in a local optimum. Additionally, the selection mutation strategy further enhances convergence speed while maintaining population diversity. These strategies promote exploration in the early stages of evolution and exploitation in the later stages, enabling a well-balanced search for optimal solutions. We conducted comprehensive experiments two standard benchmark sets (i.e., CEC2010 and CEC2013), antenna array optimization, feature selection, and four engineering design problems. The results indicate that ESSSO outperforms ten comparison algorithms, especially in scenarios with smaller population sizes. This confirms its effectiveness in high-dimensional global optimization tasks and demonstrates that it can achieve better results with less computational resource consumption.},

  abstract     = {The application of hybrid seru manufacturing in real-world production often necessitates the implementation of a worker transfer strategy to overcome limitations in skill levels and realize the co-optimization of production efficiency and worker workload. Therefore, this study focuses on hybrid seru system scheduling considering worker transfer (HSSWT) to minimize both the makespan and the total labor time. The presence of multiple optimization objectives and coupled subproblems results in a considerably large search space, which poses challenges that existing optimization frameworks cannot effectively address. Thus, we propose a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive decomposition algorithm (RLADA) to address this issue. First, to minimize the search space, the HSSWT is decomposed into two subproblems, each utilizing distinct search strategies to explore specific areas. Elite-driven population evolution and a lower bound-guided greedy search are proposed to solve the individual subproblems. Second, a deep Q-network has been developed to adaptively select the subproblem to optimize in each generation by dynamically dividing the objective space. Finally, to narrow the search space, the lower bound is used to filter out unpromising solutions, thereby avoiding invalid searches. Additionally, the lower bound is utilized to determine the search depth according to the optimization margin, helping to conserve computing resources. Extensive comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the specialized designs, and the RLADA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution convergence and diversity when addressing the HSSWT.},

This paper proposes a novel problem of optimizing the reconfiguration capability of distribution networks (DNs) by considering the expansion of power lines under resource constraints. The reconfiguration capability reflects the ability of a DN to respond to uncertainties and disturbances by adjusting its topology. A novel metric based on the number of spanning trees is proposed to quantify the reconfiguration capability of a DN. Moreover, an optimization model is formulated to maximize the reconfiguration capability of a DN subject to resource constraints on line expansions. To solve this model efficiently, a multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is developed, which can optimize multiple tasks with different expansion line quantities simultaneously by exploiting knowledge transfer across tasks. The proposed metric, model, and algorithm are validated on two case studies using the IEEE 33-bus and 70-bus test systems, and the results show their effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.},

To address these challenges, we present a Two-Stage LLVM Option Sequence Optimization Method to Minimize Energy Consumption (TSOMFEC). In the first stage, we propose an Option Selection algorithm based on Pattern Mining (OSPM). OSPM integrates a pattern mining algorithm and CRC algorithm to precisely preselect options, with the goal of reducing the search space of option sequences while guaranteeing optimization quality. In the second stage, we present an Option Sequence Evolutionary Algorithm (OSOA). OSOA encodes options and their positions in the sequence as individual items and then constructs an item interaction graph to capture complex interactions among different items. The item interaction graph is utilized in a genetic algorithm to reduce actual energy consumption evaluations and rapidly obtain high-quality option sequences. We evaluate the performance of TSOMFEC by comparing it with four state-of-the-art methods across eight typical embedded programs in terms of solution quality and optimization time. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of both OSPM and item interaction graph. The experimental results demonstrate that TSOMFEC not only achieves the best solution quality but also spends the least optimization time. It obtains average energy consumption improvement percentages relative to the -O3 level of 0.075, along with average optimization time of 3178 s. Moreover, the effectiveness of both OSPM and the item interaction graph has been validated.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration entails the estimation of the rigid transformation which best aligns two point sets. At present, Iterative Closest Point is arguably the best-known and one of the most effective algorithms for point cloud registration. Iterative Closest Point uses singular value decomposition to optimise the alignment of two point sets via least squares fit. However, the algorithm is liable to converge to sub-optimal solutions due to its greedy search strategy. In this study, the problem of point cloud registration is addressed using the popular Bees Algorithm metaheuristic. Thanks to its global search strategy, the Bees Algorithm is known to be impervious to sub-optimal convergence. Singular value decomposition is used as a problem-specific operator within the Bees Algorithm to improve the efficiency of the search. Experimental tests showed that the standard Bees Algorithm outperformed Iterative Closest Point, an Evolutionary Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimisation in terms of consistency and precision of the point cloud registration results. The Bees Algorithm also excelled for its robustness to noisy data. When enhanced by singular value decomposition, the Bees Algorithm outperformed the standard Bees Algorithm, and similarly enhanced evolutionary and particle swarm optimisers. The running times of the proposed method were compatible with online implementation. It is concluded that the proposed combination of bees-inspired optimisation and least squares fitting allows accurate, efficient, and consistent registration of point cloud models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the researches about solving partial differential equations (PDEs) based on artificial neural network have attracted considerable attention. In these researches, the neural network models are usually designed depend on human experience or trial and error. Despite the emergence of several model searching methods, these methods primarily concentrate on optimizing the hyperparameters of fully connected neural network model based on the framework of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and the corresponding search spaces are relatively restricted, thereby limiting the exploration of superior models. This article proposes an evolutionary computation method aimed at discovering the PINNs model with higher approximation accuracy and faster convergence rate. In addition to searching the numbers of layers and neurons per hidden layer, this method concurrently explores the optimal shortcut connections between the layers and the novel parametric activation functions expressed by the binary trees. In evolution, the strategy about dynamic population size and training epochs (DPSTE) is adopted, which significantly increases the number of models to be explored and facilitates the discovery of models with fast convergence rate. In experiments, the performance of different models that are searched through Bayesian optimization, random search and evolution is compared in solving Klein–Gordon, Burgers, and Lamé equations. The experimental results affirm that the models discovered by the proposed evolutionary computation method generally exhibit superior approximation accuracy and convergence rate, and these models also show commendable generalization performance with respect to the source term, initial and boundary conditions, equation coefficient and computational domain. The corresponding code is available at https://github.com/MathBon/Discover-PINNs-Model .},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of vehicles in urban areas draws significant attention to traffic signal control (TSC), which can enhance the efficiency of the entire network by properly switching the phases of each signalized intersection. Fixed and max-pressure methods are commonly used in TSC systems owing to their high simplicity and good interpretability, but they respectively lack dynamic adaptability and automatic rule generation, possibly leading to low solution accuracy in complicated traffic environments. Meanwhile, meta-heuristic and black-box learning methods meet challenges in practice such as extensive computational time and poor interpretability. To this end, this paper proposes a new TSC method based on Genetic Programming (GP) to generate descriptive score rules automatically for switching phases of all signalized intersections in an urban transportation network. In the proposed method, switching phases of each signalized intersection type is formulated as a symbolic regression problem, and effective primitives are defined to facilitate GP to solve the problem. Experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks. The results have validated the effectiveness of our proposed GP based method compared to several state-of-the-art TSC methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability.},

In this paper, we propose a direct fitness replacement method with generation-based fixed evolution control to implement a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that uses a surrogate model for wrapper-type feature selection, where long short-term memory is established as the learning algorithm. The importance of the work and its benefits lie in the need to reduce the excessive computational time required by conventional wrapper-type feature selection methods based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and LSTM networks, maintaining or improving the predictive capacity of the models. We analyze the use of incremental learning to update the surrogate model, in comparison with the conventional non-incremental learning approach. We applied these methods in real-life time series forecasting of air quality, indoor temperature in a smart building and oil temperature in electricity transformers. Multi-step ahead predictions of the forecast models obtained with different meta-learners of the surrogate model were compared by using the Diebold–Mariano statistical test on a multi-criteria performance metric. The proposed method outperformed other approaches for feature selection including, among others, methods based on surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms developed by the authors in previous research, other surrogate-assisted deterministic methods for feature selection and the conventional wrapper-type feature selection method based on LSTM, improving the prediction on test dataset by 23.98%, 34.61% and 13.77%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The Kriging surrogate model is less frequently employed in high-dimensional expensive problems than is the radial basis function (RBF) model. This discrepancy is attributed to the challenge of hyperparameter tuning within the Kriging covariance function, which leads to relatively worse predictive performance. However, the Kriging model still plays a crucial role in providing the predicted uncertainty for new point infill that cannot be replaced by the RBF model. To leverage the advantages of both models, a surrogate information transfer and fusion algorithm is presented. Surrogate information transfer introduces global sensitivity information from the constructed RBF model to the hyperparameter optimization of the Kriging model, reducing the dimensions of hyperparameter tuning and improving its approximation performance. Surrogate information fusion combines the RBF and Kriging models, with the RBF model providing more accurate predictions of unknown points for exploitation, while the Kriging model provides predicted uncertainty for swarm updating and new point infilling to ensure exploration of the solution space. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on eight benchmark problems and a in real-world optimization case. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the surrogate information transfer and fusion methods and the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm over the compared algorithms.},

In the algorithm, a novel environmental selection criterion based on substituting ɛ I ɛ + Iɛ+ indicator for distance is introduced to enhance the convergence, and once the selected individuals exceed the population size after multiple traversals, those with poor convergence or diversity are randomly eliminated. In addition, to tackle the irregular Pareto front shapes, the invalid reference vectors are deleted regularly, and a certain number of reference vectors with local diversity and global diversity are added, so as to conduct a overall search that combines deep search and wide search to balance exploitation and exploration.

The uncertainty violation of interval constraints can be accurately evaluated by the proposed advanced multi-objective optimization algorithm using a segmentation function without requiring multiple interval analyses. Additionally, by applying penalties to infeasible solutions in the two-stage process, partially feasible and superior infeasible solutions are retained in the early stages of evolution, while superior feasible solutions are favored in the later stages. A novel benchmark was designed and the effect of the imprecision factor on the Pareto front was examined in details. Comparisons with seven deterministic constraint handling techniques demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for solving interval constrained multi-objective optimization problems, demonstrating that PF-ICMOA is a highly competitive method for balancing the feasibility, convergence, and diversity performance characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Distributed manufacturing paradigm is becoming one of the dominant manufacturing models today. Heterogeneities between factories exist in fact due to the differences in process flexibility and machine performance. Most research focuses on identical distributed factories and overlooks the influence of heterogeneous factories on the subproblem of job allocation. This paper investigates a distributed heterogeneous permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DHPFSP) to minimize the makespan, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established. Building upon a special phenomenon of job assignment to a specific heterogeneous factory in DHPFSP, an iterated greedy algorithm with acceleration of job allocation probability (IGP) is proposed. To utilize this phenomenon, a job allocation probability matrix is introduced to describe the trend of job allocation, and a fast pass strategy with job allocation probability is suggested to speed up the algorithm search process. Furthermore, to generate a high-quality initial solution quickly for IGP, an NEH-based heuristic framework for distributed heterogeneous factory environment (NEHDHF) is proposed. In NEHDHF, several distinct initial job sequence generation strategies and a new first-f job allocation strategy are proposed for obtain a better initial solution. In computational experiments, there are 720 test instances designed and publicized. The IGP achieves 535 best solutions out of 720 instances. Statistically sound results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithms for the considered problem.},

Second, several properties of the bi-objective problem are analyzed to guide the design of local search operators for both objectives optimization. Third, the updating mechanism of the probability model is designed to learn from the elite solutions. Fourth, two knowledge-guided local search operators are designed and implemented to exploit better non-dominated solutions sufficiently. A design of experiment is carried out to determine the parameters. Extensive computational tests and comparisons with the state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms are carried out, which verify the effectiveness of the knowledge-guided local search operators, the problem-oriented heuristic-based sampling mechanism, and the special designs of the KEDA in solving the energy-efficient JRALB-FP.},

However, achieving droplets with the desired radius often entails costly design iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines machine learning algorithms with metaheuristic algorithms to leverage their respective strengths in speed and accuracy. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Rain Optimization Algorithm (ROA) in enhancing the accuracy of five machine learning models. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid model, optimized by ROA, for predicting droplet generation in a cross-junction microfluidic channel, achieving a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.937, reflecting a 3.6 % increase in accuracy. We employ symbolic regression to validate the hybrid model, yielding an R 2 value of 0.987, indicating strong agreement with real data. Furthermore, we utilize the SHAP method in Explainable AI to interpret the hybrid model&#39;s performance. Notably, the proposed hybrid model requires only four seconds to solve the prediction problem, significantly reducing computational time compared to the numerical model and experimental method. This approach facilitates the study of each input parameter&#39;s impact on droplet size prediction, offering otherwise challenging and costly insights to obtain experimentally.},

The analysis results show that the concrete temperature values calculated based on the inversion of the HPSOGWO algorithm are in good agreement with the measured values, and the HPSOGWO algorithm has good adaptability in the inversion of thermal parameters of arch dams.

  abstract     = {Multi-population-based methods are widely employed for solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). The population collaboration strategy is a critical part of multi-population algorithms, and different collaboration strategies perform well on different complex CMOPs. However, these single-population collaboration strategies are still challenging to adapt to various CMOPs with different characteristics. To address this issue, we propose a novel tri-population hybrid collaboration evolutionary algorithm called TP-HCEA, which includes a constraint-relaxed population (denoted as m a i n p o p mainpop ), a constraint-ignored auxiliary population (denoted as a u x p o p 1 auxpop1 ), and an auxiliary population (denoted as a u x p o p 2 auxpop2 ) for the original CMOP, to search optimal solutions in the feasible region. Specifically, due to the different complementarities of the two auxiliary populations, m a i n p o p mainpop collaborates with a u x p o p 1 auxpop1 and a u x p o p 2 auxpop2 in a dynamic choice between strong and weak cooperation. The effectiveness of TP-HCEA is validated through comparative analysis with seven state-of-the-art algorithms in four CMOP benchmark suites and nine real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Since the inception of Differential Evolution (DE), the vast majority of studies on it indicate that exponential crossover does not solve the real-parameter optimization in continuous spaces very well. However, we find that once the appropriate crossover rate C R CR and its corresponding parameter control are found, the DE variants with exponential crossover can achieve comparable performance with the ones employing binomial crossover. In this paper, a new DE algorithm, called Global Opposition Learning and Diversity ENhancement based DE with exponential crossover (GOLDEN-DE), is proposed to fill the gap in this field. The GOLDEN-DE algorithm has the following highlights: First, a novel global opposition learning mechanism is proposed in our GOLDEN-DE algorithm; Second, a Novel Parameter Control, namely NPC technique, with fitness-independent characteristic is incorporated in the GOLDEN-DE algorithm. Third, a novel population Diversity ENhancement (DEN) mechanism is proposed, and individuals in the stagnation status can be re-calculated in order to enhance population diversity. Fourth, a time stamp mechanism for handling too old inferior solutions in the external archive is also put forward. We evaluate the GOLDEN-DE algorithm for real-parameter single-objective global optimization on 88 benchmarks from the three universal test sets, including CEC2013, CEC2014, and CEC2017 test suites, and experiment results show that our GOLDEN-DE algorithm is competitive with several state-of-the-art DE variants.},

Given the NP-hard nature of path planning problems, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), as one of the outstanding evolutionary algorithms with robust optimization capabilities, is a good candidate to deal with them. In this study, an improved NSGA-II (INSGA-II) is proposed to solve the multi-objective path planning problems, in which path length, path safety and path smoothness are optimized simultaneously. First, a grid-based environment model is created, and each feasible solution is encoded as a discrete ordered point set. Second, a hybrid initialization strategy is employed to enrich the diversity of initial population. Third, besides the usual selection, crossover and mutation operators, problem-specific evolutionary operators are developed. In addition, an adaptive variable neighborhood local search strategy is designed to increase the exploitation ability of the algorithm. Moreover, a hybrid global search strategy is applied to further improve the algorithm’s the exploration ability. Finally, the proposed INSGA-II is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms on 16 instances of four representative maps. Simulation results indicate that INSGA-II can solve the multi-objective path planning problems with high efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing multi-dimensional resource utilization is a critical research area in distributed computing, particularly in cloud computing, where various heterogeneous resources are integrated to offer a wide range of services. Addressing this issue necessitates the simultaneous consideration of multiple resource bottlenecks. This paper presents a new solution, called the Multi-Population Growth Genetic Algorithm (MPGGA), which consists of a central management unit responsible for executing information interaction and growth quota reallocation, and multiple population evolution executors to perform crossover and regeneration within each population. The proposed MPGGA combines elite sharing and priority support for the weaker population (ESPW), resulting in better convergence and optimality than other combinations of strategies. This outcome is corroborated by extensive ablation experiments on various strategies. Furthermore, the experimental results for minimizing the maximum utilization of resources in each dimension indicate that MPGGA-ESPW outperforms other popular algorithms, such as GHW-NSGA II (1.363x), GHW-MOEA/D (1.339x), NSGA II (1.948x), and MOEA/D (2.151x) in terms of convergence speed. For energy consumption-related optimization problems, the experimental results demonstrate that the adaptability of a single algorithm in MPGGA family is limited by the algorithm of growth route, while also showing that the MPGGA framework is flexible to allow various algorithms as its growth route to adapt to various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Developing advanced population-based multi-objective optimization algorithms to explore optimal operating parameters is a crucial means of achieving energy saving and consumption reduction in aluminum electrolysis process (AEP). Many techniques, such as NSGA-II/NSGA-III, rely on dominance relationships among population members to prioritize evolving individuals. However, this mechanism assumes equal relationships among selected candidates, overlooking the potential of preponderant individuals to guide rapid population evolution. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm driven by preponderant individuals and symmetric sampling (MOPISS). This algorithm first establishes an individual selection strategy driven by preponderant individuals to expedite population evolution. Subsequently, it employs the count of preponderant individuals to calculate the interaction learning probability (ILP) for adaptively adjusting the genetic intensity of population. ILP is then integrated into the evolutionary process to create a novel genetic mechanism based on symmetric sampling, thereby enhancing the randomness of the solution space and genetic efficacy. Finally, MOPISS is validated across 17 benchmark functions and operational parameter optimization cases of AEP. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits a significant competitive advantage over other mainstream approaches in terms of evolutionary speed and optimization performance. Specifically, it can increase current efficiency by approximately 3% and reduce energy consumption by 276 kW ⋅ ⋅ h/t-Al for AEP.},

  abstract     = {With the emerging deployment of deep neural networks, such as in mobile devices and autonomous cars, there is a growing demand for neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically design powerful network architectures. It is more reasonable to formulate NAS as a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition to prediction performance, multi-objective NAS (MONAS) problems take into account other criteria like the number of parameters and inference latency. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are the preferred approach for tackling MONAS due to their effectiveness in dealing with multi-objective optimization problems. Recently, local search-based NAS algorithms have demonstrated their efficiency over MOEAs for MONAS problems. However, their performance has been only verified on bi-objective NAS problems. In this article, we propose a local search algorithm for multi-objective NAS (LOMONAS), an efficient local search framework for solving not only bi-objective NAS problems but also NAS problems having more than two objectives. We additionally present a parameter-less version of LOMONAS, namely IMS-LOMONAS, by combining LOMONAS with the Interleaved Multi-start Scheme (IMS) to help NAS practitioners avoid manual control parameter settings. Experimental results from a series of benchmark problems in the CEC’23 Competition demonstrate the competitiveness of LOMONAS and IMS-LOMONAS compared to MOEAs in tackling MONAS within both small-scale and large-scale search spaces.

The weapon-target assignment (WTA) problem, a famous combinatorial optimization problem in military operations research, is decisive for the success of UAV defense programming. Related investigations face two main challenges: 1) Constructing a multi-objective optimization model reflecting the complexities of new UAV application patterns, and 2) solving the time-consuming WTA problem with high-dimension decision variables as it is NP-complete. This paper introduces a modified differential evolution based on a new mapping method called Pareto-Optimal-Matching that solves multi-objective binary optimization problems and constructs a 3 objective Sensor-Weapon-Target Assignment model. The proposed algorithm overcomes the inherent limitation of traditional differential evolution, which only performs well in continuous problems.

Recently, machine learning (ML) based tools have demonstrated their effectiveness in recognizing people’s handwriting in the early stages of AD. In most cases, they use features defined by using the domain knowledge provided by clinicians. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on vectorial genetic programming (VE_GP) to recognize the handwriting of AD patients. VE_GP is an enhanced version of GP that can manage time series directly. We applied VE_GP to data collected using an experimental protocol, which was defined to collect handwriting data to support the development of ML tools for the early diagnosis of AD based on handwriting analysis.

  abstract     = {Constrained multitasking optimization (CMTO) obtains increasing attention recently. The goal of CMTO is to handle multiple constrained tasks simultaneously. There are two limitations of existing studies on CMTO: (i) existing knowledge transfer techniques for CMTO may not work due to non-intersecting feasible domains and the unconsidered relationship between constraints and objectives; and (ii) knowledge diversity is lacking in existing CMTO algorithms because the representation of knowledge is biased to feasible solutions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a co-evolution and domain adaptation (CEDA) method for CMTO. First, a new constraint relaxation-based domain adaptation technique for knowledge transfer is devised. Domain adaptation can effectively address the limitations imposed by non-intersecting feasible domains. In addition, as the population evolves, the knowledge representation is biased to different kinds of solutions. Second, a co-evolutionary strategy is proposed to improve the knowledge diversity. The two proposed techniques are with generality and can be readily integrated into different multitasking frameworks. In this paper, the CEDA method is combined with two popular multitasking (i.e., multifactorial-based and multi-population-based) frameworks. The constructed CEDA-based algorithms are compared with fifteen state-of-the-art algorithms on a CMTO benchmark suite and a real-world application. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CEDA method.},

To address this issue, a constrained multitask particle swarm optimization algorithm with knowledge transfer-based adaptive penalty function (CMTPSO-APF) is proposed to improve the convergence performance. The main contributions of CMTPSO-APF are three-fold. First, a dynamic particle topology is designed to improve the neighborhood similarity for different tasks with constrained conditions. Then, the particles with similar spatial structures can facilitate the knowledge transfer between different tasks. Second, a covariance matrix learning mechanism is proposed to obtain valid knowledge with constrained conditions. Then, the proposed method can promote the population to move in the direction of the optimal solution. Third, a knowledge transfer-based adaptive penalty function for constrained multitask optimization is designed to achieve the dynamical change of penalty factor according to the evolution state. Then, the adaptive penalty function can promote the transfer of effective knowledge and improve the convergence. Finally, some simulation experiments are carried out on the CMTO benchmark test suites and the practical application of the wastewater treatment process.

First, strategy adaptation, which calculates selection probability based on the feedback of different mutation operators in previous evolution, and assigns mutation operations to each individual to provide guidance for the next stage of evolution is developed. Secondly, a new historical individual preservation method is designed to improve search efficiency. Thirdly, deep reinforcement learning is applied to select multiple local search operators to refine the accuracy of potential optimal solutions.

To address these challenges, we first establish a set of criteria for developing a BABC algorithm. Following these criteria, we propose a novel BABC algorithm, denoted as oBABC, which not only adheres to the defined criteria but also successfully inherits the advantages of original ABC algorithm. To evaluate the performance of oBABC and verify its effectiveness, experiments are conducted on two typical binary problems: uncapacitated facility location problem (UFLP) and maximum cut problem (Max-Cut). The experimental results reveal the following findings: 1) The validity of the criteria and the accuracy of the theoretical analysis are confirmed. oBABC exhibits high search efficiency with an invalid learning rate ( ILR ) of 0 %, while the ILR s of other BABC algorithms almost exceeds 20 %. 2) In terms of search efficiency and capability, oBABC exhibits a significant improvement in search efficiency and consistently ranks at the top in terms of optimization capability.

Specifically, the two populations, termed globPop and locPop , individually evolve by decomposition-based and Pareto dominance-based methods, responsible for global evolution and local evolution, respectively. These two populations collaborate through substantial information exchange, thereby facilitating each other’s evolution. Firstly, the distribution of the two populations is analyzed and an individual exploitation operation is designed for locPop to exploit some promising areas that are undeveloped in globPop . Then, the guide-position is devised for globPop to indicate the optimal point for a subproblem on the Pareto front (PF). By using the guide-position, a strategy for generating uniform weight vectors is proposed to improve the population diversity. Finally, comprehensive experiments on 37 widely used test functions and 2 real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed DPEA-IEAW outperforms comparison algorithms in solving MOPs with various PFs.},

This paper studies a cooperative task allocation problem of weeding robots and spraying drones (WRSDCTA) with two objectives of minimizing the maximum completion time and minimizing the total residual herbicide. Based on the characteristics of the problem, a mathematical model is established. An effective multi-objective teaching-learning-based optimizer (MOTLBO) is proposed to solve this problem. At first, two heuristic initialization methods are designed to generate high quality initial population. And then, a multi-teacher strategy is presented when selecting teachers and students. For teachers, two heuristic search operators are designed to improve personal ability. For students, an improved OBX crossover operator is designed to learn from selected teachers. In addition, a multi-neighborhood search strategy is presented to further improve the local search capability of the algorithm. Finally, the proposed MOTLBO algorithm is compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms from close-related literature, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and high performance of MOTLBO for solving the WRSDCTA problem.},

  abstract     = {With the trend of economic globalization, distributed manufacturing widely exists in modern manufacturing systems. As an extension of the distributed flowshop scheduling problem, the distributed no-wait flowshop group scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times (DNFGSP_SDSTs) is investigated in this article. To address DNFGSP_SDSTs with the criterion of minimizing makespan, this study proposes an enhanced estimation of distribution algorithm·(EEDA) with problem-specific knowledge. First, a mixed integer linear programming(MILP) model of DNFGSP_SDSTs is established. Second, based on the characteristics of DNFGSP_SDSTs, five problem-specific properties about local search operators are derived as prior knowledge to reduce computational cost. Third, two NEH-based two-stage heuristics are presented to construct a high-quality population with diversity. Fourth, a probability model with problem-specific knowledge and a family-based updating mechanism are developed to accumulate valuable pattern information from high-quality solutions, while a sampling strategy is designed to generate new populations with the accumulated information. Fifth, several local search operators are devised to refine the obtained solutions. Furthermore, perturbation and reinitialization methods are developed to avoid premature convergence. Finally, the validity of the MILP model is verified by using the Gurobi solver. The parameters of EEDA are tuned through a design of experiments. The effectiveness of key components in EEDA is confirmed through extensive experiments, and the computational comparisons with the state-of-the-art algorithms indicate the effectiveness of the proposed EEDA for solving DNFGSP_SDSTs.},

In the proposed algorithm, an initial population with high quality and diversity is generated by a heuristic allocation strategy based on robot capacity constraints. During the evolutionary phase, a crossover strategy based on information in the non-dominated solution set is designed for exploration in the global scope. A multi-objective local search with an iterated greedy idea is introduced to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm.

However, their captured heuristic information lacks com prehensiveness and usefulness, as they fail to consider various combinations of frequent items and ignore objective information. This deficiency makes it challenging to generate new solutions that balance global and local search. To address these issues, we propose an approach called EOHIPU. EOHIPU efficiently mines and represents more itemsets composed of frequent items, and simultaneously introduces pseudo-utility to quantitatively characterize each item&#39;s contribution to the objective, thereby capturing more comprehensive and useful heuristic information. With this heuristic information, EOHIPU designs a mechanism for generating new solutions, balancing global and local search. We conduct experiments on 21 hard benchmark instances from QAPLIB, comparing EOHIPU with five state-of-the-art approaches. Our EOHIPU achieves the best results, with average percentage deviations (APDs) of 0.064 and 0.046 under short and long running times, respectively. Additionally, EOHIPU demonstrates faster convergence compared to other state-of-the-art approaches across all instances. These results highlight EOHIPU&#39;s superior solution quality and convergence rate. Moreover, the effectiveness of the captured heuristic information and the new solution generation mechanism is validated.},

However, multi-objective FAJSP in cellular manufacture (FAJSP-CM), a real-world extension of FAJSP with important applications in the mass customization of complex products, is barely considered in most previous studies. Hence, this study first addresses the multi-objective FAJSP-CM problem via a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). Then, a matheuristic-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MMOEA), with a matheuristic decoding method, knowledge-guided initialization and learning-based local intensification method, is presented to efficiently tackle the FAJSP-CM problem in polynomial-time. The matheuristic decoding method, which hybrids a decomposition linear programming model (D-LP) that can quickly and optimally allocate the execution times of all operations, to search for the optimal solution in a specific space. The knowledge-guided initialization is extended to get a high-quality and great-diversity initial population for accelerated convergence. Meanwhile, the learning-based local intensification method is developed to adaptively coordinate five problem-specific local search operators to enhance the exploitation ability of the MMOEA algorithm. Finally, comprehensive experiments based on 720 instances are conducted to evaluate the proposed MILP model and MMOEA algorithm. The results of the first experiments illustrate the MILP model can obtain the Pareto solutions of small-scale instances. The remaining experiments demonstrate that the proposed MMOEA algorithm outperforms its competitors by 0.21 and 0.72 in hypervolume ratio and coverage indictors, along with approximately a 25 % improvement in success rate.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of evolutionary algorithms tailored for multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs). These algorithms aim to find multiple equivalent Pareto optimal solution sets (PSs). However, little work has been done on MMOPs with large-scale decision variables, especially when the Pareto optimal solutions are sparse. These problems pose significant challenges due to the dimension curse, the unknown sparsity, and the unknown number of equivalent PSs. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm based on similarity detection called SD-MMEA to solve large-scale MMOPs with sparse Pareto-optimal solutions. Specifically, it employs a multi-population independent evolution to explore multiple PSs and distinguishes different PSs by double detection of the similarity between subpopulations. Simultaneously, develop online scoring mechanisms for decision variables to guide the subpopulations to explore in different directions. In addition, during the latter stage of evolution, the decision variables of individuals are further optimized by a double-layer grouping process. The proposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that SD-MMEA has significant advantages in solving large-scale MMOPs with sparse solutions.},

Traditional local search-based metaheuristic algorithms, such as adaptive neighborhood search (ANS) and variable neighborhood descent (VND), mainly focus on optimizing the current solution without considering potential long-term consequences, which may easily get stuck in local optima and limit the overall performance. Thus, we propose a multi-agent deep Q-network-based metaheuristic algorithm (MDQN-MA) for NRP to harness the strengths of various metaheuristics. Each agent encapsulates a metaheuristic algorithm, where its available actions represent different perspectives of the problem environment. By combining their strengths and various perspectives, these agents can work collaboratively to navigate and search for a broader range of potential solutions effectively. Furthermore, to improve the performance of an individual agent, we model its neighborhood search as a Markov Decision Process model and integrate a deep Q-network to consider long-term impacts for its neighborhood sequential decision-making. The experimental results clearly show that an individual agent in MDQN-MA can outperform ANS and VND, and multiple agents in MDQN-MA even perform better, achieving the best results among metaheuristic algorithms on the Second International Nurse Rostering Competition dataset.},

  abstract     = {Gene selection is a pivotal process in machine-learning-driven medical diagnostics, where the goal is to identify a subset of genes from microarray expression profiles that can enhance the predictive accuracy of classifiers for disease diagnosis. The two key objectives of gene selection are to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis, which is typically a multi-objective optimization problem. In recent years, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have gained wide attention in feature selection research, and several related algorithms have been produced. However, most algorithms tend to get stuck in local optimality when searching for solutions from a high-dimensional space. To solve the gene selection problem effectively, this study introduces a recursive multi-objective differential evolution algorithm with elite recursive strategy (RMODE-E) and a recursive multi-objective differential evolution algorithm with Pareto front recursive strategy (RMODE-P). RMODE-E amalgamates the features selected by the top E elite individuals, RMODE-P consolidates the features selected by the Pareto front set, and the combined features then serve as the foundation for subsequent recursive rounds of searching. The proposed feature subspace combination strategy not only reduces the recursive search space but also improves the capacity to find globally optimal feature subsets. Extensive experiments were conducted to compare our proposed algorithms with eight state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms to validate their effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that RMODE-P has better global search capability as it achieves better best classification accuracy, mean classification accuracy , and minimal gene subset size.},

However, the existing literature rarely considers the integrated scheduling of production and logistics on the workshop due to the NP-hard property of both machine scheduling and AGV scheduling. The energy-efficient job shop scheduling problem with limited AGVs is investigated in this paper. A multi-objective memetic algorithm with deep Q-network (DQNMMA) is proposed to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption. In DQNMMA, ten features are selected to describe the current state of the population. This enables the DQN to dynamically adjust the crossover probability according to the population evolution. Formulas for calculating the head length and tail length of each node in the disjunctive graph model are presented for the first time to enable fast and accurate access to the critical paths. Building upon the analysis of critical paths, four problem properties are developed as the foundation for designing six neighborhood operators. Then, a property-based variable neighborhood search strategy is proposed to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm. Numerous experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively enhance the performance of the algorithm, especially in solving large-scale problems. The comparative analysis with three other state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms confirms the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed DQNMMA.},

The robust influence maximization problem is a further extension of the influence maximization problem considering the external factors pertaining to the propagation process. The current research mainly includes how to select the most influential nodes through algorithms, or how to improve the robustness of the network structure. However, these researches lack the application of the propagation models in directed networks, and also ignore the networked robustness on the information transmission. Therefore, this paper focuses on analyzing the characteristics of directed networks in the information propagation process, and further solve the robust influence maximization problem considering the directionality. First, a robust influence evaluation factor R S D RSD is designed to assess the robust influence ability of each node on directed networks. Under the guidance of this evaluation factor, a problem-directed Memetic algorithm is developed to solve the robust influence maximization problem, named MA-RIM D D . The characteristics of directed networks are considered involving with the genetic operators. The empirical analysis on several synthetic and practical networks indicates that MA-RIM D D can select robust and influential seeds from directed networks, outperforming baseline approaches. Based on experiments conducted on three synthetic networks and two real-world networks, our proposed algorithm exhibits a performance improvement up to 15% over baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {The key issue in handling multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) is to find multiple Pareto sets (PSs) corresponding to one Pareto front (PF). Therefore, learning the PSs is critical to facilitate solving MMOPs while unfortunately, current research only focuses on PF learning which is helpless in finding multiple PSs by the information of one PF. Moreover, since the PSs of an MMOP are usually non-functional, traditional approximative function model-based PF learning is inapplicable. Consequently, developing new PS learning techniques is desired. Inspired by data-driven evolutionary algorithms, data can be used to train surrogate models to assist the algorithm. This article proposes an online data-driven PSs learning technique that aims to learn the topologies of PSs through a surrogate model to facilitate the search for PSs. Specifically, the Growing Neural Gas network is trained using non-dominated solutions to learn the topologies of PSs during the evolutionary process. Then, the nodes of the network are used to generate new solutions and adopted as reference points for environmental selection. A new algorithm is developed based on the PS learning technique for MMOPs. Experimental studies on three benchmark test suites and two different real-world applications demonstrate the superiority of our method over six state-of-the-art algorithms dedicated to MMOPs. The PSs learning technique can obtain the topologies of PSs and facilitate the search for them.},

  abstract     = {The task of selecting the best optimization algorithm for a particular problem is known as algorithm selection (AS). This involves training a model using landscape characteristics to predict algorithm performance, but a key challenge remains: making AS models generalize effectively to new, untrained benchmark suites. This study assesses AS models’ generalizability in single-objective numerical optimization across diverse benchmark suites. Using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) and transformer-based (TransOpt) features, the research investigates their individual and combined effectiveness in AS across four benchmarks: BBOB, AFFINE, RANDOM, and ZIGZAG. AS models perform differently based on benchmark suite similarities in algorithm performance distributions and single-best solvers. When suites align, these models underperform against a baseline predicting mean algorithm performance; yet, they outperform the baseline when suites differ in performance distributions and solvers. The AS models trained using the ELA landscape features are better than the models trained using the TransOpt features on the BBOB and AFFINE benchmark suites, while the opposite is true for the RANDOM benchmark suite. Ultimately, the study reveals challenges in accurately capturing algorithm performance through problem landscape features (ELA or TransOpt), impacting AS model applicability.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective selection hyper-heuristics have attracted more attention of researchers because of their cross-domain ability. However, for multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), obtaining a manageable number of solutions that are well distributed and converged in the objective space is still a challenge, especially when solving high-dimensional MOPs. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a compass-based hyper-heuristics(COHH), which is a general iterative framework that learns and selects from a set of meta-heuristics or components (named low-level heuristics, LLHs). The selected LLH is applied to solve the given MOP at the current iteration. In order to learn the potential of LLHs, the impact of the diversity of the current solution set on the final performance is studied. Then a new compass-based indicator is defined to evaluate the current solution sets. The learning strategy with new indicator can bias to diversity by adjusting the angle of a reference vector. After learning, the adaptive two-stage selection strategy triggered by the quality of the current solution set is used to choose LLH. Experiments are conducted on DTLZ, MaOP, WFG, and MaF test suites, as well as several real-world constrained test problems. Experimental results show that COHH is competitive in performance and cross-domain capability when compared with popular meta-heuristics and hyper-heuristics.},

To address above problems, a cooperative constrained multi-objective dual-population evolutionary algorithm (CCMDEA) is proposed with uncertainty budget of wind power, which divides the intermittent power into different intervals with flexible uncertain parameters. On the basis of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), constraint violation (CV) is also involved to guide the population evolution combined with two defined populations: convergence population (CP) and diversity population (DP) to coordinate convergence and diversity performance of pareto-fronts, and a coordinated selection mechanism is designed to select suitable parents according to the state of evolutionary population, which can coordinate the convergence population and diversity population well. According to simulation results on two test systems, the efficiency and priority of the proposed algorithm is well verified, which also reveals that the proposed algorithm can be a viable way for solving power dispatching of wind-power integrated power system.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble learning of multiple search strategies has demonstrated effectiveness in improving the performance of differential evolution (DE) for global optimization. In existing ensemble learning methods, offspring for each target solution is generated by one of the strategies from the strategy pool according to the optimization requirement of the considered problem. However, since the genetic material of an offspring generally comes from one single strategy, the advantages of different strategies could not be simultaneously utilized for optimizing decision variables with different properties. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes the collective ensemble learning (CEL) paradigm, which merges the advantages of multiple strategies for generating an offspring. CEL mainly includes the component decomposition (CD) and component integration (CI) mechanisms. The CD mechanism divides the target solutions and the candidates generated by different generation strategies into exploitative and explorative components respectively, in consideration of the evolution status at the dimension level. Then, the CI mechanism is implemented to integrate the appropriate components to form the offspring according to the sub-similarity measurement performed at the component level. The effectiveness and advantages of CEL have been validated and discussed by performance comparisons with the baseline, each single mechanism, existing ensemble learning methods, as well as several state-of-the-art DE variants.},

Meanwhile, multiple production modes are simultaneously adopted in the site to promote productivity and assure flexibility, and thus the coordination scheduling among them becomes a challenging problem. To achieve cell reconfiguration and cell scheduling in a cellular manufacturing system in which no-idle flow-line and flexible job-shop production modes are hybridized, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulated and an enhanced adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is developed. In the proposed algorithm, a decision tree-based rule combination selector is developed to adaptively select the most appropriate rule combination fit for the given production scenario to generate a high-quality initial population. Three types of crossover operators and six objective-oriented local search operators are designed to increase the exploration and exploitation capability. An adaptive balance mechanism of exploration and exploitation is trained by Q -learning to maximize search efficiency. In addition, an adaptive adjustment mechanism of population size is designed to ensure diversity and speed up convergence. The comparative study demonstrates that the three proposed adaptive mechanisms are effective and the proposed algorithm with three adaptive mechanisms significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in solving the studied problem.},

First, we verify that pseudo-Boolean functions of degree m &lt; n m&amp;lt;n , where n n is the search space dimension, cannot generate all the possible rankings of the solutions. Secondly, the sufficient condition for a ranking to be generated by a pseudo-Boolean function of dimension ( n − 1 ) (n−1) is presented, and also the necessary condition is conjectured.

However, the performance of most MaOEAs is seriously affected when handling MaOPs with irregular Pareto fronts (PFs). In this paper, a new MaOEA variant based on parallel distance (called PDMaOEA) is proposed to solve MaOPs with irregular PFs. Firstly, two new metrics based on parallel distance are designed. The first one termed diversity metric can adapt to irregular PFs. The second one called comprehensive selection metric can consider both diversity and convergence simultaneously. Based on the two metrics, a mating selection method and an environmental selection strategy are proposed. In the mating selection, solutions with good convergence or diversity are chosen to improve the quality of offspring population. In the environmental selection, the selection pressure is significantly enhanced by the two metrics. Experimental study is validated on 19 irregular problems with different shapes of PFs. Performance of the proposed PDMaOEA is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis shows that the proposed approach is competitive in handling MaOPs with irregular PFs.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (termed as PSO) is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the swarm intelligence. Since its advent, PSO has been successfully applied to tackle various issues that are hard to optimize. Unfortunately, similar to other evolutionary computation, PSO is also difficult to get rid of the bad luck of premature convergence and local optimization, especially when dealing with complex multimodal issues. Hence, this work proposes a diversity-guided PSO with multi-level learning strategy (DPSO-MLS). To begin with, chaotic opposition-based learning (OBL) is used to generate well-distributed initial particles to speed up convergence process of DPSO-MLS. Subsequently, according to the current swarm diversity, the high-layer learning mechanism enables PSO to explore the entire search space from a global perspective via attractive and repulsive strategies, respectively. Next, according to average fitness value of entire swarm, the low-layer learning strategy fine-tunes the particles search from a local perspective to sustain its diversity. To be specific, in the context of the repulsion phase, the regular varying function (RVF) embedded update strategy is used to block potential local optima so as to continue exploring the potential search space when the particle&#39;s fitness is less than the average of swarm, otherwise an alternative mutation scheme is utilized to enrich the swarm diversity. Accordingly, the slowly varying function (SVF) embedded update strategy is applied when the particle&#39;s fitness is greater than the average of swarm, otherwise the worst-best example learning based mechanism is exploited to update the worst particle to improve the quality of swarm in the context of the attraction phase. To verify the effectiveness of DPSO-MLS, extensive experiments are conducted and the results show that our proposal is superior or highly competitive to several existing PSOs according to the robustness, convergence rate and solution accuracy.},

SOF improves the existing model using three strategies, including: (1) enlarging the geometric structure of the operation tree (OT) for better generalization, (2) using a bootstrap sampling technique to construct a diverse OT as a base learner, and (3) implementing a chaos-based algorithm using symbiotic organisms search 2.0 (SOS 2.0) to minimize the prediction error. Experiments were conducted on three datasets covering three different concrete types, including, respectively, recycled aggregate concrete (RAC), high-performance concrete (HPC), and lightweight foamed concrete (LFC). SOF was compared against several commonly used AI models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R, and R 2 , R2, with the results showing SOF to have both the best predictive performance and the capability to generate explicit formulas. The statistical results also confirmed the predictive performance of SOF to be significantly better than these AI models, with a p -value &lt; 0.05.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) are challenging because they need to optimize multiple conflicting objectives and satisfy various constraints simultaneously. To solve CMOPs, various constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them tackle constraints by considering all constraints or zero constraint scenarios, these extreme treatment methods may be unable to utilize the information of multiple constraint subsets composed of partial constraints to maintain more promising infeasible solutions. To remedy this issue, a constraint subsets-based evolutionary multitasking method is developed, where a CMOP is transformed into a multitasking optimization problem by creating multiple simple auxiliary CMOPs. Particularly, the original CMOP is the main task, while the newly created CMOPs with different constraint subsets are the auxiliary tasks. Each task will be evolved by one specific population, and the knowledge transfer is conducted among tasks to realize the collaborative search. Meanwhile, the updating of the auxiliary task involves two stages. In the first stage, each auxiliary population will evolve to approach the pareto front of the constraint subset (s-CPF), promoting crossing the infeasible regions. While in the second stage, a feasible region-based search mechanism is proposed to approach the pareto front of the main task from each s-CPF, by utilizing unique and promising infeasible solutions. In addition, systematic experiments are carried out on three benchmark test suites and four real-world CMOPs. The experimental results fully demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly competitive with other state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the development of e-commerce platforms, the logistics industry is also booming. The transportation process is at the core of the logistics industry, which influences the timeliness and rationality of logistics distribution. In the real world, there are many dynamic demands in logistics distribution, so logistics distribution should deal with dynamic demands quickly to realize more effective route planning. This paper proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) with elastic strategy (AGA-ES) to solve the dynamic capacitated vehicle routing problems (DCVRPs). Firstly, AGA designs an adaptive local search operator, which can adaptively adjust the quantity of nodes that need local search, according to the fitness value of different individuals. At the same time, AGA develops adaptive crossover and mutation operators, which can automatically adjust the crossover and mutation probability based on the different fitness values. The experimental results verify the better performance of AGA on the traditional capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRPs). After that, AGA combines elastic strategy (AGA-ES) to solve DCVRPs. This paper mainly concerns three types of actual demand information in DCVRPs: distribution nodes increase, distribution nodes decrease, and distribution road conditions change, according to the actual background. AGA-ES could interact with demand information and judge the types of different demands, and then adaptively plan new and reasonable routes after receiving one or more of the above demand information. The verification of benchmark data sets shows that AGA-ES can effectively deal with DCVRPs. Furthermore, this paper collects the longitude and latitude coordinates of 100 SF express stations in Xi’an, constructs the distribution information of these express stations, and verifies that AGA-ES can solve the DCVRPs under the actual background.},

  abstract     = {Network motifs in complex networks signify critical patterns of connections essential for deciphering system dynamics. Identifying and understanding these rare and elusive motifs is crucial for analyzing complex network behaviors. Our previous research has established a significant positive correlation between the occurrence of motifs and two network properties at the micro level, namely Assortativity Degree ( ρ ρ ) and Local Clustering Coefficient ( C C l CCl ) (Mursa, 2019b; Mursa, 2019c; Mursa, 2019a; Mursa, 2021). Making use of these findings, in this paper, we present a novel null model, MuAn , which leverages Evolutionary Algorithms to produce synthetic networks with topologies that are characterized by high values of ρ ρ and C C l CCl , facilitating the emergence of network motifs. A comprehensive experiment validates our proposed null model quality in generating networks with motifs through fine-tuning the EA configuration for precise and optimal outcomes and a comparative analysis with other well-known null models. The proposed model offers a promising avenue to advance motif analysis by enabling the generation of synthetic networks with motifs, expediting investigations on gene regulatory networks, transcriptional networks, drug-target networks, artificial neuronal networks, and other domains wherein motif-driven analysis is pivotal to unraveling their intrinsic complexities.},

However, the capacity of rehabilitation services remains inadequate. This current study deals with scheduling physical therapies with coupled operations and multiple resources in rehabilitation departments, considering bi-objective optimization by minimizing both makespan and waiting time. Based on detailed analysis of practical operations, a mixed integer linear programming model is formulated. For small-size instances, optimal solutions can be obtained using software such as Gurobi. To handle large instances, a compound NSGA-II algorithm (CNSGA-II) is proposed. CNSGA-II consists of First-NSGA-II and Second-NSGA-II, which are associated with patient sequences and their respective treatments. Furthermore, practical heuristics are used to improve the initial solutions for CNSGA-II. The results of a real-work instance show that makespan is reduced by approximately 8.0%–10.8% and the maximum waiting time is reduced by about 26.4%–30.0%, comparing to the Queue Length Priority Algorithm commonly used in practice. The proposed CNSGA-II is further assessed using randomly generated instances and compared to MOEA/D and NSGA-II based on HV and IGD metrics. The results indicate the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed CNSGA-II algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Variational autoencoder is a commonly unsupervised learning model. However, its complex structure hinders the utilization of the network architecture search algorithm to release researchers from tedious manual design. To design excellent architectures automatically, this paper proposes an efficient evolutionary architecture search for variational autoencoder with alternating optimization and adaptive crossover(AOC-VAE). Firstly, to alleviate the problem of large search space when automatically designing variational autoencoders, AOC-VAE designs an alternating optimized search mechanism based on the specific coupling of encoder and decoder in variational autoencoders, which reduces the original huge search space almost to half. Then, AOC-VAE can find quickly the optimal individual in the solution space by designing an adaptive crossover mechanism. In early evolutionary period, the structural differences between individuals are relatively significant, making crossover operations more inclined to exchange structural information between individuals. As evolution progresses, the individual structures in the population tend to be similar, and the exchange of information concentrates on the parameter. Finally, in the optimization process, a fitness evaluation mechanism based on dynamic weights is designed to accurately find out the outstanding individuals under the current optimization goal. Individual fitness in the population is more inclined to be affected by the current optimization goal, thus guiding the population to evolve according to the optimization goal at different stages. AOC-VAE is verified on MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 benchmark datasets and compared with 14 algorithms. The experimental results show that the VAE network structure designed by the AOC-VAE performs well in the image classification task.},

  abstract     = {In the iron and steel industry, hardness is one of the key indicators of strip quality in the continuous annealing production line (CAPL). However, the complex production process and the strong coupled nonlinearity between process parameters make it difficult to develop accurate mechanism models and pose a challenge for data-driven modeling approaches. More importantly, most of the data-driven learning methods lack interpretability and cannot characterize the mathematical relationship between process parameters and product quality, which in turn makes it extremely hard to understand the process mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes an interpretable modeling approach (IMA) based on feature decomposition and ensemble to construct interpretable analytical models between process parameters and strip quality. In the IMA, a data-mechanism fusion-based feature decomposition (DM_FD) method is first applied to cope with high-dimensional input feature problems. Then, an improved multiobjective genetic programming algorithm (iMOGP) is developed to construct interpretability sub-models. Finally, a sparse optimization ensemble method (SOE) is used to integrate the sub-models to achieve interpretability and good generalization. Experimental results based on practical strip data demonstrate that the proposed IMA can cope well with high-dimensional input features and achieve model interpretability compared with commonly used machine learning methods and genetic programming (GP)-based modeling methods while ensuring better accuracy and generalization.},

While researchers worldwide have proposed a wide variety of EAs, certain limitations remain, such as slow convergence speed and poor generalization capabilities. Consequently, numerous scholars actively explore improvements to algorithmic structures, operators, search patterns, etc., to enhance their optimization performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) integrated as a component in the EA framework has demonstrated superior performance in recent years. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on integrating reinforcement learning into the evolutionary algorithm, referred to as reinforcement learning-assisted evolutionary algorithm (RL-EA). We begin with the conceptual outlines of reinforcement learning and the evolutionary algorithm. We then provide a taxonomy of RL-EA. Subsequently, we discuss the RL-EA integration method, the RL-assisted strategy adopted by RL-EA, and its applications according to the existing literature. The RL-assisted procedure is divided according to the implemented functions including solution generation, learnable objective function, algorithm/operator/sub-population selection, parameter adaptation, and other strategies. Additionally, different attribute settings of RL in RL-EA are discussed. In the applications of RL-EA section, we also demonstrate the excellent performance of RL-EA on several benchmarks and a range of public datasets to facilitate a quick comparative study. Finally, we analyze potential directions for future research. This survey serves as a rich resource for researchers interested in RL-EA as it overviews the current state-of-the-art and highlights the associated challenges. By leveraging this survey, readers can swiftly gain insights into RL-EA to develop efficient algorithms, thereby fostering further advancements in this emerging field.},

Although one common approach to overcoming this challenge is to construct reliable surrogates, their accuracy inevitably deteriorates in a high-dimensional search space. Thus, this paper presents a novel SAEA based on scalarization function approximation, which is designed to strengthen its robustness against this deterioration. The proposed algorithm constructs an approximation model for each scalarization function defined in a decomposition-based framework. Each decomposed problem is then solved using multiple independent models trained for its neighbor problems. The intent is to decrease the risk of search performance degradations caused by unreliable approximations and retain the redundancy of the surrogate-assisted search to hedge the risk of over-fitting. Furthermore, each approximation model is adapted to a promising region of its corresponding decomposed problem to reduce the complexity of model fitting given a limited number of training samples. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art SAEAs adapted for high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {In many-objective optimization, most existing evolutionary algorithms struggle to effectively balance the convergence and diversity of population. Given the failure of Pareto-dominance-based selection mechanism in high-dimensional spaces and the growing recognition of the advantages of angle-based similarity evaluation, we propose a Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm using Dominance Relation Selection and Angle-based Distribution Evaluation (DSAE). Firstly, based on both traditional Pareto dominance and a newly proposed Angle-dominance with higher selection pressure, a Dominance Relation Selection (DRS) strategy is designed, which dynamically adjusts the selection pressure by assessing the overall proximity between parent and offspring populations. Then, an Angle-based Distribution Evaluation is proposed to determine the distribution levels of solutions, so as to adaptively maintain promising distribution performance of population in objective space. Furthermore, a Pareto-dominance-based global optimal solution set is introduced to save solutions with the best diversity throughout the iteration as the final output. Finally, DSAE is compared with 7 state-of-the-art algorithms by using benchmark test suites DTLZ and WFG with 5, 8 and 10 objectives, and the experimental results demonstrate that DSAE has the most advanced performance.},

  abstract     = {Expensive objectives and constraints are key characteristics of real-world multi-objective optimization problems. In practice, they often occur jointly with inexpensive objectives and constraints. This paper presents the Inexpensive Objectives and Constraints Self-Adapting Multi-Objective Constraint Optimization algorithm that uses Radial Basis function Approximations (IOC-SAMO-COBRA) for such problems. This is motivated by the recently proposed Inexpensive Constraint Surrogate-Assisted Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (IC-SA-NSGA-II). These algorithms and their counterparts that do not explicitly differentiate between expensive and inexpensive objectives and constraints are compared on 22 widely used test functions. The IOC-SAMO-COBRA algorithm finds significantly better (identical/worse) Pareto fronts in at least 78% (6%/16%) of all test problems compared to IC-SA-NSGA-II measured with both the hypervolume and Inverted Generational Distance+ performance metric. The empirical cumulative distribution functions confirm this advantage for both algorithm variants that exploit the inexpensive constraints. In addition, the proposed method is compared against state-of-the-art practices on a real-world cargo vessel design problem. On this 17-dimensional two-objective practical problem, the proposed IOC-SAMO-COBRA outperforms SA-NSGA-II as well. From an algorithmic perspective, the comparison identifies specific strengths of both approaches and indicates how they should be hybridized to combine their best components.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a home health care routing and scheduling problem (HHCRSP) specifically focusing on the context of a pandemic environment. The investigated HHCRSP involves assigning appropriate caregivers to patients and optimizing caregiver routes while minimizing total travel costs, workload differences among caregivers, and negative patient preferences. The problem accounts for synchronized visits, lunch breaks, time windows, and special pandemic constraints (e.g., maximum total contact times for each caregiver and multi-trip routes). To our knowledge, this is the first study to address these constraints and goals simultaneously in the HHCRSP. To solve the problem, we propose a customized algorithm, AMOALNS, which combines archived multi-objective simulated annealing (AMOSA) with adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). Our AMOALNS generates a new solution iteratively through problem-specific heuristics within ALNS, employing a multi-objective optimization framework to intelligently disrupt and repair feasible solutions. The adaptive updating of heuristic weights is determined by the domination relation between the newly generated solution and non-dominated solutions stored in the archive of AMOSA. To show the performance of the AMOALNS through extensive experiments, we compare it with the epsilon constraint method and other state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms in the literature. Additionally, we use Pareto front analysis to aid decision-makers in comprehending the shape of the Pareto front and making informed choices based on their preferences. The trade-off analysis shows that minimizing total travel costs is the hardest to achieve, and optimizing workload balancing is worthwhile. Also, most of the non-dominated solutions can simultaneously achieve low workload balancing and high preference of patients. Finally, the sensitivity analyses reveal that the time windows classifications and instances sizes have significant impact on the compromising solutions.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms face significant challenges when it comes to solving expensive multi-objective optimization problems, which require costly evaluations. One of the most popular approaches to addressing this issue is to use surrogate models, which can replace the expensive real function evaluations with cheaper approximations. However, in many surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs), the process of offspring generation has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for expensive multi-objective optimization called RM-SAEA, which utilizes a regularity model (RM) operator to generate offspring more effectively. The regularity model operator is combined with a general genetic algorithm operator to create a heterogeneous offspring generation module that can better approximate the Pareto front. Moreover, to overcome the data deficiency issue in expensive optimization scenarios, we employ a data augmentation strategy while training the regularity model. Finally, we embed three representative SAEAs into the proposed RM-SAEA to demonstrate its efficacy. Experimental results on several benchmark test suites with up to 10 objectives and real-world applications show that RM-SAEA achieves superior overall performance compared to eight state-of-the-art algorithms. By focusing on more effective offspring generation and addressing data deficiencies, our proposed framework is able to generate better approximations of the Pareto front and improve the optimization process in expensive multi-objective optimization scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The interests in evolutionary constrained multiobjective optimization are rapidly increasing during the past two decades. However, most related studies are limited to small-scale problems, despite the fact that many practical problems contain large-scale decision variables. Although several large-scale constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) have been developed, they are still tested on benchmarks that are designed for small-scale problems without the features of large-scale problems. To promote the research on large-scale constrained multi-objective optimization (LSCMO), this paper proposes a new LSCMO benchmark based on the design principles of large-scale multi-objective optimization and constrained multi-objective optimization. In this benchmark, more realistic features are considered, such as mixed linkages between constraint variables and unconstrained variables, imbalanced contributions of variables to the objectives, varying number constraint functions. Besides, to better solve the proposed benchmark, a bidirectional sampling strategy is proposed, where a convergence direction sampling and a diversity direction sampling are used to accelerate the convergence and maintain diversity respectively. Furthermore, the proposed bidirectional sampling strategy is embedded into an existing CMOEA to improve the search ability of algorithm in the large-scale search space with constraints. In experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with several latest peer algorithms, and the results verify that the designed benchmark functions can effectively test the performance of algorithms and the proposed algorithm can better tackle the new benchmark. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to solve the network structure control-based personalized drug target recognition problems with more than 2000 decision variables, and results show its superiority.},

The weighted sum (WS) method and the Tchebycheff (TCH) method are the two most popular scalarization methods. They have pros and cons in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) the WS method allows MOEA/D to converge faster than the TCH method; the WS-based MOEA/D cannot obtain unsupported non-dominated vectors, while the TCH-based one can overcome this shortcoming. This inspired us to use the WS method to drive the population towards the Pareto front and then switch to the TCH method to maintain a more diverse population. To better balance convergence and diversity, we propose a new scalarization strategy called adaptive composite norm (ACN). The ACN strategy can combine the WS and the TCH with dynamic weighting. The experiments consider 16 instances including 4 MOCOPs and run on the PlatEMO. Results reveal that MOEA/D-ACN can rank first and significantly outperform the other evolutionary multi-objective combinatorial optimization algorithms on almost all instances.},

  abstract     = {As a representative evolutionary algorithm based on probabilistic models, the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is widely applied in complex continuous optimization problems based on remarkable characteristics of modeling with macro-dominant information. However, the success of EDA depends on the quality of dominant solutions, modeling, sampling methods, and the efficiency of searching. An enhanced Kalman filtering and historical learning mechanism-driven EDA (KFHLEDA) is proposed to adjust the search direction and enlarge the search range of classical EDA in this paper. The enhanced Kalman filtering is designed in allusion to specific problems during the search through the prediction, observation, and the first and second revision stages. A historical archive is integrated into KFHLEDA to store the elite individuals with specific knowledge and diverse solutions from Kalman filtering. The elite strategy is embedded in the revision improvement matrix to revise modeling data, which is fed back to the probabilistic model through the historical learning mechanism with previous promising solutions to estimate the covariance matrix. The population adaptive adjustment strategy is introduced to reduce the number of invalid iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed KFHLEDA is proved through theoretical analysis. The evaluation results on benchmark functions of the CEC 2017 test suit validate that the KFHLEDA is efficient and competitive compared with fifteen classical metaheuristic algorithms and state-of-the-art EDA variants.},

The Inter-Domain Path Computation under Node-defined Domain Uniqueness Constraint (IDPC-NDU) problem is one of many such scenarios. The problem requires finding the shortest path in a multi-domain network, but it cannot visit any domain twice. Since this is a proven NP-Hard problem, it is reasonable to approach IDPC-NDU from a meta-heuristics perspective.

In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multimodal multiobjective algorithm guided by growing neural gas, which learns the topological structure of the obtained good solutions during the evolution process. These good solutions are well-converged and well-distributed in the decision space, which indicate the shape of the Pareto optimal solution set. The proposed algorithm employs three novel mating selection operators based on the topological structure to efficiently and effectively search for Pareto optimal solutions. The first operator exploits Pareto optimal solutions within the topological structure, while the others explore Pareto optimal solutions around and far away from the topological structure, respectively. The proposed algorithm is compared with eight state-of-the-art evolutionary multimodal multiobjective algorithms on 20 test problems.

  abstract     = {Silicon electrodes are widely used in semiconductor etching machines. The periodic consumption of silicon electrodes has become an important consumable in wafer manufacturing. Due to the limited number of silicon electrode manufacturers and the increasing demand for silicon electrodes in global market, the newly processed silicon electrodes need to be immediately delivered to wafer manufacturers to ensure uninterrupted production. Driven by this, this paper introduces a new integrated scheduling problem called the silicon electrode production and transportation integrated scheduling problem (SEPTISP), whose criterion is to minimize the makespan. This problem is modeled as a combination of the production scheduling subproblem (PSS) and the transportation scheduling subproblem (TSS). These two subproblems are coupled with each other. Considering the SEPTISP&#39;s NP-hard and coupling properties, a novel collaborative Q-learning hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm integrated with reinforcement learning scheme (CQHEA_RLS) is proposed to handle them. In the CQHEA_RLS, the production agent and the transportation agent are focused on executing exploitation in the reduced but promising regions via their specific search actions, while the joint agent is centered on performing exploration in the whole solution space through its joint search actions and determining the suitable search regions for the other two agents. Meanwhile, the joint agent also integrates the historical performance information of its own and the other two agents&#39; search actions to dynamically choose its subsequent search actions. Moreover, each agent is devised as an effective Q-learning hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm . This new collaborative framework ensures that the CQHEA_RLS can continuously search downwards to obtain truly high-quality solutions in a relatively short runtime. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed algorithm can achieve better performance than the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Many metaheuristic methods have been proposed and have shown promising performance in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). As a representative example, the competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) exhibits excellent performance in solving large-scale MOPs. However, CSO performs poorly when used straightforwardly for constrained MOPs with complex constraints or objective spaces. In this paper, we propose a dual-swarm-based CSO framework that co-evolves two swarms with different orientations: (i) CSO is improved using genetic algorithms, namely CSO-GA to form a convergence-directed swarm without considering constraints to accelerate the convergence. (ii) CSO is further improved by differential evolution, namely CSO-DE to form a search-directed swarm by considering constraints to enhance diversity and improving the search for the constrained Pareto front. Moreover, a new constraint relaxation method is proposed that combines the particle swarm feasible rate and current evolutionary generation to dynamically adjust the factor for decreasing or increasing constraint relaxation. Extensive experiments with 37 benchmark instances and nineteen real-world constrained MOPs demonstrate that our proposed algorithm yields significantly better or at least more competitive results than ten state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Objective reduction is an efficient method to simplify many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with redundant objectives. However, most objective reduction algorithms operate on an entire sample set, which would easily omit local features and lead to an over-reduction of objectives. To alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes an objective reduction algorithm based on population decomposition and hyperplane approximation, denoted as PDHA, where the population is decomposed into several subpopulations, and a method based on hyperplane approximation is applied to extract the essential objectives from subpopulations. PDHA has two advantages. First, extracting essential objectives from the subpopulations could reduce errors produced by the reduction technique. Second, more attention is paid to local features via extracting the essential objectives from different subpopulations, which could prevent an over-reduction of objectives. The performance of PDHA is theoretically verified and experimentally compared with some state-of-the-art objective reduction algorithms and some algorithms for MaOPs on some benchmark problems. The experimental results show that PDHA is effective for the objective reduction of objective-redundant MaOPs.},

  abstract     = {The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem with wide real-life applications. Binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (BQPSO) algorithm is a popular heuristic algorithm used in binary optimization. While BQPSO exhibits strong global search capabilities, it is still prone to local optima due to particle aggregation. To address this issue, an adaptive BQPSO (ABQPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the MKP efficiently. A hybrid encoding population initialization scheme is employed, leveraging specific knowledge of MKP to increase population diversity and improve search efficiency. Furthermore, ABQPSO uses a mapping strategy that converts continuous values into discrete values based on the average position of particles. An adaptive repair operator considering two pseudo-utility ratios is introduced to enable particles to explore different feasible regions, which dynamically adjusts current pseudo-utility ratios based on changes in the global best solution. A local search method is applied to guide particles towards convergence to the optimum. A local sparseness degree measurement and a diversity mechanism are utilized to avoid local optima. To evaluate the effectiveness of ABQPSO, it is compared against ten state-of-the-art algorithms using 168 MKP benchmark instances of varying scales. Experimental results reveal that ABQPSO outperforms the comparison algorithms, especially for large-scale problems, demonstrating better solution accuracy.},

In this paper, reliability is defined as the ability of a network-level pavement maintenance plan to improve the condition of a pavement network within a certain budget. In order to quantify reliability, the reliability index is defined as the ratio between the post-maintenance network condition and the net maintenance cost. With this purpose in mind, a two-objective optimization model was developed. To test its applicability, the model was applied to a pavement network in Canada. The model was solved using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and the differential evolution algorithms. Finally, the reliability indices of algorithms and termination criteria were computed. The results indicated that the differential evolution algorithm recommended less frequent but more intense interventions that made the solutions expensive and less reliable. This paper contributed to the network-level pavement maintenance body of knowledge by (1) developing a multi-objective optimization model to reduce uncertainties of parameter tuning and algorithm selection; (2) increasing the reliability of budget allocation; (3) showcasing the significance of pavement clustering in increasing reliability; and (4) developing and incorporating actual pavement improvement curves.},

  abstract     = {Collective motion, often called flocking, is a prevalent behaviour observed in nature wherein large groups of organisms move cohesively, guided by simple local interactions, as exemplified by bird flocks and fish schools. Inspired by those intelligent species, many cyber–physical systems attempted to increase autonomy by resembling the models that describe those collective behaviours. The main motivation that persuades robotic research, particularly to move in that direction, is to benefit from the substantial robustness and reliability that social and collective systems can achieve relative to those systems that use a centralised solution to the problems. Collective motion behaviour can be achieved by applying virtual physical interaction inspired by elastic materials to determine the required attraction and repulsion forces between the agents in a swarm robotic system . However, it is necessary to apply virtual interaction efficiently to prevent undesirable swarm fluctuation, slow alignment, and excessive energy consumption. This paper presents a novel Optimised Collective Motion (OCM) algorithm that exerts viscoelastic interaction between robots. The main purpose of the developed algorithm is to increase robustness against different disturbing effects such as measurement noise, environmental disturbances , and modelling uncertainties, which implies the algorithm’s capability for real-world robotic applications . Moreover, the algorithm’s parameters are tuned automatically by employing Particle Swarm Optimisation to achieve: (i) minimum control effort, (ii) fast alignment, and (iii) robustness against noise. Simulation results established that the proposed algorithm outperforms the former algorithms, achieving 98% alignment in 50 s compared to the same alignment obtained in more than 300 s based on the previous method and being more robust in the presence of measurement noise. Furthermore, real-robot experiments performed on miniature mobile robots validate the OCM algorithm’s effectiveness and demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s practical capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Grouping problems are a special case of combinatorial problems that emerge in several practical and theoretical situations, where the goal is to find the optimal groups that minimize an objective function. One of the most outstanding metaheuristics to solve them is the Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA). Nevertheless, many grouping problems have very complex search spaces with unique and hard features that demand sophisticated search processes; therefore, their solution implies designing GGAs with specific-purpose intelligent heuristic strategies. This work presents an experimental approach to designing high-performance GGAs by analyzing in isolation its components and studying the weaknesses and strengths of its optimization process. Furthermore, we introduce a case study to develop a GGA for the Parallel Machine-Scheduling with Unrelated Machines and Makespan Minimization ( R | | C m a x R||Cmax ) problem to show the aspects to consider by implementing the proposed experimental approach. The information generated from this study allowed us to recognize the appropriate intelligent heuristic strategies for every genetic component, giving rise to the Grouping Genetic Algorithm with Intelligent Heuristic Strategies (GGA-IHS). The experimental results showed the usefulness of our proposal since GGA-IHS is about 91% better than the state-of-the-art Grouping Genetic Algorithm with Controlled Genes Transmission (GGA-CGT) for the R | | C m a x R||Cmax problem. Additionally, the experimental results indicate that the GGA-IHS performance is comparable with state-of-the-art solution methods by using only 10000 generations. The outcome of this work demonstrates the importance of knowing in-depth the problem to solve and the algorithmic behavior of each intelligent heuristic strategy included in every GGA.},

Based on the specific characteristics of the problem, a hybrid scheduling approach that combines forward and backward scheduling, a step-by-step destruction and reconstruction operator, and three adaptive reconstructive methods that combine coarse-tuning and fine-tuning are proposed to explore the near-optimal solution. Through comprehensive computational comparison and statistical analysis, the results demonstrate that the proposed shifting iterated greedy algorithm performs significantly better in relative deviation index values at the same CPU running time.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems involve the optimization of multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously subject to a number of constraints, which pose a great challenge for the existing algorithms. When utilizing evolutionary algorithms to solve them, the constraint handling technique (CHT) plays a pivotal role in the environmental selection. Several CHTs, such as penalty functions, superiority of feasible solutions , and ϵ ϵ -constraint methods, have been developed. However, there are still some issues with the existing methods. On the one hand, different CHTs are typically better suited to specific problem and selecting the most appropriate CHT for a given problem is crucial. On the other hand, the suitability of CHTs may vary throughout different stages of the optimization process. Regrettably, limited attention has been given to the adaptive selection of CHTs. In order to address this research gap, we develop an adaptive CHT selection method based on deep reinforcement learning , allowing for the selection of CHTs that are tailored to different evolutionary states. In the proposed method, we adopt the deep Q-learning network to evaluate the impact of various CHTs and operators on the population state during evolution. Through a dynamic evaluation, the network adaptively outputs the most appropriate CHT and operator portfolio based on the current state of the population. Specifically, we propose novel state representation and reward calculation methods to accurately capture the performance of diverse actions across varying evolutionary states. Furthermore, to enhance network training, we introduce a two-stage training method that facilitates the collection of diverse samples. Moreover, this adaptive selection method can be easily integrated into the existing methods. The proposed algorithm is tested on 37 test problems, the optimal results can be achieved on 19 instances in terms of the inverted generational distance metric. Experimental results verify the proposed method generalizes well to different types of problems.},

Dealing with the complexity of LSGO while avoiding the local optima is the main challenge of large-scale optimization algorithms . A multiswarm strategy has also been introduced to improve swarm diversity; however, it reduces the convergence speed. Previous studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can improve the convergence ability of EAs owing to its increasing learning ability. In this study, we develop a multiswarm optimizer with an RL mechanism (MSORL) for LSGO. The MSORL includes a tri-particle group structure for subswarms to save the computational cost and balance the diversity and convergence. An RL-guided updating strategy is designed to enhance the convergence speed, and an adaptive tolerance-based search mechanism is employed to improve the diversity and avoid the local optima.

Trap placement, which collects insect information through determining the exact location and number of traps, will enhance the precision for obtaining insect information. However, this method involves optimizing conflicting objectives. On one hand, smaller number of traps save the monitoring cost and enlarge the monitoring efficiency. On the other hand, number of traps may be insufficient and losses the monitoring accuracy. Existing studies to enhance the monitoring accuracy via both laboratory testing and high tech devices but they rarely considered economic efficacy in practice. In this paper, we characterize the trap placement problem as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem under Uncertainty. Feedforward Neural Networks and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms are used to design a tailored algorithm for modeling the conflicting objectives through process-based simulation. Then, robust multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (RMOA) is developed to search for the Pareto optimal solution for the least number of traps settled at optimal positions. Results show the optimal and robust performance of exact trap locations to monitor insect infestation effectively under uncertain insect locations and dynamic insect growth. Compared to the studies that were mainly utilizing general algorisms for solving agricultural problems, the proposed model has implications for effective methods of capturing the characteristics of real-world insect monitoring applications in food industry.},

To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical multi-objective optimization framework including the off-line and on-line optimization. Firstly, a steadystate non-linear PEMFC system model is established as the base model. Secondly, an adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization (AMPSO) algorithm scheme is proposed in the off-line optimization procedure for the exact optimization of operation parameters. Meanwhile, an adaptive flight parameter strategy based on the particle dispersity (PD) information is proposed to balance the convergence and diversity of Pareto solutions . Finally, to decrease the influence caused by parameter uncertainty, the interval optimization method is proposed in the on-line optimization layer based on the results of AMPSO . The convergence condition of the proposed optimization scheme is verified by theory analysis. The proposed AMPSO is compared with different algorithms in the numerical simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed method is tested on four representative benchmark problems. These results demonstrate that the PEMFC system with the proposed optimization scheme performs better than the base model and classical optimization algorithms in terms of the net power and system efficiency indexes, revealing the success of this hierarchical optimization approach in solving the accurate optimization and parameter uncertainty problems. By using statistical test methods, the proposed algorithm performs better hypervolume (HV) metric from the Pareto solution distribution.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new algorithm for optimizing parameters in swarm algorithm using reinforcement learning. The algorithm, called iSOMA-RL, is based on the iSOMA algorithm, a population-based optimization algorithm that mimics the competition-cooperation behavior of creatures to find the optimal solution. By using reinforcement learning, iSOMA-RL can dynamically and continuously optimize parameters, which can play a crucial role in determining the performance of the algorithm but are often difficult to determine. The reinforcement learning technique used is the state-of-the-art Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which has been successful in many areas. The algorithm was compared to the original iSOMA algorithm and other algorithms from the SOMA family, showing better performance with only constant increase in computational complexity depending on number of function evaluations. Also we examine different sets of parameters to optimize and different reward functions. We also did comparison to widely used and state-of-the-art algorithms to illustrate improvement in performance over the original iSOMA algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Production scheduling in distributed manufacturing systems has become an active research field, where large-sized complicated products, such as airplanes and ships, are taken as the primary focus. This paper investigates a distributed assembly job shop scheduling problem (DAJSP) which consists of two production phases. The first stage processes components in several job shops, and the second stage assembles the processed parts into final products . First, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is established to describe the problem with minimizing maximum completion time and find optimal schedules for small-scale scenarios. Afterwards, a genetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search (GA-VNS) is proposed to address more complex instances, which adopts the genetic algorithm as the main framework and employs the variable neighborhood search for exploration. A problem-specific three-vector encoding scheme is designed to represent three decision-making processes of the DAJSP accordingly. To improve candidate solutions, a disjunctive graph model for DAJSP is formulated and three critical path-based neighborhood structures which directly perform on encoding vectors are designed. Numerical experiments are conducted on four groups of instances with different scales and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP model and GA-VNS. To sum up, the proposed GA-VNS shows the best performance on 30 instances out of 40 instances, while the superior stability has also been proved by statistical tests. In addition, two complicated DAJSP cases are abstracted from an enterprise for fabricating large complex components to further validate the GA-VNS.},

Home health care (HHC) is a prospective approach to relieve and cope with this issue. This study addresses a multi-objective HHC routing and scheduling problem (HHCRSP) considering uncertainties and caregivers’ working time balance. First, a stochastic programming method is employed to formulate the uncertain service time and travel time, and then a chance-constrained programming model is developed to minimize the total operation cost and penalty cost of violating allowable time windows. Second, a multi-objective migrating birds optimization incorporating a stochastic simulation method is proposed. An ensemble of population iteration and external archive search is designed to obtain high-quality solutions. A stochastic simulation strategy is devised to evaluate the feasibility of obtained solutions and calculate their objective values. At last, numerical experiments are implemented for solving an extending benchmark set.

  abstract     = {Over the years metaheuristics have been successfully applied to optimization problems in many real-world applications. The increasing complexity and scale of the problems addressed has posed new challenges to researchers in the field. The application of distributed metaheuristics is a common approach to speed up the time to solution or improve its quality by leveraging traditional parallel programming models on platforms like multicore processors or computer clusters. More recently, the emergence of Cloud Computing and new programming models and frameworks for Big Data has facilitated access to an unprecedented amount of computational resources , which led to a growing interest in optimization frameworks that support the development and execution of distributed metaheuristics taking advantage of this potential. In this paper, we present the current status of development of one such framework that aims to provide support for the application of distributed population-based metaheuristics to the global optimization of large-scale problems in Spark. The framework provides a reduced set of abstractions to represent the general structure of population-based metaheuristics as templates and strategies to particularize them into concrete metaheuristics, as well as other nice features like out of the box implementations of the most common distributed models, full configurability through a human-friendly format, and the possibility of rapid prototyping and testing metaheuristics in the Spark shell. To validate the approach, a template for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was implemented as a proof of concept , which includes strategies for instantiating different variants of the algorithm, configurable topologies, and sequential and distributed execution models.},

  abstract     = {Space Surveillance Network (SSN) plays a crucial role in Space Domain Awareness (SDA) as it helps to maintain the catalog of Resident Space Objects (RSOs). Howe`ver, as the population of RSOs continues to grow, the contradiction between the increasing number of RSOs and limited sensor resources will be further apparent. How to effectively utilize existing sensor resources becomes a vital concern. This paper focuses on the Multi-sensor Collaborative Observation Scheduling (MCOS) in SSN. The workflow of SSN is summarized, and a Mathematical Programming Model (MPM) is established to maximize observation profit. Given the complexity of MPM, a modified Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed by combining Reverse learning, Neighbor adjustment, and Particle perturbation (RNP-PSO). In the MPM, multiple constraints such as observation time for each RSO, observation frequency, and sensor capability are considered, enabling a comprehensive description of the MCOS problem for the first time. The RNP-PSO incorporates a reverse learning algorithm to improve the quality of the initial population. Additionally, continuous mapping is added to the neighbor adjustment process to enhance the algorithm&#39;s search capabilities. Furthermore, a particle perturbation strategy is proposed to increase the diversity of solutions and avoid local optima . A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the RNP-PSO algorithm in solving the MCOS problem. The results demonstrate that compared to several other effective algorithms, the RNP-PSO algorithm significantly improves the Task Completion Rate (TCR) by approximately 17.01%, 19.1%, 13.53%, and 13.99%, while simultaneously reduces the Resource Consumption Rate (RCR) by about 55.48% and 36.38%. The experiments also include strategy and parameter sensitivity verification, which thoroughly validate the performance of the RNP-PSO algorithm in various aspects.},

Adjusting the evolutionary scale to suit different types of problems is a critical yet challenging open question in DE research. To efficiently address this issue, this paper proposes a novel DE based on evolutionary scale adaptation, termed as ESADE. First, a successful scale estimation mechanism is proposed to measure the appropriate evolutionary scale by utilizing the successful evolutionary feedback from the solution space provided by the trial vectors and the target vectors. With the appropriate evolutionary scale, an evolutionary scale adaptation mechanism pre-selects the closest or the farthest trial vector from each target vector, which corresponds to a small or large evolutionary scale respectively to match the search requirements of different evolutionary stages. The effectiveness of the ESA method is demonstrated by performance comparisons with each single baseline strategy, state-of-the-art DEs and state-of-the-art multi-strategy methods on 29 benchmark functions with three dimensionalities. Further applications on several real-world optimization problems also reveal the competitive performance of ESADE.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) are multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) involving multiple equivalent global or local Pareto optimal solution sets (PSs). For decision-makers, not only the global optimal solution sets need to be found, but also the value of local optimal solution sets cannot be ignored. However, most multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) tend to select solutions with better convergence, and it is difficult to obtain the global PSs and local PSs at the same time. Therefore, we propose a fuzzy preference indicator-based two-stage evolutionary algorithm (FPITSEA) in this paper. To evaluate more comprehensively the potential of each solution in the population for locating the global and local PS during the evolutionary process, a fuzzy preference indicator is designed in FPITSEA. The fuzzy preference indicator is used to guide the evolution of the population in the first stage to find the global and local Pareto optimal regions. Subsequently, an independent evolution strategy is implemented in the second stage to distinguish different PSs as accurately as possible while also ensuring the convergence quality of the solution set. In addition, an improved distance-based subset selection method is proposed, aiming to simultaneously improve the distribution of the solution set in the decision space and objective space . Experimental results on several test sets of MMOPs show the advantages of FPITSEA over several state-of-the-art MMOEAs.},

This paper investigates a hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem with learning and forgetting effects (HFSP-LF). Two learning and forgetting effects models are constructed. The sequence-dependent setup time (SDST) is also considered. The objective is to minimize the makespan of all jobs. To solve such problem, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is built to formulate HFSP-LF. Then, a meta-reinforcement learning-based metaheuristic (MRLM) is proposed. In MRLM, a constructive heuristic is employed to generate the initial solution. Several problem-specific search operators are developed to explore and exploit the solution space . The search framework of MRLM comprises a meta-training phase and a Q-learning-driven search phase. In the meta-training phase, the search operators are trained to obtain prior knowledge of their selection and an initial learning model is constructed. In the Q-learning-driven search phase, Q-learning is employed to implement automatic selection of search operators through continuously perfecting the learning model and absorbing the feedback information of searching. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experiment. The experimental results demonstrate that the designs of MRLM are effective, and MRLM significantly outperforms several well-performing methods on solving HFSP-LF.},

Previous works mainly focus on the design of novel trigger conditions manually; however, since those conditions are often designed heuristically, the performance may be affected by the preference of the designers. To this end, this paper tries to solve the action advising problem automatically using genetic programming (GP), an evolutionary computation technique. A framework incorporating GP to action advising is provided, together with a novel population initialization method to enhance the performance. Empirical studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. More importantly, thanks to the high transparency of GP, comprehensive analysis is also conducted based on the results.

It could detect whether the environment has changed while explore the change intensity of PF and PS, respectively. Moreover, different response strategies are implemented for PF and PS. For PF environmental changes, a multiple knee points-guided evolutionary strategy (MKGES) is proposed, which is driven by front shape information and adaptively responds to different PF change intensities. For PS environmental changes, a knowledge guided memory strategy (KGMS) is proposed, which guides population evolution based on environmental information.

  abstract     = {The multi-objective dynamic agile earth observation satellite scheduling problem (MO-DAEOSSP) aims to schedule a set of real-time arrival requests and form a reasonable observation plan to satisfy various criteria. According to the requirements in practical applications, the total profit and the average image quality of scheduled requests are taken as optimization goals in this study. Compared to manually designed heuristics and iterative-based methods used in previous research, genetic programming based hyper heuristics (GPHH) can automatically evolve high-quality heuristic rules (HRs) for real-time scheduling without being highly dependent on expert knowledge. In this paper, a knowledge-transfer based multi-objective GPHH framework (KT-MOGP) is proposed, equipped with a heuristic-based simulation considering the idle monitoring, to evolve non-dominated HRs for solving MO-DAEOSSP. The heuristic-based simulation generates feasible schedules and returns fitness values for given HRs, which are the individuals evolved by KT-MOGP. KT-MOGP applies a knowledge transfer mechanism to accelerate convergence. Once a source problem is trained, its non-dominated solutions are extracted and their feature importance is transferred to guide the initialization of another target problem, by which the knowledge generated during the training process can be fully utilized. Experimental results on three sets of instances show that KT-MOGP outperforms the existing GPHH-based method and that the evolved HRs are competitive compared to several classical constructive heuristics and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms . The results also show the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge transfer-based initialization. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to consider both multi-objective scenarios and real-time arrival requests.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world problems can be abstracted as multimodal global optimization, which is one of the main challenges for optimization algorithms due to its complexity. The fireworks algorithm (FWA) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm that has been widely studied and applied by virtue of the synergistic property among fireworks. Current FWA variants have poor exploitation capability to handle some locally complex multimodal functions , which greatly limits the application of the FWA to practical problems. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose the multi-guiding spark fireworks algorithm (MGFWA) to solve multimodal functions by enhancing FWA exploitation capabilities. Three different strategies which are boosted guiding vector, multi-guiding sparks, and population-based random mapping are designed to boost the guiding vector, enrich the guiding spark diversity, and fix the mapping function , separately. The validity and parameter setting of MGFWA are theoretically analyzed. Experimentally, the results on the CEC2013 and CEC2017 single objective optimization benchmarks illustrate the remarkable performance of the MGFWA compared to other typical optimization algorithms and FWA variants. Moreover, the ablation study shows each of the three parts plays an important role in the algorithm and the efficiency experiment shows the MGFWA can improve the efficiency of guiding sparks by 10%. We believe that the MGFWA can be considered the SOTA variant of the FWA.},

These three types of problems correspond to large-scale global optimization problem, multi/many-objective optimization problem, and large-scale multi/many-objective optimization problem, respectively. Driven by the above problems, meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs) with scalable characteristics have received extensive attention in this field. This paper summarizes the research progress of MHAs for space scale expansion optimization from three perspectives. Starting from the key difficulties of the optimization problem, the challenges brought by the expansion of the space scale to the existing MHAs are emphatically analyzed. From the perspective of methodology, the optimization methods of MHAs are divided into three modules: simplify problem structure, improve algorithm performance and expand application fields. Based on the review of performance evaluation benchmark problems, the simulation degree of various test suites for different practical application problems is summarized. In addition, some remaining challenges and future research directions on optimization of space scale expansion are discussed and analyzed.},

  abstract     = {In many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), balancing convergence and diversity while rapidly converging to the Pareto front is an arduous task for evolutionary algorithms . In addition, with the increase of the number of targets, the number of non-dominant solutions increases exponentially, and the individual selection pressure is insufficient. For this problem, we propose a many-objective evolution algorithm assisted by an ideal hyperplane (MaOEA-IH). To begin, the ideal hyperplane is built from the extremums of each dimension of objective space , guiding the individual to the Pareto front of search. Second, a parallel p p -norm mating selection strategy based on the ideal hyperplane is proposed to improve convergence. In addition, two other factors are taken into account: (1) different p-norms are used to measure different spatial scales ; and (2) individual selection uncertainty is defined by incorporating a probabilistic perturbation mechanism . Following that, the sum of objectives is applied to shift-based density estimation, which serves as an evaluation criterion in the environmental selection operation. This method increases the chances of solutions with high convergence and diversity entering the next generation, thereby increasing selection pressure. On three benchmark problems of DTLZ, WFG, and MaF, we compare MaOEA-IH with seven excellent algorithms. The results demonstrate that the MaOEA-IH proposed is highly competitive in solving MaOPs.},

AROA introduces a search strategy in which a candidate solution is moved in the search space depending on the quality of solutions in its neighborhood, as well as the best candidate. The candidates are managed by local search operators based on modified Brownian motion, trigonometric functions , randomly selected solutions, and a form of memory. Consequently, AROA exhibits a satisfactory exploitation–exploration balance exhibited by highly competitive performance. The introduced algorithm is experimentally compared with the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics on the CEC 2014, 2017, and 2020 test suites. The obtained results reveal the advantages of AROA over related algorithms and its suitability in solving complex real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Opposition-based learning (OBL) is an effective strategy that adjusts the population to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. However, OBL involves two phases (generation and calculation) that are seldom mentioned simultaneously. Besides, individual information in OBL is not fully used to guide evolution. First, a novel neighborhood generation strategy is proposed to fully use individual information. There are numerous variants of the neighborhood structure. Three prominent neighborhood structures are designed to demonstrate their benefits in various dimensions. Second, a multi-operator calculation method with two distributions is introduced to reach the equilibrium between diversification and intensification. Consequently, this paper proposes three multi-operator neighborhood-based OBL variants (MNOBLs). Compared with the traditional OBL variants, MNOBLs generate the opposite population by using a neighborhood of the individuals. A well-balanced calculation method can lead to good convergence behavior . Subsequently, the proposed MNOBLs are embedded into the basic differential evolution (DE) algorithm to obtain the proposed algorithms. The extensive and rigorous numerical experiments are designed at three levels: strategies, algorithms, and functions. Specifically, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are verified by comparing them with 13 state-of-the-art DE variants and four metaheuristics on the CEC 2017, and CEC 2022 test suites, and two real-world optimization problems . The comprehensive results show that the proposed OBL variants provide promising results for most problems.},

  abstract     = {The search domain of meta-heuristic algorithms is always constantly changing, which make it difficult to adapt the diverse optimization issues. To overcome above issue, an evolutionary updating mechanism called Memory Backtracking Strategy (MBS) is proposed, which contains thinking stage, recall stage, and memory stage. Overall, the adoption of the MBS enhances the efficiency of MHSs by incorporating group memory, clue recall, and memory forgetting mechanisms. These strategies improve the algorithm&#39;s ability to explore the search space , optimize the search process, and escape local optima . MBS will be applied to three different types of MHS algorithms: evolutionary based (LSHADE_SPACMA), physical based (Stochastic Fractal Search, SFS), and biological based (Marine Predators Algorithmnm, MPA) to demonstrate the universality of MBS. In the experimental section including 57 engineering problems, algorithm complexity analysis, CEC2020 Friedman ranking, convergence curve, Wilcoxon statistical, and box plot. Among them, 21 algorithms participated in the Friedman experiment, including MBS_LSHADE_SPACMA ranked first, LSHADE_SPACMA ranked second, MBS_MPA ranked 6th, MPA ranked 8th, MBS_SFS ranked 9th and SFS ranked 12th. Combined with the analysis of &quot;MBS testing analysis&quot; and the experimental results of engineering problems, it has proven that MBS has universality and good ability to improve optimization algorithm performance.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the classical hybrid flow shop scheduling problem(HFSP) to minimize makespan. This problem is known to be NP-hard and widely exists in many industrial systems such as electronics, paper, textile, and manufacturing industries. The existing work has shown that searching in multiple solution representation spaces is beneficial to improving the performance of the algorithm. However, the connection of the solutions in different solution representation spaces was ignored. To address this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage cross-neighborhood search algorithm (TSCNSA) for solving the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem. TSCNSA contains two individuals, each of which is responsible for searching in a solution representation space. The algorithm is divided into two stages: exploration and exploitation. In the exploration stage, the two individuals search in the solution representation space generated by the job-based encoding method and two decoding methods respectively to locate the potential area. In the exploitation stage , the two individuals search in the solution representation space generated by the operation-based encoding and two decoding methods respectively. The information obtained in the exploration stage will be transferred in the exploitation stage. Besides, each individual searches in its neighborhood and then generates an expert solution in the other solution representation space to guide the search for the other individual. Finally, the performance of the TSCNSA is proved by testing the well-known 586 benchmark instances. 151 new upper bounds are obtained, including 144 instances in Jose&#39;s benchmark instances, 2 instances in Liao&#39;s benchmark instances, and 5 instances in Carlier&#39;s benchmark instances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel adaptive differential evolution algorithm for global optimization problems by introducing an enhanced mutation operator and a new mixed control parameter setting based on dual performance evaluation metrics . To further strengthen the search efficiency of algorithm and availably balance its exploration and exploitation, a dual performance metrics-based mutation operator is first proposed to implement the search of population by organically integrating the fitness value and history update of individual to find the potential promising areas and allocate the suitable search resources for them. Meanwhile, a dual performance metrics-based mixed parameter setting is developed to yield appropriate associated parameters for each individual by comprehensively measuring its search characteristic and requirement based on both its fitness value and history update. In addition, a new restart strategy is further put forward to boost the search performance of algorithm by reasonably replacing the meaningless individuals measured by both their fitness values and history updates with the randomly generated individuals based on Gaussian walk. In contrast to the existing DE versions, the new algorithm organically takes advantage of the fitness value and history update of individual to assign the proper computational resources for each potential promising region, create the suitable parameters for different individuals, and eliminate the valueless individuals from population. Thereby, it is capable of heightening the search efficiency of algorithm and maintaining a good balance between exploration and exploitation effectively. At last, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing with 19 typical or up-to-date algorithms on 42 benchmark functions from both IEEE CEC2017 and CEC2022 test suites. Compared to these opponents, the proposed algorithm achieves significantly better performance on 60 out of 77 cases based on the multiproblem Wilcoxon signed-rank test at a significant level of 0.05, and thus is a more promising optimizer.},

In an effort to accelerate the convergence, this paper suggests a multi-granularity variable clustering method for evolutionary algorithms. This method estimates the sparse distribution of decision variables at each generation and partitions them into a varying number of layers, each with a distinct probability of being zero. These clustering outcomes inspire the development of a crossover operator and a mutation operator , which prove adept at efficiently generating sparse solutions .

  abstract     = {Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are widely utilized for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). These algorithms have a higher degree of diversity due to a uniform distribution of the reference vectors in the objective space . However, these algorithms may struggle to select a suitable candidate set for solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) with irregular Pareto fronts (PFs). To solve this problem, a solution potential-based adaptation reference vector evolutionary algorithm (SPARVEA) is proposed in this paper. In the algorithm, a concept called solution potential is presented to assess whether the direction of convergence of the solution to the ideal solution has potential. The solution potential is obtained with an evaluation function to calculate the potentials of the corresponding solutions. A solution potential-based adaptation strategy is then designed for adapting the reference vector to better guide the direction of convergence of the solution when solving MaOPs with irregular PFs. A modified angle penalty distance (mAPD) is adjusted to improve the convergence rate of the solution set in many-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm SPARVEA is compared with state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on four test sets with irregular PFs and four practical problems. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of SPARVEA on many-objective optimization problems. This contribution helps to advance the development of efficient algorithms for solving many-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {As optimization problems become more and more complex in real-world scenarios, the effectiveness of many existing differential evolution (DE) methods is critically challenged. To circumvent this predicament, this paper proposes a triple competitive DE (TCDE) to tackle increasingly complicated optimization problems. Specifically, a triple competition mechanism is devised to first randomly arrange individuals into exclusive triples and then let individuals in each triple compete with each other. Subsequently, heterogeneous mutation schemes are designed to update the three individuals in each triple based on the competition results. With the cooperation between these two techniques, on the one hand, better individuals in the triples tend to exploit the areas where they lie to find high-accuracy solutions, while worse individuals in the triples prefer to explore the intricate problem space to locate promising regions. On the other hand, different individuals are mutated by following the guidance of different leading exemplars, which ensures that individuals traverse the sophisticated solution space in diverse directions along with slight intensification to optimal regions . Furthermore, a modified adaptive parameter adjustment scheme is designed for individuals in each triple by considering their differences so as to meet the expectation that better individuals focus on exploitation while worse individuals concentrate on exploration. Finally, experiments are performed to first compare TCDE with totally 10 advanced DE variants and then further compare it with totally 10 CEC winners and their latest variants on the CEC&#39;2014 and the CEC&#39;2017 problem suites with totally 4 different dimensionality settings. Experimental results prove that TCDE achieves highly competitive or even much better performance than the totally 20 compared methods. Particularly, TCDE is demonstrated to be especially capable of solving complicated optimization problems. Furthermore, the efficacy of TCDE in tackling real-world optimization problems is substantiated through experiments conducted on the CEC&#39;2011 real-world optimization problem set.},

  abstract     = {The indicator-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated their superiority in handling diverse types of multi- and many-objective optimization problems . However, these evolutionary algorithms still face significant challenges in balancing convergence and diversity of the evolutionary population, despite numerous auxiliary mechanisms designed to improve their performance. To address this issue, an adaptive parental guidance strategy (APGS) is proposed in this paper. On the one hand, APGS leverages the current population to evaluate the quality of the newly generated offspring. On the other hand, it employs an adaptive threshold to select offspring individuals with better convergence and diversity. This approach enhances the convergence and diversity of the candidate solution set throughout the evolutionary process, thereby ensuring high-quality obtained solutions. By incorporating the APGS, this paper proposes a new indicator-based evolutionary algorithm with parental guidance (IEAPG). Simulation results on several test suites and real-world problem show that compared to PREA, SPEA/R, GrEA, TS-NSGA-II, HEA and MaOEA/IGD, the proposed IEAPG has better performance and robustness in dealing with different types of multi- and many-objective optimization problems. Furthermore, further investigation reveals that the incorporation of the APGS can significantly improve the performance of different categories of multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

Overcoming it is a crucial prerequisite for many optimization-related tasks such as building quality benchmarks, algorithm selection , and algorithm configuration. Several approaches to extracting features from single-objective optimization problems have been proposed but they all have some inherent limitations and thus offer an incomplete look at the problems and their properties. In this work, we extend and improve our previous work on existing topological features that offer a new look at optimization problems where their similarity is quantified in terms of the appearance of topological structures . We show that topologically inspired features are not correlated with existing state-of-the-art landscape feature groups, meaning that they capture different and thus complementary information. Topological features are subsequently used to classify problem instances from the COmparing Continuous Optimizers (COCO) benchmark showing that similar problems most often have similar topological features. Further, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the proposed methodology to its hyperparameters and provide some additional insight into the behavior of the topological features. Lastly, we also investigate topological features and their generalization across different sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {Differential Evolution (DE), as a promising population-based stochastic optimization algorithm , has drawn attention from researchers of various fields owing to its simple operation, strong robustness and few control parameters . However, classic DE suffers from drawbacks such as premature convergence and stagnation resulted from reduced population diversity when tackling complicated optimization problems with high dimensions . To mitigate these deficiencies, Differential Evolution with Perturbation mechanism and Covariance Matrix based stagnation indicator (PCM-DE) is proposed in this paper. There are three main modifications in the algorithm. First, a two-phase parameter adaptation strategy based on fitness value is proposed to guide the search towards promising direction according to different stages of evolution. Second, a perturbation mechanism for archived population is proposed, where a new weight coefficient is defined by exploiting information of fitness value and position in archived individuals. Third, a stagnation indicator based on covariance matrix is proposed to assess the population diversity and the information of variance is employed to perturb stagnant individuals. To validate the effectiveness of PCM-DE, it is compared with several state-of-the-art DE variants and non-DE based algorithms under a large test suite containing 100 benchmark functions . Besides, three truss optimization problems are also employed to verify the feasibility and scalability of the algorithm. The experiment results confirm its highly competitive performance in terms of solution accuracy and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have recently shown excellent abilities in solving computationally expensive optimization problems (EOPs), but most of them are not designed for high-dimensional EOPs (HEOPs). A new algorithm where the gradient information is well-incorporated into dimension perturbation mutation called as GIDPM for HEOPs, is proposed and fully investigated in this paper. Specifically, for each solution, a local candidate offspring pool is obtained by combining the gradient descent information and dimension perturbation mutation, and the DE/current-to-rand/2/bin is employed to generate a global candidate offspring pool. Then an offspring selection strategy is used to identify the exact offspring solutions, in which the overall qualities of two pools, the directions of near gradient descent of candidate solutions, and the distributions and RBF predictions of candidate solutions are considered in turn, to achieve appropriate local exploitation or global exploration. In addition, an Autoencoder-embedded search strategy is used to quickly jump out of the local optima caused by some small ripples or oscillations of the landscape after each several iterations to achieve leapfrog search. The GIDPM maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental studies on benchmark problems demonstrate that the GIDPM achieves better convergence performance when the problem dimension is larger than or equal to 30, and the better performance of GIDPM can be achieved with the increase of dimension. The GIDPM is also used for the design of the sandwich panel with truss cores. Compared with gradient-based algorithm, the GIDPM obtains the design with better structural performance.},

  abstract     = {Software developers commonly use third-party software libraries to reduce implementation efforts and mitigate errors in their source code while building high-quality and reliable software. To support software evolution, newer libraries are released periodically with added features, improvements in performance as well as critical updates such as bug fixes. Hence, older, existing (source) libraries need to be replaced with their newer, updated (target) counterparts, in a process known as library migration. Typically, library migration is a time-consuming, manual, and error-prone process that requires developers to analyze the source and target library code and its documentation. Specifically, developers examine Application Programming Interface (API) implementations and documentation to replace each source API with a target API without modifying the underlying software functionality. While recent works have used various techniques to recommend suitable target library replacements, these approaches do not generalize well, e.g., when a source library method needs to be replaced by one or more target library APIs or methods. To address this limitation, we propose the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to identify suitable method replacements during library migration. In particular, we formulate library migration at the method-level as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem and examine the performance of 7 multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: UNSGAIII, RNSGAII, AGEMOEA, SMSEMOA , NSGAII, IBEA and MOEAD. We use method signature and documentation similarity, and co-occurrence probability to accurately recommend one or more target library methods. We evaluate our approach by conducting an empirical study on 9 popular Java library migrations mined from 57,447 open-source projects on GitHub. Our results demonstrate that UNSGAIII, RNSGAII, AGEMOEA, SMSEMOA , NSGAII, IBEA and MOEAD achieve 90%, 89%, 94%, 90%, 91%, 94%, and 71% precision on average, and 83%, 23%, 58%, 63%, 58%, 60% and 17% average recall respectively.

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have become an effective choice to solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, it is well known that Pareto dominance-based MOEAs struggle in MOPs with four or more objective functions due to a lack of selection pressure in high dimensional spaces. The main choices for dealing with such problems are decomposition-based and indicator-based MOEAs. In this work, we propose the use of Grammatical Evolution (an evolutionary computation search technique) to generate functions that can improve decomposition-based and indicator-based MOEAs. Namely, we propose a methodology to generate new scalarizing functions, which are known to have a great impact in the performance of decomposition-based MOEAs and in some indicator-based MOEAs. Additionally, we propose another methodology to generate hypervolume approximations , since the hypervolume is a popular performance indicator used not only in indicator-based MOEAs but also to assess performance of MOEAs. Using our first methodology, we generate two new scalarizing functions and provide their corresponding experimental validation to show that they exhibit a competitive behavior when compared against some well-known scalarizing functions such as ASF, PBI and the Tchebycheff scalarizing function. Using our second methodology, we produce 4 different hypervolume approximations and compare their performance against the Monte Carlo method and against two other state-of-the-art hypervolume approximations. The experimental results show that our functions exhibit a good compromise in terms of quality and execution time .},

Recent contributions span the development of specialized algorithms and the construction of challenging benchmark problems. Here, we continue these research directions through the development and analysis of a new bi-objective problem, the dynamic Travelling Thief Problem (TTP), including three modes of dynamic change: city locations, item profit values, and item availability. The interconnected problem components embedded in the dynamic problem dictate that the effective tracking of good trade-off solutions that satisfy both objectives throughout dynamic events is non-trivial. Consequently, we examine the relative contribution to the non-dominated set from a variety of population seeding strategies, including exact solvers and greedy algorithms for the knapsack and tour components, and random techniques. We introduce this responsive seeding extension within an evolutionary algorithm framework. The efficacy of alternative seeding mechanisms is evaluated across a range of exemplary problem instances using ranking-based and quantitative statistical comparisons, which combines performance measurements taken throughout the optimization. Our detailed experiments show that the different dynamic TTP instances present varying difficulty to the seeding methods tested. We posit the dynamic TTP as a suitable benchmark capable of generating problem instances with different controllable characteristics aligning with many real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {In constrained multi-objective optimization, balancing convergence, diversity, and feasibility of solutions in the population are challenging. Most existing approaches focus on convergence and feasibility but fail to enforce the diversity and uniformity of solutions in the approximated Pareto Front (PF). In decomposition-based approaches, the diversity and uniformity of the obtained solution set depend on the set of weight vectors employed, which are generally fixed and initialized uniformly. However, Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) are characterized by discontinuous Pareto-optimal fronts due to the presence of constraints. Therefore, to maintain better diversity and uniformity in the population, the weight vector set employed in the framework should consider the characteristics of PF, which is not known in advance. However, during the evolution, the characteristics of PF can be estimated and the associated weight vectors can be appropriately distributed. Motivated by this issue, we propose a novel Constrained Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with a Clustering-based Weight vector Adaptation strategy called CMOEA-CWA. The proposed CMOEA-CWA uses the basic framework of CMOEA-DPMS. After exploring the search space , CMOEA-CWA reinitializes the weight vectors if there exist any discontinuities in the approximated pareto front (PF). In CMOEA-CWA, the PF is approximated using the feasible solutions stored in an archive and novel parameter-free clustering techniques . During the clustering process , if there exist any discontinuities in the approximated PF, one population will exploit the feasible regions with a re-initialized set of weight vectors while the other population will explore the feasible regions with uniformly distributed weight vectors. Empirical results obtained on four popular and widely used benchmarks when compared with nine latest state-of-the-art algorithms (ARMOEA, CCMO, TiGE-2, ToP, MOEA/D-DAE, PPS, CTAEA, MOEA/D-2WA and CMOEA-DPMS) suggest the superiority of the proposed algorithm, especially on 47 complicated constrained multi-objective problems. The proposed algorithm performs statistically better than or comparable (in terms of HV) to ARMOEA, CCMO, TiGE-2, ToP, MOEA/D-DAE, PPS, CTAEA, MOEA/D-2WA and CMOEA-DPMS in 91.48 %, 78.72 %, 100 %, 70.21 %, 85.11 %, 78.72 %, 91.49 % and 82.97 % of test instances, respectively.

  abstract     = {Multi-modal multi-objective problems (MMOPs) arise frequently in real world applications , in which multiple Pareto-optimal solution sets (PSs) correspond to the same point on the Pareto front (PF). Diversity preservation is a crucial issue in multi-modal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs), which aims at evolving the population toward the PF and equivalent PSs with a uniform distribution and good spread. In spite of many diversity preservation approaches in MMOEAs, most of them guarantee the diversity in decision space with a degraded performance in objective space . To address the above issues, this article proposes a MMEA based on dual decomposition and subset selection , which employes the weight vectors and grids to decompose both the objective and decision spaces. On the basis of dual decomposition, the mating selection are adaptively performed based on estimated optimization stages of current subproblem . Moreover, a subset with good diversity in both the objective and decision spaces are selected from the promising solutions ever collected during the evolution process. Experimental results on 22 benchmark problems demonstrate our advantages to maintain a more balanced diversity in both objective and decision spaces. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we develop an efficient model to allocate abnormalities in medical chest X-ray images. The developed model consists of a set of stages; the first stage is to segment the images using a multilevel thresholding technique to determine the lung inside the image, then extracting the features from the segmented objects using different extractor methods. Then, we proposed a Fractional-order modified Heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (FMHCLPSO) as a feature selection method to determine the relevant features used to improve the detection process. To evaluate the performance of the developed IoMT model, a set of three medical datasets is used, called Covid-19 &amp; Pneumonia, X-raycovid, and Radiography. The results illustrate the high efficiency of the developed model to detect diseases based on performance measures . Furthermore, We compared the proposed method to several existing methods, and it showed significant performance.},

  abstract     = {For real-world design optimization, there may often exist multiple candidate concepts that may solve the problem at hand. The process of concurrently identifying the best concept and the corresponding variable values that optimize the design objective(s) is termed as a multi-concept optimization (MCO). While such problems are commonly encountered in practical domains such as engineering, transport, product design, there has been little focus on developing computationally efficient algorithms for MCO. One of the reasons contributing to this gap is the scarcity of benchmark problems with diverse challenges that could be used as a testbed for the development and systematic evaluation of advanced MCO algorithms . In this paper, we particularly focus on MCO problems with multiple conflicting objectives. We review the existing multi-objective MCO test problems and identify their shortcomings through preliminary numerical experiments. Then, we propose a methodology and provide a test problem generator for systematically constructing new multi-objective MCO instances with desired properties . We also propose 28 specific test problem instances using this generator to build a benchmark suite that poses a wide range of challenges to the prospective search strategies. Further, we conduct numerical experiments on the proposed test suite using multiple existing algorithmic strategies from the literature to demonstrate their performance. The results clearly highlight the challenges faced by the strategies for different types of problems. These observations emphasize the need for research efforts towards the development of more efficient and versatile MCO algorithms to tackle a wider range of MCO problems.},

  abstract     = {Many surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEA) with outstanding performance have been developed to handle Expensive Constrained Optimization Problems (ECOPs). But most of them are limited to solving ECOPs with continuous variables and inequality constraints . Therefore, a Kriging-assisted Double Population Differential Evolution (KDPDE) is proposed to deal with mixed-integer ECOPs with inequality and equality constraints. In particular, promising regions near the feasible region are created by Integer restriction Relaxation-based Double Population (IRDP) search framework, and then an Expected Improvement-based Classification local Search (EICS) is adopted to guide the infeasible solutions in the promising region into the feasible region . In order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, the widely distributed elite solutions are utilized by Elite solutions Retention-based Multi-directional Exploration (ERME) for diverse exploration, and the repetition rate information of individuals in the population is used by Population Diversity Maintenance Operation (PDMO) to adaptively avoid the population from falling into a local region. Therefore, KDPDE is capable of balancing the performance between convergence and robustness for mixed-integer ECOPS with mixed constraints. Experimental studies on several benchmark problems and a real-world application example demonstrate that KDPDE has excellent performance on solving such kind of problems under a limited computational budget.},

  abstract     = {Many engineering optimization problems fall into the category of Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems, which combine nonlinear relations, constraint conditions, and different types of variables, including continuous, integer, and/or discrete variables. Solving MINLP problems can be a challenging exploration process since their landscape can be composed of many discontinuous feasible parts with different sizes. In this scheme, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) often fail to generate enough diversity to explore the discontinuous feasible parts. Consequently, EAs are vulnerable to being attracted to larger discontinuous feasible parts, even if they are not promising regions. In this paper, a new proposal based on two fundamental strategies is presented to improve the performance of the differential evolution algorithm when solving MINLP problems. The first strategy considers a set of “good fitness-infeasible solutions” that contribute to exploring promising regions from infeasible contours. It reduces the vulnerability of the solutions to be attracted to larger discontinuous feasible parts with unpromising objective function values . The second is a composite trial vector generation to improve the combinatorial exploration while ensuring a robust convergence capacity toward the final solution. Sixteen well-known MINLP problems are used in several experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, comparing it to state-of-the-art EAs. The results provided by the proposal show a better performance in terms of quality, robustness, and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), which is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem , plays an important role in modern logistics and transportation systems. Recent years, heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms have attracted many researchers’ attentions to solve the VRPTW problems. As an outstanding meta-heuristic algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm exhibits very promising performance on continuous problems. However, how to adapt PSO to efficiently deal with VRPTW is still challenging work. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (N-CLPSO) to solve VRPTW. To improve the exploitation capability of N-CLPSO, we introduce a new remove-reinsert neighborhood search mechanism, which consists of the removed operator and the reinsert operator. When performing the removed operator, the probability of adjacency between two customers is calculated by an information matrix ( I M IM ), which is constructed based on the customers’ time-space information and elite individuals’ local information . When executing the reinsert operator, the I M IM and a cost matrix ( C M CM ), which is introduced to record the cost of customer insertion, are used to find an optimal insert position. Moreover, to enhance the exploration of N-CLPSO, a semi-random disturbance strategy is proposed, in which elites’ longest common sequences (LCS) are saved, aiming to prevent population degradation. The N-CLPSO algorithm is tested on 56 Solomon benchmark instances, and it attains the optimal solutions on 29 instances. The simulation results and comparison results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms or can compete with the majority of other 3 PSO variants as well as other 12 state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The classical flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) normally assumes that operations of each job have strict sequence constraints, i.e., each operation can be processed only after its previous operation is completed. However, in the actual production, the phenomenon that some operations of a job don&#39;t have any sequence constraints is very common. With regard to this, we firstly propose a FJSP with discrete operation sequence flexibility (FJSPDS) aiming at minimizing the makespan and total energy consumption , simultaneously. An effective mathematical model is established for the FJSPDS and its validity is proved by the CPLEX; and then an improved memetic algorithm (IMA) is designed to solve the FJSPDS. In the IMA, a new flexible sequencing method for determining process plan of each job and a right-leaning decoding method are proposed. And some effective crossover and mutation operators and an effective local search operator are designed to accelerate the convergence speed and expand the solution space of the algorithm. A total of 110 FJSPDS benchmark instances are constructed to conduct numerical simulation experiments. Experimental results show that our proposed IMA has superior performance in almost all of the instances compared with three well-known evolutionary algorithms . Our proposed model and algorithm can help the production managers who work with flexible manufacturing systems to obtain optimal scheduling schemes considering operations which have or don&#39;t have sequence constraints.},
