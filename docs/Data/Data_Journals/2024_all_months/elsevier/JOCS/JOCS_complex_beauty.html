  abstract     = {We develop a novel fourth-order compact finite difference scheme to solve nonlinear singular ordinary differential equations. Such problems occur in many fields of science and engineering, such as studying the equilibrium of an isothermal gas sphere, reaction–diffusion in a spherical permeable catalyst, etc. These problems are challenging to solve because of their singularity or nonlinearity. By our proposed method, we can easily solve these complex problems without removing or modifying the singularity. To construct the new fourth-order compact difference method, Initially, we created a uniform mesh within the solution domain and developed a compact finite difference scheme. This scheme approximates the derivatives at the boundary nodal points to handle the problem’s singularity effectively. Employing a matrix analysis approach, we discussed the convergence analysis of the methods. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply our approach to solve various real-life problems from the literature. The new method offers high-order accuracy with minimal grid points and provides better numerical results than the nonstandard finite difference method and exponential compact finite difference method.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate real-life time series data often contain missing values. These missing values often affect subsequent prediction tasks. Traditional imputation methods generally consider only some of the characteristics of multivariate time series data. This can easily lead to inaccurate filling results. In this paper, a feature correlation-based bidirectional recurrent network (BRNN-FR) is proposed to solve the problem of missing values in multivariate sequence data. First, this method involves the design of a bidirectional prediction network based on time intervals and the use of forward and reverse time series information between data points to obtain the characteristics of data changes with time to the greatest extent. Second, considering the correlation between features, a combined feature selection strategy based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and mutual information was proposed. A multiple regression model was established to predict between features. Finally, a bidirectional network ensemble filling algorithm based on the relationships between features is established to predict missing values. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets show that the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum R2 value (R2_score) of the BRNN-FR algorithm in the direct imputation test are better than those of the other comparison methods in most cases. BRNN-FR also achieved a better area under the curve (AUC) in the indirect comparison experiment of two classifications of in-hospital death after filling the medical dataset. Using the AIR air quality dataset and the power transformer temperature dataset from the ETTH1 interpolation regression to predict the next 3 hours and 6 hours of average numerical results, most of the optimal regression results are obtained.},

We observe that by introducing frequency-weighted coupling and timescale variations in the dynamics of nodes, the system exhibits a first-order explosive transition to phase synchrony. Further, we extend this study to understand the nature of synchronization in the case of two coupled star networks. If the coupled star networks are identical, we observe that with increasing inter-star coupling strength, the hysteresis width initially increases, reaches a maximum value, then decreases before saturating. If the interacting star networks are non-identical, we observe that the transition to the coherent state is preceded by the occurrence of intermittent in-phase and anti-phase synchrony for small inter-star coupling. However, for large values of coupling strengths, we observe that the intermittent state disappears and the hysteresis width changes as in coupled identical star networks. We characterize these transitions by plotting the Lyapunov exponents for the system and the master stability function.},

  abstract     = {Addressing discontinuities in fluid flow problems is inherently difficult, especially when shocks arise due to the nonlinear nature of the flow. While handling discontinuities is a well-established practice in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), it remains a major challenge when applying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In this study, we compare the shock-resolving capabilities of traditional CFD methods with those of PINNs, highlighting the advantages of the latter. Our findings show that PINNs exhibit less dissipative behavior compared to conventional techniques. We evaluated the performance of both PINNs and traditional methods on linear and nonlinear test cases, demonstrating that PINNs offer superior shock-resolving properties. Notably, PINNs can accurately resolve inviscid shocks with just three grid points, whereas traditional methods require at least seven points. This suggests that PINNs are more effective at resolving shocks and discontinuities when using the same grid for both PINN and CFD simulations. However, it is important to note that PINNs, in this context, are computationally more expensive than traditional methods on a given grid.},

  abstract     = {In academia, research collaboration plays a vital role in enhancing the research quality and enriching the academic profile of the authors. Recommending appropriate collaborators from a vast scholarly database, particularly for newcomers, poses a challenging cold-start problem. This study addresses a cold-start problem in peer recommendation, considering a dynamic coauthorship graph as a network structure of academic collaborators. As the coauthorship graph is quite large and complex, an efficient indexing method is essential for speeding up the initial search of similar coauthors. The study introduces an efficient Global Inverted List ( G I L ) for indexing research areas and active authors in the coauthorship network. An attribute-based search and filtering mechanism is proposed to identify relevant collaborators, followed by the application of k-means clustering and doc2vec metrics to rank and select top recommendations. A cold user is associated with attributes that identify coauthors with similar research interests. For each attribute of the cold user, the model searches the associated authors from the GIL. Further, two filtering approaches are applied to refine the retrieved author list. The first ensures that the authors have a significant presence in the specified research areas, whereas the second one helps avoid recommending authors with only superficial connections to the cold user. The model creates a feature matrix of filtered authors using the publication features of authors. The k-means clustering applied to the feature matrix generates k clusters, among which the model chooses only those with seed nodes i.e. the clusters which are having seed nodes are selected for further process. Selected clusters are ranked using doc2vec metrics, with the top-ranked cluster providing the final recommendation. The model recommends the top L members of the selected cluster, where L is the length of the recommendations provided to the new user. Our extensive experiments show the efficacy of the proposed model.},

This fusion protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes within ES, including hypoxia and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Hypoxia has been documented to trigger EMT, a process that can stabilize a hybrid cell state, enhancing metastatic potential and resistance to drugs. However, the precise mechanisms that sustain this hybrid phenotype during hypoxia in ES have remained enigmatic. Our study introduces a logical model for EMT in ES, underscoring the potential significance of the EWS::FLI1/miR-145 circuit in inducing hybrid states during hypoxia. Furthermore, our findings underscore the necessity for downregulating EWS::FLI1 to fully activate EMT under hypoxic conditions. This model aligns well with results derived from existing literature. These insights underscore the crucial role of EWS::FLI1 in inducing the hybrid state in ES during hypoxia.},

  abstract     = {The effectiveness of heat transfer fluids (HTFs) is pivotal in maximizing the efficiency and longevity of various devices, from small-scale applications to large industrial systems. A comprehensive understanding of the properties of innovative ternary heat transfer nanofluids (TNFs) is essential, particularly when utilized over a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium. This study explores tangent hyperbolic thermal nanofluids (TNFs) made up of nanoparticles such as graphene, zirconium oxide and magnesium oxide and, suspended in an ethylene glycol base fluid, within a non-Darcy porous medium. Similarity variables are used to streamline the mathematical representation of fluid flow and heat transmission in TNFs. Then, semi-analytical solutions to the reduced governing equations are obtained using the homotopy analysis method. The influence of tri-nanoparticles, porosity, and the Forchheimer parameter on skin friction, fluid flow dynamics, heat transfer rates, and the Nusselt number is investigated. The Forchheimer parameter lowers the Nusselt number by 27.80 % for TNFs, 21.27 % for the hybrid nanofluid, and 21.08 % for the nanofluid. As a result, the temperature within TNFs is more evenly distributed. TNFs can transfer more heat by raising the medium’s porosity and the tri-nanoparticle volume fraction. These results unveil groundbreaking insights into enhancing the efficiency of heat transfer fluids. The introduction of a porous medium emerges as an alternate strategy to boost the performance of TNFs.},

  abstract     = {Strong geological disasters have caused persistent losses in society, economy, and ecological environments. Given the unique geographical settings of the stricken areas, their resilience is prone to damage or even loss. Comprehensive risk assessment of natural disasters is the core content and important foundation for building regional resilience. Therefore, conducting dynamic characteristics analysis of resilience in mountainous disaster areas impacted by strong earthquake geological disasters is vital for ensuring the region&#39;s high-quality and sustainable development. This article takes the 51 stricken areas of Wenchuan earthquake as the research object. To this end, social, economic and ecological environmental data from 2008 to 2020 was hereby collected. Initially, a regional resilience assessment system based on &quot;socio-economic-ecological environment&quot; was established, considering the long-term and spatial heterogeneity of geological disasters. Secondly, the regional resilience assessment model was constructed using Spectral clustering-genetic algorithm-improved entropy weight method. Following that, the dynamic characteristics of regional resilience were quantitatively analyzed from two aspects, including change velocity state and change rate trend. Finally, based on the regional resilience characteristics, differentiated resilience enhancement strategies were proposed. Collectively, the results revealed that: (1) From a geological disaster standpoint, the risk in post-earthquake disaster areas exhibited a strikingly rapid decline, with the spatial distribution of geological disaster risk being notably higher in the central areas and diminishing towards the peripheries. (2) Overall, the regional resilience of the 51 stricken areas showed a &quot;V-shaped&quot; trend, with a significant upturn since 2012. (3) From the perspective of dynamic characteristics, more counties (cities) presented an upward trend. (4) The 51 stricken areas were hereby divided into the &quot;benchmarking type&quot;, the &quot;declination type&quot;, the &quot;backward type&quot;, and the &quot;potential type&quot;. In conclusion, the current study enhances the technical framework for evaluating regional resilience and provides technical support for the construction of resilient cities.},

This study evaluates the effectiveness of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic in modeling topics from colonoscopy reports related to Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, and Polyps. We compared these models in terms of their ability to identify clinically relevant topics, their influence on the performance of machine learning classifiers trained on the derived topic features, and their scalability. Our analysis, based on average results across five iterations of train-test splits, showed that BERTopic generally outperformed LDA in clustering metrics, achieving Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and Purity scores of 0.5637, 0.5953, and 0.8447, respectively, compared to LDA’s scores of 0.5349, 0.5254, and 0.8149. Additionally, classifiers trained on BERTopic-derived features exhibited improved predictive accuracy and F1-scores, with Logistic Regression reaching a mean accuracy of 0.8464 and a mean F1-score of 0.8507, compared to 0.8319 and 0.8351 for LDA-based features.

We then define the concept of preference consistency and propose a formula for calculating this metric that redistributes the weights of individual pieces of evidence based on the preferences of all evidence.

  abstract     = {By developing IoTs (Internet of Things), a new concept is arising in WBANs (Wireless Body Area Networks), called IoBs (Internet of Bodies). WBANs are the safety-critical devices that use rule-based knowledge with fuzzy variables for monitoring patients. There are two issues with the knowledgebase: (1) appropriate knowledge representation and inference and (2) handling the situations for which there is no rule in the knowledgebase. In this paper, for the first issue we present MFCPN (Multi-level Fuzzy Colored Petri-nets) and for the second one we present a RL (Reinforcement Learning) mechanism for decision making based on the past device’s feedback to the environment. Through a few scenarios and two datasets, the proposed approach has been applied to pacemakers to show the approach&#39;s effectiveness. The comparison between decision making by our approach and two real datasets indicates the proposed approach has 79.3 % accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive numerical framework for simulating the evaporation and combustion of isolated, spherically-symmetric, multi-component fuel droplets. The framework incorporates a detailed description of chemical reactions in the gaseous phase and is capable of modeling pure evaporation, autoignition, and hot-wire ignition scenarios. The transport equations for mass, species, and energy are solved in both the liquid (droplet) and gaseous (surrounding atmosphere) phases. Diffusion in the liquid phase is described using the Stefan–Maxwell theory, while in the gaseous phase, both molecular and thermal diffusion are considered. The model also includes the thermophoretic effect for carbonaceous particles and accounts for gas radiation through various models, ranging from optically-thin approximations to more complex methods like the P1 and discrete ordinate methods. Non-gray radiative effects are handled using the Weighted-Sum-of-Gray-Gases Model (WSGGM). Liquid/gas interface conditions are evaluated by imposing flux continuity of mass and energy, along with thermodynamic equilibrium for species. Deviations from ideal thermodynamic behavior in the liquid droplet are managed by incorporating a suitable activity coefficient or by using a proper cubic equation of state. Additionally, the presence of supporting fibers is modeled using a simplified one-dimensional approach. The transport equations are solved using the method of lines, with spatial discretization performed via the finite difference method on a body-fitted grid. The resulting system of Differential–Algebraic Equations (DAEs) is then solved using a fully-coupled approach. Thanks to its generality in terms of kinetic and thermodynamic descriptions and the reduced computational time, the proposed framework offers significant potential for advancing our understanding of the complex combustion processes of multi-component liquid fuels and for enhancing the planning and execution of experiments involving isolated fuel droplets.},

In this paper, we construct one such limit by proving undecidability of learnability of state spaces of physical systems. We characterize state spaces as binary hypothesis classes of the computable Probably Approximately Correct learning framework. This leads to identifying the first limit for learnability of state spaces in the agnostic setting. Further, using the fact that finiteness of the combinatorial dimension of hypothesis classes is undecidable, we derive undecidability for learnability of state spaces as well. Throughout the paper, we try to connect our formal results with modern neural networks. This allows us to bring the limits close to the current practice and make a first step in connecting scientific exploration aided by machine learning with results from learning theory.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new method in which a generative network (GN) set within a reduced-order model (ROM) framework is used to solve inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDE). The aim is to match available measurements and estimate the corresponding uncertainties associated with the states and parameters of a numerical physical simulation. We train the GN using only unconditional simulations of the discretized PDE model. A GN is used here to exploit the ability of these methods to generate realistic outputs from complex probability distributions, such as the ones that represent the possible states and parameters of a physical problem. We compare the proposed method with the gold standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Additionally, we suggest the use of a novel type of time-stepping regularization to improve the representativeness of the physical solution, and we present a new way of evaluating the GN training, taking advantage of the real/generated sample structure. We apply the proposed approaches to a spatio-temporal compartmental model in epidemiology. The results show that the proposed GN-based ROM can efficiently quantify uncertainty and accurately match the measurements and the gold standard. This is achieved using only a limited number of unconditional simulations from the full-order numerical PDE model (40 simulations). The GN-based ROM operates 60 times faster than the gold standard (MCMC), while producing uncertainties that closely match those generated by the MCMC approach. The proposed method is a general framework for quantifying uncertainties in numerical physical simulations and is not restricted to the specific physics of this application.},

This study introduces a novel pseudo-operational collocation method, leveraging two-variable Jacobi polynomials. These polynomials are obtained through the Kronecker product of their one-variable counterparts, concerning both spatial ( x ) and temporal ( t ) domains. The study explores the impact of four parameters ( θ , ϑ , σ , ς &gt; − 1 ) on the accuracy of resulting approximate solutions, marking the first examination of such influence. Collocation nodes in a tensor approach are constructed employing the roots of one-variable Jacobi polynomials of varying degrees in x and t . The study delves into analyzing how the distribution of these roots affects the outcomes. Consequently, pseudo-operational matrices are devised to integrate both integer and fractional orders, presenting a novel methodological advancement. By employing these matrices and appropriate approximations, the governing equations transform into an algebraic system, facilitating computational analysis. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of the equations under study are investigated and the study estimates error bounds within a Jacobi-weighted space for the obtained approximate solutions. Numerical simulations underscore the simplicity, applicability, and efficiency of the proposed matrix spectral scheme.},

Thus, they need to be handled using probabilistic methods commonly based on ensembles. However, initial conditions generated by digital computers fall within the sparse set of discrete IEEE floating point numbers which have non-uniform distributions along the real axis. Therefore, there are many missing initial conditions whose absence might be expected to degrade the computed statistical properties of chaotic systems. The universality of this problem is enshrined in Sharkovskii’s theorem which is the simplest mathematical statement of the fact that no finite number representation of a chaotic dynamical system can account for all of its properties and shows that the precision of the representation limits the accuracy of the resulting digital behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), a signaling protein family, is essential in angiogenesis, regulating the growth and survival of endothelial cells that create blood vessels. VEGF is critical in osteogenesis for coordinating blood vessel growth with bone formation, resulting in a well-vascularized environment that promotes nutrition and oxygen delivery to bone-forming cells. Predicting VEGF is crucial, yet experimental methods for identification are both costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces VEGF-ERCNN, an innovative computational model for VEGF prediction using deep learning. Two datasets were generated using primary sequences, and a novel feature descriptor called multi fragmented-position specific scoring matrix-discrete wavelet transformation (MF-PSSM-DWT) was developed to extract numerical characteristics from these sequences. Model training is performed via deep learning techniques such as generative adversarial network (GAN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), ensemble residual convolutional neural network (ERCNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The VEGF-ERCNN outperformed other competitive predictors on both training and testing datasets by securing the highest 92.12 % and 83.45 % accuracies, respectively. Accurate prediction of VEGF therapeutic targeting has transformed treatment techniques, establishing it as a crucial participant in both health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological condition revealed by deficiencies in physical well-being, social communication, hyperactive behavior, and increased sensitivity. The delayed diagnosis of ASD showcases a significant obstacle in mitigating the severity of its impact. Individuals with ASD often exhibit restricted and repetitive behavioral patterns. In this context, we proposed a novel adaptive feature fusion technique with a BAT-PSO-LSTM-based network for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Our focus is on three distinct autism screening datasets namely, Toddlers, Children, and Adults for comprehensive analysis of techniques. Bat and PSO concurrently select features and the selected features will go through an adaptive feature fusion algorithm and an LSTM-based classifier. This research addresses various challenges encountered in the existing techniques including concerns related to overfitting, faster training, interpretability, generalization capability, and reduced computation time. The work incorporates baseline techniques like a neural network, CNN, and LSTM with evaluations based on key parameters like precision, specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, and f1-score. The experimental simulations reveal that AFF-BPL outperforms considered baseline techniques achieving remarkable accuracy on all three datasets. Specifically, the model attains the accuracy of 0.992, 0.989, and 0.986 on toddler, children, and adult datasets respectively. Additionally, the exploration of functional and structural images will provide deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of ASD.},

To our best knowledge, it is the first time that the solution of SPBP is accurately approximated using the space–time meshless method without applying any adaptive refinement technique. The method is based on solving the problem without distinguishing between space and time variables, which eliminates the need for time discretization schemes. To address the inherent non-linearity of the problem, the method employs an iterative algorithm based on quasilinearization technique. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by solving different examples of one- and two-dimensional SPBP with very small ϵ up to 1 0 − 10 . Additionally, the numerical convergence of the method with respect to ϵ and also to the number of collocation points has been investigated.

  abstract     = {Forest fires are a key component of natural ecosystems, but their increased frequency and intensity have devastating social, economic, and environmental implications. Thus, there is a great need for trustworthy digital tools capable of providing real-time estimates of fire evolution and human interventions. This work develops an interpretable, physics-based model that will serve as the core of a broader wildfire prediction tool. The modeling approach involves a simplified description of combustion kinetics and thermal energy transfer (averaged over local plantation height) and leads to a computationally inexpensive system of differential equations that provides the spatiotemporal evolution of the two-dimensional fields of temperature and combustibles. Key aspects of the model include the estimation of mean wind velocity through the plantation and the inclusion of the effect of ground inclination. Predictions are successfully compared to benchmark literature results concerning the effect of flammable bulk density, moisture content, and the combined influence of wind and slope. Simulations appear to provide qualitatively correct descriptions of firefront propagation from a localized ignition site in a homogeneous or heterogeneous canopy, of acceleration resulting from the collision of oblique firelines, and of firefront overshoot or arrest at fuel break zones.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear diffusion–reaction systems model a multitude of physical phenomena. A common situation is biological development modeling where such systems have been widely used to study spatiotemporal phenomena in cell biology. Systems of coupled diffusion–reaction equations are usually subject to some complicated features directly related to their multiphysics nature. Moreover, the presence of advection is source of numerical instabilities, in general, and adds another challenge to these systems. In this study, we propose a NURBS-based isogeometric analysis (IgA) combined with a second-order Strang operator splitting to deal with the multiphysics nature of the problem. The advection part is treated in a semi-Lagrangian framework and the resulting diffusion–reaction equations are then solved using an efficient time-stepping algorithm based on operator splitting. The accuracy of the method is studied by means of a advection–diffusion–reaction system with analytical solution. To further examine the performance of the new method on geometries more general than rectangles (e.g., L-shaped domains and parts of annuli), the well-known Schnakenberg–Turing problem is considered with and without advection. Finally, a Gray–Scott system on a circular domain is also presented. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithm to accurately reproduce the solution in the presence of complex patterns on more complicated geometries. Moreover, the new method clarifies the effect of geometry on Turing patterns.},

  abstract     = {One of the most significant current discussions in optimization under deep uncertainty is integrating machine learning and data science into robust optimization, which has led to the emergence of a new field called Data-Driven Robust Optimization (DDRO). When creating data-driven uncertainty sets, it considers a dataset’s complexity, hidden information, and inherent form. One of the more practical machine learning algorithms for creating data-driven uncertainty sets is support vector clustering (SVC). This algorithm has no prerequisites for preliminary information to generate uncertainty sets with arbitrary geometry. More scenarios can reduce risk when developing SVC-based uncertainty sets. However, the lack of a systematic way to manage the large number of these scenarios hinders the employment of SVC. This paper puts forward an incremental learning algorithm based on support vector clustering, called Incremental Support Vector Clustering (ISVC), to construct an uncertainty set incrementally and efficiently using large datasets. This approach’s novelty and main contributions include incrementally constructing uncertainty sets and dynamic management of outliers. In order to update the temporarily stored Bounded Support Vectors (BSV) and identify outliers, the idea of BSV-archive is offered, where the revision-and-recycle operation is tailored to do just that. As a result, some of the newly acquired information is preserved. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the proposed ISVC approach can create an uncertainty set comparable to that of an SVC-based method while using significantly less time.},

  abstract     = {Detecting Change Points (CPs) in data sequences is a challenging problem that arises in a variety of disciplines, including signal processing and time series analysis. While many methods exist for PieceWise Constant (PWC) signals, relatively fewer address PieceWise Linear (PWL) signals due to the challenge of preserving sharp transitions. This paper introduces a Markov Random Field (MRF) model for detecting changes in slope. The number of CPs and their locations are unknown. The proposed method incorporates PWL prior information using MRF framework with an additional boolean variable called Line Process (LP), describing the presence or absence of CPs. The solution is then estimated in the sense of maximum a posteriori. The LP allows us to define a non-convex non-smooth energy function that is algorithmically hard to minimize. To tackle the optimization challenge, we propose an extension of the combinatorial algorithm DPS, initially designed for CP detection in PWC signals. Also, we present a shared memory implementation to enhance computational efficiency. Numerical studies show that the proposed model produces competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We further evaluate the performance of our method on three real datasets, demonstrating superior and accurate estimates of the underlying trend compared to competing methods.},

  abstract     = {In the cloud, users need to connect to the data server to perform the file transmission via the Internet, and the Server transmits data to many servers. A machine or vehicle that can fly with the assistance of the air is known as an Aircraft. As an alternative to the downward thrust of jet engines, it uses either static lift or an airfoil&#39;s dynamic lift to combat gravity&#39;s pull. Drawing wall panel measurement points in the model is easy using the Aircraft Wall Panels (AWP) button. Draw wall panels between existing nodes or on the drawing grid using the relevant wall panel specifications. The technique intends to discover and extract information about undesirable defects such as dents, protrusions, or scratches based on local surface attributes gathered from a 3D scanner. Defects from a perfectly smooth surface include indentations and bumps on the surface. An image&#39;s features may be extracted by reducing the number of pixels in the picture to a manageable size so that the most exciting sections of the image can be recorded with Surface Feature Extraction (SFE). Some of the problems are the threat of drones and composite materials that do not break easily in oxymoronic. The aircraft&#39;s inner structure may have been damaged, although this is impossible to determine. A runway incursion severely threatens aviation safety because of the rise in aircraft movement on the airport surface and other human factors. An electronic moving map of airport runways and taxiways is shown to the pilot through a head-up display in the cockpit&#39;s head-down position. A practical feature extraction approach is required to ensure the safety of the airport scene in runway incursion prevention systems. All the drawbacks are rectified by AWP-SFE sensors installed along the runway centerline to detect magnetic signals generated by surface-moving targets, and this information is utilized to compute the target&#39;s length. The target length may extract peak features after regularizing the time domain data. Differentiation of target characteristics is used to determine the similarities between distinct targets. The suggested method&#39;s signal characteristics are more easily recognized than time domain or frequency domain feature methods. The experimental results show the proposed method AWP-SE to achieve a high-efficiency ratio of 88.2 %, activity ratio of 73.3 %, Analysis of aircraft in wall plane measurement point of 87.8 % and an error rate of 32.3 % compared to other methods.},

  abstract     = {The presence of threats and anomalies in the Internet of Things infrastructure is a rising concern. Attacks, such as Denial of Service, User to Root, Probing, and Malicious operations can lead to the failure of an Internet of Things system. Traditional machine learning methods rely entirely on feature engineering availability to determine which data features will be considered by the model and contribute to its training and classification and “dimensionality” reduction techniques to find the most optimal correlation between data points that influence the outcome. The performance of the model mostly depends on the features that are used. This reliance on feature engineering and its effects on the model performance has been demonstrated from the perspective of the Internet of Things intrusion detection system. Unfortunately, given the risks associated with the Internet of Things intrusion, feature selection considerations are quite complicated due to the subjective complexity. Each feature has its benefits and drawbacks depending on which features are selected. Deep structured learning is a subcategory of machine learning. It realizes features inevitably out of raw data as it has a deep structure that contains multiple hidden layers. However, deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks can capture arbitrary-length dependencies, which are difficult to handle and train. However, it is suffering from exploiting and vanishing gradient problems. On the other hand, the log-cosh conditional variational Autoencoder ignores the detection of the multiple class classification problem, and it has a high level of false alarms and a not high detection accuracy. Moreover, the Autoencoder ignores to detect multi-class classification. Furthermore, there is evidence that a single convolutional neural network cannot fully exploit the rich information in network traffic. To deal with the challenges, this research proposed a novel approach for network anomaly detection. The proposed model consists of multiple convolutional neural networks, gate-recurrent units, and a bi-directional-long-short-term memory network. The proposed model employs multiple convolution neural networks to grasp spatial features from the spatial dimension through network traffic. Furthermore, gate recurrent units overwhelm the problem of gradient disappearing- and effectively capture the correlation between the features. In addition, the bi-directional-long short-term memory network approach was used. This layer benefits from preserving the historical context for a long time and extracting temporal features from backward and forward network traffic data. The proposed hybrid model improves network traffic’s accuracy and detection rate while lowering the false positive rate. The proposed model is evaluated and tested on the intrusion detection benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. Our proposed model outperforms other methods, as evidenced by the experimental results. The overall accuracy of the proposed model for multi-class classification is 99.31% and binary-class classification is 99.12%.},

We also provide a reference strategy on parameter selection of locally refined composite meshes. Numerical tests confirm that finite element method on locally refined composite meshes has higher accuracy than uniform meshes, but the computational cost is less than that of graded meshes.

The literature abounds with cases demonstrating that, depending on how it is formulated, a solution can be shown to exist or not. Here we address the problem in terms of deterministic, block-sequential asynchronous updates, over cyclic configurations, by which the possibility of a solution remains open. Our main results are negative in terms of the possibility of solving the problem with such formulation, encompassing the cases of any cellular automaton with any sequential update, and any elementary cellular automaton with any block-sequential update; furthermore, we uncover some properties that any potential solution with block-sequential update should have in order for it to be a candidate to solving the problem.

A computational model of a human ankle joint with 43 input parameters serves as an illustrative case for the procedure. The Genetic Algorithm is used to efficiently search for distinct variants of the model with similar output, while clustering helps to quantify the obtained results. The search is performed in a close vicinity to the original model, mimicking subjective decisions in parameter acquisition. The method reveals twelve distinct clusters in the model parameter set, all resulting in the same angular displacements. These clusters correspond to three unique internal load states for the model, confirming the complex nature of the ankle. The proposed approach is general and could be applied to study other models in mechanical engineering and robotics.},

For fusing the outputs from multi-models, the weight assigned to each output is calculated based on two factors, namely the accuracy of each model and the similarity between the testing input and the focus data used for constructing the respective model. Specifically for similarity calculation, the focus data list is identified based on set operations. There are three theoretical contributions of this study, namely accuracy-and-similarity-based weight calculation, the set-operation-based similarity calculation which is an addition to traditional distance-based calculation, and the high compatibility of the proposed approach which is independent from any baseline approach. A practical case of overall reconnaissance capability evaluation of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm is studied for validation. Primary results indicate that the proposed approach can outperform two single models: the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. Further validations demonstrate that the proposed approach also outperforms multi-model output fusion with equal weights, without model accuracy, with varied focus data percentages ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. More importantly, the proposed approach remains effective in four different conditions of multi-model outputs fusion with improvements from 9.58 % to 38.03 %.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare systems worldwide are increasingly subject to in-depth analysis. Problems in healthcare systems are of concern to the general public. For example, overcrowding in emergency departments creates several issues including longer waiting times, more frequent medical errors, a longer length of stay and worsened performance indicators. Overcrowding situations reduce the availability of staff and material resources, and therefore deteriorate the quality of care. The main cause of the overcrowding in emergency departments is the permanent interferences between the scheduled patients, unscheduled patients and urgent and unscheduled patients arriving at the emergency department. The objective of the present study is to develop an innovative decision support system that minimizes these interferences, while taking into account the perturbations that can occur throughout the day. The research’s ultimate goal is to improve the performance indicators via two processes: the first is a memetic algorithm based on a four dimensional hypercube genetic algorithm and local search techniques, and the second is based on a multi-agent system which dynamically orchestrates the patient pathway (given by the scheduling algorithm). In order to test and validate our approach, experiments are designed with real data from the adult emergency department at Lille University Medical Center. Simulations showed that with our approach we were able to reduce the waiting time of patients by 28.12%.},

  abstract     = {The concept of digital twins promises to revolutionize engineering by offering new avenues for optimization, control, and predictive maintenance. We propose a novel framework for simultaneously training the digital twin of an engineering system and an associated control agent. The training of the twin combines methods from adjoint-based data assimilation and system identification, while the training of the control agent combines model-based optimal control and model-free reinforcement learning. The training of the control agent is achieved by letting it evolve independently along two paths: one driven by a model-based optimal control and another driven by reinforcement learning. The virtual environment offered by the digital twin is used as a playground for confrontation and indirect interaction. This interaction occurs as an “expert demonstrator”, where the best policy is selected for the interaction with the real environment and “cloned” to the other if the independent training stagnates. We refer to this framework as Reinforcement Twinning (RT). The framework is tested on three vastly different engineering systems and control tasks, namely (1) the control of a wind turbine subject to time-varying wind speed, (2) the trajectory control of flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) subject to wind gusts, and (3) the mitigation of thermal loads in the management of cryogenic storage tanks. The test cases are implemented using simplified models for which the ground truth on the closure law is available. The results show that the adjoint-based training of the digital twin is remarkably sample-efficient and completed within a few iterations. Concerning the control agent training, the results show that the model-based and the model-free control training benefit from the learning experience and the complementary learning approach of each other. The encouraging results open the path towards implementing the RT framework on real systems.},

  abstract     = {Advances in connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies have made signal-free intersections a viable option for enhancing traffic performance. In the absence of traffic signal control, sequencing control strategies become crucial to ensuring the safety and efficiency of conflicting traffic flows at these intersections. The First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Longest-Queue-First (LQF) strategies have received significant attention as fundamental approaches to managing connected and automated vehicles at signal-free intersections, serving as baselines for evaluating innovative strategies. However, the impact of varying traffic demand in conflicting directions on the volatility of CAV queues at signal-free intersections remains unclear, and there is a lack of analytical quantitative estimates on how these two fundamental sequencing strategies affect fairness within CAV queues. Furthermore, in urban road networks, CAVs entering a downstream intersection typically originate from an upstream intersection, and thus CAVs typically move in bunching and correlation. However, this phenomenon has received little attention in the modelling of CAV queues. To this end, in this paper, by virtue of the salient advantage of the Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) in describing the bunching and correlated arrival properties, an MAP-based double-input queueing model and its computational framework are developed to estimate the queueing process of CAVs at signal-free intersections. Some basic statistical metrics, such as queue length, delay, conditional queue length, and queue length variance, are derived. Additionally, numerical experiments are conducted to examine the queueing performance of FCFS and LQF strategies under different traffic conditions. The results suggest that the effectiveness of FCFS and LQF strategies varies depending on the level of traffic demand in the conflicting directions.},

  abstract     = {The brain is a complex system with functional and structural networks. Different neuroimaging methods have been developed to explore these networks, but each method has its own unique strengths and limitations, depending on the signals they measure. Combining techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has gained interest, but understanding how the information derived from these modalities is related to each other remains an exciting open question. The multilayer network model has emerged as a promising approach to integrate different sources data. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic and electrophysiological data captured by fNIRS and EEG to compare brain network topologies derived from each modality, examining how these topologies vary between resting state (RS) and task-related conditions. Additionally, we adopted the multilayer network model to integrate EEG and fNIRS data and evaluate the benefits of combining multiple modalities compared to using a single modality in capturing characteristic brain functioning. A small-world network structure was observed in the rest, right motor imagery, and left motor imagery tasks in both modalities. We found that EEG captures faster changes in neural activity, thus providing a more precise estimation of the timing of information transfer between brain regions in RS. fNIRS provides insights into the slower hemodynamic responses associated with longer-lasting and sustained neural processes in cognitive tasks. The multilayer approach outperformed unimodal analyses, offering a richer understanding of brain function. Complementarity between EEG and fNIRS was observed, particularly during tasks, as well as a certain level of redundancy and complementarity between the multimodal and the unimodal approach, which depends on the modality and the specific brain state. Overall, the results highlight differences in how EEG and fNIRS capture brain network topology in RS and tasks and emphasize the value of integrating multiple modalities for a comprehensive view of brain connectivity and function.},

Algorithmic differentiation can be applied symbolically at the level of the domain specific language, and the code generator reused to implement code required for an adjoint calculation. However the adjoint calculations are complicated by the well-known problem of storing or recomputing the forward data required by the adjoint, and different checkpointing strategies have been developed to tackle this problem. This article considers the combination of high-level algorithmic differentiation with step-based checkpointing schedules, with the primary application being for solvers of time-dependent partial differential equations. The focus is on algorithmic differentiation using a dynamically constructed record of forward operations, where the precise structure of the original forward calculation is unknown ahead-of-time. In addition, high-level approaches provide a simplified view of the model itself. This allows data required to restart and advance the forward, and data required to advance the adjoint, to be identified. The difference between the two types of data is here leveraged to implement checkpointing strategies with improved performance.},

To tackle these obstacles, this paper proposes a comprehensive solution. Our devised framework primarily leverages Python modules CFFI and dynamic linking library technology to seamlessly integrate ML algorithms with CFD programs, facilitating efficient data interchange between them. Distinguished by its simplicity, efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, our framework is adaptable across various CFD programs, scalable to multi-node parallelism, and compatible with heterogeneous computing systems. In this paper, we showcase a spectrum of CFD+ML algorithms based on this framework, including stability analysis of ML Reynolds stress models, bidirectional coupling between ML turbulence models and CFD programs, and online dimension reduction optimization techniques tailored for resolving unstable steady flow solutions. In addition, our framework has been successfully tested on supercomputer clusters, demonstrating its compatibility with distributed computing architectures and its ability to leverage heterogeneous computing resources for efficient computational tasks.},

This challenge can be tackled by means of semi-supervised learning methods that take advantage of both labelled and unlabelled data. In this work, we present new semi-supervised learning methods based on techniques from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). In particular, we have created two semi-supervised learning methods following two topological approaches. In the former, we have used a homological approach that consists in studying the persistence diagrams associated with the data using the bottleneck and Wasserstein distances. In the latter, we have considered the connectivity of the data. In addition, we have carried out a thorough analysis of the developed methods using 9 tabular datasets with low and high dimensionality. The results show that the developed semi-supervised methods outperform the results obtained with models trained with only manually labelled data, and are an alternative to other classical semi-supervised learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Hardness is a materials’ property with implications in several industrial fields, including oil and gas, manufacturing, and others. However, the relationship between this macroscale property and atomic (i.e., microscale) properties is unknown and in the last decade several models have unsuccessfully tried to correlate them in a wide range of chemical space. The understanding of such relationship is of fundamental importance for discovery of harder materials with specific characteristics to be employed in a wide range of fields. In this work, we have found a physical descriptor for Vickers hardness using a symbolic-regression artificial-intelligence approach based on compressed sensing. SISSO (Sure Independence Screening plus Sparsifying Operator) is an artificial-intelligence algorithm used for discovering simple and interpretable predictive models. It performs feature selection from up to billions of candidates obtained from several primary features by applying a set of mathematical operators. The resulting sparse SISSO model accurately describes the target property (i.e., Vickers hardness) with minimal complexity. We have considered the experimental values of hardness for binary, ternary, and quaternary transition-metal borides, carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, carboborides, and boronitrides of 61 materials, on which the fitting was performed.. The found descriptor is a non-linear function of the microscopic properties, with the most significant contribution being from a combination of Voigt-averaged bulk modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and Reuss-averaged shear modulus. Results of high-throughput screening of 635 candidate materials using the found descriptor suggest the enhancement of material’s hardness through mixing with harder yet metastable structures (e.g., metastable VN, TaN, ReN 2 2 , Cr 3 3 N 4 4 , and ZrB 6 6 all exhibit high hardness).},

  abstract     = {In the realm of fluid mechanics, where computationally-intensive simulations demand significant time investments, especially in predicting aerodynamic coefficients, the conventional use of time series forecasting techniques becomes paramount. Existing methods prove effective with periodic time series, yet the challenge escalates when faced with aperiodic or chaotic system responses. To address this challenge, we introduce DARSI (Deep Auto-Regressive Time Series Inference), an advanced architecture and an efficient hybrid of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) components. Evaluated against established architectures (CNN, DLinear, LSTM, LSTNet, and PatchTST) for forecasting Coefficient of Lift ( C L CL ) values corresponding to Angles of Attack (AoAs) across periodic, aperiodic, and chaotic regimes, DARSI demonstrates remarkable performance, showing an average increase of 79.95% in CORR, 76.57% reduction in MAPE, 94.70% reduction in MSE, 76.18% reduction in QL, and 75.21% reduction in RRSE. Particularly adept at predicting chaotic aerodynamic coefficients, DARSI emerges as the best in static scenarios, surpassing DLinear and providing heightened reliability. In dynamic scenarios, DLinear takes the lead, with DARSI securing the second position alongside PatchTST. Furthermore, static AoAs at 24.7 are identified as the most chaotic, surpassing those at 24.9 and the study reveals a potential inflection point at AoA 24.7 in static scenarios for both DLinear and DARSI, warranting further confirmation. This research positions DARSI as an adept alternative to simulations, offering computational efficiency with significant implications for diverse time series forecasting applications across industries, particularly in advancing aerodynamic predictions in chaotic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Constructing digital twins for predictive tumor treatment response models can have a high computational demand that presents a practical barrier for their clinical adoption. In this work, we demonstrate that proper orthogonal decomposition, by which a low-dimensional representation of the full model is constructed, can be used to dramatically reduce the computational time required to calibrate a partial differential equation model to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for rapid predictions of tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. In the proposed formulation, the reduction basis is based on each patient’s own MRI data and controls the overall size of the “reduced order model”. Using the full model as the reference, we validate that the reduced order mathematical model can accurately predict response in 50 triple negative breast cancer patients receiving standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The concordance correlation coefficient between the full and reduced order models was 0.986 ± 0.012 (mean ± standard deviation) for predicting changes in both tumor volume and cellularity across the entire model family, with a corresponding median local error (inter-quartile range) of 4.36 % (1.22 %, 15.04 %). The total time to estimate parameters and to predict response dramatically improves with the reduced framework. Specifically, the reduced order model accelerates our calibration by a factor of (mean ± standard deviation) 378.4 ± 279.8 when compared to the full order model for a non-mechanically coupled model. This enormous reduction in computational time can directly help realize the practical construction of digital twins when the access to computational resources is limited.},

  abstract     = {In network function virtualization (NFV), Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides an ordered sequence of virtual network functions (VNFs) and subsequent steering of traffic flows through them to cater to end-to-end services. This paper addresses the NP-hard problem of minimum cost SFC deployment to support customer services that access the carrier network’s NFV infrastructure (NFVI) through some edge routers. To determine the mappings of VNFs to physical servers, a challenging aspect would be the inter-server latencies that may fluctuate over time because of the sharing nature of cloud data centers. To construct the SFC, we come up with three different formulations, each corresponding to a different informational assumption about the link latencies: First, a centralized integer linear programming (ILP) formulation is given under the assumption of the non-causal availability of exact and instantaneous inter-server latencies. The solution to this ILP can serve as a lower bound to benchmark more scalable and realistic schemes. Next, we give a distributed game-theoretic formulation (with service broker agents as players) which only requires the statistical knowledge of link latency fluctuations. The game provably admits a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) and can be solved iteratively through the well-known best response dynamics (BRD) algorithm. Our main novelty lies in the third formulation in which each service broker has neither instantaneous nor statistical knowledge of the latencies. Instead, it relies on a game-theoretic learning algorithm to compose its VNF chain only based on its own history of adopted decisions and experienced delays on each logical link. We prove that the proposed learning algorithm asymptotically converges to NE and evaluate its performance through simulations in terms of convergence and the impact of network parameters.},

  abstract     = {The resonance of tsunami waves in semi-enclosed bays is paramount in understanding and mitigating the impact of seismic events on coastal communities. Semi-enclosed bays, characterized by their partial enclosure, can amplify the effects of incoming tsunami waves due to resonance behavior, where the natural frequencies of the bay correspond to those of the incoming waves. This resonance phenomenon can significantly increase wave height and inundation levels, posing an increased risk to nearby settlements and infrastructure. Understanding the resonance patterns in these bays is crucial for accurate hazard assessment, early warning systems, and effective disaster preparedness and response strategies. On October 30, 2020, an earthquake occurred between the Turkish Bay of Seferihisar Bay and the Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea. Long waves generated by the normal-faulting earthquake caused notable damage to settlements within Seferihisar Bay and the north coast of Samos Island. According to the measurements of the Syros mareograph stations, the wave heights were between 2 and 20 cm and wave periods between 9 and 20 seconds. Based on on-site survey reports conducted after the earthquake, inundation was reported in six settlements within Seferihisar Bay. However, inundation was notably higher in Sığacık and Akarca, reaching 2–3 times higher than in other locations, and the water level reached 2 m high. Given that the variance in inundation levels is attributed to resonance phenomena in Sığacık and Akarca rather than the propagation of tsunami waves, this study focused on conducting wave resonance modeling in Seferihisar Bay. The resonance modeling was performed using the RIDE wave model. Furthermore, the research has been expanded to assess the resonance patterns that might emerge in the event of an alternative earthquake or underwater landslide along the fault line responsible for the seismic event, encompassing wave periods ranging from T = 1–9 minutes and T = 20–30 minutes. Modeling results revealed that on the day of the earthquake, wave heights in Sığacık Marina and Akarca surged by 8.5 times in comparison to the wave height at the epicenter. This increase is notably higher, ranging from 2 to 2.5 times, compared to calculations made for other locations (Demircili, Altınköy, and Tepecik). Consequently, it was concluded that one of the reasons for the heightened effectiveness of inundation in Sığacık and Akarca was attributable to resonance. Moreover, supplementary investigations have indicated that waves with a period of T&lt;9 minutes will pose higher risks for Demircili, Altınköy, Sığacık Marina, and Tepecik compared to the day of the earthquake. By comprehensively studying wave resonance in semi-enclosed bays, researchers and policymakers can better anticipate the potential impact of tsunami events and take measures to protect coastal communities, ultimately increasing resilience and reducing the loss of life and property in vulnerable regions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-layer complex networks (MLCN) appears in various domains, such as, transportation, supply chains, etc. Failures in MLCN can lead to major disruptions in systems. Several research have focussed on different kinds of failures, such as, cascades, their reasons and ways to avoid them. This paper considers failures in a specific type of MLCN where the lower layer provides services to the higher layer without cross layer interaction, typical of a computer network. A three layer MLCN is constructed with the same set of nodes where each layer has different characteristics, the bottom most layer is Erdos–Renyi (ER) random graph with shortest path hop count among the nodes as gaussian, the middle layer is ER graph with higher number of edges from the previous, and the top most layer is preferential attachment graph with even higher number of edges. Both edge and node failures are considered. Failures happen with decreasing order of centralities of edges and nodes in static batch mode and when the centralities change dynamically with progressive failures. Emergent pattern of three key parameters, namely, average shortest path length (ASPL), total shortest path count (TSPC) and total number of edges (TNE) for all the three layers after node or edge failures are studied. Extensive simulations show that all but one parameters show definite degrading patterns. Surprising, ASPL for the middle layer starts showing a chaotic behaviour beyond a certain point for all types of failures.},

  abstract     = {Complex systems intricately intertwine with life, and the identification of the most influential spreaders in complex networks can aid in resolving numerous pragmatic problems. Nevertheless, the identification of such kinds of nodes currently stands as an open and challenging issue. In order to accurately and efficiently address this issue, numerous metrics have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a new method based on degree, clustering coefficient and k-shell decomposition value— D C K DCK to detect the most influential spreaders by gauging the spreading ability of nodes. The proposed centrality assesses the significance of a node by the impacts of its neighbors, encompassing both the local and global network structures. To evaluate the performance of D C K DCK , we compare it with different centrality measures under utilizing the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered model to simulate the propagation of epidemics across real-world networks. Experiments on real networks illustrate that D C K DCK exhibits superior differentiation ability and more accurate identification ability for influential spreaders and compared with other methods, Kendall’s τ τ correlation coefficient of the D C K DCK could be enhanced by 12.82%, 13.20%, 8.62%, 5.32%, 7.97% and 11.73% for the degree centrality, K-shell decomposition, G L I GLI centrality, H H - G S M GSM centrality, L G I LGI centrality and N P C C NPCC centrality.},

  abstract     = {In healthcare, a remarkable progress in machine learning has given rise to a diverse range of predictive and decision-making medical models, significantly enhancing treatment efficacy and overall quality of care. These models often rely on electronic health records (EHRs) as fundamental data sources. The effectiveness of these models is contingent on the quality of the EHRs, typically presented as unstructured text. Unfortunately, these records frequently contain spelling errors, diminishing the quality of intelligent systems relying on them. In this research, we propose a method and a tool for correcting spelling errors in Russian medical texts. Our approach combines the Symmetrical Deletion algorithm with a finely tuned BERT model to efficiently correct spelling errors, thereby enhancing the quality of the original medical texts at a minimal cost. In addition, we introduce several fine-tuned BERT models for Russian anamneses. Through rigorous evaluation and comparison with existing spelling error correction tools for the Russian language, we demonstrate that our approach and tool surpass existing open-source alternatives by 7% in correcting spelling errors in sample Russian medical texts and significantly superior in automatically correcting real-world anamneses. However, the new approach is far inferior to proprietary services such as Yandex Speller and GPT-4. The proposed tool and its source code are available on GitHub 1 and pip 2 repositories.

  abstract     = {Support vector machines (SVMs) are classic binary classification algorithms and have been shown to be a robust and well-behaved technique for classification in many real-world problems. However, there are ambiguities in the basic concepts of SVMs although these ambiguities do not affect the effectiveness of SVMs. Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik, who presented SVMs in 1995, pointed out that an SVM predicts through a hyperplane with a maximal margin. However existing literatures have two different definitions of the margin. On the other hand, Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik converted an SVM into an optimization problem that is much easier to solve. Nevertheless, existing papers do not explain how the optimization problem derives from an SVM well. These ambiguities may cause certain troubles in understanding the basic concepts of SVMs. For this purpose, this paper defines a separating hyperplane of a training data set and, hence, an optimal separating hyperplane of the set. The two definitions are reasonable since this paper proves that w 0 T x + b 0 = 0 w0Tx+b0=0 is an optimal separating hyperplane of a training data set when w 0 w0 and b 0 b0 constitute a solution to the above optimization problem. Some notes on the above margin and optimization problem are given based on the two definitions. These notes should be meaningful for clarifying the basic concepts of SVMs.},

  abstract     = {The constant growth of invasions and information theft by using infected software has always been a problem. According to McAfee labs in 2020, on average, 480 new viruses are created each hour. The means of identifying such threats, categorizing and creating vaccines may not be that fast. Thanks to the increasing processing power and the popularity of artificial intelligence, it is now possible to integrate intelligence on an antivirus engine to enhance its protecting capabilities. And doing so with good algorithms and parameterization can be a key asset in securing one’s environment. In this work we analyze the overall performance of our antivirus and compare it with other state-of-art antiviruses. In this work, we create an extreme neural network which can perform quick training time and have satisfactory accuracy when classifying unknown files that may or may not be infected with Citadel. Our virus database is built with many examples of well-known infected files, and our results are compared with other intelligent antiviruses created by other companies and/or researchers. The proposed technique stands out as a beneficial practice in terms of efficiency and interpretability; it achieves a very reduced number of neurons through its thorough pruning process. This reduction of dimensionality shrinks the input layer by 98%, enhancing not only data interpretation but also reducing the time required for training. Our antivirus achieves an overall performance of 98.50% when distinguishing harmless and malicious portable executable (PE) programs. To enhance accuracy, we conducted tests under various initial conditions, learning functions, and architectures. Our successful results consumes only 0.19 s of training when using the complete training database and the response time is so immediate that the computer rounds it to 0.00 s. In this work, we conclude that mELM implementations are viable, and their performance can match state-of-the-art ones. It’s training and classification times are among the fastest of the algorithms tested, and the accuracy in detecting Citadel-infected PEs is acceptable.},

In particular, we targeted on flash temperature during seizure process, which is difficult to measure directly in experiment and has not been simulated without using friction theory. Our model consisted of both a macroscopic elastoplastic consideration and a microscopic interfacial interaction consideration, and the heat generation scheme that 90% of the plastic strain energy is converted to heat energy were adopted in the model. The simulation demonstrated the seizure process in which the contact state is maintained by the strong interfacial interaction as the plastic strain progresses and the temperature rapidly rises. The flash temperature by the simulation provided a reasonable quantitative match at order level to a temperature estimated by substituting true contact area and interfacial heat flux obtained by the simulation into a theoretical formula of flash temperature.},

  abstract     = {Insulin is a kind of protein that regulates the blood sugar levels is significant to prevent complications associated with diabetes, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, and kidney damage. Insulin protein (IP) plays an active role in drug discovery, medicine, and therapeutic methods. Unlike experimental protocols, computational predictors are fast and can predict IP accurately. This work introduces a model, called IP-GCN for IP prediction. The patterns from IP are extracted by K-spaced position specific scoring matrix (KS-PSSM) and the model training is accomplished using powerful deep learning tool, called Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Additionally, we implemented Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) and Dipeptide Composition (DPC) for feature encoding to assess the predictive performance of GCN. To evaluate the efficacy of our novel approach, we compare its performance with well-known deep/machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Extremely Randomized Tree (ERT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Predictive results demonstrate that the proposed predictor (IP-GCN) secured the best performance on both training and testing datasets. The novel computational would be fruitful in diabetes drug discovery and contributes to research for therapeutic interventions in various Insulin protein associated diseases.},

The melting phenomenon with buoyancy effect has been considered. Hybrid nanofluids exhibit improved thermal connectivity, enhanced mechanical resilience, favorable aspect ratios, and superior thermal conductivity when compared to conventional nanofluids. The system of governing equations is transformed into dimensionless form using the Lie group approach. Numerical computations are performed utilizing the spectral local linearization method . It is demonstrated that the Nusselt number and friction drag are decreased due to the increase of manganese and nickel zinc ferrites particles in the fluid. Further, the melting parameter reduces entropy generation by 41.16% and the viscous dissipation parameter minimizes surface friction . Sensitivity analysis, conducted through RSM, reveals that skin friction and the Nusselt number are positively sensitive to the melting parameter. The numerical solutions have been compared with the available results along with error estimations, which show excellent agreement. Comparison of both hybrid nanofluids are displayed graphically. Finally, this work has many uses such as microwave and biomedical applications , electromagnetic interfaces, melting, and welding operations which are the most significant manufacturing applications important in various sectors such as cooling systems of nuclear reactors.},

This study introduces a novel method for calculating the horizontal displacement of a diaphragm wall, applicable to servo-controlled excavation, based on the non-limit earth pressure theory. Furthermore, the study investigates the coherence of axial forces in prestressed struts. First, the diaphragm wall is modeled as a rectangular thin plate with two opposite edges simply supported and the other two edges free. It is then divided into m×n small rectangles along the depth and length directions, and the external combined force within each small rectangle is calculated. Secondly, a non-linear set of force–displacement equations is constructed, and the recursive equation of the displacement of the diaphragm wall is obtained by applying the Newton–Raphson method. The method’s accuracy is confirmed through field measurement comparisons. Subsequently, The paper then applies the proposed methodology to scrutinize the effects of loading on individual and multiple struts on the axial forces of adjacent struts. The loading scheme for struts in deep excavation within soft soil areas can be referenced by utilizing this method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that leverages both data and numerical simulations to address the challenges of solving forward and inverse wave problems, particularly in the mid-frequency range. Our method is tailored for efficiency and accuracy, considering the computationally intensive nature of these problems, which arise from the need for refined mesh grids and a high number of degrees of freedom. Our approach unfolds in multiple stages, each targeting a specific frequency range. Initially, we decompose the wave field into a grid of finely resolved points, designed to capture the intricate details at various wavenumbers within the frequency range of interest. Importantly, the distribution of these grid points remains consistent across different wavenumbers. Subsequently, we generate a substantial dataset comprising 1,000 maps covering the entire frequency range. Creating such a dataset, especially at higher frequencies, can pose a significant computational challenge. To tackle this, we employ a highly efficient enrichment-based finite element method , ensuring the dataset’s creation is computationally manageable. The dataset which encompasses 1000 different values of the wavenumbers with their corresponding wave simulation will be the basis to train a fully connected neural network . In the forward problem the neural network is trained such that a wave pattern is predicted for each value of the wavenumber. To address the inverse problem while upholding stability, we introduce latent variables to reduce the number of physical parameters. Our trained deep network undergoes rigorous testing for both forward and inverse problems, enabling a direct comparison between predicted solutions and their original counterparts. Once the network is trained, it becomes a powerful tool for accurately solving wave problems in a fraction of the CPU time required by alternative methods. Notably, our approach is supervised, as it relies on a dataset generated through the enriched finite element method , and hyperparameter tuning is carried out for both the forward and inverse networks.},

In this study, we compare the performance of several graph neural networks for predicting the energy of water cluster anions, a system of fundamental interest in Chemistry and Biology. Following the identification of the graph attention network as the optimal aggregation procedure for this task, we obtained an efficient and accurate energy model. This model is then employed to conduct Monte Carlo simulations of clusters across different sizes, demonstrating stable behavior. Notably, the predicted surface-to-interior state transition point and the bulk energy of the system are consistent with findings from other investigations, at a computational cost three-orders of magnitude lower.},

  abstract     = {The concern of this manuscript is stabilized finite element simulations of two-dimensional incompressible and viscous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) duct flows governed by a coupled system of partial differential equations of the convection–diffusion type. In such flows, the high values of the Hartmann numbers ( Ha Ha ) indicate that the convection process dominates the flow field. As is typical trouble encountered in convection-dominated flow simulations, classical discretization methods fail to function properly for MHD flows at high Hartmann numbers , yielding several numerical instabilities. In this study, the core computational tool we employ in order to overcome such challenges is the streamline-upwind/Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) formulation. Beyond that, since the SUPG-stabilized formulation requires additional treatment where solutions experience rapid changes, we also enhance the SUPG-stabilized finite element formulation with a shock-capturing operator for achieving better solution profiles around sharp layers. The formulations are derived for both steady-state and time-dependent models. The proposed method, the so-called SUPG-YZ β β formulation, techniques used, and in-house-developed finite element solvers are evaluated on a comprehensive set of numerical experiments. The test computations reveal that the SUPG-YZ β β formulation yields quite good solution profiles near strong gradients without any significant numerical instabilities, even for quite challenging values of Ha Ha , whereas the SUPG usually fails alone. Furthermore, by using only linear elements on relatively coarser meshes, the proposed formulation achieves this without the need for any adaptive mesh strategy, in contrast to most previously reported studies.},

Lithium-ion battery (LIB) is frequently used battery in most of eVTOL because they have high charge storage capacity, good health of battery and long-life cycles. To maintain the health of battery, the state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH) are the most important parameters. This study demonstrates the SoC evaluation of batteries in eVTOL aircrafts and then forecasts SoC of batteries using different machine learning (ML) approaches such as Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Linear Regression. The experimental dataset was collected by an open portal at Carnegie Mellon University wherein over 15 million records including a hundred charge/discharge cycles, and several working conditions are available. SoC of batteries was first calculated by using collected dataset. Input parameters for SoC forecasting by ML models were prepared with different features such as voltage, current, charging/discharging energy and temperature. By feature selection analysis, E Discharge and voltage were found to be the most effective features for SoC of battery. The experimental dataset was first split into 80 % of training and 20 % of testing and then applied for three ML models (Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Linear Regression). As compared to other ML models, Random Forest presented the best performance having the lowest error values ( RMSE ≈ 0.000985, R 2 = 0.9996 ) due to non-linear relationship between every feature and SoC. The studies suggested that ML approach for battery’s SoC forecasting would provide promising methods to manage the health of battery for eVTOL aircraft.},

For a given universe X X , the popular greedy heuristic, called Greedy-SetCover , is the main theoretical contribution to obtain an approximate solution for the MSCP in polynomial-time, offering an optimal approximate ratio of ( ln | X | + 1 ) (ln|X|+1) . In this article, we propose an approximate algorithm for MSCP within a succinct representation of the input dataset, whose empirical performance improves Greedy-SetCover both in quality and execution time, while offering the same optimal approximation ratio for the problem. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm is magnitudes of times faster than the aforementioned greedy one, obtaining on average a cardinality much closer to the optimal solution. Furthermore, because we work on a succinct representation that allows us to compute operations between sets using bitwise operators, we can process much larger datasets than state-of-the-art solutions. As a result, our proposal is also a suitable alternative for processing large datasets as required by the current Big Data era.},

By reviewing existing literature, the majority of the HAR methods achieved limited performance, while trained and tested utilizing unseen Internet of Things (IoT) data. In order to achieve higher recognition performance in the context of HAR, a new clustering method named Modified Differential Evolution based Fuzzy Clustering (MDEFC) is proposed in this article. The proposed MDEFC method incorporates an asymptotic termination rule and a new differential weight for enhancing the termination condition and improving this method’s ability in exploring the solution space of the objective function. The extensive empirical analysis states that the proposed MDEFC method achieved impressive recognition results with minimal training time by using both spatial and temporal features of the individual. The proposed MDEFC method’s effectiveness is tested on a real time dataset and an online Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) v1.1 dataset. The result findings demonstrate that the proposed MDEFC method averagely obtained 99.73 % of precision and 99.86 % of recall on the WISDM v1.1 dataset. Similarly, the proposed MDEFC method averagely obtained 93.46 % of f1-measure, 94.60 % of recall, and 93.88 % of precision on the real time dataset.

Capable of complex agent-based simulations on a dynamic network, it is able to capture individual-level dynamics as well as dynamics of the network structure, and how these interact and evolve. By capturing the emergent behaviour resulting from the interactions of node states and network topology, we argue that DyNSimF will help modellers to gain a fundamentally better understanding of complex network systems. The package can handle both weighted and directional links, is computationally scalable and efficient, and includes a generic utility-based edge selection framework. DyNSimF provides a generic modelling framework for dynamics networks and includes visualisation methods and tools to aid in the analysis of models. It is designed to be extensible and aims to be easy to learn and work with, allowing non-experts to focus on model development, while being highly customisable and extensible to allow for complex custom models.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the issue of an adequate loss function in the optimization of machine learning models used in the forecasting of financial time series for the purpose of algorithmic investment strategies (AIS) construction. We propose the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL) function, solving important problems of classical forecast error functions in extracting information from forecasts to create efficient buy/sell signals in algorithmic investment strategies. MADL places appropriate emphasis not only on the quality of the point forecast but also on its impact on the rate of achievement by the investment system based on it. The introduction and detailed description of the theoretical properties of this new MADL loss function are our main contributions to the literature. In the empirical part of the study, based on the data from two different asset classes (cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and commodities: Crude Oil), we show that our new loss function enables us to select better hyperparameters for the LSTM model and obtain more efficient investment strategies, with regard to risk-adjusted return metrics on the out-of-sample data.},

  abstract     = {Modeling and analyzing interrelationships within the Bitcoin market, as a prominent cryptocurrency, leads to understanding hidden structures, effective management and informed decision-making. Regarding this matter, numerous studies have analyzed the time-varying spillover patterns in this ecosystem. Although spillover network analysis can elucidate the nature and strength of correlations, it may not be adept at handling the conditional interdependencies within intricate non-linear and dynamic essential behaviors of financial time series. This research tries to address the mentioned challenges by presenting a novel analytical model to investigate the dynamic communication patterns among Bitcoin, United States Economic Policy Uncertainty (US EPU) and public sentiments. Following this objective, rather than directly exploring the effect of original data series on each other, the approach decomposes them into sequences of meaningful statistical behaviors, at different lag-lead horizons. Subsequently, considering the significance of conditional dependencies, we extract and analyze the rules and patterns of information flow among the observed behaviors. The findings not only unveil a distinct flow pattern compared to the spillover network, but also offer valuable insights into dynamic interactions and dominant behaviors under various scenarios. One observation suggests that as the historical range of predictors increases in predicting future changes, their effectiveness or reliability decreases, while their number simultaneously increases. Moreover, the trend slope of Bitcoin functions as a notable behavior in propagating information, directly influencing both economic uncertainty and investor sentiment. The proposed model enhances the understanding of interaction between financial time series and provides useful perspectives for analysis and risk management.},

A genetic algorithm based on speed invariant and the elite algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-TSP assignment problem. To ensure the integration of the population, a population resettlement strategy with elite lakes was proposed to improve the probability of population transfer to the best Pareto solution. The experiment verified that this strategy can approach the optimal solution more closely during the population convergence process, and compared it with traditional Multi TSP algorithms and single function multi-objective Multi TSP algorithms. By comparing the total distance and maximum deviation of multiple robot systems, it is proven that this algorithm can effectively balance the path length of each robot in task allocation. From the research results, it can be seen that in genetic algorithms, resetting the population after reaching precocity can maintain the optimization characteristics of the population and have a high probability of obtaining Pareto solutions. At the same time, storing elite individuals from previous convergent populations for optimization can better obtain Pareto solutions.},

  abstract     = {In inverse analysis, Bayesian estimation is useful for understanding the reliability of the estimation result or prediction based on it because it can estimate not only optimal parameters but also their uncertainties. The estimation of an earthquake source fault based on observed crustal deformation is a typical inverse problem in the field of earthquake research. In this study, a method for simultaneous Bayesian estimation of earthquake fault plane geometry and spatially variable slip distribution on the plane has been developed. The developed method can be applied to stochastic models with arbitrary probability distribution settings, and it enables to incorporate appropriate constraints for slip distribution in the estimation process, which can lead to enhanced robustness and stability of estimation. Since this method is computationally more expensive than conventional methods, large-scale parallel computing was introduced to cope with the increased computational cost and a supercomputer was used for the analysis. To validate the proposed method, simultaneous Bayesian estimation of fault geometry and slip distribution with slip constraints was performed using the crustal deformation observed in the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake. Hierarchical parameterization and massively parallelized Bayesian inference used in this study have broad applicability not only in earthquake research but also in other scientific and engineering fields.},

  abstract     = {Forced migration is a major humanitarian challenge today, with over 100 million people forcibly displaced due to conflicts, violence and other adverse events. The accurate forecasting of migration patterns helps humanitarian organisations to plan an effective humanitarian response in times of crisis, or to estimate the impact of possible conflict and/or intervention scenarios. While existing models are capable of providing such forecasts, they are strongly geared towards forecasting headline arrival numbers and lack the flexibility to explore migration patterns for specific groups, such as children or persons of a specific ethnicity or religion. Within this paper we present Flee 3, an agent-based simulation tool that aims to deliver migration forecasts in a more detailed, flexible and reconfigurable manner. The tool introduces adaptable rules for agent movement and creation, along with a more refined model that flexibly supports factors like food security, ethnicity, religion, gender and/or age. These improvements help broaden the applicability of the code, enabling us to begin building models for internal displacement and non-conflict-driven migration. We validate Flee 3 by applying it to ten historical conflicts in Asia and Africa and comparing our results with UNHCR refugee data. Our validation results show that the code achieves a validation error (averaged relative difference) of less than 0.6 in all cases, i.e. correctly forecasting over 70% of refugee arrivals, which is superior to its predecessor in all but one case. In addition, by exploiting the parallelised simulation code, we are able to simulate migration from a large scale conflict (Ukraine 2022) in less than an hour and with 80% parallel efficiency using 512 cores per run. To showcase the relevance of Flee to practitioners, we present two use cases: one involving an international migration research project and one involving an international NGO. Flee 3 is available at https://github.com/djgroen/flee/releases/tag/v3.1 and documented on https://flee.readthedocs.io .},

Over recent years, deep learning methods have been utilized in a wide variety of research applications such as binding site prediction. In this study, a new combination of attention blocks in the 3D U-Net model based on semantic segmentation methods is used to improve localization of pocket prediction. The attention blocks are tuned to find which point and channel of features should be emphasized along spatial and channel axes. Our model&#39;s performance is evaluated through extensive experiments on several datasets from different sources, and the results are compared to the most recent deep learning-based models. The results indicate the proposed attention model (Att-UNet) can predict binding sites accurately, i.e. the overlap of the predicted pocket using the proposed method with the true binding site shows statistically significant improvement when compared to other state-of-the-art models.

However, the land components of most Earth System Models, including the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), typically neglect vertical canopy structure by using a single layer big-leaf representation to simulate water, CO 2 2 , and energy exchanges between the land and the atmosphere. In this study, we developed a Multi-Layer Canopy Model for the E3SM Land Model to resolve the micro-climate created by vegetation canopies. The model developed in this study re-implements the CLM-ml_v1 to support heterogeneous computing architectures consisting of CPUs and GPUs and includes three additional optimization-based stomatal conductance models. The use of Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation provides a speedup of 25–50 times on a GPU relative to a CPU. The numerical implementation of the model was verified against CLM-ml_v1 for a month-long simulation using data from the Ameriflux US-University of Michigan Biological Station site. Model structural uncertainty was explored by performing control simulations for five stomatal conductance models that exclude and include the control of plant hydrodynamics (PHD) on photosynthesis. The bias in simulated sensible and latent heat fluxes was lower when PHD was accounted for in the model. Additionally, six idealized simulations were performed to study the impact of three environmental variables (i.e. air temperature, atmospheric CO 2 2 , and soil moisture) on canopy processes (i.e. net CO 2 2 assimilation, leaf temperature, and leaf water potential). Increasing air temperature reduced net CO 2 2 assimilation and increased air temperature. Net CO 2 2 assimilation increased at higher atmospheric CO 2 2 , while decreasing soil moisture resulted in lower leaf water potential.},

Firstly, a spline-based differential quadrature (DQ) formula is developed to approximate the Riesz derivative by using cubic B-splines as trial functions, which allows us to approximate the fractional derivatives with high accuracy and small computational cost. We then utilize it to discretize the fractional derivatives in the governing equation and a cubic B-spline DQ scheme is further established by applying the finite difference (FD) scheme to the resulting system of ordinary differential equations. A brief implementation of the proposed DQ method is also presented. To examine the effectiveness of this spline-based DQ method, numerical tests are finally done on some benchmark problems and the simulation of rotating Gaussian hill in convection-dominated flow governed by fractional derivatives. The advantages in computational accuracy and efficiency are illustrated by comparing the results with the other algorithms in open literature.},

  abstract     = {The present study assesses RANS-based turbulence models to simulate the isothermal confined swirling flow in a combustor representing a constituent can combustor of the can-annular configuration used in jet engines. The two-equation models (standard k − ϵ k−ϵ , realizable k − ϵ k−ϵ , standard k − ω k−ω , SST k − ω k−ω ), and seven-equation model (linear pressure strain-Reynolds stress model, LPS-RSM), are assessed by comparing their predictions of mean axial velocity, mean transverse velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and shear stress with the experimental data at two different positions (i.e., the primary and dilution hole planes) in the combustor. While the two-equation models generally have failed to predict the confined swirling flow at both positions accurately, the SST k − ω k−ω model yielded the most accurate, followed by standard k − ω k−ω and realizable k − ϵ k−ϵ models. The discrepancies between the computational and experimental results could be attributed to the isotropic turbulence assumptions, which, however, are invalid for confined swirling flows. Further, the two-equation model formulations cannot capture the intricacies of vortex flow and its interaction with the surroundings in confined swirling flows. The LPS-RSM, which considers turbulence anisotropy, showed some promise, although overpredicted results follow the trend with experimental values at the primary holes plane. However, at the dilution holes plane, the model overpredicted the velocity field, and underestimated the turbulence field, including turbulent kinetic energy and shear stress. These observed discrepancies can be ascribed to the pressure-strain correlation in the LPS-RSM, which assumes the pressure is a linear function of the strain-rate tensor. However, this linear assumption is quite simplistic for complex flows. Further, the influence of discretization (SOU and third-order MUSCL) schemes of convective terms is also assessed, and the differences in predictions resulted from MUSCL scheme having lower diffusion and superior ability to capture sharper gradients, however, did not translate into improving the solution accuracy. Hence, this study suggests that more advanced high-fidelity turbulence models (e.g., hybrid RANS-LES, LES, DNS) are needed to accurately predict the confined swirling flow in combustors.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition has gradually attracted people&#39;s interest. However, this algorithm has some problems. For example, the diversity of the algorithm is poor, and the convergence and diversity of the algorithm are unbalanced. In addition, users don&#39;t always care about the entire Pareto front. Sometimes they may only be interested in specific areas of entire Pareto front. Based on the above problems, this paper proposes a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with dynamic weight vector (MOEA/D-DWV). Firstly, a weight vector generation model with uniform distribution or preference distribution is proposed. Users can decide which type of weight vector to generate according to their own wishes. Then, two combination evolution operators are proposed to better balance the convergence and diversity of the algorithm. Finally, a dynamic adjustment strategy of weight vector is proposed. This strategy can adjust the distribution of weight vector adaptively according to the distribution of solutions in the objective space, so that the population can be uniformly distributed in the objective space as much as possible. MOEA/D-DWV algorithm is compared with 9 advanced multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The comparison results show that MOEA/D-DWV algorithm is more competitive.

  abstract     = {Natural disasters, such as tsunamis and earthquakes, may affect gravely on human lives, infrastructure, and economy. Negative effects of these situations can be minimized with the help of technology. In this paper we propose ITS4Tsunamis, an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) that combines different technologies to help emergency management agencies to provide safe routes for their emergency vehicles. In the case of a tsunami emergency, these agencies must consider different aspects when moving with their vehicles, such as the road state and the vehicle features. Technologies such as Complex Event Processing (CEP) can be used to gather and process the information provided by a collection of sensors and assess the corresponding emergency level. In addition, we introduce uncertainty as a key element when determining the road-status, since this factor is uncertain by itself, and is based on the flood level and the number and size of obstacles in the roads. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is then used to deal with uncertainty and help authorities to evaluate the road accessibility. Safe routes are obtained using Colored Petri Nets (CPNs), a graphical formalism that allows us to analyze concurrent systems. This approach has been applied to Cádiz, a city in the southwest of Spain, which is close to an active tectonic rift. This work is an extended version of the conference paper by Díaz et al.

  abstract     = {A spreading process can be observed when particular information, substances, or diseases spread through a population over time in social and biological systems. It is widely believed that contact interactions among individual entities play an essential role in the spreading process. Although contact interactions are often influenced by geometrical conditions, little attention has been paid to understand their effects, especially on contact duration among pedestrians. To examine how the pedestrian flow setups affect contact duration distribution, we have analyzed trajectories of pedestrians in contact interactions collected from pedestrian flow experiments of uni-, bi- and multi-directional setups. Based on turning angle entropy and efficiency, we have classified the type of motion observed in the contact interactions. We have found that the majority of contact interactions in the unidirectional flow setup can be categorized as confined motion, hinting at the possibility of long-lived contact duration. However, ballistic motion is more frequently observed in the other flow conditions, yielding frequent, brief contact interactions. Our results demonstrate that observing more confined motions is likely associated with the increase of parallel contact interactions regardless of pedestrian flow setups. This study highlights that the confined motions tend to yield longer contact duration, suggesting that the infectious disease transmission risk would be considerable even for low transmissibility. These results have important implications for crowd management in the context of minimizing spreading risk. This work is an extended version of Kwak et al.

In this work, we perform the simulation on a graphics processing unit (GPU), a hardware solution widely used as an accelerator for scientific computing and deep learning. We show that GPUs can accelerate the simulation up to 25-fold compared to multi-core CPUs when using the GEMM subroutine on both. To hide memory latency, we fuse the element-wise operation into the GEMM kernel using C U T L A S S CUTLASS which can improve the performance by 26% ∼ ∼ 33% compared to the implementation based on c u B L A S cuBLAS . Furthermore, we perform the ‘on-the-fly’ calculation in the epilogue of the GEMM subroutine to avoid saving intermediate results on global memory, which makes large-scale atomistic spin dynamics simulations feasible and affordable.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI-Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of high-dimensional covariance matrices in latent factor models is an important topic in many fields and especially in finance. Since the number of financial assets grows while the estimation window length remains of limited size, the often used sample estimator yields noisy estimates which are not even positive definite. Under the assumption of latent factor models, the covariance matrix is decomposed into a common low-rank component and a full-rank idiosyncratic component. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the idiosyncratic component, under the assumption of a grouped structure of the time series, which may arise due to specific factors such as industries, asset classes or countries. We propose a generalized methodology for estimation of the block-diagonal idiosyncratic component by clustering the residual series and applying shrinkage to the obtained blocks in order to ensure positive definiteness. We derive two different estimators based on different clustering methods and test their performance using simulation and historical data. The proposed methods are shown to provide reliable estimates and outperform other state-of-the-art estimators based on thresholding methods.},

  abstract     = {The human brain is an enormous scientific challenge. Knowledge of the complete map of neuronal connections (connectome) is essential for understanding how neuronal circuits encode information and the brain works in health and disease. Nanoscale connectomes are created for a few small animals but not yet for the human. The key challenges in the development of a whole human brain model at the nanoscale are data acquisition and computing including big data and high performance computing. This work focuses on big data and volumetric and geometric modeling of brain morphology at the micro- and nanoscales. It presents the volumetric and four geometric neuronal models and estimates the storage required for them. It introduces four geometric neuronal models: straight wireframe, enhanced wireframe, straight polygonal, and enhanced polygonal. The volumetric model requires approximately from 4.2 to 33.6 petabytes (PB) at the microscale up to 5,600,000 exabytes (EB) at the nanoscale. The straight wireframe model requires 18 PB at the microscale and 24 PB at the nanoscale. The enhanced parabolic wireframe model needs 36 PB at the microscale and 48 PB at the nanoscale, whereas the enhanced cubic model requires 54 PB at the microscale and 72 PB at the nanoscale. The straight polygonal model requires 24 PB at the microscale and 32 PB at the nanoscale. The enhanced parabolic polygonal model needs 48 PB at the microscale and 64 PB at the nanoscale, while the enhanced cubic model needs 72 PB at the microscale and 96 PB at the nanoscale. The straight wireframe model of 18 PB is sufficient to enable computing of the human synaptome and subsequently the connectome. The only operational supercomputer able to provide such storage is the world’s first exascale supercomputer Frontier . The sizes of the volumetric and geometric models are comparable at the microscale, however, their difference is dramatic at the nanoscale; for the 10 nm resolution the geometric models are smaller approximately from 58 to 233 thousand times, and for the 1 nm resolution from 58 to 233 million times. This novel work is an extended version of a conference paper [15] and it represents a step forward toward the development of the human whole brain model at the nanoscale.},

This study introduces a novel community index as well as a CDA based on the newly introduced community index. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of the communities identified by the proposed CDA, we compare with six sets of communities identified by well-known CDAs, namely, FastGreedy, infomap, labelProp, leadingEigen, louvain, and walktrap. It is observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms its competing algorithms in terms of several prominent statistical and biological measures. We implement the hardware coding with Verilog, which surprisingly reduces the computation time by 20% compared to R programming while extracting the communities. Next, the communities identified by the proposed algorithm are used for topological and biological analysis with reference to the elite genes, obtained from Genecards, to identify potential biomarkers of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC). Finally, we discover that the genes F2RL3, CALM1, LPAR1, ARPC2, and CLDN7 carry significantly high topological and biological relevance of previously established ESCC elite genes. Further the established wet lab results also substantiate our claims. Hence, we affirm the aforesaid genes, as ESCC potential biomarkers.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the task of developing automated models for complex aerobatic aircraft maneuvers. The approach employed here utilizes Behavioral Cloning, a technique in which human pilots supply a series of sample maneuvers. These maneuvers serve as training data for a Machine Learning algorithm, enabling the system to generate control models for each maneuver. The optimal instances for each maneuver were chosen based on a set of objective evaluation criteria. By utilizing these selected sets of examples, resilient models were developed, capable of reproducing the maneuvers performed by the human pilots who supplied the examples. In certain instances, these models even exhibited superior performance compared to the pilots themselves, a phenomenon referred to as the “clean-up effect”. We also explore the application of transfer learning to adapt the developed controllers to various airplane models, revealing compelling evidence that transfer learning is effective for refining them for targeted aircraft. A comprehensive set of intricate maneuvers was executed through a meta-controller capable of orchestrating the fundamental maneuvers acquired through imitation. This undertaking yielded promising outcomes, demonstrating the proficiency of several Machine Learning models in successfully executing highly intricate aircraft maneuvers. This paper is an extended version of the previously ICCS 2023 published conference paper [1] .},

  abstract     = {Simulation is a useful and effective way to analyze and study complex, real-world systems, allowing researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to make sense of the inner working of a system involving many factors, often resulting in some sort of emergent behavior. The number of parameter value combinations grows exponentially and it quickly becomes infeasible to test them all or even to explore a suitable subset. How does one then efficiently identify the parameter value combinations that matter for a particular simulation study, and determine their impact on the result? In addition, is it possible to train a machine learning model to predict the outcome of an agent-based model (ABM) with a systematically chosen small subset of parameter value combinations, such that the result could be predicted without running the ABM? We use covering arrays to create t t -way ( t t = 2, 3, etc.) combinations of parameter values to significantly reduce an ABM’s parameter value exploration space, which is supported by our prior work. In our ICCS 2023 paper (Olsen et al., 2023) we built on that work by applying it to Wilensky’s Heatbugs model and training a random forest machine learning model to predict simulation results by using the covering arrays to select our training and test data. Our results show that a 2-way covering array provides sufficient training data to train our random forest to predict three different simulation outcomes. Our process of using covering arrays to decrease parameter space to then predict ABM results using machine learning is successful. In this paper that extends the ICCS 2023 paper (Olsen et al., 2023), we analyze the role of parameter combinations and parameter values in determining model output via combination frequency difference (CFD) analysis and Shapley values. CFD has not previously been applied to agent-based models; we provide a process for using this approach and compare and contrast with Shapley values and random forest feature importance.},

We discuss the stabilization of the advection-dominated diffusion problem with the Petrov–Galerkin (PG) formulation and present the FEM solution obtained with the PG method. The main benefit of using a stabilization method is that it can deliver a good-quality approximation to the solution on a mesh that is not fully refined towards the singularity. We employ PINN and VPINN methods, defining several strong and weak loss functions. We compare the training and solutions of PINN and VPINN methods with higher-order FEM methods. We consider a case with uniform FEM and uniform distribution of points for PINN, as well as uniform distribution of test functions for VPINN.

  abstract     = {One of the goals of Industry 4.0 is the adoption of data-driven models to enhance various aspects of the manufacturing process, such as monitoring equipment conditions, ensuring product quality, detecting failures, and preparing optimal maintenance plans. However, many machine-learning algorithms require a large amount of training data to reach desired performance. In numerous industrial applications, such data is either not available or its acquisition is a costly process. In such cases, simulation frameworks are employed to replicate the behavior of real-world facilities and generate data for further analysis. Simulation frameworks typically provide high-quality data but are often slow which can be problematic when real-time decision-making is required. Control approaches based on simulation-based data commonly face challenges related to inflexibility, particularly in dynamic production environments undergoing frequent reconfiguration and upgrades. This paper introduces a method that seeks to strike a balance between the reliance on simulated data and the limited robustness of simulation-based control methods. This balance is achieved by supplementing available data with additional expert knowledge, enabling the matching of similar data sources and their combination for reuse. Furthermore, we augment the methods with an explainability layer, facilitating collaboration between the human expert and the AI system, leading to informed and actionable decisions. The performance of the proposed solution is demonstrated through a case study on gas production from an underground reservoir resulting in reduced downtime, heightened process reliability, and enhanced overall performance. This paper builds upon our conference paper (Kuk et al., 2023), addressing the same problem with an extended, more generic methodology, and presenting entirely new results.},

In the first problem, given (a) the voter stance towards each law that will be voted by the parliament and (b) the political stance of each party towards each law (all party members are assumed to vote according to it), the goal is finding the parliamentary seats distribution maximizing the number of laws that will be approved/rejected as desired by the voter. In the second problem no parliament is involved, but a single issue with several possible answers is voted by citizens in a presidential election with several candidates. The problem consists in deciding how a group of voters, split in different electoral districts, all of them supporting the same candidate, should vote to make their candidate president. It is assumed that (a) all delegates of each electoral district are assigned to the candidate winning in the district, (b) after the election day, candidates may ask their assigned delegates to support other candidates receiving more votes than them, and these post-electoral supporting stances are known in advance by the electorate, and (c) the group of voters that is coordinated knows the votes that will be cast by the rest of the electorate. For each problem, its NP-hardness as well as its inapproximability are proved. This implies that something as essential as exercising the democratic right to vote, in such a way that the voting choice will be the best for the voter’s political stances, is at least NP-hard. It is also shown how genetic algorithms can be used to obtain reasonable solutions in practice despite the limitations of theoretical approximation hardness.},

This approach termed distance comparison (DiC) judges a new design candidate as worth evaluating by using its distance from the best solution.

The DiC method is integrated with a novel hybrid metaheuristic based on differential evolution (DE) and the Rao algorithm. In the proposed hybrid strategy, a modified Rao algorithm and an enhanced DE are applied adaptively based on the population diversity to utilize the advantage of each one for a specific stage of the optimization process. Six truss sizing examples with continuous variables, including the 10-bar and 200-bar planar trusses and the 25-bar, 72-bar, 120-bar, and 942-bar spatial trusses, are examined to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results demonstrate that DiC significantly reduces the number of structural analyses.

Current practice for treating collision hotspots is almost always reactive: once a threshold level of collisions has been exceeded during some predetermined observation period, treatment is applied (e.g. road safety cameras). However, more recently, methodology has been developed to predict collision counts at potential hotspots in future time periods, with a view to a more proactive treatment of road safety hotspots. Dynamic linear models provide a flexible framework for predicting collisions and thus enabling such a proactive treatment. In this paper, we demonstrate how such models can be used to capture both seasonal variability and spatial dependence in time dependent collision rates at several locations. The model allows for within- and out-of-sample forecasting for locations which are fully observed and for locations where some data are missing. We illustrate our approach using collision rate data from 8 Traffic Administration Zones in the US, and find that the model provides a good description of the underlying process and reasonable forecast accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Medical image analysis plays a crucial role in modern healthcare for accurate diagnosis and treatment. However, the inherent challenges and limitations posed by the complexity and variability of medical images, coupled with the shortcomings of existing methods, necessitate the development of novel approaches. In this study, we propose LiteFusionNet (Lightweight Fusion Network), a lightweight model that effectively addresses these challenges, offering the advantage of accurate and efficient medical image classification while mitigating the computational demands. The LitefusionNet leverages the power of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and feature fusion techniques to achieve improved performance in medical image classification. LitefusionNet combines the strengths of MobileNet and MobileNetV2 architectures to extract robust features from medical images. These features capture discriminative information from different levels of abstraction, enhancing the model&#39;s ability to capture fine-grained patterns. The fusion process employs a concatenation method to combine the extracted features, resulting in a more comprehensive representation that improves the model&#39;s classification accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of LitefusionNet, extensive experiments are conducted on a diverse set of publicly available medical image datasets, including brain MRI, skin, CT, X-ray, and histology. The results demonstrate that LitefusionNet outperforms several existing models in terms of classification accuracy, showcasing its efficacy in different medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, we provide interpretability to the model&#39;s predictions by performing Grad-CAM analysis, enabling insights into the important regions in the medical images that contribute to the classification decision. In addition, we compare LitefusionNet with five pre-trained models. LiteFusionNet excels in medical image classification, boasting impressive accuracies across diverse datasets: 97.33% for brain MRI, 91.11% for skin, 99.00% for CT, 98.15% for X-ray, and 92.11% for histology. These results underscore LiteFusionNet&#39;s robust and versatile performance, making it a compelling solution for accurate and efficient medical image analysis. Overall, LitefusionNet strikes a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and real-time performance. Our findings demonstrate its potential as a promising solution for accurate and efficient medical image analysis, with applications in diagnostic support systems and clinical decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation is an important technical tool, OTSU algorithm is a common method in threshold segmentation, but with the increase of the number of threshold segmentation, the selection of its threshold is a big problem, and the segmentation effect is difficult to be guaranteed. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a random collision whale optimization algorithm to optimize OTSU for reliable image segmentation. The algorithm is called RCWOA for short. Firstly, the Halton sequence is used to uniformly initialize the population to make the population position distribution uniform, and then the dimensional Opposition-based learning of small-hole imaging is introduced to update the whale position and find out the missing feasible solution. Finally, the random collision theory is used to update the position of the optimal individual to improve the quality of the solution, At the same time, it also improves the search ability of the algorithm. In 12 test functions, RCWOA was compared with 6 other algorithms, demonstrating the feasibility and novelty of RCWOA. In 8 experiments of fundus image segmentation, RCWOA was compared with 9 other algorithms.

  abstract     = {Clinical Pathways (CPs) consist of structured multidisciplinary guidelines and protocols used to model steps of clinical treatments. The main objective of applying CPs is that of optimizing both outcomes and efficiency — however, the actual implementation of CPs can be complex and result in important deviations and unexpected inefficiencies. In this paper, we develop an approach to identifying and understanding such problems by leveraging process mining techniques and background knowledge. We design specific data structures aimed at properly capturing the data produced during the implementation of CPs, including the treatment of more than one disease for a single patient. We then provide a methodology to discover and characterize congestion dynamics in CPs. Since the resulting process discovery problem is theoretically intractable, we develop heuristic algorithms that, based on an extensive experimental assessment, prove capable of discovering meaningful knowledge with a reasonable computational effort.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a novel control strategy is proposed to obtain the stability boundary in addition to reduce the transients around the equilibrium points. To encounter the described problem, a new approach of combining the bifurcation analysis with the state feedback controller is proposed. A bifurcation analysis at different equilibrium points is performed to obtain the stable region of operation. In addition to this, the transients behavior of the system is also obtained simultaneously in the form of eigenvalues plots. The objective of the proposed controller is to generate a control law and state variables to reduce the transients keeping the system within the stability boundary by tuning the reference input matrix. From the obtained simulation results, it is seen that, by combining the bifurcation analysis with state feedback controller, the transients and the steady state error are reduced by selecting the purely negative real eigenvalues and reference input matrix respectively. The obtained closed loop control law and the state variables utilizing Ackerman’s Formula are found within the stability limit. A sensitivity index obtained from local sensitivity analysis verifies the relationship between the stability boundary at different longitudinal velocity on a low-friction road obtained from bifurcation analysis.},

The cell-centered NIM (CCNIM) is a simplified variant of the NIMs that has recently shown its efficiency in solving fluid flow problems but has been hampered by issues such as inapplicability to one-dimensional problems, complexities in handling Neumann boundary conditions and the formulation of a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) for discrete unknowns. Here, we present a modified version of the CCNIM designed to overcome the challenges associated with its previous version. Our novel development retains the essence of CCNIM while resolving these issues. The proposed scheme, grounded in the nodal framework, achieves second-order accuracy in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Unlike its precursor, the proposed method formulates algebraic equations for discrete variables per node, eliminating the cumbersome DAE system. Neumann boundary conditions are seamlessly incorporated through a straightforward flux definition, and applicability to one-dimensional problems is now feasible. We successfully apply our approach to one and two-dimensional convection-diffusion problems with known analytical solutions to validate our approach. The simplicity and robustness of the approach lay the foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.},

Our discretization enforces jump conditions across the grounding line and achieves high-order accuracy using stencils constructed with a weighted least-squares method.

Understanding the dynamics of bubble columns is essential for optimizing their performance in various applications. This study proposes a data-driven approach for analyzing the dynamics of a two-dimensional bubble column system. We conducted simulations with varying superficial velocities and generated a comprehensive training dataset encompassing the entire velocity and pressure fields to achieve this. We then compared the performance of two approaches, the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) and the High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD), in representing the system’s dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that the conventional FFT approach fails to adequately capture the complex dynamics of the dispersed multiphase flow system. This limitation arises due to the distribution of frequencies along the domain. Conversely, our work highlights the success of the HODMD method in accurately representing the system’s dynamics using only a few arbitrary sampling points within the domain. The implications of this study are significant, as it sheds light on the potential benefits of employing HODMD for analyzing bubble column dynamics. By utilizing this approach, industrial processes can be optimized more effectively across various applications.},

In these scenarios, while governing equations are known, the available data consist of only a limited set of snapshots for system parameters. Our model consists of two key components: the generator and the encoder, both updated alternately by gradient descent. In contrast to previous approaches that directly match approximated solutions with real snapshots, we employ an indirect matching operating within the lower-dimensional latent feature space. This method circumvents challenges associated with high-dimensional inputs and complex data distributions in solving SDEs. Numerical experiments indicate that, compared to existing deep learning solvers, our proposed approach not only demonstrates superior accuracy but also exhibits advantages in both computational efficiency and model complexity.},

We have ported the code to C++, significantly optimized the data structure to minimize memory accesses, and developed parallel implementations for CPU and GPU commodity devices using oneAPI libraries and tools. This results in CPU and GPU versions that are up to 19x and 83x faster, respectively, than an OpenMP baseline that uses eight CPU cores. Most importantly, the proposed optimizations for CPU and GPU can be paramount to get the most out of other LiDAR-based algorithms in which the careful selection of the right data structure, parallelization strategies and memory access reduction techniques will certainly result in significant performance improvements.},

It also profoundly influences and enriches the spiritual and cultural experiences of people living in cities and nearby spaces. The reason for the emphasis on green corridors is that many cities and towns are constantly expanding, and the urban green space system has not yet formed an effective network. At the same time, factors such as the loss of the urban natural environment, biodiversity reduction, and environmental degradation have led to the need to build urban green corridors to deal with risks. By improving the neural network model, this paper predicted the construction land scale of the urban green corridor network, which was used to adjust the land use structure of the green corridor and optimize the land use layout. This paper aims to use the upgraded neural network method to predict the scale of urban green corridor network building land, which helps to evaluate the ecological security status. It can solve the dynamic solution problem of multi-indicator variable weight problems, overcoming the influence of subjective factors in the weight-setting process. The experiment adopted the improved neural network model for prediction. The results showed that its accuracy was much higher than the gray prediction model, which has improved by about 14.81%. This paper fully proved that the improved neural network model had a high degree of fit and feasibility for predicting the land scale of urban green corridor networks. It is directly related to the rationality and practicability of the urban green corridor network planning scheme, which plays a role in guaranteeing the ecological security of the landscape.},

Recently, scaffolds emerged as potentially more efficient method in restoring bone continuity. In this paper, an attempt was made to validate the correctness of this statement. Three lengths of bone defects were selected for the analysis: 35, 45 and 55 mm, located in the lower, middle and upper section of femur diaphysis. The following methods of restoring bone continuity were evaluated: 1 plate, 2 parallel plates, 1 plate and scaffold, 2 parallel plates and scaffold. Simulations of the forces generated during human gait cycle were performed. The evaluated parameters obtained were: maximal and average stresses, strain energy density as well as percentage changes in values of these parameters in relation to the values obtained for intact bone in its selected zones. Studies have shown that the best method of restoring bone continuity is to use a single plate with a scaffold. The stress distribution obtained by this method had the highest similarities to the one obtained for intact bone model in terms of load transfer as well as maximal stresses values obtained. The study validated the statement that the use of a scaffold to restore bone continuity is potentially more efficient method than conventional approaches.},

  abstract     = {A new pressure-projection pre-conditioning multi-fractional-step (PPP-MFS) method for incompressible Navier–Stokes flow in porous media is presented. This fractional step method is applied to decouple the pressure and the velocity; thereby, overcoming the computational costs and difficulty associated with the resolution of the nonlinear term in the Navier–Stokes equation for fine geometric models. Specifically, time evolution is decomposed into a sequence of multi-fractional solution steps. In the first step, an elliptic problem is solved for pressure ( p p ) with a no-slip boundary condition. This gives the Stokes pressure and velocity fields. In the second step, the obtained pressure p p is then projected onto the field p ∗ p∗ and used to solve for velocity field ( u u ) required for the pre-conditioning of the solution to the Navier–Stokes equation. The pressure and velocity fields are obtained from the solution of the Navier–Stokes equation in the third step. Numerical and geometric discretisation of porous samples were carried out using finite-element method. For flow in simple channel models represented by two- and three-dimensions and in systems with high conductivity, the Stokes and Navier–Stokes numerical solutions produced close pressure and velocity field approximations. For flow around a cylinder, computation time is consistently higher in the Navier–Stokes equation by a factor of 2 with a pronounced non-symmetric pressure field at high mesh refinements. This computation time is desirable given that Navier–Stokes computation without preconditioning can be orders of magnitude more expensive.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new task assignment scheme for sparse LDL T factorization on a hybrid GPU-CPU platform, and correspondingly an efficient supernodal algorithm, GPU Node and CPU Pipelining ( GNCP ). GNCP assigns a large number of weakly coupled tasks to GPU and CPU respectively so that GPU and CPU can execute different factorization tasks concurrently without explicit synchronization, which has not been achieved by previous researches. More precisely, based on the number of CPU threads, the global memory of GPU as well the size of the matrix, we introduce the concept of the truncation level in the partition tree built by the multi-level graph partitioning. The sum of FLOP associated with decoupled nodes in the truncation level accounts for about 65% of the whole computations in tested numerical examples. GNCP assigns the factorization tasks of each node in the truncation level to GPU. The data of each node in the truncation level are copied to the global memory of GPU and factorized entirely and independently by GPU one-by-one. Once factorization of any node in the truncation level has been completed, the cross-factorizations of this node to its ancestors and the following related operations are decoupled from other GPU tasks. These tasks are assigned to CPU threads with a reentrant pipelining strategy, accounting for about 35% of the whole calculations. Using this novel design, CPU and GPU are working concurrently and a large part of factorization is performed in overlapped time. Numerical tests for matrices from SuiteSparse matrix collection show higher performance than the well-known hybrid GPU-CPU solver CHOLMOD.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the evolution of water vapor content has significant practical engineering implications for accurately determining the timing of artificial rain enhancement operations. However, the nonlinear, unstable, and chaotic nature of water vapor content presents considerable challenges to its precise prediction. To address this, our research proposes a combined prediction model, based on a neural network model selection mechanism and small sample water vapor content data observed by microwave radiometers in the Zhengzhou area. This combined model utilizes seven neural network models as candidate models and dynamically selects the optimal three models as the central prediction components via evaluation indicators. Additionally, we employ the maximum information coefficient method to preserve the optimal input features and use a time-varying rate wave mode decomposition algorithm as the front-end processing module. This module processes the original water vapor content sequence and extracts relevant latent information. Finally, we incorporate the African vulture intelligent optimization algorithm as the backend processing component to optimize the weighted combination coefficients, achieving the integration of prediction results. Experimental results reveal that the Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) of the proposed model on three types of water vapor content datasets are 0.208%, 0.876%, and 0.369%, respectively. This suggests a predictive performance improvement of at least 10% compared to existing models. The prediction model proposed in this study not only establishes an accurate and reliable mechanism for predicting water vapor content but also offers more comprehensive decision support information for weather modification operations.},

  abstract     = {Grammatical inference involves learning a formal grammar as a finite state machine or a set of rewrite rules. This paper focuses on inferring nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) from a given sample of words: the NFA must accept some words, and reject the others. To address this task we construct several over-constrained inference models capable of finding NFA of size k + 1 k+1 , which are directly convertible to NFA of size k k . Additionally, we propose an NFA evaluation method based on random walks along with two methods used to enhance the acceptance rates of the inferred NFA. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through the results of comprehensive experiments conducted on several benchmark sets. This paper is an extended version of the ICCS 2023 paper entitled “Inference of over-constrained NFA of size k + 1 k+1 to efficiently and systematically derive NFA of size k k for grammar learning” (Jastrzab et al., 2023 [1] ).},

  abstract     = {The steam generator is an essential equipment in power plants, and understanding its behavior with the aid of mathematical models allows for improved decision-making aiming toward better efficiency. Well-calibrated models can help identify new operating conditions that lead to efficiency enhancement. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of steam generators, computationally efficient models based solely on energy-mass balance usually present limiting simplifications. Alternatively, computational fluid dynamics can solve reacting flow phenomena but require a great amount of computational time. Purely data-driven models often extrapolate poorly as they do not necessarily contain the physical equations that drive the system’s behavior. In this scenario, the multi-fidelity approach is an attractive solution because it combines physics-grounded representation with a low computational footprint and allows for mapping the efficiency of the steam generator considering uncertainty propagation. This paper presents a multi-fidelity model that simulates the efficiency of a steam generator from the PECÉM power plant. The model is assembled by the sum of two Gaussian processes, trained using one high-fidelity and one low-fidelity dataset. The high-fidelity dataset is formed by the observed operation of the actual power plant at varying operating conditions. These same operating parameters are the input for the energy-mass balance model built using the EBSILON software to generate the low-fidelity dataset. The observed efficiency of the PECÉM power plant ranged from 82.89% to 84.37%, with a mean value of 83.58%. The resulting multi-fidelity model presents a root mean square error of 0.19%, which is six times lower than the error obtained by the energy-mass balance model. This model is then used for global sensitivity analysis and robust optimization. A Pareto front mapping expected efficiency and its confidence level is built by exploring not yet experimented operational points. Finally, data clustering allowed the identification of efficiencies around 86%, which adds 1.63% to the power plant’s maximum level.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address a way to reduce the total computational cost of meshless approximation by reducing the required stencil size through spatially varying computational node regularity. Rather than covering the entire domain with scattered nodes, only regions with geometric details are covered with scattered nodes, while the rest of the domain is discretized with regular nodes. A simpler approximation can be used in regions covered by regular nodes, effectively reducing the required stencil size and computational cost compared to the approximation on scattered nodes where a set of polyharmonic splines is added to ensure convergent behaviour. This paper is an extended version of conference paper entitled “Spatially-varying meshless approximation method for enhanced computational efficiency” (Jančič et al., 2023) presented at “International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2023”. The paper is extended with discussion on development and implementation of a hybrid regular-scattered node positioning algorithm (HyNP). The performance of the proposed HyNP algorithm is analysed in terms of separation distance and maximal empty sphere radius. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that HyNP nodes can be used for solving problems from fluid flow and linear elasticity, both in 2D and 3D, using meshless methods. The extension also provides additional analyses of computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution obtained on the spatially-variable regularity of discretization nodes. In particular, different levels of refinement aggressiveness and scattered layer widths are considered to exploit the computational efficiency gains offered by such solution procedure.},

A bottom-up hierarchical specification-driven metacomputing framework was developed to automate the composition and deployment of necessary resources, and the generation of all necessary code, files, and parameter selections required for solving multiphysics problems. Utilization of the framework amounts to the generation of directly computable multiphysics models. The user’s role is reduced to providing (through a graphical user interface) the specification of the problem and its associated physics every time a new problem arises, while the rest of the resources are specified once at the beginning of the process. The proposed approach requires enabling and implementing transformation and composition of specifications describing seemingly heterogeneous entities such as problem (physics, boundary and initial conditions) and computational resources specifications. This is achieved by the utilization of Category Theory constructs and software that can implement them. This framework features a graphical user interface for capturing physics problem specifications at the meta-meta level, generating runtime scripts and input files for problem solving, and capturing problem specifications intuitively. Finally, the framework is demonstrated with its application to a conjugate heat transfer challenge problem associated with an aerobraking structure under hypersonic conditions.},

As a result, this study examines the stress distribution within the sphere, and how they is affected by the joint dimensions (sphere and bolts diameters, threading length and inclination angle of diagonals), in addition, the study aims to develop practical (AI) based predictive model to estimate the stress values at the critical points of the sphere. A numerical parametric study utilizing a FEM model calibrated by literature experimental was used to accomplish these goals. Thirty-four spherical steel bolted joints were developed using ANSYS workbench software to determine the stress values at center, top surface, bottom surface and at thread contact area. The outcomes of the parametric study were used to train and validate the developed ANN predictive model. The research results indicated that the average accuracy of the ANN productive model is about 85%, the maximum stresses are always located at the threading area, then at the sphere surface, while it is minimum at the sphere center. Finally, the diagonal inclination angle has almost no impact on the stress distribution.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing is gaining popularity in high-performance computing applications. Its utilization enables advanced simulations when local computing resources are limited. However, cloud usage may increase costs and entail resource unavailability risks. This article presents an original approach that employs machine learning to predict long-term cloud resource usage. This enables optimizing resource utilization through appropriate reservation plans, reducing the associated costs. The solution developed utilizes statistical models, XGBoost, neural networks and the Temporal Fusion Transformer. Long-term prediction of cloud resource consumption, especially the Cloud Resource Usage Optimization System that is critical for prolonged simulations, involves using prediction results to dynamically create resource reservation plans across various virtual machine types for HPC on the Google Cloud Platform. Experiments using real-life production data demonstrate that the TFT prediction model improved prediction quality (by 31.4%) compared to the best baseline method, particularly in adapting to chaotic changes in resource consumption. However, it should be noted that the best prediction model in terms of error magnitude might not be the most suitable for resource reservation planning. This was validated by the neural network-based method, introducing an FR metric for forecast evaluation. Resource reservation plans were assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively, focusing on various aspects like a service-level agreement compliance and potential downtime.

We attempt to quantify the reliability of input parameter identifiability through the lens of 4 clinically relevant measurements and the attendant difficulty in personalising the model. In turn, this that we extend existing methods which combine both parameter influence and orthogonality, to global sensitivities. By examining different parameter sensitivity evaluation methodologies, we investigate the stability of optimal parameter subsets which are commonly used to aid clinical investigations. In order to perform the personalisation process, one must understand the complexity of the high dimensional input parameter hyperspace associated with this class of model. By utilising Sobol indices, we propose a domain-agnostic and intuitive approach. This involves varying the bounds of the input parameter space relative to the model’s base state. These investigations yield a pseudo-mapping of the input hyperspace, cementing our understanding of the role of identifiable input parameters in the state-space model. Our findings suggest a novel global methodology for input parameter identifiability and input hyperspace mapping, providing valuable insights into solving the personalisation process.},

  abstract     = {Fractional order differential equations are often employed to better and accurately model several natural and physical processes with memory characteristics than the integer-order models. In this work, a proposed fractional-order model is presented to simulate one of the most dangerous viral cattle diseases. The present fractional-order Lumpy Skin Disease model considers the interactions between different compartments of cattle and virus vectors. The solution of the model is examined in terms of existence, uniqueness, positivity and boundedness. Then, the stability analysis of the different equilibrium points in the model is carried out. The basic reproduction number, R 0 R0 , has been obtained too. The dependence of stability regions on the values of key parameters is demonstrated and the sensitivity of R 0 R0 to different parameters in the system is also investigated. Finally, a proposed optimal control scheme is adopted to successfully diminish the disease spread. It is found that the stability of disease-free equilibrium point is verified at small values of the infection rate of cattle caused by infected cattle or insects. In addition, the disease-free equilibrium point maintains its stability in cases where the recovery rate of cattle or the vaccination rate of cattle are increased. Moreover, the high-efficiency vaccination program helps in stabilizing the disease-free equilibrium point. Also, the fractional-order parameter is found to provide additional degree of freedom in the model to represent different scenarios of evolution for solution orbits. The optimal control parameters of the model are examined in different scenarios to limit or suppress the spread of the disease. It is demonstrated that two control parameters are sufficient to achieve the goals of disease elimination and stabilization of an infection-free steady state. Numerical simulations are verified to confirm our theoretical findings and estimations.},

  abstract     = {When solving partial differential equations on scattered nodes using the Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method, one of the parameters that must be chosen is the stencil size. Focusing on Polyharmonic Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that it affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way — the solution error oscillates under increasing stencil size. We find that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed approximation error. Based on this observation we are able to introduce a numerical quantity that could indicate whether a given stencil size is locally optimal. This work is an extension of our ICCS 2023 conference paper (Kolar-Požun et al., 2023).},

  abstract     = {Accurate simulation of sea ice is critical for predictions of future Arctic sea ice loss, looming climate change impacts, and more. A key feature in Arctic sea ice is the formation of melt ponds. Each year melt ponds develop on the surface of the ice and primarily via affecting the albedo, they have an enormous effect on the energy budget and climate of the Arctic. As melt ponds are subgrid scale and their evolution occurs due to a number of competing, poorly understood factors, their representation in models is parametrised. Sobol sensitivity analysis, a form of variance based global sensitivity analysis is performed on an advanced melt pond parametrisation (MPP), in Icepack, a state-of-the-art thermodynamic column sea ice model. Results show that the model is very sensitive to changing its uncertain MPP parameter values, and that these have varying influences over model predictions both spatially and temporally. Such extreme sensitivity to parameters makes MPPs a potential source of prediction error in sea-ice models, given that the (often many) parameters in MPPs are usually poorly known. Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown great potential in learning and replacing subgrid scale processes in models. Given the complexity of melt pond physics and the need for accurate parameter values in MPPs, we propose an alternative data-driven MPPs that would prioritise the accuracy of albedo predictions. In particular, we constructed MPPs based either on linear regression or on nonlinear neural networks, and investigate if they could substitute the original physics-based MPP in Icepack. Our results shown that linear regression are insufficient as emulators, whilst neural networks can learn and emulate the MPP in Icepack very reliably. Icepack with the MPPs based on neural networks only slightly deviates from the original Icepack and overall offers the same long term model behaviour. We then searched for the smallest possible emulator that achieves good performance by performing features selection based on mutual information. Results indicates that a smaller model, based only on a portion of the full set of input variables needed by the physical MPP, is also sufficient to approximate and replace the physical MPP. This smaller emulators are not only computationally faster but also easier to interpret on a physical ground. Several and diverse challenges still exist, yet this study is an encouraging first step, prior to using real data, towards the adoption of data-driven MPPs in sea-ice models.},

  abstract     = {Smart grid intelligently transforms modern power system through the introduction of various advanced techniques, promoting the growth of distributed renewable energy sources and improving the efficiency of load management. The construction of smart grid recognizes the importance of net load forecasting, which represents the difference between the demanded load and the renewable energy generation, and has a significant impact on power system monitoring and control. Recently, some Transformer-based models have shown excellent performances in load forecasting. However, most of them perform weakly in face of net load forecasting due to the lack of emphasis on the specific trend variations and the inter-feature dependencies in cyclical temporal patterns. To address the two issues, we present the PSGformer that consists of multiscale series decomposition, seasonal module and trend module, which can focus on unique properties that affect the accuracy of net load forecasting by processing different components obtained from the series decomposition. The seasonal module seamlessly introduces graph attention network into the Transformer to compensate for the capability of capturing local inter-feature dependencies. The trend module adopts a new segment-wise iterative approach to capture trend patterns. Compared to the six baseline models, PSGformer has higher forecasting accuracy and stability on four load datasets from different countries.},

A comprehensive grid independence study and validation were conducted to ensure the accuracy of our simulations. We focus on particles with 10-, 50-, and 100-microns diameters. Our simulations indicate that the primary flow (relative tangential velocity) of both the fluid and the particles follow the input acceleration. We also examined the secondary flow within the toroidal. Smaller particles (10 microns) closely follow the fluid flow with minimal lag, while larger particles (50 and 100 microns) exhibit a noticeable lag due to the inertia effect. Furthermore, the displacement from the initial position is also dependent on the particle size, with smaller particles traveling further distances. However, despite the ongoing acceleration of the fluid and the toroidal, the largest particles (100 microns) eventually settle and stop due to their high inertia (mass), and their velocity begins to decrease during the acceleration of the toroidal. These findings highlight the significant role of particle size in determining particle behavior within a toroidal, paving the way for future research and Particle Imaging Velocimetry Gyroscope (PIVG) application.},

  abstract     = {Community detection, which involves partitioning nodes within a network, has widespread applications across computational sciences. Modularity-based algorithms identify communities by attempting to maximize the modularity function across network node partitions. Our study assesses the performance of various modularity-based algorithms in obtaining optimal partitions. Our analysis utilizes 104 networks, including both real-world instances from diverse contexts and modular graphs from two families of synthetic benchmarks. We analyze ten inexact modularity-based algorithms against the exact integer programming baseline that globally optimizes modularity. Our comparative analysis includes eight heuristics, two variants of a graph neural network algorithm, and nine variations of the Bayan approximation algorithm. Our findings reveal that the average modularity-based heuristic yields optimal partitions in only 43.9% of the 104 networks analyzed. Graph neural networks and approximate Bayan, on average, achieve optimality on 68.7% and 82.3% of the networks respectively. Additionally, our analysis of three partition similarity metrics exposes substantial dissimilarities between high-modularity sub-optimal partitions and any optimal partition of the networks. We observe that near-optimal partitions are often disproportionately dissimilar to any optimal partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of the commonly used modularity-based methods: they rarely produce an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition even on networks with modular structures. If modularity is to be used for detecting communities, we recommend approximate optimization algorithms for a methodologically sound usage of modularity within its applicability limits.

Based on the evidence distance, an information distance I d Id is computed to find out how similar nodes are, and second-order adjacent nodes are used to reflect node information. Information distance is used to determine the weight of a node, and a weighted information index (WII) is used to evaluate how important a node is by combining the weight and information of nodes. The proposed method is tested by identifying influential nodes in twelve real-world networks and comparing their performance with the other seven methods. The Susceptible–Infected (SI) model and two evaluation indices have been applied to twelve real-world networks to evaluate the feasibility of our method. The findings indicate that the WII exhibits the most effective differentiation, thereby demonstrating the efficacy and practicality of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Transmission system operators have a growing need for more accurate forecasting of electricity demand. Current electricity systems largely require demand forecasting so that the electricity market establishes electricity prices as well as the programming of production units. The companies that are part of the electrical system use exclusive software to obtain predictions, based on the use of time series and prediction tools, whether statistical or artificial intelligence. However, the most common form of prediction is based on hybrid models that use both technologies. In any case, it is software with a complicated structure, with a large number of associated variables and that requires a high computational load to make predictions. On many occasions, the resources to reach these predictions are not available to researchers. In this paper we present a MATLAB® toolbox created to predict electrical demand. The toolbox implements multiple seasonal time series forecasting methods such as new generalized multiple seasonal Holt–Winters exponential smoothing models and neural network models, among others. The models presented include novel discrete interval mobile seasonalities (DIMS) to improve forecasting on special days. The paper also describes the computational analysis conducted to apply the toolbox in various electrical systems in Europe, where the results obtained can be seen. The use of this library opens a new way of research for the use of models with discrete and complex seasonalities in other fields of application.},

Taking into consideration the intrinsic characteristics of the goaf, an indicator system covering 12 indicators from three aspects, namely goaf morphology, rock mass physical-mechanical parameters, and goaf development status, is constructed to assess goaf stability. To address the vagueness and randomness issues in the classification criteria for goaf stability early warning, a fuzzy interval-based model is proposed to quantify warning indicators and determine their fuzzy interval range and optimal boundary information. The RES theory is introduced to analyze the interaction relationships among warning indicators, and the D numbers theory is utilized to comprehensively synthesize opinions from multiple experts, establishing a D-RES coupled weight calculation model for collaborative decision-making. Additionally, the asymmetric fuzzy association cloud is introduced to represent the uncertainties and vagueness among different risk levels, considering the finite interval and asymmetric distribution features of warning indicator levels. By integrating the D-RES-derived coupled weights, early warning of goaf stability is achieved. The validation on mining goafs demonstrates that the warning results of the model are consistent with the actual safety conditions, indicating the high applicability and accuracy of the proposed early warning model. The developed model provides a theoretical foundation for formulating safety management policies relevant to mining goafs.},

  abstract     = {We present a new software package, “HybridOctree_Hex,” for adaptive all-hexahedral mesh generation based on hybrid octree and quality improvement with Jacobian control. The proposed HybridOctree_Hex begins by detecting curvatures and narrow regions of the input boundary to identify key surface features and initialize an octree structure. Subsequently, a strongly balanced octree is constructed using the balancing and pairing rules. Inspired by our earlier preliminary hybrid octree-based work, templates are designed to guarantee an all-hexahedral dual mesh generation directly from the strongly balanced octree. With these pre-defined templates, the sophisticated hybrid octree construction step is skipped to achieve an efficient implementation. After that, elements outside and around the boundary are removed to create a core mesh. The boundary points of the core mesh are connected to their corresponding closest points on the surface to fill the buffer zone and build the final mesh. Coupled with smart Laplacian smoothing, HybridOctree_Hex takes advantage of a delicate optimization-based quality improvement method considering geometric fitting, Jacobian and scaled Jacobian, to achieve a minimum scaled Jacobian that is higher than 0.5. We empirically verify the robustness and efficiency of our method by running the HybridOctree_Hex software on dozens of complex 3D models without any manual intervention or parameter adjustment.

  abstract     = {Missing data is an issue that can negatively impact any task performed with the available data and it is often found in real-world domains such as healthcare. One of the most common strategies to address this issue is to perform imputation, where the missing values are replaced by estimates. Several approaches based on statistics and machine learning techniques have been proposed for this purpose, including deep learning architectures such as generative adversarial networks and autoencoders. In this work, we propose a novel siamese neural network suitable for missing data imputation, which we call Siamese Autoencoder-based Approach for Imputation (SAEI). Besides having a deep autoencoder architecture, SAEI also has a custom loss function and triplet mining strategy that are tailored for the missing data issue. The proposed SAEI approach is compared to seven state-of-the-art imputation methods in an experimental setup that comprises 14 heterogeneous datasets of the healthcare domain injected with Missing Not At Random values at a rate between 10% and 60%. The results show that SAEI significantly outperforms all the remaining imputation methods for all experimented settings, achieving an average improvement of 35%. This work is an extension of the article Siamese Autoencoder-Based Approach for Missing Data Imputation [1] presented at the International Conference on Computational Science 2023. It includes new experiments focused on runtime, generalization capabilities, and the impact of the imputation in classification tasks, where the results show that SAEI is the imputation method that induces the best classification results, improving the F1 scores for 50% of the used datasets.},

  abstract     = {Modeling large datasets through Multivariate Functional Approximations (MFA) provide an elegant way to handle many visualization and scientific analysis workflows. The process necessitates scalable data partitioning methods to compute MFA representations efficiently without compromising the accuracy or continuity of the reconstructed solution. We propose a domain-decomposed method for computing the MFA with B-spline bases, which reduces the total work per task and uses a restricted Additive Schwarz (RAS) method to converge the control point data degrees-of-freedom along subdomain boundaries. We provide an in-depth analysis of the parallel approach with domain decomposition solvers, aiming to minimize local subdomain error residuals and recover high-order continuity at subdomain interfaces with appropriate choices of knot overlaps. The communication cost, determined by the overlap regions in the RAS implementation, is optimized to recover the numerical error profile of the single subdomain case. Our proposed method stands in contrast to previous methods, which typically only recover either C 0 C0 or at best C 1 C1 continuity for arbitrary B-spline degree expansions, or those that require post-processing to blend discontinuities in the reconstructed data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using analytical and real-world datasets in 1D, 2D, and 3D through both strong and weak scaling studies. The performance results indicate that the overall cost of computing the approximation is directly proportional to the underlying nearest-neighbor communication implementation, and is only weakly dependent on the overlap region size that determines the size of the messages. This finding underscores the efficiency and scalability of our proposed method, making it a promising solution for handling large datasets in scientific workflows.},

  abstract     = {Linear antenna arrays find extensive application in the communication systems of the future, including IoT, 5 G, and beamforming technologies. However, sustaining subsidiary lobes while keeping a tight beamwidth remains a challenge. In this paper, an enhanced version of Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHOA) is presented. AHOA is a kind of particle swarm algorithm based on the unique flying abilities and clever foraging techniques of hummingbirds seen in nature. In this research, a hybridization of AHOA and quasi opposition based learning is presented for linear antenna array applications. The quasi opposition learning based artificial hummingbird method has been developed to produce more accurate outcomes for further complicated tasks and is named as Quasi Opposition Based Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm. The approach is evaluated across various communication needs of the linear array, and the results are compared with those obtained from other conventional methods. In comparison to the other approach, the proposed strategy delivers the lowest subsidiary lobes along with the narrow beamwidth without any grating lobes. Thus, the proposed approach is capable of managing diverse linear array applications without sacrificing beamwidth or subsidiary lobes levels.},

  abstract     = {Advanced and accurate prediction of rock fragmentation distribution can reduce the secondary crushing work, the cost of manual equipment and increase efficiency, thereby enabling tunnel excavation towards lightweighting. To that end, a novel hybrid random forest (RF) model optimized by atomic orbital search (AOS) with Logistic mapping (LM), i.e., LMAOS-RF, was proposed to predict rock size distribution. Five other hybrid models such as epsilon-support vector regression (e-SVR) and nu-support vector regression (n-SVR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM) and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) optimized by arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) were also developed and compared to LMAOS-RF model. Eleven parameters including uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), blasting workface height (H), degree of bonding of bedding surface (DB), total number of holes (TNH), periphery holes spacing (SPH), relief holes spacing (SRH), blasting layer thickness (TH), total charge (TC), concentration ratio (CR), charge structure (CS) and cut holes maximum charge (CHC) were considered to estimate maximum rock size (MRS) for representing rock size distribution. The performances of six hybrid models were evaluated using statistical indices, regression analysis, error analysis and Taylor diagram. The results indicated that the proposed LMAOS-RF model is the best model to explainrelationship between the considered parameters and MRS. Finally, the results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated that TH and SPH are the greatest positive and negative parameter for predicting MRS. Therefore, this paper provides an accurate guidance for field engineers to optimize blasting design to reduce large block rate and further simplify tunneling.},

  abstract     = {We explore the applicability of MATLAB for 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of shear-driven indoor airflows. A new scale-resolving, large-eddy simulation (LES) solver titled DNSLABIB is proposed for MATLAB utilizing graphics processing units (GPUs). In DNSLABIB, the finite difference method is applied for the convection and diffusion terms while a Poisson equation solver based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed for the pressure. The immersed boundary method (IBM) for Cartesian grids is proposed to model solid walls and objects, doorways, and air ducts by binary masking of the solid/fluid domains. The solver is validated in two canonical reference cases and against experimental data. Then, we demonstrate the validity of DNSLABIB in a room geometry by comparing the results against another CFD software (OpenFOAM). Next, we demonstrate the solver performance in several isothermal indoor ventilation configurations and the implications of the results are discussed in the context of airborne transmission of COVID-19. The novel numerical findings using the new CFD solver are as follows. First, a linear scaling of DNSLABIB is demonstrated and a speed-up by a factor of 3-4 is also noted in comparison to similar OpenFOAM simulations. Second, ventilation in three different indoor geometries are studied at both low (0.1 m/s) and high (1 m/s) airflow rates corresponding to R e = 5000 Re=5000 and R e = 50000 Re=50000 . An analysis of the indoor CO 2 2 concentration is carried out as the room is emptied from stale, high CO 2 2 content air. We estimate the air changes per hour (ACH) values for three different room geometries and show that the numerical estimates from 3D CFD simulations differ by 80%–150% ( R e = 50000 Re=50000 ) and 75%–140% ( R e = 5000 Re=5000 ) from the theoretical ACH value based on the perfect mixing assumption. Third, the analysis of the CO 2 2 probability distributions (PDFs) indicates a relatively non-uniform distribution of fresh air indoors. Fourth, utilizing a time-dependent Wells-Riley analysis, an example is provided on the growth of the cumulative infection risk which is shown to reduce rapidly after the ventilation is started. The average infection risk is shown to reduce by a factor of 2 for lower ventilation rates (ACH=3.4-6.3) and 10 for the higher ventilation rates (ACH=37-64). Finally, we utilize the new solver to comment on respiratory particle transport indoors. A key contribution of the paper is to provide an efficient, GPU compatible CFD solver environment enabling scale-resolved simulations (LES/DNS) of airflow in large indoor geometries on a single GPU designed for high-performance computing. The demonstrated efficacy of MATLAB for GPU computing indicates a high potential of DNSLABIB for various future developments on airflow prediction.},

We present novel analytical equations for estimating the expected communication time before user and network isolation, offering a unique perspective on network resilience through the lens of user behavior and involvement. Unlike most analyses focusing on stationary conditions, we employ network renewal processes to model these occurrences in temporal small-world networks where nodes can be online or offline. Our analytical equations, based on node lifetime distributions, shed light on the likelihood of network isolation under these conditions, offering valuable insights for optimizing network design and management. The validation of our analytical models through extensive simulations not only underscores their accuracy but also paves the way for a deeper understanding of temporal network behavior and resilience beyond the small-world paradigm.},

Realistic particle systems often involve large numbers of particles and complex particle shapes. The resulting need to account for shape factors requires the inclusion of even more particles to obtain statistically meaningful results. However, the computational cost increases with the number of particles, making efficient parallelization crucial. Therefore, the proposed scheme aims to improve the scalability by optimizing the communication and data management between processors. Through hindered settling experiments, the applicability and performance of the novel particle decomposition scheme are thoroughly investigated using the homogenized lattice Boltzmann method. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance, especially in scenarios with a large number of particles, by reducing communication constraints and improving scalability. This research contributes to the advancement of computational methods for efficient study of complex particle systems and provides valuable insights for future developments in this field.},

Many reputation-based resource sharing mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate the problem of free riding. However, the evolutionary stability of these mechanisms that require peers to keep track of the reputations of other peers has not been investigated. We show that, without any extra benefit, systems with reputation-based incentive mechanisms are not evolutionary stable. We also show that if the fraction of peers that record reputation and reciprocate accordingly is above a certain threshold, then free riding can be controlled, and a reputation management system is beneficial only when the fraction of free riders is above a certain threshold. Furthermore, we show that imposing a round-based fee and dividing it among the peers as an incentive to keep track of reputation is an evolutionary stable strategy. In this process, we analyse all the possible equilibria in different settings of the system.},

However, the difference of material parameters and the complexity of interface discontinuity mechanisms may lead to difficulties in modeling the coupling effects of multi-material flows under extreme conditions. In this work, we focus on the solution strategy that combines the machine learning with physical constraints for multi-material Riemann problem, as well as its applications in compressible two-gas flows. A neural network architecture is designed to make it suitable for solving the interfacial velocity of multi-material Riemann problem. By means of the construction of physical constraints, the output of neural networks faithfully represents the physical behavior, and the advantages in training convergence and accuracy are obvious for networks with fewer neurons. In addition, a transformation of input data from unbounded domain to bounded domain is proposed, which is capable of improving the applicability of neural networks. Such neural network surrogate model is relatively simple and conveniently applied to the practical ghost fluid method (PGFM), in which only the interfacial velocity solution of Riemann problem is required to define interface conditions. Several typical problems are selected to test the performance of the physics-constrained neural network model. If the offline surrogate model is embedded in the PGFM, the results indicate that it enables an effective implementation for simulating various two-gas flows with a wide range of applications.},

Briefly, a multilayer network consists of nodes, edges, and layers, whose meaning depends on their entities. Its informative content can be studied to understand the biological interactions and mechanisms of a larger one, based on topological and homological similarities. This approach is referred to Network Alignment (NA), and it is generally used to transfer the knowledge from one biological species to another. From a more general point of view, NA allows mapping nodes between two or more networks of interest, by preserving topologically similar regions. In this paper, we presented MALGNN , a M ultilayer-network AL igner based on Graph Neural Networks ( GNN ). It is a method for Pairwise Global NA (PGNA) of multilayer biological networks, which uses GNNs for processing node embeddings and computing the similarities between pairs of nodes. The proposed method performs the topological assessment via the unsupervised representational learning of the multilayer network graph models. MALGNN allows improving the alignment performance on multilayer networks, in terms of Node Correctness and Objective Score, compared to methods for static and dynamic/temporal networks. Our method proved to be a ready-to-use solution for performing the PGNA of multilayer networks based on topological assessment.

The effects of numerous physical parameters on heat transfer characteristics are investigated using numerical and statistical simulations. Here methanol is taken as the base Casson fluid, while enhancement is achieved by introducing the nanoparticles such as graphite oxide, along with single-wall carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The transformed governing differential equations are numerically solved using a second-order accurate implicit finite difference scheme known as the Keller-Box technique. To conduct the sensitivity analysis RSM is used to explore the impact of various physical quantities on heat transfer. The influence of Nusselt number ( G r − 1 / 5 Nu Gr−1/5Nu ) and skin friction ( G r 1 / 5 C f Gr1/5Cf ) against various physical quantities associated with the behaviour of Casson nanofluid flow are shown in terms of graphs and tables. One of the key findings is that an increase in the Casson parameter leads to a reduction in G r 1 / 5 C f Gr1/5Cf and an increase in the G r − 1 / 5 Nu Gr−1/5Nu .

With its help and 99% probability, the sokol s k e w skew solver found all the known and seven new best-known skew-symmetric sequences for odd instances from L = 121 L=121 to L = 223 L=223 . For larger instances, the solver cannot reach 99% probability within our limitations, but it still found several new best-known binary sequences.

  abstract     = {We propose the Allen–Cahn (AC) equation with a space-dependent mobility and a source term for general motion by mean curvature. Using the space-dependent mobility, we can control the temporal evolution dynamics. Furthermore, by using the source term, we can control the growth and shrinkage of the interfaces. To efficiently solve the governing equation, we use an operator splitting method that splits the main equation into the modified AC equation and the source term equation. The modified AC model is numerically computed using a fully explicit Euler method, and the source term equation is solved analytically. The overall numerical schemes preserve the maximum principle if the time step size satisfies a certain condition. To show the performance of the proposed mathematical model and its corresponding numerical scheme, we conduct several computational experiments. The numerical results confirm the efficiency and robust performance of the proposed model and its numerical algorithm, rendering the proposed model as a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.},

By leveraging these matrices and utilizing the Galerkin method, we transform the FOCP into a system of algebraic equations that can be readily solved. We delve into the Bell polynomials’ convergence analysis and error estimation and introduce a residual correction procedure for error estimation. To assess the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on four different examples and compare our results with those previously reported in the literature.

Notably, this technique eliminates the need to approximate higher derivatives, simplifying the computational process and improving accuracy by avoiding potential errors associated with derivative approximations.

  abstract     = {Epidemiological modeling has a long history and is often used to forecast the course of infectious diseases or pandemics. These models come in different complexities, ranging from systems of simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to complex agent-based models (ABMs). The former allow a fast and straightforward optimization, but are limited in accuracy, detail, and parameterization, while the latter can resolve spreading processes in detail, but are extremely expensive to optimize. Epidemiological modeling can also be used to propose and design non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns. In general, their optimal design often leads to nonlinear optimization problems. We consider policy optimization in a prototypical situation modeled as both ODE and ABM, review numerical optimization approaches, and propose a heterogeneous multilevel approach based on combining a fine-resolution ABM and a coarse ODE model. Numerical experiments, in particular with respect to convergence speed, are given for illustrative examples.},

The WG-FEM approach incorporates an interpolation operator I N IN and achieves optimal order convergence in an energy-like norm for continuous and fully discrete schemes. In the fully-discrete analysis, we combined WG-FEM for spatial space on a Shishkin-type mesh with the Crank–Nicolson scheme for temporal discretization on an equidistant mesh. Since the energy norm is insufficient to capture the behavior of the boundary layer functions accurately, we have derived the optimal order of convergence in a strong balanced norm. This norm exhibits an order of O ( N − 1 ln N ) k O(N−1lnN)k in spatial convergence and second-order convergence in time when using an L 2 L2 -projection Q N QN as an intermediate operator. We conducted numerical examples to validate the proposed method’s theoretical findings.

Through mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, and systematic in-field experiments, we have proven that not only does it work, but it can also be successfully applied to solve the super-important, for many places all around the world, problem of smog.

Firstly, based on interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, the definitions of IVIFPWGA operator and DIVIFPWGA operator are proposed, and the DIVIFPWGA operator is used to describe the dynamic characteristics of interval intuitionistic fuzzy Numbers. Secondly, the deviation maximization method is used to solve the target attribute weight, and considering the time preference of decision makers, the TOPSIS based on temporal preference is proposed to obtain the time weight. Furthermore, IVIFPWGA and DIVIFPWGA operators are used to gather the target threat information of multiple moments to complete the decision-making of each target, and the dynamic decision algorithm flow which combines attribute weight and time weight is designed. Finally, An application example of dynamic decision making for air combat target threat assessment is given.

  abstract     = {Tissue Engineering (TE) and Regenerative Medicine (RM) aim to replicate and replace tissues for curing disease. However, full tissue integration and homeostasis are still far from reach. Biofabrication is an emerging field that identifies the processes required for generating biologically functional products with the desired structural organization and functionality and can potentially revolutionize the regenerative medicine domain, which aims to use patients’ cells to restore the structure and function of damaged tissues and organs. However, biofabrication still has limitations in the quality of processes and products. Biofabrication processes are often improved empirically, but this is slow, costly, and provides partial results. Computational approaches can tap into biofabrication underused potential, supporting analysis, modeling, design, and optimization of biofabrication processes, speeding up their improvement towards a higher quality of products and subsequent higher clinical relevance. This work proposes a reinforcement learning-based computational design space exploration methodology to generate optimal in-silico protocols for the simulated fabrication of epithelial sheets. The optimization strategy relies on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, the Advantage-Actor Critic, which relies on a neural network model for learning. In contrast, simulations rely on the PalaCell2D simulation framework. Validation demonstrates the proposed approach on two protocol generation targets: maximizing the final number of obtained cells and optimizing the spatial organization of the cell aggregate.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a telecommunication system that allows marine equipment (ships, shore-based stations) to communicate and transmit information regarding their trajectory (position, speed, course, etc.), so that other ships are aware of their presence and collision between vessels can be avoided. Unfortunately, AIS struggles against some technical limitations (relatively short range of its terrestrial segment that led to the introduction of satellite AIS segment, that deals with new problems, namely packet collisions) that leads to parts of the AIS data being damaged during transmission. Therefore, to maintain the proper level of maritime safety and security, there is a need for reconstruction of such damaged AIS data, so that ships keep receiving appropriate updates from their neighbours. In this paper we propose a machine-learning based approach for AIS data reconstruction, with one of its stages – detection of damaged data that requires reconstruction – being its main focus. The characteristics of the proposed approach is presented, together with the results of several computational experiments that measure its performance. This article is an extended version of a paper that was presented at the International Conference on Computational Science in 2023 (ICCS-2023) (Szarmach and Czarnowski, 2023), enriched with the results of additional computational experiments.},

Directional derivatives are particular cases of symmetric multilinear forms; therefore, using their symmetric properties and their coordinate representation, we implement functions to calculate mixed partial derivatives. Moreover, with directional derivatives, we deduce concise formulas for the velocity, acceleration, jerk, and jounce/snap vectors. The utility of our formulation is proved with three examples. The first example presents a comparison against the forward mode of finite differences to compute the fourth-order directional derivative of a scalar function. To this end, we have coded the finite differences method to calculate partial derivatives until the fourth order, to any order of approximation . The second example presents efficient computations of the velocity, acceleration, jerk, and jounce/snap. Finally, the third example is related to the computation of some partial derivatives.

We perform a relatively comprehensive study comparing the computational time via time complexities of direct and iterative solvers. We focus on the space–time formulation with refined computational grids and the corresponding time slabs, namely, computational grids obtained by taking the “cross-sections” of the refined space–time mesh. We estimate the computational complexity of solving systems of linear equations for multidimensional meshes with arbitrary dimensional singularities encountered in space–time formulation and time-marching schemes. The choice between space–time formulation and time-marching schemes depends entirely on the problem’s nature and the properties that need to be addressed. Thus, the paper aims to discuss the computational complexities of both approaches rather than suggest a better formulation. Our considerations concern the computational complexity of sequental execution of the multi-frontal solvers, the iterative solvers, and the static condensation.

In this paper, we propose a solution for tactical conflict management that seeks to avoid collisions between UAVs while introducing low complexity in terms of calculations involved and protocol requirements. Our solution specifically addresses multirotor UAVs, and seeks to accelerate the handling of possible conflicts in aerial traffic corridors, which are the most critical scenarios envisioned for the near future due to the high density of UAVs in such spaces. Experimental results obtained in both MATLAB and our realistic drone simulator, ArduSim, evidence the advantages of our solution against previous approaches when solving collisions in a 2D plane. In addition, we propose a 3D extension to handle flight conflicts in more complex scenarios while guaranteeing that floor and ceiling flight limits are adequately enforced.},

  abstract     = {Numerical instabilities arising when simulating transport phenomena dominated by convection processes are among the most challenging situations in computational science, demanding the use of non-classical formulations and techniques to achieve accurate approximations . Although the stabilized formulations usually help suppress node-to-node nonphysical oscillations, numerical approximations typically experience localized instabilities around sharp layers where the solution exhibits rapid changes. We, therefore, propose a stabilized formulation based on the streamline-upwind/Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method augmented with YZ β β discontinuity-capturing for solving convection-dominated advection–diffusion equations involving Caputo-type time-fractional derivatives numerically. A numerical method based on finite differences is used to approximate the time-fractional derivatives. The nonlinear systems arising from the space and time discretizations are solved with the Newton–Raphson (N–R) method at each time step. The linear equation systems emanating from the N–R processes are then handled with an ILU-preconditioned GMRES search technique. Four test computations are provided to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed methods and techniques. It is observed that the SUPG-YZ β β formulation successfully eliminates nonphysical oscillations.},

  abstract     = {It is particularly important to accurately predict NOx emission concentration in cement production. As the cement industry is a process industry, there are many chemical reactions, coupling of front and back processes, and large fluctuations in production, resulting in time-delayed denitration data, strong coupling, and uncertainty, which makes it difficult to adequately extract the characteristics of the denitration data to achieve accurate prediction of NOx concentration. At the same time, excessive ammonia is used in production to reduce NOx concentration, resulting in increased ammonia escape and secondary hazards to the environment, therefore it is necessary to perform accurate multi-step prediction of NOx concentration and ammonia escape. To address these issues, this paper presented a new multicriteria deep learning hybrid model MI-ITBA. The model is constructed by connecting an improved causal dilated temporal convolutional network (ITCN) with bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) and a special attention mechanism, which enhances the ability to extract features from denitration sequence, using the attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different time steps and highlight the influence of key features on the prediction results. In addition, the time series (TS) of denitration containing time-delay information is designed in the input of the model to minimize the influence of time delay . Dynamic information support for denitration control was provided by multi-step prediction of NOx concentration at seven moments and ammonia escape value at three moments to retain the dynamics of the data. Compared with TCN, BiGRU, and TCN-BiGRU, MI-ITBA has a high prediction accuracy, which can provide an effective guide to realizing NOx emission reduction and accurate ammonia injection.},

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s industrial age, one of the most pressing challenges is to find an efficient heat transfer fluid because common fluids don&#39;t provide efficient heating and cooling in industries. This paper aims to explore the flow and heat transfer characteristics of ( SWCNT-Ag/ Sodium Alginate ) and ( MWCNT-Cu/ Sodium Alginate) based hybrid nanofluids in the presence of Cattaneo–Christov heat flux model and thermal radiation on a surface. To achieve this, we transform the modeled partial differential equations (PDEs) into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using suitable similarity variables. These equations are then solved using MATLAB software (bvp4c) to illustrate the influence of important controlling parameters, presented in both tabular and graphical formats. It is noted that raising the Inertia coefficient parameter leads to a drop in the velocity distribution profile of the ( SWCNT-Ag/ Sodium Alginate ) and ( MWCNT-Cu/ Sodium Alginate) based hybrid nanofluid. Enhancing the rotation parameter of ( SWCNT-Ag/ Sodium Alginate ) and ( MWCNT-Cu/ Sodium Alginate ) based hybrid nanofluid decreases the velocity distribution profile. The increasing values of the thermal radiation parameter and Biot number increased the thermal distribution profile while the fall down for the enhancing values of the melting parameter. The convergence ranges of emerged flow parameters are listed here ( 0.1 &lt; β &lt; 1.4 ) (0.1&amp;lt;β&amp;lt;1.4) , ( 0.1 &lt; Γ &lt; 0.4 ) (0.1&amp;lt;Γ&amp;lt;0.4) , ( 0.1 &lt; P &lt; 1.3 ) (0.1&amp;lt;P&amp;lt;1.3) , ( 0.1 &lt; F r &lt; 1.2 ) (0.1&amp;lt;Fr&amp;lt;1.2) , ( 0.01 &lt; ϕ 1 = ϕ 2 &lt; 0.04 ) (0.01&amp;lt;ϕ1=ϕ2&amp;lt;0.04) , ( 0.4 &lt; M e &lt; 1.0 ) (0.4&amp;lt;Me&amp;lt;1.0) , ( 0.1 &lt; B i &lt; 2.2 ) (0.1&amp;lt;Bi&amp;lt;2.2) , ( 0.1 &lt; R d &lt; 1.2 ) (0.1&amp;lt;Rd&amp;lt;1.2) , and ( 0.4 &lt; Ω t &lt; 1.0 ) (0.4&amp;lt;Ωt&amp;lt;1.0) .

  abstract     = {The solution of high-dimensional nonlinear regression problems through standard machine learning approaches often relies on first-order information, due to the numerical and memory challenges arising from the computation of the Hessian matrix and of the higher-order derivatives. While this scenario seems not favorable to second-order methods, here we show that an efficient and modular structure-exploiting interior-point solver can be successfully applied to the recently introduced class of entropy-based methods for regression learning. Specifically, by exploiting the favorable structure of the problem and of the Hessian matrix, we suggest a robust solution strategy based on explicit low-rank updates combined with an iterative Symmetric Quasi-Minimal Residual (SQMR) algorithm to solve the underlying system of linear equations . The results show that the proposed structure-exploiting solver – which relies on the hybrid parallelism and distributed-memory computing paradigm – allows a significant solution time speed-up with respect to a naive solution strategy. Furthermore, through an adequate use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and of Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP), the proposed solver enables the solution of large-scale problems on high-performance computing architectures consisting of thousands of compute nodes. The accompanying detailed convergence and performance analyses demonstrate both numerical robustness and high-performance capabilities for increasingly high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {Aerodynamic shape optimization for dynamic stall mitigation is computationally challenging, requiring multiple costly CFD evaluations. This work proposes a multifidelity modeling technique to efficiently mitigate dynamic stall over an airfoil, particularly manifold mapping (MM) within a trust-region-based optimization framework to find an optimal shape defined by six PARSEC parameters. The high-fidelity (HF) responses are modeled using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with Menter’s shear stress transport turbulence model at a Reynolds number of 135,000, Mach number of 0.1, and reduced frequency of 0.05. The low-fidelity responses are acquired from the Kriging regression (KR) trained over the design space. The MM with the pattern-search algorithm is utilized to find optimal designs in two different test cases. The result yields two distinct optimal shapes with a higher thickness, larger leading-edge radius, and more aft camber than the baseline airfoil (NACA 0012), indicating the presence of multiple valid designs. Both designs delay the dynamic stall angle over 3 deg while mitigating peak lift and pitching moment magnitudes. The current approach delivers a computational saving of over 70% compared to HF-KR and Cokriging regression techniques. These findings present an efficient multifidelity strategy with potential application to other computationally expensive optimization problems .},

Model complexity limits the analytical investigations to a few aggregation-breakage parameters, although various numerical and semi-analytical schemes are available. This article proposes a new semi-analytical approach, the Elzaki integral transform as a pre-treatment to reinforce domain decomposition for better accuracy and convergence, in conjunction with the projected differential transform method for finding the closed form or approximated series solutions for non-linear aggregation, aggregation-breakage, and multi-dimensional aggregation equations. The technique’s key benefit over traditional numerical methods is its ability to solve linear or non-linear differential equations directly without discretization or linearization. Theoretical convergence analysis and error estimates of series solutions for both one and two dimensional aggregation models are of particular interest. Finally, several numerical examples of aggregation, aggregation-breakage, and two dimensional aggregation equations are taken to validate the accuracy of the proposed method by comparing numerical simulations with exact solutions. Interestingly, we have obtained closed form solutions for the pure aggregation equation when considering constant and product aggregation kernels. Additionally, error tables and graphs help to highlight the method’s innovative nature.},

Asymptotic solutions for large stretching and suction parameters are reported. Dual solutions are found for a certain range of shrinking parameter. Stability analysis is performed in order to identify the stable and physically realizable solution. The stability is examined by calculating the lowest eigenvalues of the linearized boundary value problem associated with the self-similar equations. The analysis indicates that the first solution is stable, while the second solution is unstable. It is observed that as the suction parameter ( s s ), magnetic field parameter ( M M ) and Casson fluid parameter ( β β ) increase, the range of dual similarity solutions increases.},

  abstract     = {Computer simulations of complex physical processes typically require sophisticated numerical schemes that internally involve many parameters. Different choices of such internal numerical parameters may lead to considerably different levels of computational efficiency, some may even result in wrong simulation results. The task of finding an optimal set of the numerical parameters (e.g. for the purpose of minimising the simulation time), while ensuring an accepted level of numerical accuracy, is therefore extremely important but challenging. In this paper, we propose a new automated search algorithm that is based on constrained stochastic searches within the parameter space. This iterative search scheme is also equipped with an accuracy check, which adopts several complementary measures for quantifying the similarities between time series from different simulations, such that parameter choices that lead to insufficiently accurate results will be automatically rejected. As a concrete scenario of usage, we have applied the automated parameter search scheme to the open-source reservoir simulation framework OPM. An empirical study shows that a suitable design of the optimisation objective function, together with an appropriate choice of the number of trials per search iteration and the perturbation scale per trial, can produce fast and convergent improvements with respect to the optimisation objective. For example, for a set of 12 numerical parameters, 30 trials from five search iterations are sufficient for reducing the objective function by 30% for the open Norne black-oil reservoir model. The robustness of the automated search scheme is also demonstrated for two other open reservoir models. Moreover, it is found that the parameter values automatically identified for the Norne model can also greatly improve the simulation efficiency of another proprietary reservoir model that has drastically different scale, resolution and geological properties.},

The angle of the exposed person’s neck was varied from 0 ° to 20 ° to assess its impact on particle motion. The airway models for the infected and exposed individuals were based on software and CT data, respectively. Particles, generated 1.5 cm from the exposed person’s mouth, were analyzed for deposition on the lung inlet patches, considering the suction effect. The study focused on correlations between the neck angle changes and particle size, excluding considerations of evaporation, death, and coalescence. Results showed larger particles (&gt;15 µm) were not suctioned in and fell, with size influencing attachment locations in the respiratory tract. In virus-laden droplet simulations, the droplets generated inside the infected person’s bronchi were tracked over 60 s. Most of the droplets dispersed in the space were less than 3.0 µm, and the amount of droplets adhering to the lung inlet patches was characteristic. Notably, the data on particle and droplet volumes adhering to specific lung regions at different neck angles and time intervals provide insights for devising efficient drug inhalation methods to mitigate disease progression at targeted lung locations.

  abstract     = {Feature Selection (FS) is a special preprocessing step in Machine Learning (ML) that reduces the number of unwanted features in datasets to increase the accuracy of ML classifiers . A popular binary variant of the continuous Jaya algorithm is the Discrete Jaya (DJaya) algorithm. It is commonly used for addressing optimization problems with binary design variables (also known as binary decision variables). Nevertheless, DJaya tends to prematurely converge to local optimal solutions , and its performance deteriorates as the complexity of the optimization problem grows. The DJaya algorithm is improved in this article by introducing the Improved Binary DJaya Algorithm (IBJA), which is specially designed to solve the FS problem. IBJA includes three techniques in DJaya. First, it incorporates the update equation of the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm into the optimization loop of DJaya to enhance DJaya’s searching process and exploration abilities. Second, it uses a new Dynamic Opposition-based Learning in the final steps of the optimization loop of DJaya to boost its searching and exploring capabilities. Third, it employs binary transfer functions to calculate binary solutions from the real-valued solutions generated by HHO and DOBL. Using 15 UCI datasets, IBJA’s performance was assessed and compared against four ML classifiers and ten efficient optimization algorithms. Besides, the Friedman statistical test was employed to investigate the reliability of the experimental findings. According to the overall experimental and statistical findings, IBJA scored the highest accuracy, best objective value, and fewest chosen features for each of the 15 UCI datasets.},

In this paper we provide a simple, accurate and almost instantaneous method to obtain the I–V curve which can be easily programmed, for example, in a microcontroller . The main tool is a recent parametrization of the SDM I–V curve which allows to compute the I–V points explicitly when the slope of the curve is known. Then, an iterative sequence of points based in the mean slope between the points of the previous step is constructed. The new methodology is compared with the most common method and the superiority of our proposal is demonstrated with a large repository of curves. Moreover, using the distribution of points obtained with the new methodology, it is possible to represent, with high precision and speed, other curves such as the power and the curvature functions providing a deeper information of the SDM.},

These are attractive because they are mesh-free, avoiding issues associated with solver remeshing and convergence. They have however fragmented into niches, using increasingly complex particles that introduce internal degrees of freedom and external solver coupling. We show that, contrary to prior assumptions in the literature, memoryless isotropic point particles can model material properties including anisotropy, hysteresis, and failure solely through the statistics of their distributions. The resulting models offer compact code that is straightforward to accelerate and port, can span between micro- and macro-structure, require few parameters to set up a simulation, and unlike high-dimensional machine learning models they use a low-dimensional representation that can be efficiently learned. Rather than deriving them as approximations to either molecular dynamics or partial differential equations we investigate how these models can be found directly, and illustrate this with both qualitative comparisons of phenomenology and quantitative comparisons of predictions.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient method to perform uncertainty and sensitivity analyses in a cesium adsorption model upstream chained with a pore water composition model. As the number of uncertain input parameters is about twenty for each of the two models, a dimension reduction technique is implemented to build a polynomial approximation of the cesium distribution coefficient in a reduced subspace. Two approaches are tested depending on the water composition and adsorption models are treated as a single block or two separate blocks. In view of assessing the robustness of the approaches, three initial cesium concentrations are considered to explore different regimes of the adsorption model. The interpretation of the linear transformations projecting the original inputs to the reduced coordinates is broadly consistent with the geochemical features of the model. Validation results show that the relative error levels of the surrogate models are around a few percent for both approaches with only one thousand realizations of the chained model. Global sensitivity analysis highlights that the variance of the cesium distribution coefficient is overwhelmingly governed by the adsorption model. Still, this conclusion is nuanced when considering the whole cumulative distribution function for which the interaction effects between the two models account for a fifth.},

While exact relevance indices in Formal Concept Analysis provide accurate importance evaluation that can be used for extracting interesting concepts, they often have expensive algorithmic complexity (e.g., at least quadratic in the lattice size, which is exponential with respect to the context size). This frequently results in a computational bottleneck , rendering these indices inappropriate for large, dense contexts or small contexts with large concepts. In this paper, we introduce I nterestingness P ropagation ( IP IP ), an efficient message passing strategy for identifying actionable concepts based on interesting and uninteresting information available from a very small portion of the concepts in lattices. From a conceptual perspective, IP IP leverages the lattice local and global conceptual structures to maintain local and global consistency in the interesting or uninteresting labeling information among similar neighborhood concepts. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that IP IP can accurately extract interesting concepts that are very competitive with ground truth ones computed using state-of-the-art exact interestingness indices, while being at least three times faster than certain indices like CR CR and one order of magnitude faster than others like stability.},

  abstract     = {Surface-tension-dominant droplet evaporation is ubiquitous and of importance to many applications. We present an improved Coupled Level Set and Volume of Fluid (i-CLSVoF) framework without explicit interface reconstruction for modelling micro-sized droplets with and without evaporation. In the i-CLSVoF framework, an improved surface tension force model with additional filtering steps to filter un-physical spurious velocities is developed and implemented. A simple, yet efficient, velocity-potential based approach is proposed to reconstruct a divergence-free velocity field for the advection of the free surface during droplet evaporation. This approach fixes the numerical issues resulting from the evaporation-induced velocity jump at the interface. The smeared mass source term approach incorporated in this work guarantees greater numerical stability than the non-smeared approach. Three different evaporation models (constant mass flux, thermally driven evaporation and droplet evaporation at room temperature) are implemented in the i-CLSVoF. Corresponding numerical benchmark cases (dam break, droplet relaxation and droplet evaporation subjected to different evaporation models) are conducted to validate the surface tension and the evaporation models. Good agreement between the numerical and corresponding analytical solutions is found. The model developed in this work shows convincing performance in modelling surface-tension-dominant flow with and without evaporation.},

They can be related to various physical aspects reflected in the model, e.g., heterogeneous energy distribution or random crystallographic orientation assignment to subsequent grains. Therefore, the paper&#39;s main aim is to analyze the influence of such random elements in the CA recrystallization model used to predict the material microstructure morphology after thermo-mechanical treatment. The first part of the work presents the available tools for pseudo-random number generation and the main elements of the investigated CA recrystallization model. Different variants of input data preparation prior to the simulation, including deformation energy distribution, are shown. The role of the investigated pseudo-random number generators ( rand , lcg , mt , ranlux ) and their distribution (uniform, normal, lognormal) is highlighted in this part. Finally, the input data are used to perform simulations of recrystallization progress, and the effect of pseudo-random number generation parameters on transformation kinetics and growth of recrystallized grains is evaluated. With this work, we have demonstrated that the choice of the generator type , particularly the method of its distribution, influences the simulation results in the form of final material morphology.},

To demonstrate the applicability of the method, several application problems arise in isothermal gas spheres, stellar structures, and physics with different shape factors and are successfully solved by means of this method. The comparison is made with the available exact solution and the existing methods (Mall and Chakraverty, 2014; Umesh and Kumar, 2021; El-Essawy et al., 2023; Ahmad et al., 2016). We see that the method meets our expectations and reaches an exact solution in a few iterations. The optimality of the method is investigated by the absolute errors and absolute residual errors . The present method is time-efficient, requires less computational work, and converges to an exact solution in a few iterations.

In this paper, we investigate how phenotypic switching at the cancer cell level impacts the behaviour at the tissue level, specifically on the emergence of isolated foci of the invading solid tumour mass leading to a multifocal tumour. To this end, we propose a new mathematical model of cancer invasion that includes the influence of cancer cell phenotype on the rate of invasion and metastasis. The implications of the model are explored through numerical simulations revealing that the plasticity of tumour cell phenotypes appears to be crucial for disease progression and local invasive spread. The computational simulations show the progression of the invasive spread of a primary cancer reminiscent of in vivo multifocal breast carcinomas, where multiple, synchronous neoplastic foci are frequently observed and are associated with a poorer patient prognosis.},
