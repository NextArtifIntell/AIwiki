  abstract     = {We estimate the number of zeros of a polynomial in ℂ [ z ] ℂ[z] within any small circular disk centered on the unit circle, which improves and comprehensively extends a result established by Borwein, Erdélyi, and Littmann in 2008. Furthermore, by combining this result with Euclidean geometry, we derive an upper bound on the number of zeros of such a polynomial within a region resembling a gear wheel. Additionally, we obtain a sharp upper bound on the annular discrepancy of such zeros near the unit circle. Our approach builds upon a modified version of the method described in Borwein et al. (2008), combined with the refined version of the best-known upper bound for angular discrepancy of zeros of polynomials.},

These lower bounds reflect the increasing difficulty of the problem for m → ∞ m→∞ , namely, a term log m logm in the complexity n n . This result implies that non-compact operators between arbitrary Banach spaces are not approximable using non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods. We also compare these lower bounds for non-adaptive methods with upper bounds based on adaptive, randomized methods for recovery for which the complexity n n only exhibits a ( log log m ) (loglogm) -dependence. In doing so we give an example of linear problems where the error for adaptive vs. non-adaptive Monte Carlo methods shows a gap of order n 1 / 2 ( log n ) − 1 / 2 n1/2(logn)−1/2 .},

For integer values of s s this corresponds to prescribing a zero of the polynomial on the boundary. As such, we extend findings of Lachance et al. (1979), to non-integer s s . Using this generalisation, we are able to relate Chebyshev polynomials on lemniscates and other, more established, categories of Chebyshev polynomials. An essential part of our proof involves the broadening of the Erdős–Lax inequality to encompass powers of polynomials. We believe that this particular result holds significance in its own right.},

  abstract     = {Given two nonempty and disjoint intersections of closed and convex subsets, we look for a best approximation pair relative to them, i.e., a pair of points, one in each intersection, attaining the minimum distance between the disjoint intersections. We propose an iterative process based on projections onto the subsets which generate the intersections. The process is inspired by the Halpern–Lions–Wittmann–Bauschke algorithm and the classical alternating process of Cheney and Goldstein, and its advantage is that there is no need to project onto the intersections themselves, a task which can be rather demanding. We prove that under certain conditions the two interlaced subsequences converge to a best approximation pair. These conditions hold, in particular, when the space is Euclidean and the subsets which generate the intersections are compact and strictly convex. Our result extends the one of Aharoni, Censor and Jiang [“Finding a best approximation pair of points for two polyhedra”, Computational Optimization and Applications 71 (2018), 509–23] who considered the case of finite-dimensional polyhedra.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by uncertainty quantification of complex systems, we aim at finding quadrature formulas of the form ∫ a b f ( x ) d μ ( x ) = ∑ i = 1 n w i f ( x i ) ∫abf(x)dμ(x)=∑i=1nwif(xi) where f f belongs to H 1 ( μ ) H1(μ) . Here, μ μ belongs to a class of continuous probability distributions on [ a , b ] ⊂ R [a,b]⊂R and ∑ i = 1 n w i δ x i ∑i=1nwiδxi is a discrete probability distribution on [ a , b ] [a,b] . We show that H 1 ( μ ) H1(μ) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space with a continuous kernel K K , which allows to reformulate the quadrature question as a kernel (or Bayesian) quadrature problem. Although K K has not an easy closed form in general, we establish a correspondence between its spectral decomposition and the one associated to Poincaré inequalities, whose common eigenfunctions form a T T -system (Karlin and Studden, 1966). The quadrature problem can then be solved in the finite-dimensional proxy space spanned by the first eigenfunctions. The solution is given by a generalized Gaussian quadrature, which we call Poincaré quadrature. We derive several results for the Poincaré quadrature weights and the associated worst-case error. When μ μ is the uniform distribution, the results are explicit: the Poincaré quadrature is equivalent to the midpoint (rectangle) quadrature rule. Its nodes coincide with the zeros of an eigenfunction and the worst-case error scales as b − a 2 3 n − 1 b−a23n−1 for large n n . By comparison with known results for H 1 ( 0 , 1 ) H1(0,1) , this shows that the Poincaré quadrature is asymptotically optimal. For a general μ μ , we provide an efficient numerical procedure, based on finite elements and linear programming. Numerical experiments provide useful insights: nodes are nearly evenly spaced, weights are close to the probability density at nodes, and the worst-case error is approximately O ( n − 1 ) O(n−1) for large n n .},

  abstract     = {Motivated by nonlinear approximation results for classes of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), we seek to better understand so-called library approximations to analytic functions of countably infinite number of variables. Rather than approximating a function of interest by a single space, a library approximation uses a collection of spaces and the best space may be chosen for any point in the domain. In the setting of this paper, we use a specific library which consists of local Taylor approximations on sufficiently small rectangular subdomains of the (rescaled) parameter domain ≔ Y ≔ [ − 1 , 1 ] N Y≔[−1,1]N . When the function of interest is the solution of a certain type of parametric PDE, recent results (Bonito et al., 2021 [4] ) prove an upper bound on the number of spaces required to achieve a desired target accuracy. In this work, we prove a similar result for a more general class of functions with anisotropic analyticity, namely the class introduced in Bonito et al. (2021) [5] . In this way we show both where the theory developed in Bonito et al. (2021) [4] depends on being in the setting of parametric PDEs with affine diffusion coefficients, and prove a more general result outside of this setting.},

When tension is included in the setup, stable nonlinear splines under tension always exist, but they do not always have the property that each piece (connecting one interpolation point to the next) is an s-curve. Being correlated with the fairness of an interpolating curve, this property is desirable and we conjecture that the framework employed successfully with restricted elastic splines will also work well with nonlinear splines under tension. Our purpose is to prove the following foundational result: Given points P 1 ≠ P 2 P1≠P2 , in the plane, along with corresponding unit directions d 1 , d 2 d1,d2 that satisfy d 1 ⋅ ( P 2 − P 1 ) ≥ 0 d1⋅(P2−P1)≥0 and d 2 ⋅ ( P 2 − P 1 ) ≥ 0 d2⋅(P2−P1)≥0 , there exists a unique s-curve segment of Euler–Bernoulli elastica under tension λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 that connects P 1 P1 to P 2 P2 with initial direction d 1 d1 and terminal direction d 2 d2 .},

In this paper, we study the lemniscate inradius when the defining polynomial p p is random, namely, with the zeros of p p sampled independently from a compactly supported probability measure μ μ . If the negative set of the logarithmic potential U μ Uμ generated by μ μ is non-empty, then the inradius is bounded from below by a positive constant with overwhelming probability (as the degree n n of p p tends to infinity). Moreover, the inradius has a deterministic limit if the negative set of U μ Uμ additionally contains the support of μ μ . We also provide conditions on μ μ guaranteeing that the lemniscate is contained in a union of n n exponentially small disks with overwhelming probability. This leads to a partial solution to a (deterministic) problem concerning the area of lemniscates posed by Erdös, Herzog, and Piranian. On the other hand, when the zeros are sampled independently and uniformly from the unit circle, then we show that the inradius converges in distribution to a random variable taking values in ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) (0,1/2) . We also consider the characteristic polynomial of a Ginibre random matrix whose lemniscate we show is close to the unit disk with overwhelming probability.},

  abstract     = {Singular and oscillatory functions play a crucial role in various applications, and their approximation is crucial for solving applied mathematics problems efficiently. Hyperinterpolation is a discrete projection method approximating functions with the L 2 L2 orthogonal projection coefficients obtained by numerical integration. However, this approach may be inefficient for approximating singular and oscillatory functions, requiring a large number of integration points to achieve satisfactory accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a new approximation scheme in this paper, called efficient hyperinterpolation, which leverages the product-integration methods to attain the desired accuracy with fewer numerical integration points than the original scheme. We provide theorems that explain the superiority of efficient hyperinterpolation over the original scheme in approximating such functions belonging to L 1 L1 , L 2 L2 , and continuous function spaces, respectively, and demonstrate through numerical experiments on the interval and the sphere that our approach outperforms the original method in terms of accuracy when using a limited number of integration points.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is the study of the rate of convergence of Poisson integrals for Laguerre expansions. The convergence of partial sums of Fourier series of functions in L p Lp spaces was studied, for several classes of orthogonal polynomials . In the Laguerre case Askey and Waigner proved convergence for functions f ∈ L p 0 , + ∞ f∈Lp0,+∞ with 4 / 3 &lt; p &lt; 4 4/3&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;4 . In this paper we deal with the Poisson integral A r f Arf 0 &lt; r &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;r&amp;lt;1 which arises by applying Abel’s summation method to the Laguerre expansion of the function f f . About 50 years ago, Muckenhoupt intensively studied the Poisson integral for the Laguerre and Hermite polynomials . Among other things he proved pointwise convergence , the convergence by norm, and that the Poisson integral is a contraction mapping in L p 0 , ∞ Lp0,∞ . Toczek and Wachnicki gave a Voronovskaja-type theorem by calculating the limit 1 − r − 1 A r f x − f x 1−r−1Arfx−fx as r → 1 − r→1− , provided that f ′ ′ x f′′x exists. We generalize this formula by deriving a complete asymptotic development. All its coefficients are explicitly given in a concise form. As an application we apply extrapolation methods in order to improve the rate of convergence of A r f x Arfx as r → 1 − r→1− .},

The algorithm involves two stages of sampling, the first stage sample consists of distributions and the second stage sample is obtained from these distributions. The asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is comprehensively studied across different regularity ranges of the regression function . Explicit learning rates are derived by using kernel mean embedding and integral operator techniques. We obtain the optimal rates under some mild conditions, which match the one-stage sampled minimax optimal rate. Compared with the kernel methods for distribution regression in existing literature, the algorithm under consideration does not require the kernel to be symmetric or positive semi-definite and hence provides a simple paradigm for designing indefinite kernel methods, which enriches the theme of the distribution regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for distribution regression with indefinite kernels, and our algorithm can improve the learning performance against saturation effect.},

  abstract     = {We continue the study initiated in Albiac and Wojtaszczyk (2006) of properties related to greedy bases in the case when the constants involved are sharp, i.e., in the case when they are equal to 1. Our main goal here is to provide an example of a Banach space with a basis that satisfies Property (A) but fails to be 1-suppression unconditional, thus settling Problem 4.4 from Albiac and Ansorena (2017). In particular, our construction demonstrates that bases with Property (A) need not be 1-greedy even with the additional assumption that they are unconditional and symmetric. We also exhibit a finite-dimensional counterpart of this example, and show that, at least in the finite-dimensional setting, Property (A) does not pass to the dual. As a by-product of our arguments, we prove that a symmetric basis is unconditional if and only if it is total, thus generalizing the well-known result that symmetric Schauder bases are unconditional.},
