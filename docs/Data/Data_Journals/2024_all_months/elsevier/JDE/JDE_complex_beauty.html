  abstract     = {We obtain the local existence and uniqueness for a system describing interaction of an incompressible inviscid fluid, modeled by the Euler equations, and an elastic plate, represented by the fourth-order hyperbolic PDE. We provide a priori estimates for the existence with the optimal regularity H r Hr , for r &gt; 2.5 r&amp;gt;2.5 , on the fluid initial data and construct a unique solution of the system for initial data u 0 ∈ H r u0∈Hr for r ≥ 3 r≥3 . An important feature of the existence theorem is that the Taylor-Rayleigh instability does not occur. This is in contrast to the free-boundary Euler problem, where the stability condition on the initial pressure needs to be imposed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem of the hyperbolic Keller-Segel equations in H s ( T d ) Hs(Td) on torus with d ≥ 1 d≥1 . Firstly, developing the dissipative mechanism through translation, we establish the global well-posedness in H s ( T d ) Hs(Td) ( s &gt; 1 + d 2 s&amp;gt;1+d2 ) with initial data near some equilibrium state. Secondly, by capturing the feature of the preservation of zero directional derivative, we give a class of initial date that lead to finite time blow-up. It&#39;s worth noting that our method of proving blow-up phenomenon does not require any conservation law. Finally, the characterization of this blow-up motivates us to show the ill-posedness of this system in H 3 2 ( T d ) H32(Td) in the sense of “norm inflation”, which implies that our ill-posedness result for this system is sharp on one dimensional torus.},

The existing free boundary condition can be written as { h ′ ( t ) = μ ∫ g ( t ) h ( t ) u ( t , x ) W J ( h ( t ) − x ) d x , g ′ ( t ) = − μ ∫ g ( t ) h ( t ) u ( t , x ) W J ( x − g ( t ) ) d x , {h′(t)=μ∫g(t)h(t)u(t,x)WJ(h(t)−x)dx,g′(t)=−μ∫g(t)h(t)u(t,x)WJ(x−g(t))dx, where W J ( x ) = ∫ x + ∞ J ( y ) d y WJ(x)=∫x+∞J(y)dy , and J is the kernel function of the nonlocal diffusion operator in the model. In the new free boundary condition, we replace W J WJ by a general nonnegative locally Lipschitz continuous function W with W ( 0 ) &gt; 0 W(0)&amp;gt;0 , independent of J . This represents a very different assumption that the movement of the range boundary of the species is independent of its dispersal strategy, as in [20] . Our analysis shows that the dynamics of the model with the new free boundary condition resembles that of the old model except in the case that J is thin-tailed and ∫ 0 ∞ W ( x ) d x = ∞ ∫0∞W(x)dx=∞ , where new propagation phenomena appear.}}},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study traveling waves for a time-delayed nonlocal reaction-diffusion model of within-host viral infections. Firstly, we establish the existence of semi-traveling waves that converge to an unstable infection-free equilibrium as the moving coordinate goes to −∞, provided the wave speed ⁎ c &gt; c ⁎ c&amp;gt;c⁎ for some positive number ⁎ c ⁎ c⁎ and the basic reproduction number R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 . Then we construct a Lyapunov functional to show that the semi-traveling waves converge to an endemic equilibrium as the moving coordinate goes to +∞, and use a limiting argument to obtain the existence of the traveling wave connecting these two equilibria for ⁎ c = c ⁎ c=c⁎ and R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 . We further employ a Laplace transform technique to prove the non-existence of bounded semi-traveling waves when ⁎ 0 &lt; c &lt; c ⁎ 0&amp;lt;c&amp;lt;c⁎ and R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 . It turns out that ⁎ c ⁎ c⁎ is the minimum wave speed for traveling waves connecting the infection-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the long-time behavior of solutions and the dependence of ⁎ c ⁎ c⁎ on parameters.},

Assuming a superharmonicity condition, we prove that sufficiently close to the isolated singularity, singular solutions behave like the so-called Emden–Fowler solution to the blow-up limit problem. On the technical level, we use an involved spectral analysis to study the Jacobi fields&#39; growth properties in the kernel of the linearization of our system around a blow-up limit solution, which may be of independent interest. Our main theorem positively answers a question posed by Frank and König (2019) [12] concerning the local behavior of singular solutions close to the isolated singularity for scalar solutions in the punctured ball. It also extends to the case of strongly coupled systems, the celebrated asymptotic classification due to Korevaar et al. (1999) [21] .},

We adapt a recent formulation of the corresponding problem for localised waves which involves a generalisation of the classical Dirichlet–Neumann operator. We study this operator in detail, extending some well-known results for the classical Dirichlet–Neumann operator, such as the Taylor expansion in homogeneous powers of the wave profile, the computation of its differential and the asymptotic expansion of its associated symbol. A new formulation of the problem as a single equation for the wave profile is also presented and discussed in a similar vein. As an application of these results we prove existence of doubly periodic gravity-capillary steady waves and construct approximate doubly periodic gravity steady waves.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to studying structural stability of steady subsonic Euler flows in 2D finitely long nozzles. The reference flow is subsonic shear flows with general size of vorticity. The problem is described by the steady compressible Euler system. With admissible physical conditions and prescribed pressures at the entrances and the exits of the nozzles respectively, we establish unique existence and structural stability of this kind of subsonic shear flows. Due to the hyperbolic-elliptic coupled form of the Euler system in subsonic regions, the problem is reformulated via Lagrange transformation and then decoupled into an elliptic mode and two hyperbolic modes. The elliptic mode is a mixed type boundary value problem of second order quasilinear elliptic equation for the stream function. The hyperbolic modes are transport types to control the total energy and the entropy. Mathematically, the iteration scheme is executed in a weight Hölder space with low regularity.},

In this paper we consider two cases ( p , r ) = ( 3 , 1 ) (p,r)=(3,1) and ( 3 , 3 ) (3,3) . We show that a Hopf bifurcation occurs for n -mode stationary solutions, n ≥ 1 n≥1 , in a rigorous way, studying eigenvalues in detail. Exact periods and exact critical values of τ can be written by using complete elliptic integrals. A relationship between a period and a shape of a stationary solution is also studied. In particular, a maximum point of the period is studied.}}},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the topological asymptotic expansion of a topology optimisation problem that is constrained by the Poisson equation with the design/shape variable entering through the right hand side. Using an averaged adjoint approach, we give explicit formulas for topological derivatives of arbitrary order for both an L 2 L2 and H 1 H1 tracking-type cost function in both dimension two and three and thereby derive the complete asymptotic expansion. As the asymptotic behaviour of the fundamental solution of the Laplacian differs in dimension two and three, also the derivation of the topological expansion significantly differs in dimension two and three. The complete expansion for the H 1 H1 cost functional directly follows from the analysis of the variation of the state equation. However, the proof of the asymptotics of the L 2 L2 tracking-type cost functional is significantly more involved and, surprisingly, the asymptotic behaviour of the bi-harmonic equation plays a crucial role in our proof.},

We show that the impact map associated with this discontinuous equation becomes a real analytic and exact symplectic map when written in suitable canonical coordinates. By an accurate study of the behaviour of the map for large amplitudes and by employing a parametrization KAM theorem, we show that the periodic solutions of the unperturbed oscillator persist as two-dimensional tori under conditions that depend on the Diophantine conditions of the frequency, but are independent on both the amplitude of the orbit and of the specific value of the frequency. This allows the construction of a sequence of nested invariant tori of increasing amplitude that confine the solutions within them, ensuring their boundedness. The same construction may be useful to address such persistence problem for a larger class of non-smooth forced oscillators.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the stability of exact smooth multi-solitons for the Dullin-Gottwald-Holm (DGH) equation is investigated for the first time. Firstly, through the inverse scattering approach, we derive the conservation laws in terms of scattering data and multi-solitons related to the discrete spectrum based on the Lax pair of the DGH equation. Notably, a new series Hamiltonian derived from bi-Hamilton structure are equivalent to the conservation laws, and can also be expressed in terms of scattering data. Thus we successfully connect scattering data (multi-solitons) to the recursion operator between Hamiltonian, and to the Lyapunov functional constructed from Hamiltonian. With this Lyapunov functional, it is identified that these smooth multi-solitons serve as non-isolated constrained minimizers, adhering to a suitable variational nonlocal elliptic equation. Moreover, the integrable properties of the recursion operator are presented, which is the crucial for spectral analysis in this work. Consequently, the investigation of dynamical stability transforms into a problem on the spectrum of explicit linearized systems. It is worth noting that, compared to previous works on Camassa-Holm equation and KdV-type equations, recursion operator derived from existing Hamiltonian for the DGH equation do not possess good integrable properties. We construct a new series of Hamiltonians with both analysable recursion operator and simple initial variation derivative ( δH1/δu=m ) to overcome this problem. Furthermore, orbital stability of the smooth double solitons is proved at last of the work.},

As a consequence, transition semigroups of Markov processes are C 0 C0 -semigroups on ( C b ( E ) , τ 1 M ) (Cb(E),τ1M) , if they leave C b ( E ) Cb(E) invariant and they are jointly weakly continuous in space and time. Hence, they can be reconstructed from their strong derivative at zero and thus have a fully infinitesimal description. This solves an open problem for Markov processes. We show that our results apply to a large number of Markov processes, e.g., those given as the laws of solutions to SDEs and SPDEs, including the stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations and the stochastic fast and slow diffusion porous media equations. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a Markov core operator ( L 0 , D ( L 0 ) ) (L0,D(L0)) for the above generators ( L , D ( L ) ) (L,D(L)) and prove that uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations corresponding to ( L 0 , D ( L 0 ) ) (L0,D(L0)) for all Dirac initial conditions implies that ( L 0 , D ( L 0 ) ) (L0,D(L0)) is a Markov core operator for ( L , D ( L ) ) (L,D(L)) . As a consequence, we identify the Kolmogorov operators of a large number of SDEs on finite and infinite dimensional state spaces as Markov core operators for the infinitesimal generators of the C 0 C0 -semigroups on ( C κ ( E ) , τ κ M ) (Cκ(E),τκM) given by their transition semigroups. Furthermore, if each P t Pt is merely convex, we prove that ( P t ) t ≥ 0 (Pt)t≥0 gives rise to viscosity solutions to the Cauchy problem given by its associated (nonlinear) infinitesimal generator. We also show that value functions of optimal control problems, both, in finite and infinite dimensions are particular instances of convex C 0 C0 -semigroups on ( C κ ( E ) , τ κ M ) (Cκ(E),τκM) .},

By combining the detailed analysis with the spectral expansion and the special construction of sub-supersolutions, we further prove the uniform boundedness of the solutions and the global asymptotic stability of the cylinder waves for more general nonnegative bounded initial data, and prove that the spreading speeds and the asymptotic behavior of the solutions are determined by the decay rates of the initial data.

The main aim is to obtain a sharp convergence rate which is usually connected to the boundary layer thickness. However, The convergence rate would be possibly slowed down due to the presence of the strong boundary layer effect and the interactions among the magnetic field, temperature, and fluids through not only the velocity equations but also the strongly nonlinear terms in the temperature equation. Our main strategy is to construct some new functions via asymptotic matching method which can cancel some quantities decaying in a lower speed. It leads to a sharp L ∞ L∞ convergence rate as the shear viscosity vanishes for global-in-time solution with arbitrarily large initial data.},

We assume that the space-time has an initial conformal gauge singularity and show that the initial value problem is well posed with data given at the singularity. This is understood by considering conformally rescaled equations. The Einstein equations become a system of singular ordinary differential equations, for which we establish an existence theorem which requires several differentiability and eigenvalue conditions on the coefficient functions together with the Fuchsian conditions. The Boltzmann equation is regularized by a suitable choice of time coordinate, but still has singularities in momentum variables. This is resolved by considering singular weights, and the existence is obtained by exploiting singular moment estimates.},

Darcy&#39;s law is recovered in the homogenization limit. Applying Poincaré type inequality in porous media allows us to derive the uniform estimates on the velocity field, the gradient of which is small of size ε in L 2 L2 space. This indicates the nonlinear part in the viscosity coefficient does not contribute in the limit and a linear model (Darcy&#39;s law) is obtained. The estimates of the pressure rely on a proper extension from the perforated domain to the homogeneous non-perforated domain. By integrating the equations in time variable such that each term in the resulting equations has certain continuity in time, we can establish the extension of the pressure by applying the dual formula with the restriction operator.},

Explicit solutions to such a water wave problem are static configurations where the surface is an unduloid, that is, a periodic surface of revolution with constant mean curvature. We prove that to any such configuration there connects a global continuum of non-static solutions by means of a global implicit function theorem. To prove this, the key is strict monotonicity of a certain function describing the mean curvature of an unduloid and involving complete elliptic integrals.

Error bounds of L p Lp type of approximating smooth feedback laws are derived, depending on either the C 1 C1 norm of the value function or its semi-concavity. These error bounds combined with the existence of a Lyapunov type function are used to prove the existence of an approximate optimal sequence of smooth feedback laws. Moreover, we extend this result to the Hölder continuous case by a diagonalization argument combined with the Moreau envelope. It is foreseen that these error bounds could be applied to study the convergence of synthesis of feedback laws via data driven machine learning methods. Additionally, we provide an example of an infinite horizon optimal control problem for which the value functions are non-differentiable but Lipschitz continuous. We point out that in this example no restrictions on either the controls or the trajectories are assumed.},

The fluid is assumed to occupy a horizontally infinite strip-like domain that is bounded below by a flat rigid surface and above by a moving surface. We assume that the fluid is acted upon by a bulk force and a surface stress that are stationary in a coordinate system moving parallel to the fluid bottom, and a uniform gravitational force that is perpendicular to the flat rigid surface. We construct our solutions via an implicit function argument, and show that as the slip parameter shrinks to zero, the Navier-slip solutions converge to solutions to the no-slip problem obtained previously.},

Based on stochastic maximum principle, solving the mean field game is transformed into solving a conditional mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). We first establish solvability for a type of (more general) conditional mean field FBSDEs under monotonicity conditions. We further provide some regularity results which lead to classical solutions for the associated master equations. In particular, the linear quadratic extended mean field game is solved and classical solution for (extended mean field game) master equation is obtained.},

Via the stream function, the Euler-Poisson system in the subsonic region is reformulated into a second order nonlinear elliptic system. One of the crucial ingredients of the analysis is to obtain the well-posedness of the boundary value problem for the associated linearized elliptic system, which is achieved through a special structure of the elliptic system to gain an energy estimate. By combining the iteration method with a priori estimates of solutions to the elliptic system, we establish the existence, uniqueness and nonlinear structural stability of subsonic flows.},

We show in a rigorous way, by a convergence analysis, that one can construct a completely discrete minimization problem whose solution is a good approximation of a solution to the inverse problem. The minimization problem contains a regularization term which is given by a total variation penalization and is characterized by a regularization parameter. The discretization involves at the same time the boundary measurements, by the use of the complete electrode model, the unknown conductivity and the solution to the direct problem. The electrodes are characterized by a parameter related to their size, which in turn controls the number of electrodes to be used. The discretization of the unknown and of the solution to the direct problem is characterized by another parameter related to the size of the mesh involved. In our analysis we show how to precisely choose the regularization, electrodes size and mesh size parameters with respect to the noise level in such a way that the solution to the discrete regularized problem is meaningful. In particular we obtain that the electrodes and mesh size parameters should decay polynomially with respect to the noise level.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the existence of periodic solution for nonconservative superlinear second order equations without assuming the global existence of solutions. Using the theory of topological degree, we prove a new fixed point theorem for continuous mappings with angle description, which are not necessarily area-preserving. It is a complementary to the Poincaré-Birkhoff twist theorem. By using the fixed point theorem, we give an approach of the phase-plane analysis of the spiral properties, for obtaining the existence of periodic solutions for two typical nonconservative second order superlinear equations. This result generalizes the classical work of Jacobowitz and Hartman to nonconservative equations. Moreover, it extends the existence of periodic solutions for second order superlinear equations by Struwe [27] , Capietto, Mawhin and Zanolin [6] , and Gidoni [17] .},

  abstract     = {We consider a non-local tumour growth model of phase-field type, describing the evolution of tumour cells through proliferation in presence of a nutrient. The model consists of a coupled system, incorporating a non-local Cahn-Hilliard equation for the tumour phase variable and a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient. First, we establish novel regularity results for such a model, by applying maximal regularity theory in weighted L p Lp spaces. This technique enables us to prove the local existence and uniqueness of a regular solution, including also chemotaxis effects. By leveraging time-regularisation properties and global boundedness estimates, we further extend the solution to a global one. These results provide the foundation for addressing an optimal control problem, aimed at identifying a suitable therapy, guiding the tumour towards a predefined target. Specifically, we prove the existence of an optimal therapy and, by studying the Fréchet-differentiability of the control-to-state operator and introducing the adjoint system, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions.},

We first show that the original problem is connected with a differential inclusion problem involving the Clarke subdifferential operator, and then we prove the approximate controllability of the original problem via the approximate controllability of the differential inclusion problem. The paper offers a unique solution to a challenge introduced by assuming the underlying space X as a super-reflexive Banach space, which presents issues of convexity due to the nonlinear nature of the duality map involved in the expression of the control. Such issues are not present when X is a separable Hilbert space. Therefore, the paper&#39;s novelty is its successful resolution of the convexity problem, paving the way for approximate controllability of the evolution hemivariational inequality in which X is a super-reflexive Banach space.},

We are interested in the problem that whether there is a uniform upper bound for the number of limit cycles of the equation with respect to m , which is known as the famous Smale-Pugh problem. In this work we generalize an idea from the recent paper (Yu, Chen and Liu, Disc. Cont. Dyn. Syst. Ser.

By virtue of this criterion and the previous results given by Álvarez et al. and Bravo et al., we completely solve the simplest case of the Smale-Pugh problem, i.e., the case when g ( t ) g(t) and f ( t ) f(t) are linear trigonometric, and obtain that the maximum number of limit cycles, is three, which gives a positive answer to the sixth of 33 open problem proposed by Gasull in paper (Gasull, SeMA J., 2021).},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with existence, non-existence and uniqueness of positive (coexistence) steady states to a predator-prey system with prey-dependent dispersal. To overcome the analytical obstacle caused by the cross-diffusion structure embedded in the prey-dependent dispersal, we use a variable transformation to convert the problem into an elliptic system without cross-diffusion structure. The transformed system and pre-transformed system are equivalent in terms of the existence or non-existence of positive solutions. Then we employ the index theory alongside the method of the principle eigenvalue to give a nearly complete classification for the existence and non-existence of positive solutions. Furthermore we show the uniqueness of positive solutions and characterize the asymptotic profile of solutions for small or large diffusion rates of species. Our results pinpoint the positive role of prey-dependent dispersal on the population dynamics for the first time by showing that the prey-dependent dispersal in the predator-prey system is a beneficial strategy increasing the chance of predator&#39;s survival and hence promoting the coexistence of species.},

At the beginning, the value function is defined by the solution to the controlled BSDE alluded to earlier. On one hand, we can prove the value function is deterministic function with respect to the initial random variable; On the other hand, we can show that the value function is law-invariant , i.e., depending on only via its distribution by virtue of BSDE property. Afterward, utilizing the notion of differentiability with respect to probability measures introduced by P.L. Lions [50] , we are able to establish a DPP for the value function in the Wasserstein space of probability measures based on the application of BSDE approach, particularly, employing the notion of stochastic backward semigroups associated with stochastic optimal control problems and Itô formula along a flow property of the conditional law of the controlled forward state process. We prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solutions of the associated generalized HJB equations in some separable Hilbert space. Finally, as an application, we formulate an optimal control problem for linear stochastic differential equations with quadratic cost functionals of McKean-Vlasov type under nonlinear expectation, g -expectation introduced by Peng [43] and derive the optimal feedback control explicitly by means of several groups of Riccati equations.},

However, when J is asymmetry or exponentially unbounded , the question was left open. In this paper we obtain a rather complete answer to this question. More precisely, we show that for exponentially bounded kernels the minimal speed of traveling waves exists and coincides with the spreading speed. We also investigate the case of exponentially unbounded kernels where we prove the non-existence of traveling wave solutions and obtain upper and lower bounds for the position of any level set of the solutions. These bounds allow us to estimate how the solutions spread, depending on the kernels.},

The motilities of bacteria depend on the concentration of nutrient in the form of power law, which means that they are degenerate if the power-law exponent is positive and are singular if the exponent is negative at the zero state of nutrient. We show that in both cases the spiky patterns admitted by the model are nonlinearly stable under appropriate perturbations. We introduce a unified approach to dealing with both degeneracy and singularity in the diffusivity for this model. The approach is based on a combination of weighted energy estimates and weighted elliptic estimates, where various weights are artfully constructed to capture the complex behaviors of solutions near the zero state. Numerical simulations are also carried out to confirm our theoretical results.},

Namely, a Berger domain is an open set of parametric families of diffeomorphisms having a dense set of families with persistent homoclinic tangencies. The original construction of Berger provides examples of such domains such that the tangencies are of codimension one and associated with sectional dissipative periodic points with real multipliers. We show that Berger domains can be constructed associated with homoclinic tangencies of arbitrarily large codimension and any type of hyperbolic periodic points. As an application, we find new Kolmogorov locally typical phenomena in dimension three or greater.

We do not assume that the coefficient of the dissipation term is smooth, and we investigate the effect of its oscillations on the decay rate of solutions. We prove a decay estimate that holds true regardless of the oscillations. Then we show that oscillations that are too fast have no effect on the decay rate, while oscillations that are in resonance with one of the frequencies of the elastic part can alter the decay rate. In the proof we first reduce ourselves to estimating the decay of solutions to a family of ordinary differential equations, then by using polar coordinates we obtain explicit formulae for the energy decay of these solutions, so that in the end the problem is reduced to the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of suitable oscillating integrals.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we continue the study of eigenfunctions on triangles initiated by the first author in [2] and [3] . The Neumann data of Dirichlet eigenfunctions on triangles enjoys an equidistribution law, being equidistributed on each side. The proof of this result is remarkably simple, using only the radial vector field and a Rellich type integrations by parts. The equidistribution law, including on higher dimensional simplices, agrees with what Quantum Ergodic Restriction would predict. However, distribution of the Neumann data on subsets of a side is not well understood, and elementary methods do not appear to give enough information to draw conclusions. In the present note, we first show that an “obvious” conjecture fails even for the simplest right isosceles triangle using only Fourier series.

Finally we present some numerical computations suggesting the behavior of eigenfunctions on almost isosceles triangles is quite complicated.},

Namely, in the constructed family of homeomorphisms the outer prime ends rotation number vary continuously with the parameter through the interval [ 0 , 1 / 2 ] [0,1/2] . This, in particular, answers a question from Boroński et al. (2020) [15] . Furthermore, these attractors preserve the induced Lebesgue measure from the circle and have strong measure-theoretic and statistical properties. To show main results of the paper we first prove a result of an independent interest, that Lebesgue-measure preserving circle maps generically satisfy the crookedness condition which implies that generically the inverse limits of Lebesgue measure-preserving circle maps are the pseudo-solenoids. For degree one circle maps, this implies that the generic inverse limit in this context is the pseudo-circle.},

A class of singularity conditions are proposed, which not only cover that of fractional kernel, Volterra Heston model kernel, completely monotone kernels, to mention a few, but also happen to be used in the forward stochastic Volterra integral with new conclusions arising. Motivated by mathematical physics problem such as the viscoelasticity/thermoviscoelasticity of materials, heat conduction in materials with memory, optimal control problems of abstract stochastic Volterra integral equations (including fractional stochastic evolution equations and stochastic evolutionary integral equations) are presented. At last, our BSVIEs are surprisingly used in maximum principle of controlled stochastic delay evolution equations. One advantage of this new standpoint is that the final cost functional can naturally depend on the past state.},

Fortunately, the nonlinearity has a null structure which can compensate the slower decay. Using this null structure, we prove the global existence of the solutions when the initial data is sufficiently close to a flat front.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses optimal control problems with loss control regions . In that context the state space is partitioned into disjoint subsets, referred to as regions , which are classified into two types: control regions and loss control regions . When the state belongs to a control region, the control is permanent (i.e. the control value is authorized to be modified at any time). On the contrary, when the state belongs to a loss control region, the control must remain constant as long as the state belongs to this region. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we reformulate the above setting into a hybrid optimal control problem (with spatially heterogeneous dynamics) involving moreover a regionally switching parameter, and we prove a corresponding hybrid maximum principle: hence first-order necessary optimality conditions in a Pontryagin form are obtained. Second, this paper proposes a two-steps numerical scheme to solve optimal control problems with loss control regions. It is based on a direct numerical method (applied to a regularized problem) which initializes an indirect numerical method (applied to the original problem and based on the aforementioned necessary optimality conditions). This numerical approach is applied to several illustrative examples.},

Based on approximating TFBM with a family of Gaussian processes possessing absolutely continuous sample paths, a unified framework of the Feynman-Kac formula u ( t , x ) = E x [ f ( X t ) ] e B H , λ ( t ) u(t,x)=Ex[f(Xt)]eBH,λ(t) is established for the general stochastic diffusion equation driven by TFBM with the initial value f , Hurst index H ∈ ( 0 , 1 2 ) ∪ ( 1 2 , 1 ) H∈(0,12)∪(12,1) and tempering parameter λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 . The difficulty is that the Hurst parameter H can be allowed to be less than 1/2. The idea is to explore the above simplest form, to utilize the techniques of Malliavin calculus. By using the properties of TFBM and especially that of the modified Bessel function of the second kind, we prove that the process defined by the Feynman-Kac formula is the mild and weak solutions of the general diffusion equation driven by TFBM. From the Feynman-Kac formula, we exhibit the smoothness of the density of the solution and the sharp Hölder regularity. We further show that lim t → ∞ ⁡ ln ⁡ ‖ u ( t , ⋅ ) ‖ p g ( t ) = 0 limt→∞⁡ln⁡‖u(t,⋅)‖pg(t)=0 in the almost surely sense where p ∈ R p∈R and the function g : R + → R + g:R+→R+ grows at least as fast as a linear function. The Feynman-Kac formula for the stochastic general diffusion equation in the Skorohod sense is also achieved by exploring the relationship between the Stratonovich and Skorohod integrals.},

Interface conditions between adjacent patches may be chosen independently to accurately reflect organism behavior. We show that there exists a real principal eigenvalue with a corresponding non-negative eigenfunction that is non-zero interior to the domain. We demonstrate that our model is a generalization of several existing two-patch models. We consider simple three- and four-patch landscapes representing fragmented reserves to illustrate how our model can be used to analyze population persistence, spatial distribution, and migration dynamics. Fragmented landscapes with increased heterogeneity capture migration dynamics not found in landscapes with only two patch types, such as favorable habitat patches that experience net immigration. Conditions for the existence and non-existence of zero-flux conditions interior to three-patch systems are shown, which provide insight to the location of sources and direction(s) of migration.},

Mathematical challenges lie in the fact that (i) the generalized cholera model considers the intrinsic growth of short-lived hyperinfectious (HI vibrios) state of V. cholerae and lower-infectious (LI vibrios) state of V. cholerae simultaneously; and (ii) this article originally derives the detailed classifications of spatial dynamics for the cholera model with some generally functional response functions, non-uniformness of diffusion rates and nonlocal time delay. We introduce three basic reproduction numbers: one is for HI state of V. cholerae , the other is for LI state of V. cholerae , and another is for the cholera disease in the host population. Based on these basic reproduction numbers, we further establish the global threshold dynamics. Under some conditions, the basic reproduction number of infection is strictly decreasing with respect to the diffusion coefficients of infectious hosts.},

The principal eigenvalue is firstly defined and its properties involving the intensity of harvesting and length of habitat sizes are analyzed. Then the criteria to determine whether the species spread or vanish is discussed, and some relevant sufficient conditions characterized by pulse are established. Our results reveal that the co-extinction or coexistence of species is influenced by internal expanding capacity from species itself and external harvesting pulse from human intervention, in which the intensity and timing of harvesting play key roles. Our numerical simulations validate that the larger the harvesting rate and the shorter the harvesting period, the worse the survival of the species due to the cooperation among juveniles and adults, and such harvesting pulse can even alter the situation of species from persistence to extinction. In addition, expanding capacities also affect or alter the outcomes of spreading and vanishing.},

If the product of the two competition rates in the unprotected zone is less than a given value, by establishing a prior estimate and applying the monotone dynamical system theory, we completely characterize the global dynamics, which extends some existing ones. If the product is bigger than the above mentioned value, we find that the size of the protection zone plays an important role in determining the global dynamics.

For d ≥ 2 d≥2 , we firstly prove that the compressible FENE dumbbell model admits the unique global strong solutions provided initial data are close to equilibrium state. Then, by the Littlewood-Paley decomposition theory and the Fourier splitting method, we show optimal L 2 L2 decay rate of global strong solutions for d ≥ 3 d≥3 . Finally, we mainly study optimal decay rate to the 2-D FENE dumbbell model. The improved Fourier splitting method yields that the L 2 L2 decay rate is ln − l ⁡ ( e + t ) ln−l⁡(e+t) for any l ∈ N l∈N . By virtue of the time weighted energy estimate, we can improve the decay rate to ( 1 + t ) − 1 4 (1+t)−14 . Under the low-frequency condition and by the Littlewood-Paley theory, we show that the solutions belong to some Besov spaces with negative index and obtain optimal L 2 L2 decay rate without the smallness restriction of low frequencies.},

Since the hyperbolicity ratio λ of the saddle plays an important role, we treat it as an independent parameter, so that μ ˆ = ( λ , μ ) ∈ W ˆ = ( 0 , + ∞ ) × W μˆ=(λ,μ)∈Wˆ=(0,+∞)×W , where W is an open subset of R N RN . For each μ ˆ 0 ∈ W ˆ μˆ0∈Wˆ and L &gt; 0 L&amp;gt;0 , the functions D ( s ; μ ˆ ) D(s;μˆ) and T ( s ; μ ˆ ) T(s;μˆ) have an asymptotic expansion at s = 0 s=0 and μ ˆ ≈ μ ˆ 0 μˆ≈μˆ0 with the remainder being uniformly L -flat with respect to the parameters. The principal part of both asymptotic expansions is given in a monomial scale containing a deformation of the logarithm, the so-called Ecalle-Roussarie compensator. In this paper we are interested in the coefficients of these monomials, which are functions depending on μ ˆ μˆ that can be shown to be C ∞ C∞ in their respective domains and “universally” defined, meaning that their existence is stablished before fixing the flatness L and the unfolded parameter μ ˆ 0 μˆ0 . Each coefficient has its own domain and it is of the form ( ( 0 , + ∞ ) ∖ D ) × W ((0,+∞)∖D)×W , where D a discrete set of rational numbers at which a resonance of the hyperbolicity ratio λ occurs. In our main result, Theorem A , we provide explicit expressions for some of these coefficients and to this end a fundamental tool is the employment of a sort of incomplete Mellin transform. With regard to these coefficients we also prove that they have poles of order at most two at D × W D×W and we give the corresponding residue, that plays an important role when compensators appear in the principal part. Furthermore we prove a result, Corollary B , showing that in the analytic setting each coefficient given in Theorem A is meromorphic on ( 0 , + ∞ ) × W (0,+∞)×W and has only poles, of order at most two, along D × W D×W .},

We exploit the regularity lifting lemma to obtain the optimal integrability, boundedness and decaying property of finite energy solutions to the system. Secondly, we establish sharp pointwise estimates of positive finite energy solutions to the p -Laplacian and k -Hessian systems related to the above integral system, by using the previous regularity results, the interior Hölder estimates of solutions for the corresponding differential systems and a doubling lemma of Poláčik, Quittner and Souplet (Duke Math. J.,2007). These extend Vétois&#39;s decay results (Indiana Univ. Math. J.,2019) on the positive solutions of Laplacian systems to the p -Laplacian and k -Hessian cases. We remark that our methods do not need Harnack type inequalities and it can be applied to deal with the solutions without radial structures. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to derive sharp decay estimates for possibly non-radial solutions involving k -Hessian operators. We also obtain some decay estimates of the gradients at infinity.}}},

  abstract     = {We are interested in the so-called “combined effect” of two different kinds of nonlinear terms for semilinear wave equations in one space dimension. Recently, the first result with the same formulation as in the higher dimensional case has been obtained if and only if the total integral of the initial speed is zero, namely Huygens&#39; principle holds. In this paper, we extend the nonlinear term to the general form including the product type. Such model equations are extremely meaningful only in one space dimension because the most cases in higher dimensions possess the global-in-time existence of a classical solution in the general theory for nonlinear wave equations. It is also remarkable that our results on the lifespan estimates are partially better than those of the general theory. This fact tells us that there is a possibility to improve the general theory which was expected complete more than 30 years ago.},

We establish the alternative of wave solutions, that is, either there is a unique, asymptotically stable periodic traveling wave connecting 0 to 1 directly, or there is a unique propagating terrace connecting 0 to 1. Under the assumption that all wave speeds in propagating terrace are not equal to each other, we further obtain that the propagating terrace is asymptotically stable if it exists. Moreover, the sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of periodic traveling waves connecting 0 to 1 are given respectively. Our arguments are based on the parabolic maximum principle, sliding method and the super- and sub-solution method.},

We establish the weak well-posedness of the system within an appropriate variational framework, accommodating various choices for the nonlinear potentials. One of the primary novelties of the work lies in the rigorous establishment of the existence of a weak solution through the introduction of delicate approximation schemes. To our knowledge, this represents a novel advancement for both the intricate Cahn–Hilliard–Keller–Segel system and the Keller–Segel subsystem with source terms. Moreover, when specific conditions are met, such as having more regular initial data, a smallness condition on the chemotactic constant with respect to the magnitude of initial conditions and potentially focusing solely on the two-dimensional case, we provide regularity results for the weak solutions. Finally, we derive a continuous dependence estimate, which, in turn, leads to the uniqueness of the smoothed solution as a natural consequence.},

The approach concerns large time behaviors is so-called the Gevrey method which bases on the parabolic mechanics of the micropolar system. This method enables us even to derive decay of arbitrary higher order derivatives by transforming it into the control of the radius of analyticity under a particular regularity. To bound the growth of the radius of analyticity in general L p Lp Besov spaces, we shall develop some new techniques concern Gevrey estimates, especially an extended Coifman-Meyer theory, to cover those endpoint Lebesgue framework.},

As the weight function m ( x ) m(x) changes sign in Ω, our result is a substantial extension of a previous, very recent, result of Li et al. [8] , where it was imposed the (very strong) condition that m ≥ 0 m≥0 on a neighborhood of b − 1 ( { 0 } ) b−1({0}) .

First, after deriving the forward time-dependent multidimensional nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation, the Feynman-Kac formula for the forward nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation is established by using Itô&#39;s formula and techniques for the backward nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the backward stochastic differential equation driven by Lévy process. Then, from the Feynman-Kac formula, we prove the global existence and uniqueness of the solutions for the forward and backward time-dependent multidimensional nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations by using techniques from stochastic analysis. Finally, the dynamic evolution of the probability density function corresponding to the stochastic model for the MeKS network (reflecting the interactions among the MecA complex, comK, comS) is investigated over an extended period by Feynman-Kac formula and Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we reveal the influence of symmetric and asymmetric stable noises as well as tempered stable noise on the probability density function corresponding to the stochastic MeKS network model.},

J. Probab., 28 , 1–66). When an equation is well-posed, and it is approximated by replacing the differentiation operator by reasonable discretization schemes, it is widely believed that a solution of the approximating equation should converge to the solution of the original equation as the discretization parameter approaches zero. We prove otherwise for the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics system forced by space-time white noise. Specifically, we prove that the limit of the solution to the approximating system with an additional 32 drift terms solves the original system. These 32 drift terms depend on the choice of approximations, can be calculated explicitly and essentially represent a spatial version of Itô-Stratonovich correction terms.},

We construct the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of regular solutions for the pressureless Euler–Navier–Stokes system without using a priori large time behavior estimates. Moreover, we seek for the optimal Sobolev regularity for the solutions. Concerning the temporal decay for solutions, we show that the fluid velocities exhibit the same decay rate as that of the heat equations.

Later, Weiss (1999) [34] first realized that in higher dimensions a critical dimension ⁎ d ⁎ d⁎ exists so that the singularities of the free boundary can only occur when ⁎ d ⩾ d ⁎ d⩾d⁎ . In this paper, we consider a non-homogeneous semilinear one-phase Bernoulli-type problem, and we show that the free boundary is a disjoint union of a regular and a singular set. Moreover, the regular set is locally the graph of a C 1 , γ C1,γ function for some γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) γ∈(0,1) . In addition, there exists a critical dimension ⁎ d ⁎ d⁎ so that the singular set is empty if ⁎ d d ⁎ d&amp;gt;d⁎ .

We consider problems in which incoming pulses are generated from pulse boundary data as well as problems in which a single outgoing pulse reflects off a possibly curved boundary to produce a number of incoming pulses. Although we focus here on boundary problems, it is clear that similar results hold by similar methods for the Cauchy problem for N × N N×N systems in free space.},

  abstract     = {The rotating thermal shallow water (RTSW) equations is a model for studying thin layer fluids with horizontal variations in material properties. A mathematically rigorous framework is developed for deriving new reduced slow dynamics equations of the multiple-scale RTSW equations with both balanced and unbalanced initial data over the spatial periodic domain. It is rigorously proved that the reduced slow dynamics of the RTSW equations is the thermal quasi-geostrophic (thermal QG) equations by proper rescaling. Moreover, by introducing appropriate elliptic equations and using the time-averaging technique, we further obtained the convergence rates of the solutions with unbalanced initial data.},

A deterministic periodic LQ problem is introduced and solved, whose optimal pair, together with a pair of correction processes, serves as the turnpike limit of the stochastic problem. It is shown that the turnpike limit is periodic in the distribution sense. In the special case of constant coefficients, the turnpike limit turns out to have stationary distributions, with the expectation being the solution to a static optimization problem.},

A uniform regularity for random initial data near the global equilibrium is established in some suitable Sobolev spaces by using energy estimates, and we also prove the energy decays exponentially in time by hypocoercivity arguments, which means that the long time behavior of the solution is insensitive to the random perturbation in the initial data. For the generalized polynomial chaos stochastic Galerkin method (gPC-sG) for the model, with initial data near the global equilibrium and smooth enough in the physical and random spaces, we prove that the gPC-sG method has spectral accuracy, uniformly in time and the Stokes number, and the error decays exponentially in time.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that differential Painlevé equations can be written in a Hamiltonian form. However, a coordinate form of such representation is far from unique — there are many very different Hamiltonians that result in the same differential Painlevé equation. Recognizing a Painlevé equation, for example when it appears in some applied problem, is known as the Painlevé equivalence problem . Here we consider its Hamiltonian version. We describe a systematic procedure for finding changes of coordinates that transform different Hamiltonian representations of a Painlevé equation into some canonical form. Our approach is based on Sakai&#39;s geometric theory of Painlevé equations. We explain it in detail for Painlevé IV, and give a brief summary for Painlevé V and VI. Such explicit identifications can be helpful for applications, since it gives access to known results about Painlevé equations, such as structure of symmetries and special solutions for certain parameter values.},

The parameters for the heat conductivity and the temperature-depending viscosity are investigated for both barotropic gases and polytropic gases. It finally turns out that the hypotheses on the physical effects have significant influences on the asymptotic behaviors as the parameters vanish. In particular, the positions of the shock front for the limit shock solution (if exists) are different for different hypotheses. Hence, it seems impossible to figure out a criterion selecting the unique shock solution within the framework of the inviscid Euler flows.},

  abstract     = {In the context of the spatial three-body problem and KAM theory, specifically in the regime where the Hamiltonian function is split as the sum of two Keplerian terms plus a small perturbation, we deal with quasi-periodic motions of the three bodies such that two of the three particles (the so-called inner bodies) describe near-collision orbits. More precisely the inner bodies never collide, but they follow orbits that are bounded straight lines or close to straight lines. The motion of the inner bodies occurs either near the axis that is perpendicular to the invariable plane (i.e. the fixed plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector that passes through the centre of mass of the system) or near the invariable plane. The outer particle&#39;s trajectory has an eccentricity varying between zero and a value that is upper bounded by e 2 M &lt; 1 e2M&amp;lt;1 and lies near the invariable plane. The three bodies&#39; orbits fill in invariant 5-tori and when the inner particles move in an axis perpendicular to the invariable plane, they correspond to new solutions of the three-body problem. Our approach consists in a combination of a regularisation procedure with the construction of various reduced spaces and the explicit determination of sets of symplectic coordinates. The various reduced spaces we build depend on what symmetries are taken into consideration for the reduction. Moreover we apply an iso-energetic theorem by Han, Li and Yi on the persistence of quasi-periodic solutions for Hamiltonian systems with high-order proper degeneracy. All these elements allow us to calculate explicitly the torsions for the possible combinations that the three particles&#39; motions can achieve.},

Then we use this uniform estimate to derive the acoustic limit from the scaled BFD equations within the context of classical solutions.

When the initial deformation gradient does not degenerate and there is no vacuum initially, we establish the uniform regularity estimates of solutions to the initial-boundary value problem for the three-dimensional compressible viscoelastic equations in the Sobolev spaces. Then we justify the vanishing viscosity limit of solutions of the compressible viscoelastic equations based on the uniform regularity estimates and the compactness arguments. Both the no-slip boundary condition and the Navier-slip type boundary condition on velocity are addressed in this paper. On the one hand, for the corresponding vanishing viscosity limit of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the no-slip boundary condition, it is impossible to derive such uniform energy estimates of solutions due to the appearance of strong boundary layers. Consequently, our results show that the deformation gradient can prevent the formation of strong boundary layers. On the other hand, our results also provide two different kinds of boundary conditions suitable for the well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem of the elastodynamic equations via the method of vanishing viscosity. Finally, it is worth noting that we take advantage of the Lagrangian coordinates to study the vanishing viscosity limit for the fixed boundary problem in this paper.},

This quantitative result is powerful not only to investigate the exponentially contractive property of distributions corresponding to partially dissipative McKean-Vlasov SDEs with jumps but also to handle the long time behavior of time-inhomogeneous SDEs with jumps. Our approach also works very well for two Lévy driven SDEs with different drift terms, which satisfy monotone and Lyapunov conditions. As important applications of the result in this aspect, under monotone and Lyapunov conditions, we obtain succinctly the exponential decay and the locally exponential contractivity as well as the exponential ergodicity for McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by Lévy noises.},

  abstract     = {This work studies the asymptotic dynamics of classical solutions of a multi-strain diffusive epidemic model in spatially heterogeneous environments. Results on the nonexistence of coexistence endemic equilibria are established. Moreover, explicit conditions on the parameters range which guarantee the extinctions of some strains of the disease are examined. In particular, we establish that the competition-exclusion principle occurs when the population diffuses very fast and one strain uniquely maximizes the ratio of the spatial average of transmission rate over that of the recovery rate. However, several strains of the disease may coexist when either: (i) the population diffuses very slowly, (ii) or a subgroup diffuses very slowly and the other subgroup diffuses very fast. In these two scenarios, the asymptotic profiles of the coexistence endemic equilibria with respect to the diffusion rates of the population are presented. In particular, we observe a spatial segregation of the infected populations when they diffuse very slowly.},

Prey species lack memory or cognitive abilities, exhibiting only random diffusion. In contrast, predators utilize memory-based self-diffusion. For the proposed model, we establish the existence and explicit expression of a spatially non-constant positive steady-state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that memory-based diffusion and the averaged memory period can lead to richer dynamics. Specifically, when the memory-based diffusion coefficient is not dominant, the averaged memory period has no impact on the non-constant steady-state. However, when the memory-based diffusion coefficient takes precedence, the averaged memory period can destabilize the non-constant steady-state, resulting in Hopf bifurcation and the emergence of spatially non-homogeneous periodic solutions.},

In the physical background, the solutions to the predator-prey model stand for the population densities for predator and prey and are non-negative, which is a critical challenge in our inverse problem study. We mainly focus on the unique identifiability issue and tackle it with the high-order variation method, a relatively new technique introduced by the second author and his collaborators. This method can ensure the positivity of solutions and has broader applicability in other physical models with non-negativity requirements. Our study improves this method by choosing a more general solution ( u 0 , v 0 ) (u0,v0) to expand around, achieving recovery for all interaction terms. By this means, we improve on the previous results and apply this to physical models to recover coefficients concerning compression, prey attack, crowding, carrying capacity, and many other interaction factors in the system. Finally, we apply our results to study three specific cases: the hydra-effects model, the Holling-Tanner model and the classic Lotka-Volterra model.},

We first study the associated linear theory, mainly including the spectral properties of infinitesimal generator, formal adjoint and decomposition of phase space. Based on these results, the normal form theory for nonlinear equation is established, which can be used to study the local dynamics near the steady state for such equations. As an application, we consider the Hopf bifurcation problem of a scalar diffusive equation with delay not only involved in the diffusive term but also in reaction terms. The normal form, depending on the original coefficients, up to the third order term is calculated, which allows us to determine the direction of Hopf bifurcation and stability of bifurcated periodic solutions. The results are then applied to study the scalar population model with memory-based diffusion for modeling the movement of highly-developed animals.},

  abstract     = {The question of whether features and behaviors that are characteristic to completely integrable systems persist in the transition to non-integrable settings is a central one in the field of nonlinear dispersive equations. In this work, we investigate this topic in the context of focusing nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations. In particular, we consider non-integrable counterparts of the (integrable) focusing cubic NLS equation, which are distinct generalizations of cubic NLS and involve a broad class of nonlinearities, with the cases of power and saturable nonlinearities serving as illustrative examples. This is a notably different direction from the one explored in other works, where the non-integrable models considered are only small perturbations of the integrable one. We study the Cauchy problem on the real line for both vanishing and non-vanishing boundary conditions at infinity and quantify the proximity of solutions between the integrable and non-integrable models via estimates in appropriate metrics as well as pointwise. These results establish that the distance of solutions grows at most linearly with respect to time, while the growth rate of each solution is chiefly controlled by the size of the initial data and the nonlinearity parameters. A major implication of these closeness estimates is that integrable dynamics emerging from small initial conditions may persist in the non-integrable setting for significantly long times. In the case of zero boundary conditions at infinity, this persistence includes soliton and soliton collision dynamics, while in the case of nonzero boundary conditions at infinity, it establishes the nonlinear behavior of the non-integrable models at the early stages of the ubiquitous phenomenon of modulational instability. For this latter and more challenging type of boundary conditions, the closeness estimates are proved with the aid of new results concerning the local existence of solutions to the non-integrable models. In addition to the infinite line, we also consider the cubic NLS equation and its non-integrable generalizations in the context of initial-boundary value problems on a finite interval. Apart from their own independent interest and features such as global existence of solutions (which does not occur in the infinite domain setting), such problems are naturally used to numerically simulate the Cauchy problem on the real line, thereby justifying the excellent agreement between the numerical findings and the theoretical results of this work.},

This is the fourth order analogy of the second order equation − Δ u = | x | σ u p −Δu=|x|σup , known as the Hardy–Hénon equation, which was proposed by Hénon in 1973 as a model to study rotating stellar systems in astrophysics. Although there have been many works devoting to the study of the above fourth order equation, the assumption n ≥ 4 n≥4 is often assumed. In this work, we are interested in classical solutions to the equation in the case of low dimensions, namely 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 2≤n≤3 .

Under the condition of β &gt; 1 β&amp;gt;1 , we prove the global existence of the radially symmetric strong solutions to the Kazhikhov models under Dirichlet boundary conditions for arbitrary large initial smooth data.

Then, by a high-dimensional zero point theorem, it is proved the existence of infinitely many symmetric harmonic and subharmonic bouncing solutions. Second, we consider an infinite-dimensional system as a limit case of a sequence of finite-dimensional systems.

The spatial motion of individuals from one site to another is modelled by a discrete convolution operator. In order to take into account external fluctuations such as seasonality, daily variations and so on, the convolution kernels and reaction terms may vary with time. Our analysis of the spreading speeds of invasion of the species is based on the careful and detailed study of the hair-trigger effect and spreading speed for a non-autonomous scalar Fisher-KPP equation on a lattice. Then, we are able to compare the solutions of the prey-predator system with those of a suitable scalar Fisher-KPP equation and derive the invasion speeds of the prey and of the predator.},

At the interface of the pore space and the solid part, we prescribe an inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, which enables a no-slip boundary condition at the evolving boundary. We pass rigorously to the homogenisation limit employing the two-scale transformation method. In order to derive uniform a priori estimates, we show a Korn-type inequality for the two-scale transformation method. The homogenisation result is a new version of Darcy&#39;s law. It features a time- and space-dependent permeability tensor, which accounts for the local pore structure, and a macroscopic inhomogeneous divergence condition, which induces a new source term for the pressure. In the case of a no-slip boundary condition at the interface, this source term relates to the change of the local pore volume.},

  abstract     = {We consider wave equations with a critically singular potential ξ ⋅ σ − 2 ξ⋅σ−2 diverging as an inverse square at a hypersurface σ = 0 σ=0 . Our aim is to construct counterexamples to unique continuation from σ = 0 σ=0 for this equation, provided there exists a family of null geodesics trapped near σ = 0 σ=0 . This extends the classical geometric optics construction [3] of Alinhac-Baouendi (i) to linear differential operators with singular coefficients, and (ii) over non-small portions of σ = 0 σ=0 , by showing that such counterexamples can be further continued as long as this null geodesic family remains trapped and regular. As an application to relativity and holography, we construct counterexamples to unique continuation from the conformal boundaries of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes for some Klein-Gordon equations; this complements the unique continuation results of the second author with Chatzikaleas, Holzegel, and McGill [12] , [18] , [19] , [24] and suggests a potential mechanism for counterexamples to the AdS/CFT correspondence.},

Here, the electron density is imposed with degenerate sonic boundary and considered in interiorly subsonic case, while the hole density is considered in fully subsonic case. Unlike the unipolar model, we show that the structural stability in bipolar model holds regardless of the type of doping profile and propose a new version of comparison principle, which captures the intrinsic negative correlation between electrons and holes. To overcome the difficulty caused by the degenerate effect at the sonic boundary, we introduce two different weight functions to handle the singularity near both sides of endpoints separately. The approaches adopted to prove the structural stability include the local singularity analysis, the monotonicity method, the continuation argument and the squeezing skill. Several numerical simulations are performed which support our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {A modified Poisson–Nernst–Planck system in a bounded domain with mixed Dirichlet–Neumann boundary conditions is analyzed. It describes the concentrations of ions immersed in a polar solvent and the correlated electric potential due to the ion–solvent interaction. The concentrations solve cross-diffusion equations, which are thermodynamically consistent. The considered mixture is saturated, meaning that the sum of the ion and solvent concentrations is constant. The correlated electric potential depends nonlocally on the electric potential and solves the fourth-order Poisson–Fermi equation. The existence of global bounded weak solutions is proved by using the boundedness-by-entropy method. The novelty of the paper is the proof of the weak–strong uniqueness property. In contrast to the existence proof, we include the solvent concentration in the cross-diffusion system, leading to a diffusion matrix with nontrivial kernel. Then the proof is based on the relative entropy method for the extended cross-diffusion system and the positive definiteness of a related diffusion matrix on a subspace.},

This will be achieved by separating the equilibriums from the system and show that the remaining system is described by an operator with compact resolvent. Furthermore, we will apply a unique continuation principle on the resolvent equation to show that there are no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis.},

  abstract     = {We are interested in the global dynamics of a massive scalar field evolving under its own gravitational field and, in this paper, we study spherically symmetric solutions to Einstein&#39;s field equations coupled with a Klein-Gordon equation with quadratic potential. For the initial value problem we establish a global existence theory when initial data are prescribed on a future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry. A suitably generalized solution in Bondi coordinates is sought which has low regularity and possibly large but finite Bondi mass. A similar result was established first by Christodoulou for massless fields. In order to deal with massive fields, we must overcome several challenges and significantly modify Christodoulou&#39;s original method. First of all, we formulate the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system in spherical symmetry as a non-local and nonlinear hyperbolic equation and, by carefully investigating the global dynamical behavior of the massive field, we establish various estimates concerning the Einstein operator, the Hawking mass, and the Bondi mass, including novel positivity and monotonicity properties. Importantly, in addition to a regularization at the center of symmetry we find it necessary to also introduce a regularization at null infinity. We also establish new energy and decay estimates for, both, regularized and generalized solutions.},

Since [24] , a lot of effort has been devoted to the qualitative understanding of the following question: how should one spread resources in order to maximise or minimise the total biomass? This question was studied in detail, mostly in situations where the carrying capacity of the environment and the growth rate of the population are equal. Following recent contributions [7] , [11] , [40] , we propose a mathematical treatment of this question in contexts where the growth rate and the carrying capacity are de-correlated. We investigate the optimisation of generic criteria with respect to the carrying capacity. We settle the problem of existence by providing the proper relaxation of the optimisation problems, using homogenisation-type arguments. At a qualitative level, we obtain theoretical results backing up the observations and other results of [7] , [11] , [40] regarding the optimality of homogeneous environments. We similarly investigate in details the question of minimising the total biomass. We also provide several stationarity results (in the context of large diffusivities) for the minimisation of the biomass and related criteria.},

Since there involves a new variable h ¯ h¯ in the concentrated points { x j ± } j = 1 m {xj±}j=1m during the reduction process, we have to obtain a more precise estimate for the error term. And the bubble solutions are centered at points lying on the top and the bottom circles of a cylinder. Particularly, in one of these cases, the bubble solutions can concentrate at a pair of symmetric points relative to the origin. Our results present a new clustering type of blow-up phenomenon and we think the reason why this phenomenon can occur is mainly because that the function r 2 V ( r , y ″ ) r2V(r,y″) has non-isolated critical points.},

We prove curvature in L p Lp gives local existence and curvature in W 1 , p W1,p gives uniqueness. Our argument is based on the authors&#39; theory of the RT-equations for regularizing connections to optimal regularity by coordinate transformation. The incoming regularity is too low to formulate a weak version of the geodesic equation based on the standard method of multiplying by smooth test functions and integrating by parts, so alternatively, we define weak solutions by coordinate transformation, and we give an explicit procedure for mollifying the original connection such that the correct weak solution is indeed a limit of smooth solutions of the mollified equations in the original coordinates. This is an example where limits under suitable mollification are more fundamental than a weak formulation, indicative of more complicated PDE&#39;s in which the standard weak formulation of the equations does not adequately rule out unphysical solutions. Our results apply to general second order ODE&#39;s in which the lack of regularity can be isolated in the connection coefficients. The results apply to General Relativity.},

This mechanism is called Turing&#39;s instability, which is one of important mechanisms to organize spatiotemporal patterns. In the case of two-component reaction–diffusion systems, the diffusion coefficients should be different for Turing&#39;s instability. Conversely, there exist several chemical models that produce the stable patterns even though the diffusion coefficients are equal. These are often referred to as “far-from-equilibrium phenomenon”. To study the pattern formation by equal diffusion, this article presents an example of a kinetic system with a asymptotically stable equilibrium, while the corresponding reaction–diffusion system has a family of unstable stationary solutions that is arbitrarily close to the homogeneous stationary solution.},

Here the solution is admissible in the sense that its shock waves satisfy the Lax entropy condition. We also study asymptotic behavior of solutions. In particular, we obtain a time decay rate for the total variation of the solution, and a convergence rate of the solution to its time asymptotic solution. Our system is a modification of a Keller-Segel type chemotaxis model. Its flux function possesses new features when comparing to the well-known model of Euler equations with damping.

This class of stochastic Gronwall inequalities is a useful tool for SDEs. Our focus are convex generalizations of the Bihari-LaSalle type. The constants we obtain are sharp. In particular, we provide new sharp constants for the stochastic Gronwall inequalities. The proofs are connected to a domination inequality by Lenglart (1977), an inequality by Pratelli (1976) and a characterization of Lenglart&#39;s concept of domination via the Snell envelope. The inequalities we study appear for example in connection with exponential moments of solutions to path-dependent SDEs: For non-path-dependent SDEs, criteria for the finiteness of exponential moments are known. To be able to extend these proofs to the path-dependent case, a convex generalization of a stochastic Gronwall inequality seems necessary. Using the results of this paper, we obtain a criterion for the finiteness of exponential moments which is similar to that known for non-path-dependent SDEs. Stochastic Gronwall inequalities can also be applied to study other types of SDEs than path-dependent SDEs: An estimate of this paper is applied by Agresti and Veraar (2023) to prove global well-posedness for reaction-diffusion systems with transport noise.},

  abstract     = {For the family of nonautonomous delay equations, we show that the generator of the evolution semigroup obtained from any such equation gives rise to an autonomous delay equation on a higher-dimensional space. We call it an induced delay equation . More significantly, we show that this equation can be used to study some important properties of the original dynamics in four main directions: the characterization of the hyperbolicity of the original delay equation via the hyperbolicity of the induced delay equation; the description of the spectral properties and of the corresponding Lyapunov exponents; the equivalence between the hyperbolicity of the induced delay equation and an admissibility property for its nonlinear perturbations; and, finally, the robustness of hyperbolicity under sufficiently small linear perturbations. The proofs of some of these results depend on a new variation of constants formula for the nonlinear perturbations of the induced delay equation that is also established in our work.},

Namely, assuming that such an operator T has polynomial coefficients, we interpret it as a continuous family of Hutchinson operators acting on the space of positive powers of linear forms. Using this interpretation of T , we introduce its continuously Hutchinson invariant subsets of the complex plane and investigate a variety of their properties. In particular, we prove that for any T with non-constant coefficients, there exists a unique minimal under inclusion invariant set M C H T MCHT and find explicitly what operators T have the property that M C H T = C MCHT=C .},

The topic is motivated by the mathematical problems of Meissner states of anisotropic superconductors, and of the nonlinear magneto-static Maxwell equations with strong anisotropy. Two types of degenerate curls are studied, among them one is the directional curl along a unit length vector field, which has been introduced by the author before, and the other is the matrix-curl, which is introduced in this paper. Because of the degeneracy produced by the degenerate curl of the unknown vector field in the leading term of the equation, the boundary condition should be prescribed on part of the boundary according to the nature of the degenerate curl. We formulate the Dirichelt type and natural type boundary conditions, and give existence of solutions both for the static equations and for the evolution equations.},

In this study, we consider how dynamical properties can be generalized to this setting. First, we study the generalizations of dynamical properties, such as invariance and limit sets and show that compact weakly invariant sets can be characterized in terms of the corresponding shift-invariant sets in the function space. This result enables us to consider weakly invariant sets in terms of shift-invariant sets. Next, we compare the axiomatic theory of ODE with other formalisms of generalized dynamical systems, namely generalized semiflow and multivalued semigroup.

  abstract     = {This article studies the pullback dynamics and statistical solutions for the dissipative non-autonomous Zakharov equations in a bounded interval . The main obstacle in our investigating comes from the geometric constrain of global regularity of solutions for the Zakharov equations. This geometric constrain is caused essentially by its particular structure which is a special coupling of a hyperbolic equation with a dispersive nonlinear Schrödinger equation . The nonlinear term Δ | E | 2 Δ|E|2 in the hyperbolic equation is the core ingredient leading to this geometric constrain. Firstly we show the global existence and uniqueness of solutions, and prove the continuous dependence of solutions on the initial data by exploiting a certain coercivity of the operator corresponding to the linear principle part of the Zakharov equations. Then we establish that the generated process of solution mappings possesses a bounded pullback absorbing set and pullback asymptotic compactness by using a delicate decomposition of the original problem, and obtain the existence of a pullback attractor. Next we formulate an appropriate definition of τ -continuity for the process and employ the calculus of variations to prove this τ -continuity. Afterwards, we construct a family of invariant Borel probability measures for the process via the pullback attractor and the notion of generalized Banach limit. We also propose an appropriate definition of statistical solutions for the addressed Zakharov equations, and establish that the constructed family of invariant Borel probability measures is indeed a statistical solution which satisfies the Liouville theorem of Statistical Mechanics . Our definitions and approach present here can overcome effectively the difficulty caused by the geometric constrain of the Zakharov equations. Finally, we propose some open problems related to the existence and singular limiting behavior of the pullback attractors and statistical solutions for the Zakharov equations with varying coefficient.},

  abstract     = {We consider a family of 2D logarithmic spiral vortex sheets which include the celebrated spirals introduced by Prandtl (Vorträge aus dem Gebiete der Hydro- und Aerodynamik, 1922) [23] and by Alexander (Phys. Fluids, 1971) [1] . We prove that for each such spiral the normal component of the velocity field remains continuous across the spiral. We give sufficient conditions for spiral vortex sheets to be weak solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Namely, we show that a spiral gives rise to such a solution if and only if two conditions hold across every spiral: a velocity matching condition and a pressure matching condition. Furthermore we show that these two conditions are equivalent to the imaginary part and the real part, respectively, of a single complex constraint on the coefficients of the spirals. This in particular provides a rigorous mathematical framework for logarithmic spirals, an issue that has remained open since their introduction by Prandtl in 1922. Another consequence of the main result is well-posedness of the symmetric Alexander spiral with two branches, despite recent evidence for the contrary. Moreover, our result implies a sharpness result of Delort&#39;s theorem on global existence of solutions to the Euler equations with initial vorticity measure. Our main tools are new explicit formulas for the velocity field and for the pressure function, as well as a notion of a winding number of a spiral, which not only gives a robust way of localizing the spirals&#39; arms with respect to a given point in the plane, but also ensures correct asymptotic behaviour near 0.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a reaction-diffusion population model with Dirichlet boundary condition and a directed movement oriented by a temporally distributed delay is proposed to describe the lasting memory of animals moving over space. The temporal kernel of the memory is taken as Gamma distribution function, among which there are two biologically meaningful cases: one is the weak kernel which implies that animals can immediately acquire knowledge and memory decays over time, the other is the strong kernel by which we assume that animals&#39; memory undergoes learning and memory decay stages. It is shown that the population stabilizes to a positive steady state and aggregates in the interior of the territory when the delay kernel is the weak type. In the strong kernel case, oscillatory patterns can first arise via a Hopf bifurcation with a small memory delay and then vanish when the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with a large memory delay, which implies that stability switch occurs and spatial-temporal patterns emerge for intermediate value of delays.},

Our abstract model is flexible enough as to admit time-fractional derivatives in the sense of Liouville-Grünwald. We characterize the maximal regularity property solely in terms of R -boundedness of a block operator-valued symbol, and provide corresponding estimates. In addition, we show practical criteria that imply the R -boundedness part of the characterization. We apply these criteria to show that the Keller-Segel system, as well as a reactor model system, have L q − L p Lq−Lp maximal regularity.},

These systems are quadratic, written under the form of transport equations with a nonlocal self-generated drift. We establish the localisation limit, that is the convergence of nonlocal to local systems, when the range of interaction tends to 0. These theoretical results are sustained by numerical simulations. The major new feature in our analysis is that we do not need diffusion to gain compactness, but rely on a full rank assumption on the interaction kernels. In turn, we prove existence of weak solutions for the resulting system, a cross-diffusion system of quadratic type.},

We do not restrict ourselves to the homogeneous case, but also identify the temporal and boundary trace spaces, which are both sufficient and necessary to obtain a unique solution in the L p Lp -maximal regularity space. Our results are based on a (partial) Fourier–Laplace transform of the problem in the half-space case, leading to elliptic boundary value problems which have to satisfy variants of the Lopatinskii–Shapiro condition [34] to be solvable.

  abstract     = {In a previous paper (Feng et al., J. Differential Equations (2023)), we studied a seasonally interactive model between closed seasons and open seasons with Michaelis-Menten type harvesting, in which we assumed that the harvesting quantity was relatively large ( 0 &lt; κ = l G c E T ¯ ⁎ T¯&amp;gt;T¯⁎ . In this paper, we continue to investigate the periodic dynamics of this model when the harvesting quantity is relatively small ( κ = l G c E ≥ 1 κ=lGcE≥1 ). By finding another smaller length threshold ⁎ ⁎ T ¯ ⁎ ∈ ( 0 , T ¯ ⁎ ) T¯⁎∈(0,T¯⁎) , we determine the number of periodic solutions and study their stability, which imply the occurrence of bifurcation of periodic solutions. Our results demonstrate that designing the closed harvesting season properly can prevent the species from extinction. Moreover, by comparing with the continuous harvesting model and combining the results in our previous paper and this article, we provide a complete understanding on the global dynamics for the periodic switching model. Some numerical simulations are also carried out to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider time-harmonic acoustic wave propagation in a half-plane filled by inhomogeneous periodic medium. If the refractive index depends on the horizontal coordinate only, we define upward and downward radiating modes by solving a one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem with a complex-valued periodic coefficient. The upward and downward radiation conditions are introduced based on a generalized Rayleigh series. Using the variational method , we then prove uniqueness and existence for the scattering of an incoming wave mode by a grating located between an upper and lower half plane with such inhomogeneous periodic media. The solution operator of the quasiperiodic boundary value problem yields a well-defined scattering operator, the numerical approximation of which is nothing else but the S-matrix in scattering matrix algorithms like Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) or Fourier Modal Method (FMM).},

As a step toward understanding the underlying mechanism of the spatiotemporal pattern formations by rigorous mathematical analysis, we are interested in how the joint effects of time delay, the fear effect strength, the carrying capacity, as well as the diffusion rates could affect the complex spatiotemporal pattern formations of the system. In particular, Turing instability of the Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions is investigated in details. To that end, a general formula is derived to determine Turing instability of the Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions for general 2-component delayed-diffusive system. This extends our earlier general results for non-delayed diffusive system to its delayed-diffusive counterparts. Our general formula tends to be new and can be applied to a variety of 2-component delayed-diffusive systems.},

Because this formula specifies the interplay between the coefficients of the ode, the relaxation function (“strongly” decreasing positive function) and the frequency function of the oscillation, it can be applied to design models of dissipative oscillations. As an application, we present and discuss some oscillation models that stop within a finite time period. Via two examples about the Airy function and the Bessel functions , we show that the formula might be useful in analysing certain special functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that a large class of oscillations can be used to design and analyze dissipative waves. In particular, it is easy to model dissipative waves that cause in each point of space an oscillation that stops after a finite time period. Finally, we derive an alternate form of the dissipative wave equation (for a large class of dissipative waves), which is uniquely defined by the sound speed c 0 c0 and the parameter functions in the oscillation equation.},

The system consists of a Navier–Stokes equation coupled with a convective Allen–Cahn equation, with two independent sources of randomness given by general multiplicative-type Wiener noises. In particular, the Allen–Cahn equation is characterized by a singular potential of logarithmic type as prescribed by the classical thermodynamical derivation of the model. The problem is endowed with a no-slip boundary condition for the (volume averaged) velocity field , as well as a homogeneous Neumann condition for the order parameter. We first prove the existence of analytically weak martingale solutions in two and three spatial dimensions. Then, in two dimensions , we also establish pathwise uniqueness and the existence of a unique probabilistically-strong solution.

We show that for the perturbed system there exists a C 1 C1 invariant manifold S ( t , ω ) = { ( x , y ) ∈ X × Y | x = σ ( t , y , ω ) } S(t,ω)={(x,y)∈X×Y|x=σ(t,y,ω)} under the condition that the linear part of x equation satisfies the exponential dichotomy. Meanwhile, we observe that typically if the linear part of x equation is uniformly attracting or uniformly expanding, then the corresponding invariant manifold shares the same qualitative properties. In the end, as the perturbation tends to 0, we show that the invariant manifold and its derivative in y are approaching to those of the original system, suggesting that such structure is persistent under the small random perturbation.},

The stability problem of viscous shock under small 1-dimensional perturbations was solved in Duan-Liu-Zhang [7] . In this paper, we prove the viscous shock is still stable under small 3-d perturbations. Firstly, we decompose the perturbation into the zero mode and non-zero mode. Then we can show that both the perturbation and zero-mode time-asymptotically tend to zero by the anti-derivative technique and crucial estimates on the zero-mode. Moreover, we can further prove that the non-zero mode tends to zero with exponential decay rate . The key point is to estimate the non-zero mode of nonlinear terms involving electronic potential, see Lemma 6.1 below.},

We establish the first global-in-time existence result for dissipative weak martingale solutions to this SPDE, with general finite-energy initial data . The solution is obtained as the limit of classical solutions to parabolic SPDEs. The proof combines model-specific statistical estimates with stochastic propagation of compactness techniques, along with the systematic use of tightness and a.s. representations of random variables on specific quasi-Polish spaces. The spatial dependence of the noise function makes more difficult the analysis of a priori estimates and various renormalisations, giving rise to nonlinear terms induced by the martingale part of the equation and the second-order Stratonovich–Itô correction term.},

This paper is devoted to the continuation of solutions to the extended cubic Camassa-Holm equation beyond wave breaking, and the global existence and uniqueness of the Hölder continuous energy conservative solutions for the Cauchy problem of the extended cubic Camassa-Holm type equation are investigated. An equivalent semilinear system was first introduced by a new set of independent and dependent variables , which can resolve all singularities due to possible wave breaking. Returning to the original variables, depending continuously on the initial data , the existence of the global conservative weak solutions can be obtained.

The classical results dealt with the above part ( i i ) (ii) when f is continuous or an L 1 L1 -Carathéodory function, and only obtained the existence of a number h such that the IVPs had local solutions in C [ a , a + h ] C[a,a+h] . Our methodology is to use the results obtained on ( i ) to study the results mentioned in ( i i ) (ii) when p ∈ [ 1 , p ] p∈[1,p] while the classical results used the Schauder fixed point theorems directly to obtain the existence and uniqueness of local solutions when f is continuous or p = 1 p=1 . Our results in parts ( i ) and ( i i i ) (iii) are new. The results in part ( i i ) (ii) are new when p ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ] p∈(1,∞] and improve the classical results when p = 1 p=1 . Our results will enrich the classical basic theory. As applications of the basic theory, the existence of solutions and nonnegative local solutions for logistic type population models with heterogeneous environments is studied, where the local rates of changes in the population density are L p Lp -Carathéodory functions.},

Due to the degeneracy of horizontal velocity near boundary, the higher regularity of solution is a tricky problem. By constructing suitable approximated system and establishing closed energy estimate for a good quantity (called “quotient” in [19] ), our first result is to solve this higher regularity problem. Furthermore, we show the global well-posedness and global-in- x asymptotic behavior when the initial data is small perturbation of the classical Hartmann layer in Sobolev space . By using the energy method to establish closed estimate for the quotient, we overcome the difficulty arising from the degeneracy of horizontal velocity near boundary. Due to the damping effect, we also point out that this global solution will converge to the equilibrium state (called Hartmann layer) with exponent decay rate.},

The method we adopted is a combination of the inverse scattering transform and Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method . Starting from the Lax pair associated with the coupled complex short-pulse equation, we derive a basic Riemann-Hilbert problem by introducing some appropriate spectral function transformations, and reconstruct the potential parameterized from the solution of the basic Riemann-Hilbert problem via the asymptotic behavior of the spectral variable at k → 0 k→0 .

Due to the boundary conditions, we first apply the eigenvalue theory of elliptic system to prove the existence and uniqueness of steady state for the model. The well-posedness of the model is established using an induction argument. By overcoming the difficulty of the associated elliptic eigenvalue problem , we originally derive the variational expression of the basic reproduction ratio R 0 R0 . The asymptotic profiles and monotonicity of R 0 R0 with respect to the mobility and advection rates are investigated following the variational characterization of R 0 R0 . Furthermore, the spatial dynamics of the model with Robin type boundary condition are categorized via classifying the level set of R 0 R0 . This work provides new clues for further research on the spread of epidemics in open advective environments.},

New criterions for the finite Hausdorff dimension and fractal dimension of attractors in Banach spaces are firslty proposed by combining the squeezing property and the covering of finite subspace of Banach spaces, which generalize the method established in Hilbert spaces . In order to surmount the barrier caused by the lack of orthogonal projectors with finite rank, which is the key tool for proving the squeezing property of partial differential equations in Hilbert spaces, we adopt the state decomposition of phase space based on the exponential dichotomy of the studied FDEs to obtain similar squeezing property. The theoretical results are applied to a retarded nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation and a non-autonomous retarded functional differential equation in the natural phase space, for which explicit bounds of dimensions that do not depend on the entropy number but only depend on the spectrum of the linear parts and Lipschitz constants of the nonlinear parts are obtained.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study an interaction problem between a 3 D compressible viscous fluid and a 3 D nonlinear viscoelastic solid fully immersed in the fluid, coupled together on the interface surface. The solid is allowed to have self-contact or contact with the rigid boundary of the fluid container. For this problem, a global weak solution with defect measure is constructed by using a multi-layered approximation scheme which decouples the body and the fluid by penalizing the fluid velocity and allowing the fluid to pass through the body, while the body is supplemented with a contact-penalization term. The resulting defect measure is a consequence of pressure concentrations that can appear where the fluid meets the (generally irregular) points of self-contact of the solid. Moreover, we study some geometrical properties of the fluid-structure interface and the contact surface. In particular, we prove a lower bound on area of the interface.},

When R 0 ≤ 1 , the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable. Different from earlier works for many epidemic models, we obtain the positive steady states by using bifurcation theory for R 0 &gt; 1 , which can be easily generalized to the case where the reaction-diffusion system involves partial diffusion coefficients of zero.},

The results in the mentioned papers showed that the SIRS epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate k I 2 / ( 1 + ω I 2 ) kI2/(1+ωI2) can undergo a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two. In this paper we study the SIRS epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate k I p / ( 1 + ω I q ) kIp/(1+ωIq) for general p and q . The bifurcation analysis indicates that there is a saddle-node or a cusp of codimension two for various parameter values and the model can undergo a saddle-node bifurcation or a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension two if suitable bifurcation parameters are selected. It means that there are some SIRS epidemic models which have a limit cycle or a homoclinic loop. Moreover, it is also shown that the codimension of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation is at most two.},

As a result, the condition for blocking of the propagation depends not only a condition at the junctions but also the length between the neighboring junctions, specifically, in a certain case long segments between the two junctions can prevent blocking of the propagation.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to show the global wellposedness of the Navier-Stokes equations, including surface tension and gravity, with a free surface in an unbounded domain such as bottomless ocean. In addition, it is proved that the solution decays polynomially as time t tends to infinity. To show these results, we first use the Hanzawa transformation in order to reduce the problem in a time-dependent domain Ω t ⊂ R 3 Ωt⊂R3 , t &gt; 0 t&amp;gt;0 , to a problem in the lower half-space R − 3 R−3 . We then establish some time-weighted estimate of solutions, in an L p Lp -in-time and L q Lq -in-space setting, for the linearized problem around the trivial steady state with the help of L r - L s Lr-Ls time decay estimates of semigroup. Next, the time-weighted estimate, combined with the contraction mapping principle, shows that the transformed problem in R − 3 R−3 admits a global-in-time solution in the L p - L q Lp-Lq setting and that the solution decays polynomially as time t tends to infinity under the assumption that p , q satisfy the conditions: 2 &lt; p &lt; ∞ 2&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ , 3 &lt; q &lt; 16 / 5 3&amp;lt;q&amp;lt;16/5 , and ( 2 / p ) + ( 3 / q ) &lt; 1 (2/p)+(3/q)&amp;lt;1 . Finally, we apply the inverse transformation of Hanzawa&#39;s one to the solution in R − 3 R−3 to prove our main results mentioned above for the original problem in Ω t Ωt . Here we want to emphasize that it is not allowed to take p = q p=q in the above assumption about p , q , which means that the different exponents p , q of L p - L q Lp-Lq setting play an essential role in our approach.},

Its main theorem establishes global-in-time existence and asymptotic stability of strong solutions to the Cauchy problem close to homogeneous reference states in d ≥ 3 d≥3 space dimensions . Notably, the operators are not required to be symmetric hyperbolic, instead merely the existence of symbolic symmetrizers is assumed. The dissipation is characterized by algebraic conditions implying the uniform decay of all Fourier modes at the reference state. On a technical level, the theory developed herein uses para-differential operators as its main tool. Apparently being the first to apply such operators in the context of global-in-time existence of small solutions for quasi-linear hyperbolic systems , the present work contains a new version of the strong Gårding inequality. In the context of theoretical physics , the theorem applies to recent formulations for the relativistic dynamics of viscous, heat-conductive fluids such as notably that of Bemfica, Disconzi and Noronha (2018) [2] .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the well-posedness, ill-posedness and uniqueness of the stationary 3-D radial solution to the bipolar isothermal hydrodynamic model for semiconductors. The density of electron is imposed with sonic boundary and interiorly subsonic case and the density of hole is fully subsonic case. It is difficult to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the holes due to the coupling of electrons and holes and the degeneracy of electrons at the boundary. Thus, we use the topological degree method to prove the well-posedness of solution. We prove the ill-posedness of subsonic solution under some conditions by direct mathematical analysis and contradiction method. The ill-posedness property shows significant difference to the unipolar model. Another highlight of this paper is the application of specific energy method to obtain the uniqueness of solution in two cases. One case is the relaxation time τ = ∞ τ=∞ , namely, the pure Euler-Poisson case; the other case is j τ ≪ 1 jτ≪1 , which means that, when the current flow is sufficiently small and the relaxation time is sufficiently large both can satisfy.},

First, we explore the general properties of C ∞ C∞ local integrability. Then we show the same regularity of the Gevrey&#39;s smooth local integrability as that of the vector fields under Poincaré&#39;s non-resonant condition for the case that the real parts of the eigenvalues are all positive or negative. Lastly, a sharper expression of the loss of the regularity is provided by the lowest order of the resonant terms together with the indices of Gevrey&#39;s smoothness and the diophantine condition for the case that the matrix is in the diagonal form . One of the main tools utilized here is the KAM method in the Banach space fixed with a weighted norm.},

Part I establishes a mathematical framework for approximating the invariant probability measures (IPMs) and density functions (IPDFs) of these systems, while Part II will focus on analyzing their non-autonomous periodic counterparts. Compared with the existing approximation methods available only for systems with non-degenerate linear diffusion, this paper introduces two new and easily implementable approximation methods, the log-normal approximation (LNA) and updated normal approximation (uNA), which can be used for systems with not only non-degenerate but also degenerate diffusion. Moreover, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck (KFP) operator and matrix algebra to develop algorithms for calculating the associated covariance matrix and verifying its positive definiteness. Our new approximation methods exhibit good accuracy in approximating the IPM and IPDF at both local and global levels, and significantly relaxes the minimal criteria for positive definiteness of the solution of the continuous-type Lyapunov equation. We demonstrate the utility of our methods in several application examples from biology and ecology.},

The main feature of this abstract system is that it covers a larger class of fundamental models which are included or not included previously. Under an extended locally monotone variational setting, we establish the global well-posedness, Itô&#39;s energy equality and existence of mean random attractors in some high-order Bochner spaces. The existence, uniqueness, support, (high-order and exponential) moment estimates, ergodicity , (pointwise and Wasserstein-type) exponentially mixing and asymptotic stability of invariant measures and evolution systems of measures are discussed for autonomous and nonautonomous stochastic equations . A stopping time technique is used to prove the convergence of solutions in probability in order to overcome the difficulty caused by the local monotonicity and superlinear growth of the coefficients. Our abstract results and unified methods are expected to be applied to various types of SPDEs like 2D Navier-Stokes equations, 2D MHD equations, 2D magnetic Bénard problem, Burgers type equations, 3D Leray α -model, convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations, fractional ( s , p ) (s,p) -Laplacian equations with monotone nonlinearities of polynomial growth of arbitrary order, and others.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the plasma-vacuum interface problem for the incompressible ideal MHD. The plasma magnetic field is tangential to the interface while the vacuum magnetic field vanishes. We shall prove the stability of the interface under the Taylor sign condition. By deriving the evolution equation of the interface in the Eulerian coordinates, we are able to identify different stability mechanisms which correspond to the hyperboliticity of this evolution equation. Once the optimal regularity of the interface is obtained, all the other quantities can be estimated in the Eulerian coordinates. Therefore, we do not need the change of coordinates or the use of the Alinhac&#39;s good unknowns.},

We mainly study the concentration phenomenon of the phytoplankton with large advection amplitude and small diffusion rate. Firstly, we study the threshold-type dynamics of the population by critical death rate ⁎ d ⁎ d⁎ . Secondly, we examine the concentration phenomenon with large advection amplitude and small diffusion in two cases: (i) the advection function h ( x ) h(x) changes sign only once from positive to negative in water column [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] . We find that the phytoplankton will concentrate at certain critical point with large advection amplitude and small diffusion; (ii) the advection function h ( x ) &lt; 0 h(x)&amp;lt;0 in [ 0 , κ ) [0,κ) with ∫ 0 x h ( s ) a ( s ) d s &lt; 0 ∫0xh(s)a(s)ds&amp;lt;0 for all x ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] x∈(0,1] , the phytoplankton will concentrate at the surface of water column with large advection amplitude and small diffusion.

  abstract     = {We prove an existence result for the interior Backus problem in the Euclidean ball . The problem consists in determining a harmonic function in the ball from the knowledge of the modulus of its gradient on the boundary. The problem is severely nonlinear. From a physical point of view, the problem can be interpreted as the determination of the velocity potential of an incompressible and irrotational fluid inside the ball from measurements of the velocity field&#39;s modulus on the boundary. The linearized problem is an irregular oblique derivative problem, for which a phenomenon of loss of derivatives occurs. As a consequence, a solution by linearization of the Backus problem becomes problematic. Here, we linearize the problem around the vertical height solution and show that the loss of derivatives does not occur for solutions which are either (vertically) axially symmetric or oddly symmetric in the vertical direction. A standard fixed point argument is then feasible, based on ad hoc weighted estimates in Hölder spaces.},

We propose an impulsive reaction-diffusion model with a shifting environment to describe the dynamics of species with distinct reproduction stage and dispersal stage. First, the impulsive reaction-diffusion model is reduced to a discrete-time recursive system defined by a discrete map. Next, with the aid of the appropriate test function and comparison principle, we obtain some sufficient conditions on the nonexistence and uniqueness of nontrivial fixed points of the discrete map. This, combined with the abstract theory of spatially non-translation dynamical systems , enables us to establish the existence of traveling wave solutions and the asymptotic propagation properties of the model.},

Under the hypothesis that each of these two limiting equations has both leftward and rightward spreading speeds, we establish the spreading properties of solutions and the existence of nontrivial forced waves for the original equation by appealing to the abstract theory of nonmonotone semiflows with asymptotic translation invariance.

For x ≤ 0 x≤0 the system is regular, while for x &gt; 0 the system is singularly perturbed. An essential difference with other papers is that a degenerate canard point appears which requires a blow-up analysis. We prove that under generic conditions the perturbed system has at most one small-amplitude limit cycle and at most N canard limit cycles, where N is the number of local extrema of the function F ( x ) F(x) in the singular part of the Liénard system. For critical values of the control parameters the mechanism of a canard explosion is discussed. As an application we prove that the upper bound for the number of limit cycles in a Gause predator-prey system with a general monotonic functional response function with cut-off is two times the number of maxima of the natural prey growth function after the cut-off.},

As an application, by utilizing the obtained results, the paper rigorously establishes that a polynomial Liénard system of degree n + 1 n+1 has at least n + [ n 4 ] n+[n4] limit cycles near the homoclinic loop with a nilpotent cusp of order one. This work not only updates and generalizes existing results, but also provides a rigorous application of the obtained findings in the context of limit cycle bifurcation.},

With a new scale ( y , t ) (y,t) and a Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the initial value problem , we derive different long time asymptotic expansions for the solutions of the CH equation in different space-time solitonic regions.

Fast decay region, y / t ∈ ( − ∞ , − 1 / 4 ) y/t∈(−∞,−1/4) with an error O ( t − 1 / 2 ) O(t−1/2) ; 2. Modulation-soliton region, y / t ∈ ( 2 , + ∞ ) y/t∈(2,+∞) , the result can be characterized with an modulation-solitons with residual error O ( t − 1 / 2 ) O(t−1/2) ; 3. Zakhrov-Manakov region, y / t ∈ ( 0 , 2 ) y/t∈(0,2) and y / t ∈ ( − 1 / 4 , 0 ) y/t∈(−1/4,0) . The asymptotic approximation is characterized by the dispersion term with residual error O ( t − 3 / 4 ) O(t−3/4) ; 4. Two transition regions, | y / t | ≈ 2 |y/t|≈2 and | y / t | ≈ − 1 / 4 |y/t|≈−1/4 , the asymptotic results are described by the solution of Painlevé II equation with error order O ( t − 1 / 2 ) O(t−1/2) .},

We explore how high-order nonlinearities affect the dispersive dynamics and breakdown mechanism of solutions. Firstly, we established the local well-posedness for the Cauchy problem in the framework of Besov spaces . Then, we derive the precise blow-up mechanism for strong solutions by means of the transport equation theory. Finally, a sufficient condition on initial data that leads to the finite time blow-up of the second-order derivative of the solutions is described in detail.},

Two types of bifurcations are considered: bifurcations in the class of Stokes waves (Stokes bifurcation) and bifurcations in a class of periodic waves with the period M times the period of the Stokes wave ( M -subharmonic bifurcation). If we consider the first Stokes bifurcation point then there are no M -subharmonic bifurcations before this point and there exists M -subharmonic bifurcation points after the first Stokes bifurcation for sufficiently large M , which approach the Stokes bifurcation point when M → ∞ M→∞ . Moreover the set of M -subharmonic bifurcating solutions is a closed connected continuum. We give also a more detailed description of this connected set in terms of the set of its limit points, which must contain extreme waves, or overhanging waves, or solitary waves or waves with stagnation on the bottom, or Stokes bifurcation points different from the initial one.},

  abstract     = {We show that there exist traveling wave solutions of the Keller-Segel-FKPP equation, which models a diffusing and logistically growing population subject to chemotaxis. In contrast to previous results, our result is in the strong aggregation regime; that is, we make no smallness assumption on the parameters. The lack of a smallness condition makes L ∞ L∞ -estimates difficult to obtain as the comparison principle no longer gives them “for free.” Instead, our proof is based on suitable energy estimates in a carefully tailored uniformly local L p Lp -space. Interestingly, our uniformly local space involves a scaling parameter, the choice of which is a crux of the argument. Numerical experiments exploring the stability, qualitative properties, and speeds of these waves are presented as well.},

It is notable that, whenever α = 0 , this system reduces to the minimal Keller-Segel model; the persistent Dirac-type singularities are known to occur at least in radial parabolic-elliptic setting. In this work, our first result shows that for any χ &gt; 0 , if either α ≥ 1 4 , or α ∈ ( 0 , 1 4 ) and ‖ u 0 ‖ L 1 is small appropriately, then the corresponding initial-boundary value problem possesses a global generalized solution ( u , v ) with the property that u belongs to L 1 ( Ω × ( 0 , T ) ) for any T &gt; 0 , which further implies that the general sensitivities 1 v α , with α ≥ 1 4 , can rule out the emergence of Dirac-type singularities. Our second result indicates that, if α ∈ ( 0 , 1 2 ) and ‖ u 0 ‖ L 1 is small properly, then such global generalized solution becomes bounded and smooth at least eventually, and approaches the spatial equilibria in the large time limit.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the transonic shock solutions in divergent nozzles as the expanding angle goes to zero. It is well-known that there exist infinite shock solutions for steady 1-D flows in a flat nozzle with the position of the shock front being arbitrary, while there exists a unique shock solution in an divergent nozzle as the pressure at the exit is given within an appropriate interval. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the shock solutions as the expanding goes to zero, we are also trying to figure out a criterion which may be used to select the physical one among all shock solutions in the flat nozzle. It finally turns out that the limit shock solution as the expanding angle goes to zero strongly depends on the asymptotic behavior of the receiver pressure, which is assumed to be a function of the expanding angle, imposed at the exit. In particular, as the Mach number of the flow at the entrance is larger than γ + 3 2 γ+32 , the function of the receiver pressure can be set identical to the value of the pressure behind the shock front for the flat nozzle. Then the limit shock solution may be considered as the physical one for the flat nozzle, and the limit position of the shock front being the admissible position of the shock front. To show these results, one of the key steps is to establish quantitative estimates for the position of the shock front for the given pressure at the exit. To this end, a free boundary problem for the linearized Euler system will be proposed which gives an approximation of the shock solution, then a nonlinear iteration scheme could be carried out to approach the shock solution. Moreover, the error estimates between the exact shock solution and the approximation are also established, which give quantitative information on the position of the shock front.},

Due to the difficulty in calculating the Lyapunov constants of switching polynomial systems at non-elementary singular points , it is extremely difficult to use the existing Poincaré-Lyapunov method to study these two problems. In this paper, we develop a higher-order Poincaré-Lyapunov method to consider the nilpotent center problem in switching polynomial systems, with particular attention focused on cubic switching Liénard systems. With proper perturbations, explicit center conditions are derived for switching Liénard systems at a nilpotent center. Moreover, with Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation theory , the existence of five limit cycles around the nilpotent center is proved for a class of switching Liénard systems, which is a new lower bound of cyclicity for such polynomial systems around a nilpotent center.},

Note that when the ion-acoustic plasma is hot, the Euler-Poisson system is Friedrich symmetrizable, and the linear term can provide a derivative to compensate the loss of derivative induced by quadratic terms after diagonalizing the linearized system . When the ion-acoustic plasma is cold, as considered in the present paper, the situation is very different from that in the previous paper. The Euler-Poisson system becomes a pressureless system, so the linear operator has no regularity, and the quadratic terms still lose a derivative in the diagonalized system. This fact makes it more difficult to prove the NLS approximation of Euler-Poisson system for a cold ion-acoustic plasma. In this paper, we take advantage of the special structure of the pressureless Euler-Poisson system and the normal-form transformation to deal with the difficulties caused by resonances, especially the difficulties caused by derivative loss, in order to prove the NLS approximation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the fully nonlinear wave equations on the product space R 3 × T R3×T with quadratic nonlinearities and on R 2 × T R2×T with cubic nonlinearities, respectively. It is shown that for the small initial data satisfying some space-decay rates at infinity, these nonlinear equations admit global smooth solutions when the corresponding partial null conditions hold and while have almost global smooth solutions when the partial null conditions are violated. Our proof relies on the Fourier mode decomposition of the solutions with respect to the periodic direction, the efficient combinations of time-decay estimates for the solutions to the linear wave equations and the linear Klein-Gordon equations, and the global weighted energy estimates. In addition, an interesting auxiliary energy is introduced. As a byproduct, our results can be applied to the 4D irrotational compressible Euler equations of polytropic gases or Chaplygin gases on R 3 × T R3×T , the 3D relativistic membrane equation and the 3D nonlinear membrane equation on R 2 × T R2×T .},

Combining the uniform persistence idea from dynamical systems with the properties of the corresponding entire solutions, we investigate the propagation phenomena in two different cases: (1) fast susceptible vector; (2) slow susceptible vector when the disease spreads. It turns out that in the former case, the susceptible vector may spread faster than the infected vector and host under appropriate conditions, which leads to multi-front spreading with different speeds; while in the latter case, the infected vector and host always catch up with the susceptible vector, and they spread at the same speed. We further obtain the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions connecting zero to the endemic equilibrium . We also conduct numerical simulations to illustrate our analytic results.},

This problem is originated from the transonic channel multiphase flows, which are one kind of the most important problems in mathematical fluid dynamics. In order to overcome the difficulties caused by the parabolic degeneracy near sonic and the multivariable dependence of pressure, we adopt the mixed variables of the pressure and angle functions and derive the characteristic decompositions of these quantities. In terms of the angle coordinate system, the multiphase flow equations can be transformed into a new degenerate hyperbolic system with an explicit singularity-regularity structure. We verify the convergence of the iterative sequence generated by the new system and then return the solution to the original physical variables .

These arguments are applied at a number of non-perturbative parameter and energy values in the spatial equilateral circular restricted four-body problem: a six dimensional vector field. The idea is to formulate the desired connecting orbits as solutions of certain two point boundary value problems for orbit segments which originate and terminate on the local stable/unstable manifolds attached to a periodic orbit. These boundary value problems are studied via a Newton-Kantorovich argument in an appropriate Cartesian product of Banach algebras of rapidly decaying sequences of Chebyshev coefficients. Perhaps the most delicate part of the problem is controlling the boundary conditions, which must lie on the local stable/unstable manifolds of the periodic orbit. For this portion of the problem we use a parameterization method to develop Fourier-Taylor approximations equipped with mathematically rigorous a-posteriori error bounds. This requires validated computation of a finite number of Fourier-Taylor coefficients via Newton-Kantorovich arguments in appropriate Cartesian product of rapidly decaying sequences of Fourier coefficients, followed by a fixed point argument to bound the tail terms of the Taylor expansion. After some geometric considerations in the energy manifold, transversality of the connection follows as a direct consequence of the Newton-Kantorovich argument.},

This provides a comprehensive explanation of the point-wise extinction dynamics of these two competing species under such a time-periodic worsening habitat. Then, we establish the spreading properties of the associated Cauchy problem depending on the range of the shifting speed. More specifically, we give a complete description on the threshold values for the extinction as well as persistence (by moving with asymptotic speed). Our results reveal the possibility that a competitively weaker species with a much faster spreading speed can drive a competitively stronger species with a slower spreading speed to extinction. The discussion in this paper applies to both cases of weak competition and strong-weak competition. In particular, we need to point out that some combined effects of nonlocal dispersal, two-variable coupling and time-periodic shifting heterogeneity in this system pose extra difficulties in mathematical treatment, which are dealt with by introducing new approaches.},

  abstract     = {Releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to invade the wild mosquito population is a method of mosquito control. In this paper, a stochastic mosquito population model with Wolbachia invasion perturbed by environmental fluctuation is studied. Firstly, the well-posedness, positivity, and Markov-Feller property of the solution for this model are proved. Then a group of sharp threshold-type conditions is provided to characterize the long-term behavior of the model, which pinpoints the almost necessary and sufficient conditions for the persistence and extinction of Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquito populations. Our results indicate that even for a low initial Wolbachia infection frequency, a successful Wolbachia invasion into the wild mosquito population can be driven by stochastic environmental fluctuations. Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to support our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The Camassa-Holm equation is a shallow water model possessing solutions breaking in finite time , whereas from a geometric viewpoint, its smooth solutions determine pseudospherical surfaces. Despite having been known for a long time, these two different aspects have never been considered conjunctively. As a result, it is not know if a solution developing breaking wave can also determine a pseudospherical surface nor, that being so, whether or how the singularities of the solutions can be, or even are always, inherited by the corresponding first fundamental form . We prove that certain solutions, with enough regularity and developing breaking wave, determine a pseudospherical surface defined on a strip of finite height whose corresponding metric tensor blows up near the strip&#39;s boundary. To this end, we introduce the notion of pseudospherical surface modelled by a function space and reformulate the notion of generic solution of an equation describing pseudospherical surfaces. These two new viewpoints enable us to proceed with a geometric analysis study of the surfaces determined by solutions of Cauchy problems involving the Camassa-Holm equation.},

Next, we analyze the minimization of λ ± λ± with respect to the sign-changing weight, showing that the optimal eigenvalues Λ ± Λ± are equal if the domain has a center of symmetry and the optimal weights are of bang-bang type, namely piece-wise constant functions, each one taking only two values. As a consequence, the problem is equivalent to the minimization with respect to the subsets of Ω satisfying a volume constraint. Then, we completely solve the optimization problem in one dimension , in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann conditions , showing new phenomena induced by the presence of the anisotropic diffusion. The optimization problem for λ + λ+ naturally arises in the study of the optimal spatial arrangement of resources for a species to survive in an heterogeneous habitat.},

The parameters are all positive constants and the initial data ( u 10 , u 20 , v 1 0 , v 2 0 ) (u10,u20,v10,v20) are non negative. With some supplementary conditions imposed on the parameters, it is proved that the above system has a unique globally bounded classical solution for n ≥ 2 n≥2 . Moreover, the convergence of the solution is asserted by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional. If e 2 e2 , χ 2 χ2 and ξ 2 ξ2 are sufficiently small, then the solution of the above system converges to a unique positive equilibrium. If e 2 e2 is sufficiently large and χ 2 χ2 is sufficiently small, then the solution converges to the semi-trivial equilibrium point. Remarkably, the convergence rate is exponential when e 2 ≠ σ 2 a 1 σ 1 e2≠σ2a1σ1 and algebraic if e 2 = σ 2 a 1 σ 1 e2=σ2a1σ1 . Finally, the numerical examples validate the outcomes of asymptotic behavior . The results demonstrate the predominant behavior of the parameters a 1 a1 and a 2 a2 in the existence and stability.}}},

Regularity results for the control-to-state operator, the cost functional and the adjoint state are also proved. We show the existence of optimal solutions and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions . In addition, second-order necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are established.},

Namely, we consider solutions to − L u = f ( u ) −Lu=f(u) , where L is a linear uniformly elliptic operator and f is C 1 C1 , such that the linearized equation − L − f ′ ( u ) −L−f′(u) has nonnegative principal eigenvalue . Our main result is an estimate for the L 2 + γ L2+γ norm of the gradient of stable solutions vanishing on the flat part of a half-ball, for any nonnegative and nondecreasing f . This bound only requires the elliptic coefficients to be Lipschitz. As a consequence, our estimate continues to hold in general C 1 , 1 C1,1 domains if we further assume the nonlinearity f to be convex. This result is new even for the Laplacian, for which a C 3 C3 regularity assumption on the domain was needed.},

It is proved that the initial-boundary problem is globally solvable in a generalized sense for any appropriately regular initial data, and that the generalized solutions thereof emanating from suitably small initial data will become smooth from a finite waiting time and exponentially approach ( 1 | Ω | ∫ Ω ( n 0 + c 0 ) , 0 , 0 ) as t → ∞ . As compared to a precedent result obtained without cell proliferation, the complexity caused by + n c in the first equation requires some conditions on the initial data c 0 rather only on n 0 in order to derive the large time behavior of the solutions thereof, which seems comprehensible because of the necessity for offsetting the possibly increasing trend of cell by + n c .}},

  abstract     = {This article is about the question of the persistence of regularity for the solution to hyperbolic boundary value problem in the quarter-space. More precisely we will both consider the pure boundary value problem and the initial boundary value problem and we propose a functional space, based upon the high order Sobolev space in which a control of the data of the problem leads to a control of the solution (in the same space). The space proposed here contains the tangential Sobolev space. The analysis borrows some ideas of the study of characteristic boundary value problems in the half-space for which the good derivative to consider is known to be the tangential derivatives x 1 ∂ 1 x1∂1 instead of the normal derivative ∂ 1 ∂1 . For quarter-space problems the good quantity to consider will be the radial derivative x 1 ∂ 1 + x 2 ∂ 2 x1∂1+x2∂2 and then we recover the control of tangential derivatives x 1 ∂ 1 x1∂1 and x 2 ∂ 2 x2∂2 using explicit formulas in polar coordinates. The regularity of the solution is then established intrinsically by adapting the method introduced by the author to deal with half-space problems without using regularization methods.},
