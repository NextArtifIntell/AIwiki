  abstract     = {We develop and analyze a temporally continuous spatially lumped resource budget model to explain the dynamics of synchronized biennial-bearing olives in the Levant, specifically focusing on Syria, the region’s foremost olive-producing country. The model is a time-continuous counterpart of the celebrated resource budget model. It consists of a Duffing oscillator coupled with a dynamical model of pollination with an external force propelling olive growth by photosynthesis. The reference data are obtained from statistical databases of international organizations and our own observation systems in Jordan, a country neighboring Syria, providing a wealth of information to refine the model structure. An intensive review of Syria’s modern history involving significant shifts in agricultural policy and social stability leads to a conclusion that the model should comprehend the anomaly of olive yield interacting with socio-political factors as an autonomous behavior. The conventional mathematical methodology analyzes the model’s characteristics, such as solutions’ non-negativity, boundedness, and stability. The system is stable during pollination off-season but may become unstable and unbounded during pollination on-season, which is a property that the time-discrete resource budget model cannot reproduce. A significant finding is that coupling individual fruit trees by anemophily is not essential in synchronization, overturning earlier studies in the literature. The values of model parameters that best fit the historical data of olive yield in Syria result in bounded chaos. With alternative parameter values, the model could exhibit periodic oscillation, instability, or blowing up, as clearly shown in bifurcation diagrams.},

  abstract     = {Growth-elasticity (also known as morphoelasticity) is a powerful model framework for understanding complex shape development in soft biological tissues. At each instant, by mapping how continuum building blocks have grown geometrically and how they respond elastically to the push-and-pull from their neighbors, the shape of the growing structure is determined from a state of mechanical equilibrium. As mechanical loads continue to be added to the system through growth, many interesting shapes, such as smooth wavy wrinkles, sharp creases, and deep folds, can form on the tissue surface from a relatively flatter geometry. Previous numerical simulations of growth-elasticity have reproduced many interesting shapes resembling those observed in reality, such as the foldings on mammalian brains and guts. In the case of mammalian guts, it has been shown that wavy wrinkles, deep folds, and sharp creases on the interior organ surface can be simulated even under a simple assumption of isotropic uniform growth in the interior layer of the organ. Interestingly, the simulated patterns are all regular along the tube’s circumference, with either all smooth or all sharp indentations, whereas some undulation patterns in reality exhibit irregular patterns and a mixture of sharp creases and smooth indentations along the circumference. Can we simulate irregular indentation patterns without further complicating the growth patterning? In this paper, we have discovered abundant shape solutions with irregular indentation patterns by developing a Rayleigh–Ritz finite-element method (FEM). In contrast to previous Galerkin FEMs, which solve the weak formulation of the mechanical-equilibrium equations, the new method formulates an optimization problem for the discretized energy functional, whose critical points are equivalent to solutions obtained by solving the mechanical-equilibrium equations. This new method is more robust than previous methods. Specifically, it does not require the initial guess to be near a solution to achieve convergence, and it allows control over the direction of numerical iterates across the energy landscape. This approach enables the capture of more solutions that cannot be easily reached by previous methods. In addition to the previously found regular smooth and non-smooth configurations, we have identified a new transitional irregular smooth shape, new shapes with a mixture of smooth and non-smooth surface indentations, and a variety of irregular patterns with different numbers of creases. Our numerical results demonstrate that growth-elasticity modeling can match more shape patterns observed in reality than previously thought.},

A mathematical model relating the repressive response to collective action, articulated through differential equations, facilitates a thorough analysis of their dynamic interaction. Modelling outcomes indicate that repressive regimes may exhibit sustained persistence, oscillatory patterns, or destabilization, potentially transitioning into alternative regimes. This modelling framework offers a means to discern the impact of diverse factors on the dynamics of repressive regimes and to provide modelling insight on the emergence of cycles of protest observed in different countries during certain periods of their history.},

  abstract     = {A large enough sample size of patients is required to statistically show that one treatment is better than another. However, too large a sample size is expensive and can also result in findings that are statistically significant, but not clinically relevant. How sample sizes should be chosen is a well-studied problem in classical statistics and analytical expressions can be derived from the appropriate test statistic. However, these expressions require information regarding the efficacy of the treatment, which may not be available, particularly for newly developed drugs. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) models are frequently used to quantify the efficacy of newly developed anticancer drugs. In these models, the tumor growth dynamics are commonly described by a set of ordinary differential equations containing parameters that must be estimated using experimental data. One widely used endpoint in clinical trials is the proportion of patients in different response categories determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) framework. From the TGI model, we derive analytical expressions for the probability of patient response to combination therapy. The probabilistic expressions are used together with classical statistics to derive a parametric model for the sample size required to achieve a certain significance level and test power when comparing two treatments. Furthermore, the probabilistic expressions are used to generalize the Tumor Static Exposure concept to be more suitable for predicting clinical response. The derivatives of the probabilistic expressions are used to derive two additional expressions characterizing the exposure and its sensitivity. Finally, our results are illustrated using parameters obtained from calibrating the model to preclinical data.},

Denervation experiments have shown that different types of axons can exert either pro- or anti-tumor effects, but conflicting results exist in the literature, leaving the overall influence of the nervous system on PDAC incompletely understood. To address this gap, we propose a continuous mathematical model of nerve-tumor interactions that allows in silico simulation of denervation at different phases of tumor development. This model takes into account the pro- or anti-tumor properties of different types of axons (sympathetic or sensory) and their distinct remodeling dynamics during PDAC development. We observe a “shift effect” where an initial pro-tumor effect of sympathetic axon denervation is later outweighed by the anti-tumor effect of sensory axon denervation, leading to a transition from an overall protective to a deleterious role of the nervous system on PDAC tumorigenesis. Our model also highlights the importance of the impact of sympathetic axon remodeling dynamics on tumor progression. These findings may guide strategies targeting the nervous system to improve PDAC treatment.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a mechanobiochemical model for two-dimensional cell migration which couples mechanical properties of the cell cytosol with biochemical processes taking place near or on the cell plasma membrane. The modelling approach is based on a recently developed mathematical formalism of evolving bulk-surface partial differential equations of reaction–diffusion type. We solve these equations using finite element methods within a moving-mesh framework derived from the weak formulation of the evolving bulk-surface PDEs. In the present work, the cell cytosol interior (bulk) dynamics are coupled to the cell membrane (surface) dynamics through non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The modelling approach exhibits both directed cell migration in response to chemical cues as well as spontaneous migration in the absence of such cues. As a by-product, the approach shows fundamental characteristics associated with single cell migration such as: (i) cytosolic and membrane polarisation, (ii) actin dependent protrusions, and (iii) continuous shape deformation of the cell during migration. Cell migration is an ubiquitous process in life that is mainly triggered by the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and therefore is driven by both mechanical and biochemical processes. It is a multistep process essential for mammalian organisms and is closely linked to a vast diversity of processes; from embryonic development to cancer invasion. Experimental, theoretical and computational studies have been key to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell migration. On one hand, rapid advances in experimental techniques allow for detailed experimental measurements of cell migration pathways, while, on the other, computational approaches allow for the modelling, analysis and understanding of such observations. The bulk-surface mechanobiochemical modelling approach presented in this work, set premises to study single cell migration through complex non-isotropic environments in two- and three-space dimensions.},

Actually, the exponentially distributed assumption on the description of disease stages is hard to accurately approximate the interplay of drug concentration and viral load within host. In this article, we formulate an immuno-epidemiological epidemic model on complex networks, which is composed of ordinary differential equations and integral equations. The linkage of within- and between-host is connected by setting that the death caused by the disease is an increasing function in viral load within host. Mathematical analysis of the model includes the existence of the solution to the epidemiological model on complex networks, the existence and stability of equilibrium, which are completely determined by the basic reproduction number of the between-host system. Numerical analysis are shown that the non-exponentially distributions and the topology of networks have significant roles in the prediction of epidemic patterns.},

During R-loop formation an RNA strand invades the DNA duplex, displacing the homologous DNA strand and binding the complementary DNA strand. Here we analyze a model for transcription-dependent R-loop formation at double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). In this model, R-loop formation is preceded by detachment of the non-template DNA strand from the RNA polymerase (RNAP). Then, strand exchange is initiated between the nascent RNA and the non-template DNA strand. During that strand exchange the length of the R-loop could either increase, or decrease in a biased random-walk fashion, in which the bias would depend upon the DNA sequence. Eventually, the restoration of the DNA duplex would completely displace the RNA. However, as long as the RNAP remains bound to the template DNA strand it prevents that displacement. Thus, according to the model, RNAPs stalled at DSBs can increase the lifespan of R-loops, increasing their detectability in experiments, and perhaps enhancing their biological effects.},

In this study, we employed Bayesian statistics to improve the utility and flexibility of image-based parameter inference. Tests on synthetic data confirmed that both our non-hierarchical and hierarchical Bayesian models provide accurate estimates of model parameters. By applying this method to Drosophila wings, we demonstrated that the reliability of parameter estimation is closely linked to the mechanical anisotropies present in the tissue. Moreover, we revealed that the cortical elasticity term is dispensable for explaining force-shape correlations in vivo . We anticipate that the flexibility of the Bayesian statistical framework will facilitate the integration of various types of information, thereby contributing to the quantitative dissection of the mechanical control of tissue dynamics.},

  abstract     = {SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic and is now an endemic virus that will require continued antiviral and vaccine development. A possible new treatment modality was recently suggested that would use vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) modified to express the ACE2 receptor. Since the modified VSV expresses the cell surface receptor that is used by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the thought is that SARS-CoV-2 virions would bind to the modified VSV and thus be neutralized. Additionally, since SARS-CoV-2 infected cells also express the spike protein, the modified VSV could potentially infect these cells, allowing for its own replication, but also potentially interfering with replication of SARS-CoV-2. This idea has not yet been tested experimentally, but we can investigate the feasibility of this possible treatment theoretically. In this manuscript, we develop a mathematical model of this suggested treatment and explore conditions under which it might be effective. We find that treatment with modified VSV does little to change the SARS-CoV-2 time course except when the treatment is applied at the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 infection at very high doses. In this case, VSV reduces the peak SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but lengthens the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, we find that modified VSV treatment is unlikely to be effective largely because it does not prevent infection of cells by SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract     = {Although demographic studies have failed to find evidence of aging in certain animal species, classic evolutionary theories of aging struggle to explain how evolution could favor agelessness in such cases. Here, we develop mathematical models of the disposable soma theory to identify conditions in which agelessness would be evolutionarily favored. For any given type of damage that could accumulate and cause age-accelerating mortality risk, we find that evolution could select for its complete removal if the mortality risk it poses is severe enough and its repair does not pose too large of a penalty to reproduction. Environmental factors such as extrinsic mortality and the form of population density-dependent regulation also play a large role in determining the optimal rate of aging and whether agelessness should be evolutionarily favored. However, in a system with multiple sources of damage and multiple independent repair processes, avoiding aging is rarely evolutionarily favorable. Pleiotropic repair processes, such as those that could be present in asexual fissioning organisms, make agelessness more likely but do not guarantee it. Our results indicate that agelessness could be favored by evolution in narrow contexts but that multiple types of damage and repair make agelessness unlikely to arise in sufficiently complex organisms.},

These equations are coupled with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of drug administration and distribution, implementing a realistic delivery schedule. The model is carefully calibrated from the literature, focusing on BRAF-mutated melanoma treated with Dabrafenib as a case study. By means of long-time asymptotic and global sensitivity analyses, as well as numerical simulations, we explore the impact of cell migration from the primary to the metastatic site, physiological aspects of the tumour tissues and drug dose on the development of chemoresistance and treatment efficacy. Our findings provide a possible explanation for empirical evidence indicating that chemotherapy may foster metastatic spread and that metastases may be less impacted by the chemotherapeutic agent.},

Here, we present a spatial population model where the attachment and detachment processes of bacterial cells depend on local density of particle-associated bacteria. We show that the power-law relationship can emerge when the non-random aggregated distribution of bacteria is considered without any depth-specific environmental parameters. Furthermore, the comparison between model behavior and empirical patterns in the Pacific and Southern Ocean indicated that temperature-dependent hydrolysis rate and nutrient-dependent sinking rate of particles are key parameters to explain the regional variations of the power-law exponent. The mechanistic approach developed here provides a pathway to link micro-scale interactions between individuals to macro-scale food chain structures and carbon cycle.},

While competition drives individuals to compete for limited resources, cooperation can emerge as a strategic response, mitigating risk and enhancing collective payoff. To bridge theoretical game approaches such as payoff, cooperation, and defections in ecological systems, we propose a two-species predator–prey model inspired by the principles and variations of the prisoner’s dilemma game. We comprehensively address and analytically verify all stable strategic states, exploring the role of payoff parameters both individually and collectively. Additionally, we investigate the effect of free space. Beyond ecological contexts, we present a model of rumor propagation within a social system to establish connections with the prisoner’s dilemma game. In both systems, our primary focus is to discuss strategies and enhance the cooperative factor within the system, given its crucial importance across diverse environments.},

We take the complex ER network structure into account and propose a positive-feedback mechanism among myosin-like motors, actin alignment, ER network dynamics for the emergence of ER flow.

  abstract     = {Although microorganisms often live in dynamic environments, most studies, both experimental and theoretical, are carried out under static conditions. In this work, we investigate the issue of optimal resource allocation in bacteria growing in periodic environments. We consider a dynamic model describing the microbial metabolism under varying conditions, involving a control variable quantifying the protein precursors allocation. Our objective is to determine the optimal strategies maximizing the long-term growth of cells under a piecewise-constant periodic environment. Firstly, we perform a theoretical analysis of the resulting optimal control problem (OCP), based on the application the Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP). We determine that the structure of the optimal control must be bang–bang, with possibly some singular arcs corresponding to optimal equilibria of the system. If the control presents singular arcs, then these can only be reached and left through chattering arcs. We also use a direct optimization method, implemented in the BOCOP software, to solve the studied OCP. Our study reveals that the optimal solution over a large time horizon is related to the one over a single period of the varying environment with periodic constraints. Moreover, we observe that the maximal average growth rate attainable under periodic conditions can be higher than the one under a constant environment. We further extend our analysis to conduct a qualitative comparison between the predictions from our model and some recent biological experiments on E. coli . This analysis particularly highlights the mechanisms of action of the ppGpp signaling molecule, thus providing relevant explanations of the experimental observations. In conclusion, our study corroborates previous research indicating that this molecule plays a crucial role in the regulation of resource allocation of protein precursors in E. coli .},

Environmental feedbacks that provide information about resource availability play a crucial role in encouraging cooperation. Previous work indicates that the impact of resource heterogeneity on cooperation depends on the incentive to act in self-interest presented by a situation, demonstrating its potential to both hinder and facilitate cooperation. However, little is known about the underlying evolutionary drivers behind this phenomenon. Leveraging agent-based modeling and game theory, we explore how differences in resource availability across environments influence the evolution of cooperation. Our results show that resource variation hinders cooperation when resources are slowly replenished but supports cooperation when resources are more readily available. Furthermore, simulations in different scenarios suggest that discerning the rate of natural selection acts on strategies under distinct evolutionary dynamics is instrumental in elucidating the intricate nexus between resource variability and cooperation. When evolutionary forces are strong, resource heterogeneity tends to work against cooperation, yet relaxed selection conditions enable it to facilitate cooperation. Inspired by these findings, we also propose a potential application in improving the performance of artificial intelligence systems through policy optimization in multi-agent reinforcement learning. These explorations promise a novel perspective in understanding the evolution of social organisms and the impact of different interactions on the function of natural systems.},

However, when used in conjunction with a CC-chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) antagonist, anti-PD-1 has shown efficacy in preclinical studies. In this paper, we aim to optimize treatment regimens for this combination immunotherapy using optimal control theory. We extend a treatment-free glioblastoma-immune dynamics ODE model to include interventions with anti-PD-1 and the CCR2 antagonist. An optimized regimen increases the survival of an average mouse from 32 days post-tumor implantation without treatment to 111 days with treatment. We scale this approach to a virtual murine cohort to evaluate mortality and quality of life concerns during treatment, and predict survival, tumor recurrence, or death after treatment. A parameter identifiability analysis identifies five parameters suitable for personalizing treatment within the virtual cohort. Sampling from these five practically identifiable parameters for the virtual murine cohort reveals that personalized, optimized regimens enhance survival: 84% of the virtual mice survive to day 100, compared to 60% survival in a previously studied experimental regimen. Subjects with high tumor growth rates and low T cell kill rates are identified as more likely to die during and after treatment due to their compromised immune systems and more aggressive tumors. Notably, the MDSC death rate emerges as a long-term predictor of either disease-free survival or death.},

We developed a trait-based network model to assess the impact of network topology on disease transmission, measured as community- and species-level disease prevalence. We found that trait-based feeding interactions between host species determine the frequency distribution of the niche of co-occurring species in steady-state communities, being either bimodal or multimodal. The width of the growth kernel influences the degree-biomass relationship of species, being either weakly positive or strongly negative. When this relationship is weakly positive, species-level disease prevalence is primarily correlated with biomass. However, when the degree-biomass relationship is strongly negative, species-level disease prevalence is determined by the difference between a host species’ in-degree and out-degree closeness centrality. At the community level, disease prevalence is generally amplified by increasing host richness, community biomass, and the standard deviation of interaction generality, while it is diluted by higher network connectance. Our framework verifies the amplification effects of host richness during invasion-driven community assembly and offers valuable insights for estimating disease prevalence based on host network topology.},

Empirical research has demonstrated that a diverse set of strategies are used in order to acquire a fear response across animals. Animals often use a mixed strategy: fear is acquired both innately and through learning. Despite the ubiquity of the fear response, and its established importance for shaping predator–prey interactions, little is known about why different fear acquisition strategies evolve or why mixed strategies appear common. Here, we model the evolution of fear acquisition (learning versus innate) under predation. We assume a tradeoff where individuals that learn fear are at higher risk from predators initially, but eventually obtain a lower risk as they survive predation attempts. We find that frequent predator encounters, predators that are not very dangerous, and effective learning favor the evolution of learned fear. Only pure strategies of fear acquisition evolve unless individuals suffer from either a cost to fear or, especially, a cost to learning, either of which can lead to the evolution of mixed strategies. Our results thus shed light onto the evolution of mixed fear acquisition strategies and open the door to further research on the evolution of fear acquisition.},

Here, we explore how climate warming interacts with pharmaceutical-induced boldness change to affect aquatic ecosystems, built on an empirically well-informed food-chain model, consisting of a size-structured fish consumer, a zooplankton prey, and a fish predator. Climate warming is characterized by both daily mean temperature (DMT) and diurnal temperature range (DTR) in our model. Results show that DMT and high levels of species’ boldness are the primary drivers of community instability. However, their interactive effects can lead to diverse outcomes: from predator collapse to coexistence with seasonality-driven cycles and coexistence with population interaction-driven cycles. The interactive effects are significantly modulated by daily temperature variability, where moderate DTR counteracts the destabilizing interactive effects by increasing consumer reproduction, while large temperature variability considerably reduces consumer biomass , destabilizing the community at high mean temperatures. Our analyses disentangle the respective roles of DMT, DTR and boldness in mediating the response of aquatic ecosystems to the impacts from pharmaceutical contaminants in the context of climate warming. The interactive effects of the environmental stressors reported here underscore the pressing need for studies aimed at quantifying the cumulative impacts of multiple environmental stressors on aquatic ecosystems.},

Much of the previous research has focused on the behaviour and stability of equilibria for the replicator dynamics. Here we focus on the underlying reputational dynamics that occur on a fast time scale. We describe reputational dynamics as systems of differential equations and conduct stability analyses on their equilibria. We prove that reputations converge to a unique equilibrium under a solitary observer model for each of the five standard norms and whether assessments are public or private.

The need for these drastic measures stems from the analysis of a group selection model of temporarily formed random groups introduced by Hamilton nearly fifty years ago to describe the fate of altruistic behavior in a population. Challenging conventional wisdom, we show analytically here that strong altruism evolves in Hamilton’s original model in the case of biparental sexual reproduction. Moreover, when the cost of cooperation is small and the amplified contribution shared by group members is large, cooperation is the only stable strategy in equilibrium. Thus, our results provide a solution to the ‘problem of origination’ of strong altruism, i.e. how cooperation can take off from an initial low frequency of cooperators. We discuss a possible reassessment of cooperation in cases of viral co-infection, as cooperation may even be favored in situations where the prisoner’s dilemma applies.},

Such models exhibit multistability of PTWs, typically visualised through the Busse balloon, and parameter changes typically lead to a cascade of wavelength changes through the Busse balloon. In the past, the stability boundaries of the Busse balloon have been used to predict such wavelength changes. Here, motivated by anecdotal evidence from previous work, we provide compelling evidence that the Busse balloon provides insufficient information to predict wavelength changes due to a delayed loss of stability phenomenon. Using two different reaction–advection–diffusion systems, we relate the delay that occurs between the crossing of a stability boundary in the Busse balloon and the occurrence of a wavelength change to features of the essential spectrum of the destabilised PTW. This leads to a predictive framework that can estimate the order of magnitude of such a time delay, which provides a novel “early warning sign” for pattern destabilisation. We illustrate the implementation of the predictive framework to predict under what conditions a wavelength change of a PTW occurs.},

  abstract     = {As one of methods for in vitro selection, a flow reactor type washing/selection system seems to be effective, where a ligand library is composed of “genotype–phenotype linking molecules”. In this system, high affinity ligands are selected by their respective “residual ratio” given by exp ( − k off × t ) , where k off is the dissociation rate constant and t is the washing time. In this paper, we mathematically considered the following possibility. When the washing/selection dynamics obeys the residual ratio exp ( − k off × t ) deterministically and mole fraction measurement for sampled sequences by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is performed ideally, the “relative value” of k off for each of high-ranking sequences can be estimated simultaneously. In addition to these, when the residual ratio for the whole ligand population is measured correctly, the “absolute value” for each sequence can be estimated. We deduced formulas to present the relative and absolute estimates, and mathematically analyzed the effect of fluctuations in the number of NGS reads on the estimates in details. These were confirmed by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Of Chargaff’s four rules on DNA base quantity, his second parity rule (PR-2) is the most contentious. Various biometricians (e.g., Sueoka, Lobry) regarded PR-2 compliance as a non-adaptive feature of modern genomes that could be modeled through interrelations among mutation rates. However, PR-2 compliance with stem-loop potential was considered adaptively relevant by biochemists familiar with analyses of nucleic acid structure (e.g., of Crick) and of meiotic recombination (e.g., of Kleckner). Meanwhile, other biometricians had shown that PR-2 complementarity extended beyond individual bases (1-mers) to oligonucleotides (k-mers), possibly reflecting “advantageous DNA structure” (Nussinov). An “introns early” hypothesis (Reanney, Forsdyke) had suggested a primordial nucleic acid world with recombination-mediated error-correction requiring genome-wide stem-loop potential to have evolved prior to localized intrusions of protein-encoding potential (exons). Thus, a primordial genome was equivalent to one long intron. Indeed, when assessed as the base order-dependent component (correcting for local influences of GC%), modern genes, especially when evolving rapidly under positive Darwinian selection, display high intronic stem-loop potential. This suggests forced migration from neighboring exons by competing protein-encoding potential. PR-2 compliance may have first arisen non-adaptively. Primary prototypic structures were later strengthened by their adaptive contribution to recombination. Thus, contentious views may actually be in harmony.},

All previous numerical and theoretical findings determined that the possible response scenarios of the overall population size to increasing dispersal are monotonic or hump-shaped, which has become a common assumption in ecology. Against this, we show in this paper that many other response scenarios are possible by using a simple two-patch discrete-time model. This fact evidences the interplay of local dynamics and dispersal and has significant consequences from a management perspective that will be discussed.},

Agents are started at random locations and orientations in the landscape and allowed to move until they reach the source of the odor (success) or leave the imaged area (failure). Parameters for the algorithm are chosen to optimize success and to minimize path length to the source. Success rates over 90% are consistently obtained with path lengths that can be as low as twice the starting distance from the source in air and four times the distance in the highly turbulent water plumes. We find that parameters that optimize success often lead to more exploratory pathways to the source. Information about the direction from which the odor is coming is necessary for successful navigation in the water plume and reduces the path length in the three tested air plumes.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial locomotion is a complex phenomenon that is often linked to the survival of an individual and of an animal species. Mathematical models seek to express in quantitative terms how animals move, but this is challenging because the ways in which the nervous and musculoskeletal systems interact to produce body movement is not completely understood. Models with many variables tend to lack biological interpretability and describe the motion of an animal with too many independent degrees of freedom. Instead, reductionist models aim to describe the essential features of a gait with the smallest number of variables, often concentrating on the center of mass dynamics. In particular, spring–mass models have been successful in extracting and describing important characteristics of running. In this paper, we consider the spring loaded inverted pendulum model under the regime of constant angular velocity, small compression, and small angle swept during stance. We provide conditions for the asymptotic stability of periodic trajectories for the full range of parameters. The hypothesis of linear angular dynamics during stance is successfully tested on publicly available human data of individuals running on a treadmill at different velocities. Our analysis highlights a novel bifurcation phenomenon for varying Froude number : there are periodic trajectories of the spring loaded inverted pendulum model that are stable only in a restricted range of Froude numbers , while they become unstable for smaller or larger Froude numbers .},

We find that the water retention in percent is very high (about 90 %) and relatively unaffected by either cold (−30 °C) or warm (10 °C) conditions. The retention of heat is also high, around 80 % . Based on a consideration of entropy production by the maxilloturbinate system, we show that anatomical and physiological properties of the seal provide good conditions for heat and water exchange at the mucus lining in the seal’s nasal cavity. At normal values of tidal volume and maxilloturbinate (MT) length, the air temperature in the MT reaches the body temperature before the air has left the MT channels.

  abstract     = {How does the spatial heterogeneity of landscapes interact with the adaptive evolution of populations to influence their spreading speed? This question arises in agricultural contexts where a pathogen population spreads in a landscape composed of several types of crops, as well as in epidemiological settings where a virus spreads among individuals with distinct immune profiles. To address it, we introduce an analytical method based on reaction–diffusion models. We focus on spatially periodic environments with two distinct patches, where the dispersing population consists of two specialized morphs, each potentially mutating to the other. We present new formulas for the speed together with criteria for persistence, accounting for both rapidly and slowly varying environments, as well as small and large mutation rates. Altogether, our analytical and numerical results yield a comprehensive understanding of persistence and spreading dynamics. In particular, compared to a situation without mutations or to a single morph spreading in a heterogeneous landscape, the introduction of mutations to a second morph with reverse specialization, while consistently impeding persistence, can significantly increase speed, even if the mutation rate between the two morphs is very small. Additionally, we find that the amplitude of the spatial fragmentation effect is significantly increased in this case. This has implications for agroecology, emphasizing the higher importance of landscape structure in influencing adaptation-driven population dynamics.},

As an evolving pathogen that often goes misidentified or unidentified under standard laboratory tests, it has the ability to cause fatal infections among the target population involving patients with serious medical conditions admitted to intensive care facilities, due to its capacity to resist anti-fungal treatment and the ability to persist in the hospital environment for long periods. The subject of this paper is to develop a deterministic model to study the transmission nature of Candida Auris wherein measures like apt admission screening methods with weekly screening follow-ups, transmission prevention, proper treatment protocols and environmental disinfection procedures are introduced as constant mitigating controls into the model initially which are later redefined as variable control functions during the optimal control analysis. The theory of optimal control implemented into the model helps us to understand the sensitivity of each control strategy upon the behaviour of each state variable. Further, cost-effectiveness analysis is rigorously conducted using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to identify and rank the control strategies involved based on their economic efficiency. Numerical simulation for the optimal control analysis is performed in MATLAB using the Forward–Backward Sweep Method and the findings are illustrated graphically.},

The findings suggest that thrombus formation upstream of the stent is mainly initiated by upstream arterial injury, which leads to increased platelet accumulation and activation in that area. While thrombosis downstream of the stent is more directly influenced by the stent itself. The morphology and size of in-stent thrombosis can vary significantly due to the different contributions of the stent and underlying injuries. Additionally, the volume of in-stent thrombosis is affected by the extent of the injury and the viscosity of platelets, showing a notable increase in volume with the lengthening of the injury area and rise in platelet viscosity. This study provides a novel theoretical framework for optimizing stent placement strategies and structural designs by examining the effects of stent struts and associated injuries on thrombus formation.},

Here we consider estimation of the branch lengths in fixed species trees with three or four taxa, and show that these branch lengths are identifiable. We also show that for three and four taxa simple estimators for the branch lengths can be derived based on observed site pattern frequencies. Properties of these estimators, such as their asymptotic variances and large-sample distributions, are examined, and performance of the estimators is assessed using simulation. Finally, we use these estimators to develop a hypothesis test that can be used to delimit species under the coalescent model for three or four putative taxa.},

Uncertainty is a major challenge and a barrier that ecosystem management faces, because it is difficult to precisely predict a priori risks that can have significant impacts on ecosystems. Hence, management with adaptive capacity is recommended to deal with such uncertainties, and feedback structures are central mechanisms for such flexible management. This study used mathematical models to clarify the specific impacts of feedback structures on ecosystem management, such as resource and wildlife management. In particular, the impact of errors in estimating ecosystem status when providing feedback and the impact of the time lag before feedback effects were implemented into management were examined. Overestimation of ecosystem status or a large time lag led to undesirable temporal oscillations in ecosystem status. However, these scenarios can be avoided when combined with management practices that limit the impact of management on the ecosystem, such as input control. Ecosystem management tends to have a large spatiotemporal scale, and implementing highly accurate monitoring and sophisticated feedback structures is difficult. However, the results suggest that effective ecosystem management with a simple feedback structure can be achieved through such complementary institutional design.},

We exhibit some emergence phenomenon: the total catch can be greater than the sum of the catch at two isolated sites due to connectivity. This result is obtained when the two sites are heterogeneous. We show that the increase in capture at MSY is maximal for a certain value of the carrying capacity of the second site, all other parameters remaining constant, including the carrying capacity of the first site. A stronger phenomenon can also be observed: even if none of the sites is viable for fishing, the entire system can be viable. We then study the effects of the heterogeneity of the sites and illustrate our results through simulations. It is shown that the excess yield at MSY can become very significant when the characteristics of the prey and predator in terms of potential growth are opposite at each site.},

We constructed a simulation model in which the opening times and longevities of individual flowers within inflorescences, the sizes of attractive structures of individual flowers, and the numbers of ovules and pollen grains produced by individual flowers evolve. Individual plants in the population compete for pollinators, and plants are selected by pollinators according to their floral display sizes and amounts of resources allocated to attractive structures. We found that, if the proportion of pollen on a pollinator deposited on a stigma was low, gradual blooming did not evolve even if inbreeding depression was greater than 0.5. This is because the amount of outcross-pollen on pollinators decreased at a low rate during flower visits within a single inflorescence, and the selfing rate was suppressed to a low level even if the floral display size was large. On the other hand, if the proportion of pollen deposition was high, gradual blooming evolved even if inbreeding depression was smaller than 0.5. This may be because gradual blooming can enhance pollen delivery to other plants by reducing the loss of self-pollen by geitonogamy. On the other hand, allocation ratios among floral organs (female and male organs and attractive structures) were independent of the degree of simultaneous and gradual blooming within inflorescences. We concluded that the evolution of gradual blooming is more strongly affected by the proportion of pollen on a pollinator deposited on a stigma than by inbreeding depression.},

  abstract     = {Viral coinfections are responsible for a significant portion of cases of patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness. As our awareness of viral coinfections has increased, researchers have started to experimentally examine some of the virus–virus interactions underlying these infections. One mechanism of interaction between viruses is through the innate immune response. This seems to occur primarily through the interferon response, which generates an antiviral state in nearby uninfected cells, a phenomenon know as the bystander effect. Here, we develop a mathematical model of two viruses interacting through the bystander effect. We find that when the rate of removal of cells to the protected state is high, growth of the first virus is suppressed, while the second virus enjoys sole access to the protected cells, enhancing its growth. Conversely, growth of the second virus can be fully suppressed if its ability to infect the protected cells is limited.},

However, pathways and mechanisms of prothrombinase formation and substrate delivery are still discussed. Here we designed a novel mathematical model that considered different potential pathways of FXa or FII binding (from the membrane or from solution) and analyzed the kinetics of thrombin formation in the presence of a wide range of reactants concentrations. We observed the inhibitory effect of large FVa concentrations and this effect was phospholipid concentration-dependent. We predicted that efficient FII activation occurred via formation of the ternary complex, in which FVa, FXa and FII were in the membrane-bound state. Prothrombin delivery was mostly membrane-dependent, but delivery from solution was predominant under conditions of phospholipid deficiency or FXa/FVa excess. Likewise, FXa delivery from solution was predominant in the case of FVa excess, but high FII did not switch the FXa delivery to the solution-dependent one. Additionally, the FXa delivery pathway did not depend on the phospholipid concentration, being the membrane-dependent one even in case of the phospholipid deficiency. These results suggest a flexible mechanism of prothrombinase functioning which utilizes different complex formation and even inhibitory mechanisms depending on conditions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multi-cellular models, where cells are represented as individual interacting entities, are becoming ever popular. This has led to a proliferation of novel methods and simulation tools. The first aim of this paper is to review the numerical methods utilised by multi-cellular modelling tools and to demonstrate which numerical methods are appropriate for simulations of tissue and organ development, maintenance, and disease. The second aim is to introduce an adaptive time-stepping algorithm and to demonstrate it’s efficiency and accuracy. We focus on off-lattice, mechanics based, models where cell movement is defined by a series of first order ordinary differential equations, derived by assuming over-damped motion and balancing forces. We see that many numerical methods have been used, ranging from simple Forward Euler approaches through to higher order single-step methods like Runge–Kutta 4 and multi-step methods like Adams–Bashforth 2. Through a series of exemplar multi-cellular simulations, we see that if: care is taken to have events (births deaths and re-meshing/re-arrangements) occur on common time-steps; and boundaries are imposed on all sub-steps of numerical methods or implemented using forces, then all numerical methods can converge with the correct order. We introduce an adaptive time-stepping method and demonstrate that the best compromise between L ∞ L∞ error and run-time is to use Runge–Kutta 4 with an increased time-step and moderate adaptivity. We see that a judicious choice of numerical method can speed the simulation up by a factor of 10–60 from the Forward Euler methods seen in Osborne et al. (2017), and a further speed up by a factor of 4 can be achieved by using an adaptive time-step.},

In this paper, we leverage a modified version of the double deep Q network with prioritized experience replay to improve the performance of classic deep learning algorithms. Numerical simulation results show that our methodology produces significantly more optimal cost values for shorter treatment periods compared to other recent studies.

An important case is flowering plants and their pollinators, where convergent selection on plant and pollinator traits is combined with divergent selection to minimize niche overlap within each group. In this article, we study the emergence of polymorphisms in communities structured trophically: plants are the primary producers of resources required by the primary consumers, the servicing pollinators. We model natural selection on traits affecting mutualism between plants and pollinators and competition within these two trophic levels. We show that phenotypic diversification is favored by broad plant niches, suggesting that bottom-up trophic control leads to codiversification. Mutualistic generalism, i.e., tolerance to differences in plant and pollinator traits, promotes a cascade of evolutionary branching favored by bottom-up plant competition dependent on similarity and top-down mutualistic services that broaden plant niches. Our results predict a strong positive correlation between the diversity of plant and pollinator phenotypes, which previous work has partially attributed to the trophic dependence of pollinators on plants.},

The optimal vaccination policy depends on the distribution of protection. While for low values of the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 the optimal policy prioritises the most susceptible hosts, I show that for almost any distribution the order of priority reverses and the least susceptible hosts should be vaccinated when R 0 R0 is high. The exception where this does not happen is the all-or-none vaccine. However, even a small deviation from the ideal all-or-none distribution can imply that the limited number of vaccines should be given to less susceptible hosts already at realistic values of R 0 R0 .},

  abstract     = {Labor division is a phenomenon observed across various biological contexts, including examples such as the differentiation between germ/somatic cells in multicellular organisms and the division between reproductive/worker individuals within social animal groups. In such cases, certain members contribute to tasks that enhance the viability of the entire group, even if this requires a reduction in their individual reproductive efforts. Given that group members have the potential to adopt varying contribution levels, a comprehensive analysis of the evolution becomes intricate due to the problem’s high dimensionality. In this paper, I introduce a novel method for analyzing the evolution of the distribution of contribution levels to group viability, with a particular formulation centered on the success of clonal strains. The analysis demonstrates that the curvature of the fecundity function in relation to contributions to the group plays a pivotal role in determining the occurrence of labor division between reproductive and non-reproductive tasks, aligning in part with results from prior research. Furthermore, I extend this analysis to encompass contributions to multiple categories of tasks for group viability. My findings indicate that investments in non-reproductive tasks are selected based on the average contributions for each task, with individual variation playing a less significant role as long as average values remain consistent. Additionally, I explore the impact of group size and relatedness within the group on labor division. The results highlight that increases in group size and relatedness have a positive influence on the evolution of cooperation, although their effects are not directly tied to labor division itself.},

Thus, there is a need to develop new approaches to create predictive mechanistic models of complex systems. To meet this need, we developed a method for generating artificial signaling networks that were reasonably realistic and thus could be treated as ground truth models. These synthetic models could then be used to generate synthetic data for developing and testing algorithms designed to recover the underlying network topology and associated parameters. We defined the reaction degree and reaction distance to measure the topology of reaction networks, especially to consider enzymes. To determine whether our generated signaling networks displayed meaningful behavior, we compared them with signaling networks from the BioModels Database. This comparison indicated that our generated signaling networks had high topological similarities with BioModels signaling networks with respect to the reaction degree and distance distributions. In addition, our synthetic signaling networks had similar behavioral dynamics with respect to both steady states and oscillations, suggesting that our method generated synthetic signaling networks comparable with BioModels and thus could be useful for building network evaluation tools.},

  abstract     = {The formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits (senile plaques) is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study investigates what processes are primarily responsible for their formation. A model is developed to simulate the diffusion of amyloid beta (Aβ) monomers , the production of free Aβ aggregates through nucleation and autocatalytic processes, and the deposition of these aggregates into senile plaques . The model suggests that efficient degradation of Aβ monomers alone may suffice to prevent the growth of senile plaques , even without degrading Aβ aggregates and existing plaques. This is because the degradation of Aβ monomers interrupts the supply of reactants needed for plaque formation. The impact of Aβ monomer diffusivity is demonstrated to be small, enabling the application of the lumped capacitance approximation and the derivation of approximate analytical solutions for limiting cases with both small and large rates of Aβ aggregate deposition into plaques. It is found that the rate of plaque growth is governed by two competing processes . One is the deposition rate of free Aβ aggregates into senile plaques. If this rate is small, the plaque grows slowly. However, if the rate of deposition of Aβ aggregates into senile plaques is very large, the free Aβ aggregates are removed from the intracellular fluid by deposition into the plaques, leaving insufficient free Aβ aggregates to catalyze the production of new aggregates. This suggests that under certain conditions, Aβ plaques may offer neuroprotection and impede their own growth. Additionally, it indicates that there exists an optimal rate of deposition of free Aβ aggregates into the plaques, at which the plaques attain their maximum size.},

These data consist of viral titer and CD8＋ T cell counts collected periodically over a period of 19 days from adult and aged mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1). We use the corrected Akaike Information Criterion to identify the models which best represent the considered data. Our model selection process indicates differences in mechanisms which reduce the CD8＋ T cell response: linear downregulation is favored for adult mice, while baseline exponential decay is favored for aged mice. Parameter fitting of the top ranked models suggests that the aged population has reduced CD8＋ T cell proliferation compared to the adult population. More experimental work is needed to determine the specific immunological features through which age might cause these differences. A better understanding of the immunological mechanisms by which aging leads to discrepant CD8＋ T cell dynamics may inform future treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs, among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, currently face major threats from pollution, unsustainable fishing practices , and perturbations in environmental parameters brought on by climate change. Corals also sustain regular wounding from other sea life and human activity. Recent reef restoration practices have even involved intentional wounding by systematically breaking coral fragments and relocating them to revitalize damaged reefs, a practice known as microfragmentation. Despite its importance, very little research has explored the inner mechanisms of wound healing in corals. Some reef-building corals have been observed to initiate an immunological response to wounding similar to that observed in mammalian species. Utilizing prior models of wound healing in mammalian species as the mathematical basis, we formulated a mechanistic model of wound healing, including observations of the immune response and tissue repair in scleractinian corals for the species Pocillopora damicornis . The model consists of four differential equations which track changes in remaining wound debris, number of cells involved in inflammation, number of cells involved in proliferation, and amount of wound closure through re-epithelialization. The model is fit to experimental wound size data from linear and circular shaped wounds on a live coral fragment. Mathematical methods, including numerical simulations and local sensitivity analysis, were used to analyze the resulting model. The parameter space was also explored to investigate drivers of other possible wound outcomes. This model serves as a first step in generating mathematical models for wound healing in corals that will not only aid in the understanding of wound healing as a whole, but also help optimize reef restoration practices and predict recovery behavior after major wounding events.},

  abstract     = {Across early childhood development, sleep behavior transitions from a biphasic pattern (a daytime nap and nighttime sleep) to a monophasic pattern (only nighttime sleep). The transition to consolidated nighttime sleep, which occurs in most children between 2- and 5-years-old, is a major developmental milestone and reflects interactions between the developing homeostatic sleep drive and circadian system. Using a physiologically-based mathematical model of the sleep-wake regulatory network constrained by observational and experimental data from preschool-aged participants, we analyze how developmentally-mediated changes in the homeostatic sleep drive may contribute to the transition from napping to non-napping sleep patterns. We establish baseline behavior by identifying parameter sets that model typical 2-year-old napping behavior and 5-year-old non-napping behavior. Then we vary six model parameters associated with the dynamics of and sensitivity to the homeostatic sleep drive between the 2-year-old and 5-year-old parameter values to induce the transition from biphasic to monophasic sleep. We analyze the individual contributions of these parameters to sleep patterning by independently varying their age-dependent developmental trajectories. Parameters vary according to distinct evolution curves and produce bifurcation sequences representing various ages of transition onset, transition durations, and transitional sleep patterns. Finally, we consider the ability of napping and non-napping light schedules to reinforce napping or promote a transition to consolidated sleep, respectively. These modeling results provide insight into the role of the homeostatic sleep drive in promoting interindividual variability in developmentally-mediated transitions in sleep behavior and lay foundations for the identification of light- or behavior-based interventions that promote healthy sleep consolidation in early childhood.},

  abstract     = {The overall course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Western countries has been characterized by complex sequences of phases. In the period before the arrival of vaccines, these phases were mainly due to the alternation between the strengthening/lifting of social distancing measures, with the aim to balance the protection of health and that of the society as a whole. After the arrival of vaccines, this multi-phasic character was further emphasized by the complicated deployment of vaccination campaigns and the onset of virus’ variants. To cope with this multi-phasic character, we propose a theoretical approach to the modeling of overall pandemic courses, that we term multi-period/multi-phasic , based on a specific definition of phase. This allows a unified and parsimonious representation of complex epidemic courses even when vaccination and virus’ variants are considered, through sequences of weak ergodic renewal equations that become fully ergodic when appropriate conditions are met. Specific hypotheses on epidemiological and intervention parameters allow reduction to simple models. The framework suggest a simple, theory driven, approach to data explanation that allows an accurate reproduction of the overall course of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy since its beginning (February 2020) up to omicron onset, confirming the validity of the concept.},

We examine how the periphery of murmurations remain well bounded and cohesive. We also investigate agitation waves, which occur when a flock is disturbed, developing a plausible model for how they might emerge spontaneously. To understand these behaviors a new model is presented for orientation-based social flocking. Previous methods model inter-bird dynamics by considering the neighborhood around each bird, and introducing forces for avoidance, alignment, and cohesion as three dimensional vectors that alter acceleration. Our method introduces orientation-based social flocking that treats social influences from neighbors more realistically as a desire to turn, indirectly controlling the heading in an aerodynamic model. While our model can be applied to any flocking social bird we simulate flocks of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris , and demonstrate the possibility of orientation waves in the absence of predators. Our model exhibits spherical and ovoidal flock shapes matching observation. Comparisons of our model to Reynolds’ on energy consumption and frequency analysis demonstrates more realistic motions, significantly less energy use in turning, and a plausible mechanism for emergent orientation waves.},

  abstract     = {In HIV drug therapy, the high variability of CD 4 + 4+ T cells and viral loads brings uncertainty to the determination of treatment options and the ultimate treatment efficacy, which may be the result of poor drug adherence. We develop a dynamical HIV model coupled with pharmacokinetics, driven by drug adherence as a random variable, and systematically study the uncertainty quantification, aiming to construct the relationship between drug adherence and therapeutic effect. Using adaptive generalized polynomial chaos, stochastic solutions are approximated as polynomials of input random parameters. Numerical simulations show that results obtained by this method are in good agreement, compared with results obtained through Monte Carlo sampling, which helps to verify the accuracy of approximation. Based on these expansions, we calculate the time-dependent probability density functions of this system theoretically and numerically. To verify the applicability of this model, we fit clinical data of four HIV patients, and the goodness of fit results demonstrate that the proposed random model depicts the dynamics of HIV well. Sensitivity analyses based on the Sobol index indicate that the randomness of drug effect has the greatest impact on both CD 4 + 4+ T cells and viral loads, compared to random initial values, which further highlights the significance of drug adherence. The proposed models and qualitative analysis results, along with monitoring CD 4 + 4+ T cells counts and viral loads, evaluate the influence of drug adherence on HIV treatment, which helps to better interpret clinical data with fluctuations and makes several contributions to the design of individual-based optimal antiretroviral strategies.},

We employed approximation utilizing finite element models taking into account glucose, oxygen, and hydrogen ions diffusion, consumption and production, as well as cell proliferation, migration and death, addressing how tumor cells evolve under different conditions. The resulting mathematical model was examined under different scenarios, being capable of reproducing cell death and proliferation under different cell concentrations, and the formation of a necrotic core, in good agreement with experimental data reported in the literature. This approach not only advances our fundamental understanding of necrotic core formation but also provides a robust computational platform to study personalized therapeutic strategies, offering an important tool in cancer research and treatment design.},

Comparing this fixation probability to its value under neutrality and to the corresponding fixation probability for defection, we deduce conditions for the evolution of cooperation. We show that these conditions are generally less stringent as the level of assortment increases under a wide range of assumptions on the payoffs such as additive, synergetic or discounted benefits for cooperation, fixed cost for cooperation and threshold benefit functions. This is not necessarily the case, however, when payoffs in pairwise interactions are multiplicatively compounded within groups.},

  abstract     = {Phytoplankton Chl:C:N:P ratios are important from both an ecological and a biogeochemical perspective. We show that these elemental ratios can be represented by a phytoplankton physiological model of low complexity that includes major cellular macromolecular pools. In particular, our model resolves time-dependent intracellular pools of chlorophyll, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates/lipids, and N and P storage. Batch culture data for two diatom and two prasinophyte species are used to constrain parameters that represent specific allocation traits and strategies. A key novelty is the simultaneous estimation of physiological parameters for two phytoplankton groups of such different sizes. The number of free parameters is reduced by assuming (i) allometric scaling for maximum uptake rates, (ii) shared half-saturation constants for synthesis of functional macromolecules, (iii) shared exudation rates of functional macromolecules across the species. The rationale behind this assumption is that across the different species, the same or similar processes, enzymes, and metabolites play a role in key physiological processes. For the turnover numbers of macromolecular synthesis and storage exudation rates, differences between diatoms and prasinophytes need to be taken into account to obtain a good fit. Our model fits suggest that the parameters related to storage dynamics dominate the differences in the C:N:P ratios between the different phytoplankton groups. Since descriptions of storage dynamics are still incomplete and imprecise, predictions of C:N:P ratios by phytoplankton models likely have a large uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development and homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition. We discuss how our approach enables the introduction of effective bio-mechanical interactions in a CA framework for future studies.},

  abstract     = {Iron-induced oxidative stress was thought to be the reason why the a -wave amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG) dropped when iron ions were present. It is assumed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the presence of iron ions, and this leads to a decrease in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor. It is known that in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), sodium iodate can induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and retinal damage, which mimic the effects of clinical AMD. Here, the reduction of the a -wave amplitude in mice with sodium iodate-induced age-related macular degeneration is explained. The leading edge of the a -wave is divided into voltages developed by cones and rods. The same oxidative stress model is applied here since sodium iodate causes the creation of ROS in a manner similar to that caused by iron ions, with the exception that the retina is treated as a circuit of various resistances when computing the photoresponse. Moreover, sodium iodate also leads to apoptosis and, hence, may cause misalignment in cones (not in rods) during the initial stage of apoptosis in AMD. To include the effects of apoptosis and shortening in cones and rods, we have used a factor representing the fraction of total cones and rods that are alive. To include the effect of misalignment of cones on the reduction of the a -wave amplitude, we have used the Stiles-Crawford function to calculate the number of photoisomerizations occurring in a photoreceptor misaligned at an angle θ. The results are compared with experimental data. In sodium iodate-treated eyes, the ROS produced can attract calcium ions in the photoreceptor, which increases the calcium influx. In the case of the cones, the inclusion of the misalignment angle in the phototransduction process helps in determining the voltage and slope of the voltage vs. time graph. The smaller the fraction of active photoreceptors, the smaller the amplitude of the a -wave. The calcium influx, misaligned photoreceptors, and total photoreceptor loss all cause the amplitude of the a a -wave to decrease, and at any time from the beginning of phototransduction cascade, the calcium influx causes the slope of the a -wave to increase. The reduction in the a -wave amplitude in the eyes of sodium iodate-treated mice is attributed to oxidative stress in both cones and rods and cone misalignment, which ultimately lead to apoptosis and vision loss in AMD.},

Its existence in genomes with certain definition of DNA words is unclear partly because the dictionary size in genome could be much smaller than that in a human language. We define a DNA word as a coding region in a genome that codes for a protein domain. Using human chromosomes and chromosome arms as individual samples, we establish the existence of Heaps’ law in the human genome within limited range. Our definition of words in a genomic or proteomic context is different from other definitions such as over-represented k-mers which are much shorter in length. Although an approximate power-law distribution of protein domain sizes due to gene duplication and the related Zipf’s law is well known, their translation to the Heaps’ law in DNA words is not automatic. Several other animal genomes are shown herein also to exhibit range-limited Heaps’ law with our definition of DNA words, though with various exponents. When tokens were randomly sampled and sample sizes reach to the maximum level, a deviation from the Heaps’ law was observed, but a quadratic regression in log–log type-token plot fits the data perfectly. Investigation of type-token plot and its regression coefficients could provide an alternative narrative of reusage and redundancy of protein domains as well as creation of new protein domains from a linguistic perspective.},

The objective of this study is to develop a modeling framework to inform the development of viable disease risk management policies and measures to control disease outbreaks on cruises. Our model, parameterized and calibrated using the data of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in 2020, is used to assess the impact of the mitigation measures such as mask wearing, vaccination, on-board and pre-traveling testing measures. Our results indicate mask wearing in public places as the cheapest and most affordable measure can drop the number of cumulative confirmed cases by almost 50%. This measure along with the vaccination by declining the number of the cumulative confirmed cases by more than 94% is the most effective measure to control outbreaks on cruises. According to our findings, outbreaks are more predominant in the passenger population than the crew members, however, the protection measures are more beneficial if they are applied by both crew members and passengers. Regarding the testing measure, pre-traveling testing is more functional than the on-board testing to control outbreaks on cruises.},

  abstract     = {Treating bone-cartilage defects is a fundamental clinical problem. The ability of damaged cartilage to self-repair is limited due to its avascularity. Left untreated, these defects can lead to osteoarthritis. Details of osteochondral defect repair are elusive, but animal models indicate healing occurs via an endochondral ossification-like process, similar to that in the growth plate. In the growth plate, the signalling molecules parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) form a feedback loop regulating chondrocyte hypertrophy, with Ihh inducing and PTHrP suppressing hypertrophy. To better understand this repair process and to explore the regulatory role of signalling molecules on the regeneration process, we formulate a reaction–diffusion mathematical model of osteochondral defect regeneration after chondrocyte implantation. The drivers of healing are assumed to be chondrocytes and osteoblasts, and their interaction via signalling molecules. We model cell proliferation, migration and chondrocyte hypertrophy, and matrix production and conversion, spatially and temporally. We further model nutrient and signalling molecule diffusion and their interaction with the cells. We consider the PTHrP-Ihh feedback loop as the backbone mechanisms but the model is flexible to incorporate extra signalling mechanisms if needed. Our mathematical model is able to represent repair of osteochondral defects, starting with cartilage formation throughout the defect. This is followed by chondrocyte hypertrophy, matrix calcification and bone formation deep inside the defect, while cartilage at the surface is maintained and eventually separated from the deeper bone by a thin layer of calcified cartilage. The complete process requires around 48 months. A key highlight of the model demonstrates that the PTHrP-Ihh loop alone is insufficient and an extra mechanism is required to initiate chondrocyte hypertrophy, represented by a critical cartilage density. A parameter sensitivity study reveals that the timing of the repair process crucially depends on parameters, such as the critical cartilage density, and those describing the actions of PTHrP to suppress hypertrophy, such as its diffusion coefficient, threshold concentration and degradation rate.},

  abstract     = {Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The worldwide spread of these mosquitoes and the increasing disease burden have emphasized the need for a spatio-temporal risk map capable of assessing dengue outbreak conditions and quantifying the outbreak risk. Given that the life cycle of Aedes mosquitoes is strongly influenced by habitat temperature, numerous studies have utilized temperature-dependent development rates of these mosquitoes to construct virus transmission and outbreak risk models. In this study, we contribute to existing research by developing a mechanistic model for the mosquito life cycle that accurately captures its non-Markovian nature. Beginning with integral equations to track the mosquito population across different life cycle stages, we demonstrate how to derive the corresponding differential equations using phase-type distributions. This approach can be further applied to similar non-Markovian processes that are currently described with less accurate Markovian models. By fitting the model to data on human dengue cases, we estimate several model parameters, allowing the development of a global spatiotemporal dengue risk map. This risk model employs temperature and precipitation data to assess the environmental suitability for dengue outbreaks in a given area.},

  abstract     = {Resisting apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. For this reason, it may be possible to force cancer cells to die by targeting components along the apoptotic signaling pathway. However, apoptosis signaling is challenging to understand due to dynamic and complex behaviors of ligands, receptors, and intracellular signaling components in response to cancer therapy. In this work, we forecast the apoptotic response based on the combined impact of these features. We expanded a previously established mathematical model of caspase-mediated apoptosis to include extracellular activation and receptor dynamics. In addition, three potential threshold values of caspase-3 necessary for the activation of apoptosis were selected to forecast which cells become apoptotic over time. We first vary ligand and receptor levels with the number of intracellular signaling proteins remaining consistent. Then, we vary the intracellular protein molecules in each simulated tumor cell to forecast the response of a heterogeneous population. By leveraging the benefits of computational modeling, we investigate the combined effect of several factors on the onset of apoptosis. This work provides quantitative insights for how the apoptotic signaling response can be forecasted, and precisely triggered, amongst heterogeneous cells via extracellular activation.},

  abstract     = {Natural systems show heterogeneous patchy distributions of vegetation over large landscapes. Reaction–diffusion systems can demonstrate such heterogeneity of species distributions. Here, we analyse a reaction–diffusion model of plant–herbivore interactions in two-dimensional space to illustrate non-homogeneous distributions of plants and herbivores. The non-spatial system shows bottom-up control, where herbivore density is low under low and high primary productivity but increased at intermediate productivity. In addition, the non-spatial system provides bistability between a dense vegetation state devoid of herbivores and a coexisting state of plants and herbivores. In the spatiotemporal model, we give analytical conditions of occurring diffusion-driven (Turing) instability, where a novel point in our model is the relative dispersal of herbivores, which represents the movement of herbivores from a higher to a lower vegetation state in addition to the self-diffusion of both species. It is shown that heterogeneity in the population distribution does not occur if the relative dispersal of herbivores is low, but it appears in the opposite case. Due to bistability in the underlying non-spatial system, the spatiotemporal model produces initial value-dependent patterns. The two initial values make different patterns despite having the same primary productivity and relative dispersal rate. As productivity increases with a given relative herbivore dispersal, pattern transition occurs from a blend of stripes and spots of low vegetation state to a predominantly low-density vegetation state with smaller patches of densely vegetated states with one initial value. On the contrary, a discernible change in vegetation patterns from cold spots in the dense vegetation to hot stripes in the primarily low-vegetated state is noticed under the other initial population value. Furthermore, the population distributions of plants and herbivores in the entire domain after a long period are heterogeneous for both initial values, provided the relative herbivore dispersal is substantial. We estimated mean population densities to observe species fitness in the whole domain under variable productivity. When productivity is high, the mean population density of plants may go up or down, depending on the herbivore’s relative dispersal rate. In contrast to the bottom-up control dynamics of the non-spatial system, the system exhibits a top-down control under high relative dispersal, where the herbivore regulates vegetation growth under high productivity. On the other hand, herbivores are extinct under high productivity if the relative dispersal is low.},

  abstract     = {Insect outbreaks can cause large scale defoliation of forest trees or destruction of crops, leading to ecosystem degradation and economic losses. Some outbreaks occur simultaneously across large geographic scales and some outbreaks occur periodically every few years across space. Parasitoids are a natural enemy of these defoliators and could help mitigate these pest outbreaks. A holistic understanding of the host-parasitoid interactions in a spatial context would thus enhance our ability to understand, predict and prevent these outbreaks. We use a discrete time deterministic model of the host parasitoid system with populations migrating between 2 patches to elucidate features of spatial host outbreaks. We show that whenever populations persist indefinitely, host outbreaks in both patches can occur alternatively (out of phase) at low migration between patches whereas host outbreaks always occur simultaneously (in phase) in both patches at high migration between patches. We show that our results are robust across a large range of parameters across different modelling approaches used typically to model intraspecific competition among hosts and parasitism, in the host-parasitoid literature. We give an analytical expression for the period of oscillations when the migration is low i.e. , when host outbreaks in both patches are out of phase, show it is in agreement with numerical results. We end our paper by showing that we get the same results whether we include the biologically rooted formulations from May et al. (1981) or a general cellular automata model with qualitative rules.},

  abstract     = {Marine mixotrophs combine phagotrophy and phototrophy to acquire the resources they need for growth. Metabolic plasticity, the ability for individuals to dynamically alter their relative investment between different metabolic processes, allows mixotrophs to efficiently exploit variable environmental conditions. Different mixotrophs may vary in how quickly they respond to environmental stimuli, with slow-responding mixotrophs exhibiting a significant lag between a change in the environment and the resulting change metabolic strategy. In this study, we develop a model of mixotroph metabolic strategy and explore how the rate of the plastic response affects the seasonality, competitive fitness, and biogeochemical role of mixotroph populations. Fast-responding mixotrophs are characterized by more efficient resource use and higher average growth rates than slow-responding mixotrophs because any lag in the plastic response following a change in environmental conditions creates a mismatch between the mixotroph’s metabolic requirements and their resource acquisition. However, this mismatch also results in increased storage of unused resources that support growth under future nutrient-limited conditions. As a result of this trade-off, mixotroph biomass and productivity are maximized at intermediate plastic response rates. Furthermore, the trade-off represents a mechanism for coexistence between fast-responding and slow-responding mixotrophs. In mixed communities, fast-responding mixotrophs are numerically dominant, but slow-responding mixotrophs persist at low abundance due to the provisioning effect that emerges as a result of their less efficient resource acquisition strategy. In addition to increased competitive ability, fast-responding mixotrophs are, on average, more autotrophic than slow-responding mixotrophs. Notably, these trade-offs associated with mixotroph response rate arise without including an explicit physiological cost associated with plasticity, a conclusion that may provide insight into evolutionary constraints of metabolic plasticity in mixotrophic organisms. When an explicit cost is added to the model, it alters the competitive relationships between fast- and slow-responding mixotrophs. Faster plastic response rates are favored by lower physiological costs as well as higher amplitude seasonal cycles.},

  abstract     = {Fungal pellets are hierarchical systems that can be found in an ample variety of applications. Modeling transport phenomena in this type of systems is a challenging but necessary task to provide knowledge-based processes that improve the outcome of their biotechnological applications. In this work, an upscaled model for total mass and momentum transport in fungal pellets is implemented and analyzed, using elements of the volume averaging and adjoint homogenization methods departing from the governing equations at the microscale in the intracellular and extracellular phases. The biomass is assumed to be composed of a non-Newtonian fluid and the organelles impervious to momentum transport are modeled as a rigid solid phase. The upscaled equations contain effective-medium coefficients, which are predicted from the solution of adjoint closure problems in a three-dimensional periodic domains representative of the microstructure. The construction of these domains was performed for Laccaria trichodermophora based on observations of actual biological structures. The upscaled model was validated with direct numerical simulations in homogeneous portions of the pellets core. It is shown that no significant differences are observed when the dolipores are open or closed to fluid flow. By comparing the predictions of the average velocity in the extracellular phase resulting from the upscaled model with those from the classical Darcy equation ( i.e. , assuming that the biomass is a solid phase) the contribution of the intracellular fluid phase was evidenced. This work sets the foundations for further studies dedicated to transport phenomena in this type of systems.},

  abstract     = {Circadian rhythms have been implicated in the modulation of many physiological processes, including those associated with the immune system. For example, these rhythms influence CD8 + + T cell responses within the adaptive immune system. The mechanism underlying this immune-circadian interaction, however, remains unclear, particularly in the context of vaccination. Here, we devise a molecularly-explicit gene regulatory network model of early signaling in the naïve CD8 + + T cell activation pathway, comprised of three axes (or subsystems) labeled ZAP70, LAT and CD28, to elucidate the molecular details of this immune-circadian mechanism and its relation to vaccination. This is done by coupling the model to a periodic forcing function to identify the molecular players targeted by circadian rhythms, and analyzing how these rhythms subsequently affect CD8 + + T cell activation under differing levels of T cell receptor (TCR) phosphorylation, which we designate as vaccine load. By performing both bifurcation and parameter sensitivity analyses on the model at the single cell and ensemble levels, we find that applying periodic forcing on molecular targets within the ZAP70 axis is sufficient to create a day–night discrepancy in CD8 + + T cell activation in a manner that is dependent on the bistable switch inherent in CD8 + + T cell early signaling. We also demonstrate that the resulting CD8 + + T cell activation is dependent on the strength of the periodic coupling as well as on the level of TCR phosphorylation. Our results show that this day–night discrepancy is not transmitted to certain downstream molecules within the LAT subsystem, such as mTORC1, suggesting a secondary, independent circadian regulation on that protein complex. We also corroborate experimental results by showing that the circadian regulation of CD8 + + T cell primarily acts at a baseline, pre-vaccination state, playing a facilitating role in priming CD8 + + T cells to vaccine inputs according to the time of day. By applying an ensemble level analysis using bifurcation theory and by including several hypothesized molecular targets of this circadian rhythm, we further demonstrate an increased variability between CD8 + + T cells (due to heterogeneity) induced by its circadian regulation, which may allow an ensemble of CD8 + + T cells to activate at a lower vaccine load, improving its sensitivity. This modeling study thus provides insights into the immune targets of the circadian clock, and proposes an interaction between vaccine load and the influence of circadian rhythms on CD8 + + T cell activation.},

  abstract     = {Biomathematical models of fatigue capture the physiology of sleep/wake regulation and circadian rhythmicity to predict changes in neurobehavioral functioning over time. We used a biomathematical model of fatigue linked to the adenosinergic neuromodulator/receptor system in the brain as a framework to predict sleep inertia, that is, the transient neurobehavioral impairment experienced immediately after awakening. Based on evidence of an adenosinergic basis for sleep inertia, we expanded the biomathematical model with novel differential equations to predict the propensity for sleep inertia during sleep and its manifestation after awakening. Using datasets from large laboratory studies of sleep loss and circadian misalignment, we calibrated the model by fitting just two new parameters and then validated the model’s predictions against independent data. The expanded model was found to predict the magnitude and time course of sleep inertia with generally high accuracy. Analysis of the model’s dynamics revealed a bifurcation in the predicted manifestation of sleep inertia in sustained sleep restriction paradigms, which reflects the observed escalation of the magnitude of sleep inertia in scenarios with sleep restriction to less than ∼ 4 h per day. Another emergent property of the model involves a rapid increase in the predicted propensity for sleep inertia in the early part of sleep followed by a gradual decline in the later part of the sleep period, which matches what would be expected based on the adenosinergic regulation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and its known influence on sleep inertia. These dynamic behaviors provide confidence in the validity of our approach and underscore the predictive potential of the model. The expanded model provides a useful tool for predicting sleep inertia and managing impairment in 24/7 settings where people may need to perform critical tasks immediately after awakening, such as on-demand operations in safety and security, emergency response, and health care.},

  abstract     = {The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth and its biosphere function as a single self-stabilizing system, but a key challenge is explaining how this could have arisen through Darwinian evolution. One theory is that of “selection by differential survival,” in which a clade’s extinction probability decreases with age as it accumulates adaptations resisting environmental disturbances. While this is hard to assess during early Earth history, we can assess whether this process operated among marine animal genera throughout the Phanerozoic. To that end, we analyzed time ranges of 36,117 extinct animal genera using fossil occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database in order to calculate marine metazoan extinction age selectivity, extinction rates, and speciation rates over the Phanerozoic. We identify four signatures of selection by differential survival: lower extinction rates among older lineages, heritability and taxonomically nested propagation of extinction resistance, reduced age selectivity during rare environmental perturbations, and differential extinction rather than speciation as the primary driver of the phenomenon. Evidence for this process at lower taxonomic levels also implies its possibility for life as a whole – indeed, the possibility of Gaia.},

To solve this issue, the most common method is link prediction. Currently, the link prediction methods based on network Paths of Length Three (L3) have been proven to be highly effective. In this paper, we propose a novel link prediction algorithm, named SMS, which is based on L3 and protein similarities. We first design a mixed similarity that combines the topological structure and attribute features of nodes. Then, we compute the predicted value by summing the product of all similarities along the L3. Furthermore, we propose the Max Similarity Multiplied Similarity (maxSMS) algorithm from the perspective of maximum impact. Our computational prediction results show that on six datasets, including S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens, and others, the maxSMS algorithm improves the precision of the top 500, area under the precision–recall curve, and normalized discounted cumulative gain by an average of 26.99%, 53.67%, and 6.7%, respectively, compared to other optimal methods.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces the concept of Variable Size Game Theory (VSGT), in which the number of players in a game is a strategic decision made by the players themselves. We start by discussing the main examples in game theory: dominance, coexistence, and coordination. We show that the same set of pay-offs can result in coordination-like or coexistence-like games depending on the strategic decision of each player type. We also solve an inverse problem to find a d d -player game that reproduces the same fixation pattern of the VSGT. In the sequel, we consider a game involving prosocial and antisocial players, i.e., individuals who tend to play with large groups and small groups, respectively. In this game, a certain task should be performed, that will benefit one of the participants at the expense of the other players. We show that individuals able to gather large groups to perform the task may prevail, even if this task is costly, providing a possible scenario for the evolution of eusociality. The next example shows that different strategies regarding game size may lead to spontaneous separation of different types, a possible scenario for speciation without physical separation (sympatric speciation). In the last example, we generalize to three types of populations from the previous analysis and study compartmental epidemic models: in particular, we recast the SIRS model into the VSGT framework: Susceptibles play 2-player games, while Infectious and Removed play a 1-player game. The SIRS epidemic model is then obtained as the replicator equation of the VSGT. We finish with possible applications of VSGT to be addressed in the future.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is a contributing factor to asthma severity; while it has long been understood that obesity is related to greater asthma burden, the mechanisms though which this occurs have not been fully elucidated. One common explanation is that obesity mechanically reduces lung volume through accumulation of adipose tissue external to the thoracic cavity. However, it has been recently demonstrated that there is substantial adipose tissue within the airway wall itself, and that the presence of adipose tissue within the airway wall is related to body mass index. This suggests the possibility of an additional mechanism by which obesity may worsen asthma, namely by altering the behaviour of the airways themselves. To this end, we modify Anafi &amp; Wilson’s classic model of the bistable terminal airway to incorporate adipose tissue within the airway wall in order to answer the question of how much adipose tissue would be required in order to drive substantive functional changes. This analysis suggests that adipose tissue within the airway wall on the order of 1%–2% of total airway cross-sectional area could be sufficient to drive meaningful changes, and further that these changes may interact with volume effects to magnify the overall burden.},

  abstract     = {Fish schooling has the improvement in hydrodynamic propulsive efficiency through the interaction of flow field induced by fish bodies and tail beat. Such energy-saving behaviors due to flow interactions also occur with changes in the flow field caused by structures. We examined the differences between a live fish swimming around a streamlined hydrofoil model prepared to represent fish body and swimming alone in a flow tank. We observed that the fish can remain in the same place without tail beating. It called “drafting” behavior. The analysis of fish drafting showed that fish obtained thrust using a local pressure drop caused by the high velocity flow even in the vicinity of the hydrofoil model at an angle of attack α of 10° to 20°without flow separation, and fish balanced forces by using an α of fish body. This tendency was confirmed in the model experiment using a two-axis load cell, and the forces acting on the fish body was the smallest value when the fish model was placed in the same conditions as a live fish experiment. We also confirmed by simulation and found that the α of fish body generated lift force and counteract the suction force. Above results indicate that a fish can balance the anterior–posterior and lateral direction forces by using a local pressure drop around a hydrofoil model as suction force, and using angle of attack on its body, thereby realizing drafting.},

  abstract     = {The standard consolidation theory states that short-term memories located in the hippocampus enable the consolidation of long-term memories in the neocortex. In other words, the neocortex slowly learns long-term memories with a transient support of the hippocampus that quickly learns unstable memories. However, it is not clear yet what could be the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences in learning rates and memory time-scales. Here, we propose a novel modeling approach of the standard consolidation theory, that focuses on its potential neurobiological mechanisms. In addition to synaptic plasticity and spike frequency adaptation, our model incorporates adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus as well as the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus, that we associate with distance-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also take into account the interconnected spatial structure of the involved brain areas, by incorporating the above neurobiological mechanisms in a coupled neural field framework, where each area is represented by a separate neural field with intra- and inter-area connections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply neural fields to this process. Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we explore the short-term and long-term dynamics of the model upon alternance of phases of hippocampal replay and retrieval cue of an external input. This external input is encodable as a memory pattern in the form of a multiple bump attractor pattern in the individual neural fields. In the model, hippocampal memory patterns become encoded first, before neocortical ones, because of the smaller distances between the bumps of the hippocampal memory patterns. As a result, retrieval of the input pattern in the neocortex at short time-scales necessitates the additional input delivered by the memory pattern of the hippocampus. Neocortical memory patterns progressively consolidate at longer times, up to a point where their retrieval does not need the support of the hippocampus anymore. At longer times, perturbation of the hippocampal neural fields by neurogenesis erases the hippocampus pattern, leading to a final state where the memory pattern is exclusively evoked in the neocortex. Therefore, the dynamics of our model successfully reproduces the main features of the standard consolidation theory. This suggests that neurogenesis in the hippocampus and distance-dependent synaptic plasticity coupled to synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation, are indeed critical neurobiological processes in memory consolidation.},

We simulate the proliferation of mitochondrial deletion mutants amongst a population of wild-type in human neurons. Mitochondria play a key role in ATP generation. Clonal expansion can lead to the wild-type being overwhelmed by deletions such that a diminished population can no longer fulfil a cell’s energy requirement, eventually leading to its demise. The intention of uncoupling is to reduce the formation of deletion mutants by reducing mutation rate. However, a consequence of uncoupling is that the energy production efficacy is also reduced which in turn increases wild-type copy number in order to compensate for the energy deficit. The results of this paper showed that uncoupling reduced the severity of dementia, however, there was some increase in cognitive dysfunction pre-onset of dementia. The effectiveness of uncoupling was dependent upon the timing of intervention relative to the onset of dementia and would necessitate predicting its onset many years in advance.},

We introduce a mathematical model of a glycan generalist and a mucin specialist in a two-compartment chemostat model of the human colon. Our objective is to characterize the influence of dietary fiber and mucin supply on the abundance of mucin-degrading species within the gut ecosystem. Current mathematical gut reactor models that include the enzymatic degradation of glycans do not differentiate between glycan types and their degraders. The model we present distinguishes between a generalist that can degrade both dietary fiber and mucin, and a specialist species that can only degrade mucin. The integrity of the colonic mucus barrier is essential for overall human health and well-being, with the mucin specialist Akkermanisa muciniphila being associated with a healthy mucus layer. Competition, particularly between the specialist and generalists like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , may lead to mucus layer erosion, especially during periods of dietary fiber deprivation. Our model treats the colon as a gut reactor system, dividing it into two compartments that represent the lumen and the mucus of the gut, resulting in a complex system of ordinary differential equations with a large and uncertain parameter space. To understand the influence of model parameters on long-term behavior, we employ a random forest classifier, a supervised machine learning method. Additionally, a variance-based sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the sensitivity of steady-state values to changes in model parameter inputs. By constructing this model, we can investigate the underlying mechanisms that control gut microbiota composition and function, free from confounding factors.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new model to simulate the progression of senile plaques, focusing on scenarios where concentrations of amyloid beta (Aβ) monomers and aggregates vary between neurons. Extracellular variations in these concentrations may arise due to limited diffusivity of Aβ monomers and a high rate of Aβ monomer production at lipid membranes, requiring a substantial concentration gradient for diffusion-driven transport of Aβ monomers. The dimensionless formulation of the model is presented, which identifies four key dimensionless parameters governing the solutions for Aβ monomer and aggregate concentrations, as well as the radius of a growing Aβ plaque within the control volume. These parameters include the dimensionless diffusivity of Aβ monomers, the dimensionless rate of Aβ monomer production, and the dimensionless half-lives of Aβ monomers and aggregates. A dimensionless parameter is then introduced to evaluate the validity of the lumped capacitance approximation. An approximate solution is derived for the scenario involving large diffusivity of Aβ monomers and dysfunctional protein degradation machinery, resulting in infinitely long half-lives for Aβ monomers and aggregates. In this scenario, the concentrations of Aβ aggregates and the radius of the Aβ plaque depend solely on a single dimensionless parameter that characterizes the rate of Aβ monomer production. According to the approximate solution, the concentration of Aβ aggregates is linearly dependent on the rate of monomer production, and the radius of an Aβ plaque is directly proportional to the cube root of the rate of monomer production. However, when departing from the conditions of the approximate solution (e.g., finite half-lives), the concentrations of Aβ monomers and aggregates, along with the plaque radius, exhibit complex dependencies on all four dimensionless parameters. For instance, under physiological half-life conditions, the plaque radius reaches a maximum value and stabilizes thereafter.},

Much is known about the evolution of ecological differentiation and reproductive isolation during single speciation events, but exactly how those processes scale up to complete adaptive radiations is less understood. Do we expect complete reproductive barriers between newly formed species before the ecological differentiation continues, or does proper species formation occur much later, long after the ecological diversification? Our goal is to improve our mechanistic understanding of adaptive radiations by analyzing an individual-based model that includes a suite of mechanisms that are known to contribute to biodiversity. The model includes variable biogeographic settings, ecological opportunities, and types of mate choice, which makes several different scenarios of an adaptive radiation possible. We find that evolving clades tend to exploit ecological opportunities early whereas reproductive barriers evolve later, demonstrating a decoupling of ecological differentiation and species formation. In many cases, we also find a long-term trend where assortative mating associated with ecological traits is replaced by sexual selection of neutral display traits as the primary mechanism for reproductive isolation. Our results propose that reticulate phylogenies are likely common and stem from initially low reproductive barriers, rather than the previously suggested idea of repeated hybridization events between well-separated species.},

But the NPIs also affected the transmission of viruses causing non-target seasonal respiratory diseases, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In many countries, the NPIs were found to reduce cases of such seasonal respiratory diseases, but there is also evidence that subsequent relaxation of NPIs led to outbreaks of these diseases that were larger than pre-pandemic ones, due to the accumulation of susceptible individuals prior to relaxation. Therefore, the net long-term effects of NPIs on the total disease burden of non-target diseases remain unclear. Knowledge of this is important for infectious disease management and maintenance of public health. In this study, we shed light on this issue for the simplified scenario of a set of NPIs that prevent or reduce transmission of a seasonal respiratory disease for about a year and are then removed, using mathematical analyses and numerical simulations of a suite of four epidemiological models with varying complexity and generality. The model parameters were estimated using empirical data pertaining to seasonal respiratory diseases and covered a wide range. Our results showed that NPIs reduced the total disease burden of a non-target seasonal respiratory disease in the long-term. Expressed as a percentage of population size, the reduction was greater for larger values of the basic reproduction number and the immunity loss rate, reflecting larger outbreaks and hence more infections averted by imposition of NPIs. Our study provides a foundation for exploring the effects of NPIs on total disease burden in more-complex scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In the current paper we analyse an extended SIRS epidemic model in which immunity at the individual level wanes gradually at exponential rate, but where the waning rate may differ between individuals, for instance as an effect of differences in immune systems. The model also includes vaccination schemes aimed to reach and maintain herd immunity. We consider both the informed situation where the individual waning parameters are known, thus allowing selection of vaccinees being based on both time since last vaccination as well as on the individual waning rate, and the more likely uninformed situation where individual waning parameters are unobserved, thus only allowing vaccination schemes to depend on time since last vaccination. The optimal vaccination policies for both the informed and uniformed heterogeneous situation are derived and compared with the homogeneous waning model (meaning all individuals have the same immunity waning rate), as well as to the classic SIRS model where immunity at the individual level drops from complete immunity to complete susceptibility in one leap. It is shown that the classic SIRS model requires least vaccines, followed by the SIRS with homogeneous gradual waning, followed by the informed situation for the model with heterogeneous gradual waning. The situation requiring most vaccines for herd immunity is the most likely scenario, that immunity wanes gradually with unobserved individual heterogeneity. For parameter values chosen to mimic COVID-19 and assuming perfect initial immunity and cumulative immunity of 12 months, the classic homogeneous SIRS epidemic suggests that vaccinating individuals every 15 months is sufficient to reach and maintain herd immunity, whereas the uninformed case for exponential waning with rate heterogeneity corresponding to a coefficient of variation being 0.5, requires that individuals instead need to be vaccinated every 4.4 months.},

  abstract     = {Cancer therapy often leads to the selective elimination of drug-sensitive cells from the tumour. This can favour the growth of cells resistant to the therapeutic agent, ultimately causing a tumour relapse. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a well-characterised instance of this phenomenon. In CRPC, after systemic androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a subset of drug-resistant cancer cells autonomously produce testosterone, thus enabling tumour regrowth. A previous theoretical study has shown that such a tumour relapse can be delayed by inhibiting the growth of drug-resistant cells using biotic competition from drug-sensitive cells. In this context, the centrality of resource dynamics to intra-tumour competition in the CRPC system indicates clear scope for the construction of theoretical models that can explicitly incorporate the underlying mechanisms of tumour ecology. In the current study, we use a modified logistic framework to model cell–cell interactions in terms of the production and consumption of resources. Our results show that steady state composition of CRPC can be understood as a composite function of the availability and utilisation efficiency of two resources-oxygen and testosterone. In particular, we show that the effect of changing resource availability or use efficiency is conditioned by their general abundance regimes. Testosterone typically functions in trace amounts and thus affects steady state behaviour of the CRPC system differently from oxygen, which is usually available at higher levels. Our data thus indicate that explicit consideration of resource dynamics can produce novel and useful mechanistic understanding of CRPC. Furthermore, such a modelling approach also incorporates variables into the system’s description that can be directly measured in a clinical context. This is therefore a promising avenue of research in cancer ecology that could lead to therapeutic approaches that are more clearly rooted in the biology of CRPC.},

  abstract     = {Chemotaxis, cell migration in response to chemical gradients, is known to promote self-organization of microbiological populations. However, the modeling of chemotaxis in heterogeneous environments is still limited. This study analyzes a decentralized gathering process in environments with physical as well as chemical barriers, using a multi-agent model for Disctyostelium discoideum colonies. Employing a topology-independent metric to quantify the system evolution, we study dynamical features emerging from complex social interactions. The results show that obstacles may hamper the gathering process by altering the flux of chemical signals among amoebas, acting as local topological perturbations. We also find that a minimal set of agent’s rules for robust gathering does not require explicit mechanisms for obstacle sensing and avoidance; moreover, random cell movements concur in preventing multiple stable clusters and improve the gathering efficacy. Hence, we speculate that chemotactic cells can avoid obstacles without needing specialized mechanisms: tradeoffs of social interactions and individual fluctuations are sufficient to guarantee the aggregation of the whole colony past numerous obstacles.},

To predict ICT response, we developed a multi-modal feature fusion model based on deep learning (MFMDL). This model utilizes graph neural networks to map gene-gene relationships in gene networks to low dimensional vector spaces, and then fuses biological pathway features and immune cell infiltration features to make robust predictions of ICT. We used five datasets to validate the predictive performance of the MFMDL. These five datasets span multiple types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. We found that the prediction performance of multi-modal feature fusion model based on deep learning is superior to other traditional ICT biomarkers, such as ICT targets or tumor microenvironment-associated markers. In addition, we also conducted ablation experiments to demonstrate the necessity of fusing different modal features, which can improve the prediction accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {The success of individual species under a change to the environment is dependent on a number of factors, which include the changes to habitat, competition with other species and adaptability. Here we investigate the impact of differing dispersal characteristics of two competing species responding to the change using an idealized spatio-temporal model. The rate of dispersion is given by a combination of the growth term and the form of the diffusion term, which is set to give either normal diffusion or anomalous (super) diffusion. The later is brought about by employing fractional diffusion and we characterize the population as being more adventurous than the population undergoing normal diffusion. The more adventurous population is found, not surprisingly, to reach and occupy uninhabited ground before the population undergoing normal diffusion can get there. Interbreeding is found to be important in that it can aid the spread of the less adventurous population preventing its extinction. The response to an abrupt environment change, taken here to be a change in the distribution of the growth rate, is dependent on the initial conditions, the dispersion characteristics, and the level of interbreeding, leading to very different intermediate and final states. Our results highlight instances when a particular dispersal strategy gives a population an edge over another. In the cases considered here we find states where the more adventurous population can dominate across the domain, the two populations exist in separate parts of the domain separated by fronts, and both populations coexist across the domain in the medium term with one or other of the populations dominating across the domain in the long term. Given the long time to reach equilibrium where one or other of the populations dominate, consideration needs to be put to the time scale of change, as sufficiently frequent change can allow coexistence. We demonstrate the need to include dispersion characteristics when considering the factors affecting the response of species to a change in the environment.},

While mass drug administration (MDA) is a primary strategy recommended by WHO, the use of insecticide treated nets (ITN) plays a crucial role as an alternative strategy when MDA cannot be used. In this paper, we use imitation dynamics to incorporate human behavior and voluntary use of ITN into the compartmental epidemiological model of LF transmission. We find the equilibrium states of the dynamics and the ITN usage as it depends on epidemiological parameters and the cost of ITNs. We investigate the conditions under which the voluntary use of ITNs can keep the LF prevalence under the 1% threshold. We found that when the cost of using the ITNs is about 1 0 5 105 smaller than the perceived cost of LF, then the voluntary use of ITNs will eliminate LF as a public health concern. Furthermore, when the ITNs are given away for free, our model predicts that over 80% of the population will use them which would eliminate LF completely in regions where Anopheles are the primary vectors.},

To predict the behavioral change relevant to the epidemic situation (e.g., the number of reported cases), we need to know the epidemic situation at the moment of decision, which is difficult to identify from the records of actually performed human mobility. In this study, the largest travel accommodation reservation data covering half of the existed accommodations in Japan was analyzed to observe decision-making timings and how it responded to the changing epidemic situation during Japan’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 until February 2023. To this end, we measured mobility avoidance index proposed in Ito et al., 2022 to indicate people&#39;s decision of mobility avoidance and quantified it using the time-series of the accommodation booking/cancellation data. We observed matches of the peak dates of the mobility avoidance and the number of reported cases, and mobility avoidance changed proportional to the logarithmic number of reported cases. We also found that the slope of mobility avoidance against the change of the logarithmic number of reported cases were similar among the epidemic waves, while the intercept of that was much reduced as the first epidemic wave passed by. People measure the intensity of epidemic by logarithm of the number of reported cases. The sensitivity of their response is established during the first wave and the people&#39;s response became weakened after the first experience, as if the number of reported cases were multiplied by a constant small factor.},

  abstract     = {Understanding how ecosystems respond to their environmental temperature is a major challenge. Thermodynamic constraints on species’ metabolic rates are expected to affect ecosystem characteristics, but species interactions and interspecific variation in physiological thermal response curves (TRC) may obscure ecosystem-level responses to temperature. As a result, macroecological patterns related to temperature are still poorly understood. We investigate how physiological TRC scale up to ecosystem-level thermal responses by modifying the Tangled Nature (TaNa) model, a stochastic network model of ecology and evolution. We include new parameterizations that make reproduction, death, and mutation temperature-dependent. We find that ecosystem survival probability depends on how the minimum fitness required for species survival varies with temperature. The thermal response of ecosystem survival probability is the only ecosystem property that is sensitive to interspecific variation in TRC. Species richness scales up directly from the TRC of mutation rate, and average species population sizes are inversely related to mutation rate, with Species Abundance Distributions (SADs) exhibiting more rare species in warmer temperatures. Interactions between species are also inversely related to mutation, with positive interactions occurring more frequently in colder temperatures. The abundance of surviving ecosystems is not sensitive to temperature. This work helps clarify the specific relationships between physiological responses to temperature and ecosystem-level repercussions when species are interacting and adapting to their thermal environments.},

This is achieved by introducing a bio-inspired damage that represents the growing tumor, which subsequently affects the main populations involved in the remodeling process, namely, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and bone tissue. The model is constructed using a set of differential equations based on the Komarova’s and Ayati’s models, modified to incorporate the bio-inspired damage that may result in tumor mass formation. Three distinct models were developed. The first two models are based on the Komarova’s governing equations, with one demonstrating an osteolytic behavior and the second one an osteoblastic model. The third model is a variation of Ayati’s model, where the bio-inspired damage is induced through the paracrine and autocrine parameters, exhibiting an osteolytic behavior. The obtained results are consistent with existing literature, leading us to believe that our in-silico experiments will serve as a cornerstone for paving the way towards targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life for those affected by these conditions.},

In line with kin selection theory, many social species tend to cluster into distinct groups in order to enhance their overall population fitness. Temporal interactions between populations are often modelled using classical mathematical models, but these sometimes fail to delve deeper into the, often uncertain, relationships within populations. Here, we introduce a stochastic framework that aims to capture the interactions of animal groups and an auxiliary population over time. We demonstrate the model’s capabilities, from a Bayesian perspective, through simulation studies and by fitting it to predator–prey count time series data. We then derive an approximation to the group correlation structure within such a population, while also taking account of the effect of the auxiliary population. We finally discuss how this approximation can lead to ecologically realistic interpretations in a predator–prey context. This approximation also serves as verification to whether the population in question satisfies our various assumptions. Our modelling approach will be useful for empiricists for monitoring groups within a conservation framework and also theoreticians wanting to quantify interactions, to study cooperation and other phenomena within social populations.},

These properties are determined by using the general analytical solution of the unknown input observability problem, introduced very recently in Martinelli (2022). This solution provides the systematic procedures able to determine the state observability and the parameter identifiability of any ODE model, in particular, even in the presence of time varying parameters. Four variants of the HIV model are investigated. They differ because some of their parameters are considered constant or time varying. Fundamental new properties, which also highlight an error in the scientific literature, are automatically determined and discussed. Additionally, for each variant, the paper provides a quantitative answer to the following practical question: What is the minimal external information (external to the available measurements of the system outputs) required to make observable the state and identifiable all the model parameters? The answer to this fundamental question is obtained by exploiting the concept of continuous symmetry, recently introduced in Martinelli (2019). This concept allows us to determine a first preliminary general result which is then applied to the HIV model. Finally, for each variant, the paper concludes by providing a redefinition of the state and of the parameters in order to obtain a full description of the system only in terms of a state which is observable and a set of parameters which are identifiable (both constant and time varying).},

Given the confirmatory diagnosis of COVID-19, a death event that was not necessarily caused by respiratory complications but stemmed from other complications was categorized as an indirect death from COVID-19. Associated deaths occurred in patients who did not have COVID-19 but died during the surge in COVID-19 cases when overwhelming pressure was exerted on the healthcare system. Analyzing the sixth wave (i.e., the first epidemic wave of the Omicron B.1.1.529 variant from January to May 2022), decomposition was achieved using the binomial and Poisson sampling process models fitted to two pieces of data (i.e., COVID-19 death certificate and excess data by major cause of death). The total numbers of direct, indirect, and associated deaths during the sixth wave in Osaka were estimated at 1,071; 948; and 2,157; respectively. The number of associated deaths was greater than the sum of direct and indirect deaths. We further observed that the composition of indirect and associated deaths differed by major cause of death, and deaths caused by circulatory disease included a greater proportion of indirect deaths compared with deaths by other causes. The goals of healthcare services for endemic COVID-19 include the sustainable provision of services to avoid preventable deaths. Therefore, gaining an in-depth understanding of mechanisms that lead to excess death is vital for improving future pandemic response efforts.},

  abstract     = {Surface-feeding aquatic animals navigate towards the source of water disturbances and must differentiate prey from other environmental stimuli. Medicinal leeches locate prey, in part, using a distribution of mechanosensory hairs along their body that deflect under fluid flow. Leech’s behavioral responses to surface wave temporal frequency are well documented. However, a surface wave’s temporal frequency depends on many underlying environmental and fluid properties that vary substantially in natural habitats (e.g., water depth, temperature). The impact of these variables on neural response and behavior is unknown. Here, we developed a physics-based leech mechanosensor model to examine the impact of environmental and fluid properties on neural response. Our model used the physical properties of a leech cilium and was verified against existing behavioral and electrophysiological data. The model’s peak response occurred with waves where the effects of gravity and surface tension were nearly equal (i.e., the phase velocity minimum). This suggests that preferred stimuli are related to the interaction between fundamental properties of the surrounding medium and the mechanical properties of the sensor. This interaction likely tunes the sensor to detect the nondispersive components of the signal, filtering out irrelevant ambient stimuli, and may be a general property of cilia across the animal kingdom.},

  abstract     = {Studies have shown that the internal structure of modules is hardly important for the spread of epidemics. However, most of these studies have assumed that intra-module connectivity and inter-module connectivity do not affect each other. In reality, changes in the internal structure of modules may affect inter-module links and thus change the modularity of the entire network. Therefore, we have developed a theoretical network model with adjustable modularity to investigate the impact of this situation on disease transmission. Our findings indicate that the intra-module structure plays a crucial role in disease outbreaks. Changes in intra-module structure lead to significant numerical changes in peak prevalence and duration of disease. This implies that the potential impact of changes in exposure patterns within modules should also be considered when investigating the exact impact of modular social networks on disease burden.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen (O 2 ) regulated pathways modulate B cell activation, migration and proliferation during infection, vaccination, and other diseases. Modeling these pathways in health and disease is critical to understand B cell states and ways to mediate them. To characterize B cells by their activation of O 2 regulated pathways we develop pathway specific discrete state models using previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from isolated B cells. Specifically, Single Cell Boolean Omics Network Invariant-Time Analysis (scBONITA) was used to infer logic gates for known pathway topologies. The simplest inferred set of logic gates that maximized the number of “OR” interactions between genes was used to simulate B cell networks involved in oxygen sensing until they reached steady network states (attractors). By focusing on the attractors that best represented sequenced cells, we identified genes critical in determining pathway specific cellular states that corresponded to diseased and healthy B cell phenotypes. Specifically, we investigate the transendothelial migration, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, HIF1A, and Citrate Cycle pathways. Our analysis revealed attractors that resembled the state of B cell exhaustion in HIV+ patients as well as attractors that promoted anerobic metabolism, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis in breast cancer patients, which were eliminated after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Finally, we investigated the attractors to which the Azimuth-annotated B cells mapped and found that attractors resembling B cells from HIV+ patients encompassed a significantly larger number of atypical memory B cells than HIV− attractors. Meanwhile, attractors resembling B cells from breast cancer patients post NACT encompassed a reduced number of atypical memory B cells compared to pre-NACT attractors.},

Furthermore, using the model, we investigated the impact of modeled components on treatment outcomes.

Viral rebound caused by resistance mutations or latent reservoirs has been studied mathematically. In this study, we investigated the viral rebound due to other causes. Since immunity is weaker during antiviral treatment than without the treatment, drug discontinuation may lead to an increase in the viral load. We analyzed the dynamics of the number of virus-infected cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and memory cells and identified the conditions under which the viral load increased upon drug discontinuation. If drug is administered for an extended period, a viral rebound occurs when the ratio of viral growth rate in the absence to that in the presence of the antiviral drug exceeds the “rebound threshold.” We analyzed how the rebound threshold depended on the patient&#39;s conditions and the type of treatment. Mathematical and numerical analyses revealed that rebound after discontinuation was more likely to occur when the drug effectively reduced viral proliferation, drug discontinuation was delayed, and the processes activating immune responses directly were stronger than those occurring indirectly through immune memory formation. We discussed additional reasons for drugs to cause viral rebound more likely.},

We find that the critical value of the dispersal rate increases significantly with the size of the metacommunity for both unidirectional and bidirectional dispersals, which in turn corroborates that larger metacommunities are more stable than smaller ones. Further, we find that the critical value of the dispersal for the onset of generalized synchronization is smaller(larger) for bidirectional dispersal than that for unidirectional dispersal for smaller(larger) metacommunities. Most importantly, complete synchronization error remains finite even after the onset of generalized synchronization in a wider range of dispersal rate elucidating that the latter can serve as an early warning signal for the extinction of the metacommunity.},

In the present study, a dissipative particle dynamics model was formulated to simulate the motion, adhesion, activation, and aggregation of platelets, with the aim of elucidating the mechanisms of in-stent thrombosis. The findings suggest that stent thrombosis arises from a complex interplay of multiple factors, including endothelial injury resulting from stent implantation and alterations in the hemodynamic milieu. Furthermore, the results suggest a noteworthy association between in-stent thrombosis and both the length of the endothelial injured site and the degree of stent malposition. Specifically, the incidence of stent thrombosis appears to rise in tandem with the extent of the injured site, while moderate stent malposition is more likely to result in in-stent thrombosis compared to severe or minor malposition. This study offers novel research avenues for investigating the plasticity mechanism of stent thrombosis, while also facilitating the clinical prediction of stent thrombosis formation and the development of more precise treatment strategies.},

Its regulation mechanisms are unclear, and a number of questions regarding diffusional limitation, pathways of assembly and substrate delivery remain open. We develop and analyze here a detailed mechanism-driven computer model of intrinsic tenase on phospholipid surfaces. Three-dimensional reaction–diffusion-advection and stochastic simulations were used where appropriate. Dynamics of the system was predominantly non-stationary under physiological conditions. In order to describe experimental data, we had to assume both membrane-dependent and solution-dependent delivery of the substrate. The former pathway dominated at low cofactor concentration, while the latter became important at low phospholipid concentration. Factor VIIIa-factor X complex formation was the major pathway of the complex assembly, and the model predicted high affinity for their lipid-dependent interaction. Although the model predicted formation of the diffusion-limited layer of substrate for some conditions, the effects of this limitation on the fXa production were small. Flow accelerated fXa production in a flow reactor model by bringing in fIXa and fVIIIa rather than fX. This analysis suggests a concept of intrinsic tenase that is non-stationary, employs several pathways of substrate delivery depending on the conditions, and is not particularly limited by diffusion of the substrate.},

In this paper, we build a broader family of multivariate distributions: the Polya-splitting distributions. We show that they emerge naturally as stationary distributions of a multivariate birth–death process. This family of distributions is a consistent extension of non-zero sum neutral models based on a master equation approach. It allows considering both total abundance of the community and relative abundances of species. We emphasize that this family is large enough to encompass various dependence structures among species. We also introduce the strong closure under addition property that can be useful to generate nested multi-level dependence structures. Although all Pólya splitting distributions do not share this property, we provide numerous example verifying it. They include the previously known example with independent species, and also new ones with alternative dependence structures. Overall, we advocate that Polya-splitting distribution should become a part of the classic toolbox for the analysis of multivariate count data in ecology, providing alternative approaches to joint species distribution framework. Comparatively, our approach allows to model dependencies between species at the observation level, while the classical JSDM’s model dependencies at the latent process strata.},

This framework employs the non-negative lasso (NN-LASSO) algorithm to forge a link between an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based population model and a cellular evolution model. The findings of our current work not only affirm the impact of subclonal composition on growth dynamics but also identify two significant subclones within heterogeneous growth patterns. Moreover, the subclonal compositions at the initial time are able to accurately discriminate diverse growth patterns through a machine learning algorithm. The proposed multiscale framework successfully delineates the intricate landscape of cancer evolution, bridging the gap between long-term growth dynamics and short-term measurements, both in simulated and real-world data. This methodology provides a novel avenue for thorough exploration into the realm of cancer evolution.},

Hyperparasites are common in nature, with the chestnut blight fungus virus CHV-1 a well-known natural example, but also notably include the phages of important human bacterial diseases. We build a general modeling framework for the evolution of hyperparasites that highlights the central role that the ability of a hyperparasite to be transmitted with its parasite plays in their evolution. A key result is that hyperparasites which transmit with their parasite hosts (hitchhike) will be selected for lower virulence, trending towards hypermutualism or hypercommensalism. We examine the impact on the evolution of hyperparasite systems of a wide range of host and parasite traits showing, for example, that high parasite virulence selects for higher hyperparasite virulence resulting in reductions in parasite virulence when hyperparasitized. Furthermore, we show that acute parasite infection will also select for increased hyperparasite virulence. Our results have implications for hyperparasite research, both as biocontrol agents and for their role in shaping community ecology and evolution and moreover emphasize the importance of understanding evolution in the context of multitrophic interactions.},

  abstract     = {The dominant paradigm for modeling the obesity-induced T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus) today focuses on glucose and insulin regulatory systems, diabetes pathways, and diagnostic test evaluations. The problem with this approach is that it is not possible to explicitly account for the glucose transport mechanism from the blood to the liver, where the glucose is stored, and from the liver to the blood. This makes it inaccurate, if not incorrect, to properly model the concentration of glucose in the blood in comparison to actual glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test results. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of glucose dynamics by a system of ODEs. The model includes the mechanism of glucose transport from the blood to the liver, and from the liver to the blood, and explains how obesity is likely to lead to T2DM. We use the model to evaluate the efficacy of an anti-T2DM drug that also reduces weight.},

  abstract     = {Fat cells, called adipocytes, are designed to regulate energy homeostasis by storing energy in the form of lipids. Adipocyte size distribution is assumed to play a role in the development of obesity-related diseases. These cells that do not have a characteristic size, indeed a bimodal size distribution is observed in adipose tissue . We propose a model based on a partial differential equation to describe adipocyte size distribution. The model includes a description of the lipid fluxes and the cell size fluctuations and using a formulation of a stationary solution fast computation of bimodal distribution is achieved. We investigate the parameter identifiability and estimate parameter values with CMA-ES algorithm. We first validate the procedure on synthetic data, then we estimate parameter values with experimental data of 32 rats. We discuss the estimated parameter values and their variability within the population, as well as the relation between estimated values and their biological significance. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to specify the influence of parameters on cell size distribution and explain the differences between the model and the measurements. The proposed framework enables the characterization of adipocyte size distribution with four parameters and can be easily adapted to measurements of cell size distribution in different health conditions.},

The densities of cells and molecules are described by coupled reaction–diffusion partial differential equations, and the plane wavefront propagation speeds can be obtained analytically and verified numerically. It is found that with ACD the population and propagation of stem cells can be promoted but the negative regulation on self-renewal and differentiation will work slowly. Regulatory inhibition on differentiation will inversely increase stem cells but not affect the population and wave propagation of the cell lineage. While negative regulation on self-renewal and ACD will decrease the population of stem cells and slow down the propagation, and even drive stem cells to extinction. Moreover we find that inhibition on self-renewal has a strength advantage while inhibition on ACD has a range advantage to kill stem cells.

  abstract     = {Migrating cells traverse a range of topographic configurations presented by the native extracellular environment to conduct their physiologic functions. It is well documented cells can modulate their behaviour in response to different topographic features, finding promising applications in biomaterial and bioimplant design. It is useful, in these areas of research, to be able to predict which topographic arrangements could be used to promote certain patterns of migration prior to laboratory experimentation. Despite a profusion of study and interest shown in these fields by experimentalists, the related modelling literature is as yet relatively sparse and tend to focus more on either cell–matrix interaction or morphological responses of cells. We propose a mathematical model for individual cell migration based on an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, and set out to see if the model can be used to predict migration patterns on 2-d isotropic and anisotropic topographies, whose characteristics can be broadly described as either uniform flat, uniform linear with variable ridge density or non-uniform disordered with variable feature density. Results suggest the model is capable of producing realistic patterns of migration for flat and linear topographic patterns, with calibrated output closely approximating NIH3T3 fibroblast migration behaviour derived from an experimental dataset, in which migration linearity increased with ridge density and average speed was highest at intermediate ridge densities. Exploratory results for non-uniform disordered topographies suggest cell migration patterns may adopt disorderedness present in the topography and that ‘distortion’ introduced to linear topographic patterns may not impede linear guidance of migration, given its magnitude is bounded within certain limits. We conclude that an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck based model for topographically influenced migration may be useful to predict patterns of migration behaviour for certain isotropic (flat) and anisotropic (linear) topographies in the NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line, but additional investigation is required to predict with confidence migration patterns for non-uniform disordered topographic arrangements.},

  abstract     = {Many-to-many mapping of form-to-function posits that multiple morphological and physiological traits affect the performance of multiple tasks in an organism, and that redundancy and multitasking occur simultaneously to shape the evolution of an organism’s phenotype. Many-to-many mapping is expected to be ubiquitous in nature, yet little is known about how it influences the evolution of organismal phenotype. The F -matrix is a powerful tool to study these issues because it describes how multiple traits affect multiple tasks. We undertook a simulation study using the F -matrix to test how the number of traits and the number of tasks affect trait integration and evolvability, as well as the relationships among tasks. We found that as the number of traits and/or tasks increases, the relationships between the tasks and the integration between the traits become weaker, and that the evolvability of the traits increases, all resulting in a system that is freer to evolve. We also found that as the number of traits increases, performance tradeoffs tend to become weaker, but only to a point. Our work shows that it is important to consider not only multiple traits, but also the multitude of tasks that those traits carry out when studying form-function relationships. We suggest that evolution of these relationships follows functional lines of least resistance, which are less defined in more complex systems, resulting in a mechanism for diversification.},

  abstract     = {The role of Ca 2+ release-activated Ca 2+ (CRAC) channels mediated by ORAI isoforms in calcium signalling has been extensively investigated. It has been shown that the presence or absence of different isoforms has a significant effect on store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Yoast et al. (2020) showed that, in addition to the reported narrow-spike oscillations (whereby cytosolic calcium decreases quickly after a sharp increase), ORAI1 knockout HEK293 cells were able to oscillate with broad-spike oscillations (whereby cytosolic calcium decreases in a prolonged manner after a sharp increase) when stimulated with a muscarinic agonist . This suggests that Ca 2+ influx through ORAI-mediated CRAC channels negatively regulates the duration of Ca 2+ oscillations. We hypothesise that, through the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), ORAI1 negatively regulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity to decrease inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ) production and limit the duration of agonist-evoked Ca 2+ oscillations. Based on this hypothesis, we construct a new mathematical model, which shows that the formation of broad-spike oscillations is highly dependent on the absence of ORAI1. Predictions of this model are consistent with the experimental results.},

In this study, we develop a comprehensive mathematical model that incorporates two stages of PO 4 3 − PO43− uptake and accounts for transport time delay. The model parameter values are determined by fitting experimental data of Prorocentrum donghaiense and the model is validated using experimental data of Karenia mikimotoi . The numerical results demonstrate that the model successfully captures the general characteristics of algal growth and PO 4 3 − PO43− uptake under PO 4 3 − PO43− sufficient conditions. Significantly, the experimental and mathematical findings suggest that the time delay associated with the transfer of PO 4 3 − PO43− from the surface-adsorbed PO 4 3 − PO43− ( P s Ps ) pool to the intracellular PO 4 3 − PO43− ( P i Pi ) pool may serve as a physiologically plausible mechanism leading to oscillations of algal cell quota. These results have important implications for resource managers, enabling them to predict and deepen their understanding of harmful algal blooms.},

Though imposed measures to control these pathogens are generally ineffective, even among susceptible taxa, some hosts can limit bacterial loads and symptom expression. Mechanisms by which this resistance is achieved are poorly understood. In particular, it is still unknown how differences in vascular structure may influence biofilm growth and spread within a host. To address this, we developed a novel theoretical framework to describe biofilm behaviour within xylem vessels, adopting a polymer-based modelling approach. We then parameterised the model to investigate the relevance of xylem vessel diameters on Xylella fastidiosa resistance among olive cultivars. The functionality of all vessels was severely reduced under infection, with hydraulic flow reductions of 2–3 orders of magnitude. However, results suggest wider vessels act as biofilm incubators; allowing biofilms to develop over a long time while still transporting them through the vasculature. By contrast, thinner vessels become blocked much earlier, limiting biofilm spread. Using experimental data on vessel diameter distributions, we were able to determine that a mechanism of resistance in the olive cultivar Leccino is a relatively low abundance of the widest vessels, limiting X. fastidiosa spread.},

For instance, Pelodiscus sinensis exhibits distinct black patterns on its vivid orange plastron during the embryonic and juvenile stages, but as it matures, the black patterns gradually disappear, resulting in a whitened plastron. This pattern transition is a mysterious phenomenon that forms and vanishes on the plastron, a ventral part with low visibility to both predators and peers. Our research aims to focus on understanding the mechanisms behind such pattern transitions and proposes a model capable of representing pattern formation and dispersion. To understand the changing patterns, we propose a hypothesis based on a reaction–diffusion system with a time-dependent growing spatial domain. This mathematical framework suggests the occurrence of the dispersion phenomenon. Specifically, we focus on the dilution term within the system under the growing-domain condition. While previous studies have investigated the effects of growth domains, this study specifically addresses the role of the time-dependently growing domain effects - change of diffusion coefficient and dilution - in reaction–diffusion systems. Our research sheds light on the intricate phenomenon of pattern formation and dispersion on the surface of living organisms, proposing a natural system based on the effects of growing domain, namely, a model of reaction-dilution-diffusion systems.},

The problem is that more common tags (markers) are more likely to be recognised and helped. This causes common tags to increase in frequency, eliminating the genetic variability that is required for genetic kin recognition. In recent years, theoretical models have resolved Crozier’s paradox in different ways, but they are based on very complicated multi-locus population genetics . Consequently, it is hard to see exactly what is going on, and whether different theoretical resolutions of Crozier’s paradox lead to different types of kin discrimination. I address this by making unrealistic simplifying assumptions to produce a more tractable and understandable model of Crozier’s paradox. I use this to interpret a more complex multi-locus population genetic model where I have not made the same simplifying assumptions. I explain how Crozier’s paradox can be resolved, and show that only one known theoretical resolution of Crozier’s paradox – multiple social encounters – leads without restrictive assumptions to the type of highly cooperative and reliable form of kin discrimination that we observe in nature. More generally, I show how adopting a methodological approach where complex models are compared with simplified ones can lead to greater understanding and accessibility.},

The core is assumed to comprise lipid membrane fragments and damaged organelles , while the halo consists of radiating alpha-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils. The Finke-Watzky model is employed to simulate the aggregation of lipid fragments and α-syn monomers. Analytical and numerical exploration of the governing equations yielded approximate solutions applicable for larger times. The application of these approximate solutions to simulate LB radius growth led to the discovery of the cube root hypothesis, which posits that the LB radius is proportional to the cube root of its growth time. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the LB radius is unaffected by the kinetic rates of nucleation and autocatalytic growth, with growth primarily regulated by the production rates of lipid membrane fragments and α-syn monomers. The model indicates that the formation of large LBs associated with PD is dependent on the malfunction of the machinery responsible for the degradation of lipid membrane fragments, α-syn monomers, and their aggregates.},

The three core phenomena of dietary behavior change, i.e., non-initiation, initiation followed by discontinuation and initiation followed by non-discontinuation, are expressed in terms of the value of the key variable representing mood or psychological energy, the fluctuation of which is the result of three causal relationships. Based on our experimental knowledge of the time evolution profile of the three causal input variables, we then proceed to a qualitative analysis of the resulting theory, i.e., we consider an over-approximation of it which, after discretization, can be expressed in the form of a finite integer-based model. Using Answer Set Programming, we show that our formal model faithfully reproduces the three phenomena and, under a certain assumption, is minimal. We generalize this result by providing all the minimal models reproducing these phenomena when the possible causal relationships exerted on mood are extended to all the other variables (not just those assumed in the informal explanation), with arbitrary causality signs. Finally, by a direct analytical resolution of an under-approximation of our theory, obtained by assuming linear causalities, as a system of linear ODEs, we find exactly the same minimal models, proving that they are also equal to the actual minimal models of our theory since these are framed below and above by the models of the under-approximation and the over-approximation. We determine which parameters need to be person-specific and which can be considered invariant, i.e., we explain inter-individual variability. Our approach could pave the way for universally accepted theories in the field of behavior change and, more broadly, in other areas of psychology.},

  abstract     = {Age-related heterogeneity in a host population, whether due to how individuals mix and contact each other, the nature of host–pathogen interactions defining epidemiological parameters, or demographics, is crucial in studying infectious disease dynamics. Compartmental models represent a popular approach to address the problem, dividing the population of interest into a discrete and finite number of states depending on, for example, individuals’ age and stage of infection. We study the corresponding linearised system whose operator, in the context of a discrete-time model, equates to a square matrix known as the next generation matrix. Performing formal perturbation analysis of the entries of the aforementioned matrix, we derive indices to quantify the age-specific variation of its dominant eigenvalue (i.e., the reproduction number) and explore the relevant epidemiological information we can derive from the eigenstructure of the matrix. The resulting method enables the assessment of the impact of age-related population heterogeneity on virus transmission. In particular, starting from an age-structured SEIR model, we demonstrate the use of this approach for COVID-19 dynamics in Belgium. We analyse the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 spread, with particular attention to the pre-pandemic framework and the lockdown lifting phase initiated as of May 2020. Our results, influenced by our assumption on age-specific susceptibility and infectiousness, support the hypothesis that transmission was only influenced to a small extent by children in the age group [ 0 , 18 ) and adults over 60 years of age during the early phases of the pandemic and up to the end of July 2020.},

  abstract     = {Microplastics pose a severe threat to marine ecosystems ; however, relevant mathematical modeling and analysis are lacking. This paper formulates two stoichiometric producer-grazer models to investigate the interactive effects of microplastics, nutrients, and light on population dynamics under different settings. One model incorporates optimal microplastic uptake and foraging behavior based on nutrient availability for natural settings, while the other model does not include foraging in laboratory settings. We establish the well-posedness of the models and examine their long-term behaviors. Our results reveal that in natural environments, producers and grazers exhibit higher sensitivity to microplastics, and the system may demonstrate bistability or tristability. Moreover, the influences of microplastics, nutrients, and light intensity are highly intertwined. The presence of microplastics amplifies the constraints on grazer growth related to food quality and quantity imposed by extreme light intensities, while elevated phosphorus input enhances the system’s resistance to intense light conditions. Furthermore, higher environmental microplastic levels do not always imply elevated microplastic body burdens in organisms, as organisms are also influenced by nutrients and light. We also find that grazers are more vulnerable to microplastics, compared to producers. If producers can utilize microplastics for growth, the system displays significantly greater resilience to microplastics.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equation (PDE) models are often used to study biological phenomena involving movement-birth–death processes, including ecological population dynamics and the invasion of populations of biological cells. Count data, by definition, is non-negative, and count data relating to biological populations is often bounded above by some carrying capacity that arises through biological competition for space or nutrients. Parameter estimation, parameter identifiability, and making model predictions usually involves working with a measurement error model that explicitly relating experimental measurements with the solution of a mathematical model. In many biological applications, a typical approach is to assume the data are normally distributed about the solution of the mathematical model. Despite the widespread use of the standard additive Gaussian measurement error model, the assumptions inherent in this approach are rarely explicitly considered or compared with other options. Here, we interpret scratch assay data, involving migration, proliferation and delays in a population of cancer cells using a reaction–diffusion PDE model. We consider relating experimental measurements to the PDE solution using a standard additive Gaussian measurement error model alongside a comparison to a more biologically realistic binomial measurement error model. While estimates of model parameters are relatively insensitive to the choice of measurement error model, model predictions for data realisations are very sensitive. The standard additive Gaussian measurement error model leads to biologically inconsistent predictions, such as negative counts and counts that exceed the carrying capacity across a relatively large spatial region within the experiment. Furthermore, the standard additive Gaussian measurement error model requires estimating an additional parameter compared to the binomial measurement error model. In contrast, the binomial measurement error model leads to biologically plausible predictions and is simpler to implement. We provide open source Julia software on GitHub to replicate all calculations in this work, and we explain how to generalise our approach to deal with coupled PDE models with several dependent variables through a multinomial measurement error model, as well as pointing out other potential generalisations by linking our work with established practices in the field of generalised linear models.},

  abstract     = {Early development of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) facilitated by the gap gene network has been shown to be incredibly robust, and the same patterns emerge even when the process is seriously disrupted. We investigate this robustness using a previously developed computational framework called DSGRN (Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks). Our mathematical innovations include the conceptual extension of this established modeling technique to enable modeling of spatially monotone environmental effects, as well as the development of a collection of graph theoretic robustness scores for network models. This allows us to rank order the robustness of network models of cellular systems where each cell contains the same genetic network topology but operates under a parameter regime that changes continuously from cell to cell. We demonstrate the power of this method by comparing the robustness of two previously introduced network models of gap gene expression along the anterior–posterior axis of the fruit fly embryo, both to each other and to a random sample of networks with same number of nodes and edges. We observe that there is a substantial difference in robustness scores between the two models. Our biological insight is that random network topologies are in general capable of reproducing complex patterns of expression, but that using measures of robustness to rank order networks permits a large reduction in hypothesis space for highly conserved systems such as developmental networks.},

Within this mechanism, the topology of a cross-immunoreactivity network forces intra-host viral variants to specialize for complementary roles and adapt to the host’s immune response as a quasi-social ecosystem. Here we study dynamical changes in immune adaptation caused by evolutionary and epidemiological events. First, we show that the emergence of a viral variant with altered antigenic features may result in a rapid re-arrangement of the viral ecosystem and a change in the roles played by existing viral variants. In particular, it may push the population under immune escape by genomic diversification towards the stable state of adaptation by antigenic cooperation. Next, we study the effect of a viral transmission between two chronically infected hosts, which results in the merging of two intra-host viral populations in the state of stable immune-adapted equilibrium. In this case, we also describe how the newly formed viral population adapts to the host’s environment by changing the functions of its members. The results are obtained analytically for minimal cross-immunoreactivity networks and numerically for larger populations.},

  abstract     = {Indirect reciprocity is a reputational mechanism through which cooperative behavior can be promoted amongst a group of individuals. However, in order for this mechanism to effectively do so, cheating must be appropriately punished and cooperating appropriately rewarded. Errors in assessments and actions can hinder this process. In such a setting, individuals might try to reason about evidence to assign reputations given the possibility of errors. Here, we consider a well-established theory of reasoning used to combine evidence, abductive reasoning, as a possible means by which such errors can be circumvented. Specifically, we use Dempster–Shafer theory to model individuals who account for possible errors by combining information about their beliefs about the status of the population and the errors rates and then choose the simplest scenario that could explain their observations in the context of these beliefs. We investigate the effectiveness of abductive reasoning at promoting cooperation for five social norms: Scoring, Shunning, Simple Standing, Staying, and Stern Judging. We find that, generally, abductive reasoning can outperform non-reasoning models at ameliorating the effects of the aforementioned challenges and promote higher levels of cooperation under low-error conditions. However, for high-error conditions, we find that abductive reasoning can undermine cooperation. Furthermore, we also find that a degree of bias towards believing previously held reputations can help sustain cooperation.},

Elevated SCC can signal intramammary inflammation, suggesting subclinical mastitis. Detecting mastitis is pivotal to limit severity, prevent pathogen spread, and target treatment or culling. This study aimed to differentiate normal and abnormal SCC patterns using recorded registry data. We used registry data from 2010 to 2020 for dairy cows in herds with 11 annual milk recordings. To create consistency across herds, we used data from 13,996 unique animals and eight different herds, selected based on the amount of data available, only selecting Holstein animals and conventional herds. We fitted log10-transformed SCC to days in milk (DIM) using the Wilmink and Wood’s curve functions, originally developed for milk yield over the lactation. We used Nonlinear Least Square and Nonlinear Mixed Effect models to fit the log10-transformed SCC observations to DIM at animal level. Using mean squared residuals (MSR), we found a consistently better fit using a Wood’s style function. Detection of MSR outliers in the model fitting process was used to identify animals with log10(SCC) curves deviating from the expected “normal” curve for that same animal. With this study, we propose a method to identify single animals with SCC patterns that indicate abnormalities, such as mastitis, based on registry data. This method could potentially lead to a registry data-based detection of mastitis cases in larger dairy herds.},

  abstract     = {Drug resistance is a major challenge for curative cancer treatment, representing the main reason of death in patients. Evolutionary biology suggests pauses between treatment rounds as a way to delay or even avoid resistance emergence. Indeed, this approach has already shown promising preclinical and early clinical results, and stimulated the development of mathematical models for finding optimal treatment protocols. Due to their complexity, however, these models do not lend themself to a rigorous mathematical analysis, hence so far clinical recommendations generally relied on numerical simulations and ad-hoc heuristics. Here, we derive two mathematical models describing tumour growth under genetic and epigenetic treatment resistance, respectively, which are simple enough for a complete analytical investigation. First, we find key differences in response to treatment protocols between the two modes of resistance. Second, we identify the optimal treatment protocol which leads to the largest possible tumour shrinkage rate. Third, we fit the “epigenetic model” to previously published xenograft experiment data, finding excellent agreement, underscoring the biological validity of our approach. Finally, we use the fitted model to calculate the optimal treatment protocol for this specific experiment, which we demonstrate to cause curative treatment, making it superior to previous approaches which generally aimed at stabilising tumour burden. Overall, our approach underscores the usefulness of simple mathematical models and their analytical examination, and we anticipate our findings to guide future preclinical and, ultimately, clinical research in optimising treatment regimes.},

We provide the general formulas of the generation size, extinction probability, and basic reproduction number of the proposed branching process model. The result shows that the natural temporal heterogeneity (i.e. random contacts over time) can lead to a higher extinction probability while remains the same basic reproduction number and generation size. This is also numerically verified by choosing the real contact distributions from different circumstances of four countries. In addition, we observe a non-monotonic pattern of the differences, against the transmission probability and the mean contact rate, between the extinction probabilities under the constant and random contact patterns. Given the spatial heterogeneity, we show that it can contribute to the increase of basic reproduction number, but also increase the extinction probability of the infectious disease.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the nonlinear dynamics of the MARCKS protein between cytosol and cytoplasmic membrane through the modulational instability phenomenon. The reaction–diffusion generic model used here is firstly transformed into a cubic complex Ginzburg–Landau equation. Then, modulational instability (MI) is carried out in order to derive the MI criteria. We find the domains of some parameter space where nonlinear patterns are expected in the model. The analytical results on the MI growth rate predict that phosphorylation and binding rates affect MARCKS dynamics in opposite way: while the phosphorylation rate tends to support highly localized structures of MARCKS, the binding rate in turn tends to slow down such features. On the other hand, self-diffusion process always amplifies the MI phenomenon. These predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations. As a result, the cyclic transport of MARCKS protein from membrane to cytosol may be done by means of multisolitons-like patterns.},

Through a deterministic model, expanding on our previous work on TE proliferation under epigenetic regulation, we study the long-term TE distribution and TE stability in the subgenomes of both autopolyploids and allopolyploids. We also explore different small-interfering RNA (siRNA) action modes on the subgenomes, including a model where siRNAs are not directed to specific genomes and one where siRNAs are directed – i.e. more active – in subgenomes with higher TE loads. In the autopolyploid case, we find long-term stable equilbria that tend to equilibrate the number of active TEs between subgenomes. In the allopolyploid case, directed siRNA action is fundamental to avoid a ”winner takes all” outcome of the competition between the TEs in the different subgenomes. We also show that decaying oscillations in the number of TEs occur naturally in all cases, perhaps explaining some of the observed features of ’genomic shock’ after hybridization events, and that the balance in the dynamics of the different types of siRNA is determinant for the synchronization of these oscillations.},

  abstract     = {The association of DNA methylation with age has been extensively studied. Previous work has investigated the trajectories of methylation with age, and developed predictive biomarkers of age. However, we still have a limited understanding of the functional form of methylation-age dynamics. To address this we present a theoretical framework to model the dynamics of DNA methylation at single sites. We show that this model leads to convergence to a steady-state methylation level at an exponential rate. By fitting the model to a dataset that measures changes in DNA methylation in the brain from birth to old age, we show that the timescales of this exponential convergence are heterogeneous across sites. To model this heterogeneity we generated a simulation of CpG Methylation changes with time and investigated the functional form of the dynamics of methylation with age under the empirical distribution of timescales estimated from the dataset. The resulting dynamics of the average methylation of the system were characterized and were found to closely follow an exponential trajectory. We conclude that DNA methylation can be modeled as a system that starts out of equilibrium at birth and approaches equilibrium with age in an exponential fashion. These insights illustrate the importance of accounting for nonlinear dynamics when utilizing age associated DNA methylation changes for constructing biomarkers of aging. Thus DNA methylation, along with the exponentially increasing risk of mortality with age, further establishes the exponential nature of aging.},

  abstract     = {Many coevolutionary processes, including host-parasite and host-symbiont interactions, involve one species or trait which evolves much faster than the other. Whether or not a coevolutionary trajectory converges depends on the relative rates of evolutionary change in the two species, and so current adaptive dynamics approaches generally either determine convergence stability by considering arbitrary (often comparable) rates of evolutionary change or else rely on necessary or sufficient conditions for convergence stability. We propose a method for determining convergence stability in the case where one species is expected to evolve much faster than the other. This requires a second separation of timescales, which assumes that the faster evolving species will reach its evolutionary equilibrium (if one exists) before a new mutation arises in the more slowly evolving species. This method, which is likely to be a reasonable approximation for many coevolving species, both provides straightforward conditions for convergence stability and is less computationally expensive than traditional analysis of coevolution models, as it reduces the trait space from a two-dimensional plane to a one-dimensional manifold. In this paper, we present the theory underlying this new separation of timescales and provide examples of how it could be used to determine coevolutionary outcomes from models.},

We present equilibrium and dynamic solutions, discuss their relation to existing models, and estimate model parameters through comparisons with available experimental measurements of both spatial and temporal photoreceptor characteristics. Our model compares well with existing data on spatially-dependent regrowth of photoreceptor outer segments in the macular region of Rhesus Monkeys. Our predictions are also consistent with existing data on the spatial dependence of photoreceptor outer segment length near the fovea in healthy human subjects.

We assume that the evading risk of fish predation induces fear in zooplankton species, which affects its growth dynamics radically. On the other hand, zooplankton develop an anti-predator defense by taking temporary refuge. Interestingly, the system potentially exhibits multi-stable configurations under identical ecological conditions by allowing different bifurcation scenarios, including multiple saddle–node and transcritical bifurcations with varying levels of nutrients, strength of phytoplankton toxicity, zooplankton refuge size and the cost of fear imposed by fish population. Further, by adding Gaussian white noise, we have extended the deterministic system to its stochastic version. We find that white noise appears to regulate the survival and extinction of model species. Comprehensive numerical simulations are consistent with mathematical results prognosticated by linear analysis. Overall, our study may provide a new insight into the mechanisms of emergence and mitigation of plankton blooms.},

This article presents an integrative mathematical model that describes the decrease in maximal force capacity (i.e. fatigue) over exercises performed at intensities above the critical force F c Fc ( i.e. severe domain). The model unifies the previous Critical Power Model and All-Out Model and can be applied to any exercise described by a changing force F F over time. The assumptions of the model are ( i ) isokinetic conditions, an intensity domain of F c &lt; F Fc&amp;lt;F , ( ii ) constant individual parameters of F c Fc , and τ τ , ( iii ) fatigability proportional to the accumulation of impulse J A C JAC above the critical force F c Fc . The present study adjusted the parameters to fit previous experimental observations from three types of exercises: constant intensity, all-out, and increasing ramp exercise. This integrative model establishes a connection between the previous individual models and provides an excellent description of exercise fatigability in the severe domain. With this new integrative model, the maximal force production of the muscle can be predicted over time during both maximal and submaximal exercises.},

We conducted a comparative analysis between the maximum SSD score and the maximum SSD set(s) of size k k , efficiently determined using a circular approximation, and the true results obtained through brute-force search based on the original data. Through experimentation on simulated datasets and SNP data across 50 Atlantic Salmon populations, our findings demonstrate that employing a circular approximation can lead to the generation of an incorrect max-SSD set(s). We built a graph-based split system whose circular approximation led to a max-SSD set of size k = 4 k=4 that was less than the true max-SSD set by 17.6%. This discrepancy increased to 25% for k = 11 k=11 when we used a hypergraph-based split system. The same comparison on the Atlantic salmon dataset revealed a mere 1% difference. However, noteworthy disparities emerged in the population composition between the two sets. These findings underscore the importance of assessing the suitability of circular approximations in conservation biology systems. Caution is advised when relying solely on circular approximations to determine sets of maximum diversity, and careful consideration of the data characteristics is crucial for accurate results in conservation biology applications.},

Its equivalent Hamilton energy is calculated to show the relation between firing mode and energy level. Noisy disturbance is imposed to predict the occurrence of coherence resonance, and the biophysical neuron is excited to present higher energy level. This new neuron model can address the field effect and the biophysical property of cell membrane considered as combination of capacitive fields in double capacitors. It can mimic the physical property of outer and inner membranes, and energy exchange across the double membranes explains the energy mechanism in neural activities. Time-varying energy diveristy between capacitive field is crucial for supporting continuous firing activities.

Apart from the load and ATP concentration affecting the dynamics of the motor such as velocity, run length, dissociation rate, etc., the increase of solution viscosity by supplementing crowding agents of low molecular weight into the buffer can also affect the dynamics. Here, based on our proposed model for the chemomechanical coupling of the kinesin motor, a systematically theoretical study of the motor dynamics under the variation of the viscosity and load is presented. Both the load on the motor’s stalk and that on one of the two heads are considered. The theoretical results provide a consistent explanation of the available contradictory experimental results, with some showing that increasing viscosity decreases sensitively the velocity whereas others showing that increasing viscosity has little effect on the velocity. The theoretical results reproduce quantitatively the puzzling experimental data showing that under different directions of the load on the stalk, increasing viscosity has very different effects on the change of run length or dissociation rate. The theoretical results predict that in both the pure and crowded buffers the dependence of the run length on the load acting one of the two heads has very different feature from that on the load acting on the stalk.},

After applying clustering algorithms to both groups of features, we quantified correlations between metabolites, and found the clusters accurately linked 92% of known metabolites to their respective pathways.

Theoretical studies on Batesian mimicry have been conducted in terms of their evolutionary significance and ecological consequences. However, despite the importance of eco-evolutionary feedback, the evolution and population dynamics of mimicry complex have long been explored separately. Previous studies on the dynamics of mimicry complex have proposed the possibility of the extinction of unpalatable species due to high predation by predators confusing palatable and unpalatable species. If the abundance of palatable species was large in comparison with unpalatable species, predation pressure on both unpalatable and palatable species became severe, resulting in the extinction of the unpalatable species. We hypothesized that palatable species evolved not to be similar to unpalatable species when unpalatable species became rare, because this situation is no longer advantageous for palatable species to mimic unpalatable species. Here, we constructed the eco-evolutionary dynamics of unpalatable and palatable species, and demonstrated that the evolutionary process of palatable species, which has been overlooked in previous theoretical studies, could rescue the unpalatable species from extinction. We modeled predators’ foraging decisions based on signal detection theory. We assumed that palatable species evolve in a trait space, in which there are separate adaptive peaks on either side of an adaptive valley for mimicry and cryptic phenotypes. Then, we derived the stability conditions of the equilibria. As a result, the evolution of a cryptic phenotype in palatable species was driven when unpalatable species was rare, which mitigated predation pressure on unpalatable species through the reduction in the probability to be attacked. This could work to rescue unpalatable species from extinction.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of ecological communities in nature are typically characterized by probabilistic processes involving invasion dynamics. Because of technical challenges, however, the majority of theoretical and experimental studies have focused on coexistence dynamics. Therefore, it has become central to understand the extent to which coexistence outcomes can be used to predict analogous invasion outcomes relevant to systems in nature. Here, we study the limits to this predictability under a geometric and probabilistic Lotka–Volterra framework. We show that while individual survival probability in coexistence dynamics can be fairly closely translated into invader colonization probability in invasion dynamics, the translation is less precise between community persistence and community augmentation, and worse between exclusion probability and replacement probability. These results provide a guiding and testable theoretical framework regarding the translatability of outcomes between coexistence and invasion outcomes when communities are represented by Lotka–Volterra dynamics under environmental uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {One of the most significant challenges in biology is to elucidate the roles of various regulatory interactions in cell fate decision and transition. However, it remains to be fully clarified how they cooperate and determine fate transition. Here, a general framework based on statistical analysis and bifurcation theory is proposed to identify crucial regulatory interactions and how they play decisive roles in fate transition. More exactly, specific feedback loops determine occurrence of bifurcations by which cell fate transition can be realized. While regulatory interactions in the feedback loops determine the direction of transition. In addition, two-parameter bifurcation analysis further provides detailed understanding of how the fate transition based on statistical analysis occurs. Statistical analysis can also be used to reveal synergistic combinatorial perturbations by which fate transition can be more efficiently realized. The integrative analysis approach can be used to identify critical regulatory interactions in cell fate transition and reveal how specific cell fate transition occurs. To verify feasibility of the approach, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) network is chosen as an illustrative example. In agreement with experimental observations, the approach reveals some critical regulatory interactions and underlying mechanisms in cell fate determination and transitions between three states. The approach can also be applied to analyze other regulatory networks related to cell fate decision and transition.},

  abstract     = {Several studies have developed dynamical models to understand the underlying mechanisms of insulin signaling, a signaling cascade that leads to the translocation of glucose, the human body’s main source of energy. Fortunately, reaction network analysis allows us to extract properties of dynamical systems without depending on their model parameter values. This study focuses on the comparison of insulin signaling in healthy state (INSMS or INSulin Metabolic Signaling) and in type 2 diabetes (INRES or INsulin RESistance) using reaction network analysis. The analysis uses network decomposition to identify the different subsystems involved in insulin signaling (e.g., insulin receptor binding and recycling, GLUT4 translocation, and ERK signaling pathway, among others). Furthermore, results show that INSMS and INRES are similar with respect to some network, structo-kinetic, and kinetic properties. Their differences, however, provide insights into what happens when insulin resistance occurs. First, the variation in the number of species involved in INSMS and INRES suggests that when irregularities occur in the insulin signaling pathway, other complexes (and, hence, other processes) get involved, characterizing insulin resistance. Second, the loss of concordance exhibited by INRES suggests less restrictive interplay between the species involved in insulin signaling, leading to unusual activities in the signaling cascade. Lastly, GLUT4 losing its absolute concentration robustness in INRES may signify that the transporter has lost its reliability in shuttling glucose to the cell, inhibiting efficient cellular energy production. This study also suggests possible applications of the equilibria parametrization and network decomposition, resulting from the analysis, to potentially establish absolute concentration robustness in a species.},

  abstract     = {After the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in the end of January 2020 in Germany, a large number of individuals suffered from severe symptoms and eventually needed intensive care in hospitals. Due to the rapid spread of the disease, the number of deceased individuals increased as well, which is a motivation to prevent as many new infections as possible. Therefore, the knowledge about the current evolution of the virus spread is crucial to predict its future behavior and to react with suitable interventions. In this paper, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany is forecasted by a network-based inference method, in which the interactions of individuals are taken into account using a contact matrix. Then the results are compared to the predictions without considering a contact matrix as well as to the logistic regression, which shows the advantage of incorporating the contact matrix. Furthermore, the basic reproduction number of the pandemic in Germany using a neural network approach is estimated and used for further predictions of the evolution of COVID-19 in Germany. In order to mathematically model the different compartments of the population in the considered regions, the classical SIR model is employed. In this work, we deploy the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) for the unknown parameter estimation. Furthermore, we calculate and illustrate the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of the estimations to show the accuracy of the predictions. The results include model parameter estimation and model validation, as well as the outbreak forecasting using network-informed algorithms. Our findings show that the network-inference based approach outperforms the logistic regression as well as the neural network approach and the SIR model calibration without a contact network. Furthermore according to the results, the network-inference based approach is particularly suitable for short- to mid-term predictions, even when there is not much information about the new disease. Moreover, the predictions based on the estimation of the reproduction number in Germany can yield more reliable results with increasing the availability of data, but could not outperform the network-inference based algorithm.},

Here, we extend a previously proposed mathematical model in Evolutionary Game Theory that investigated how resource use by a single species composed of cooperators and defectors may lead to its maintenance or extinction. We include another species in the model, so as to investigate how different intra and interspecific interactions of cooperative or competitive nature among individuals that share the same essential resource may drive the survival and evolution of the species. Several outcomes emerge from the model, depending on the configuration of the payoff matrix, the individual contribution to the resource pool, the competition intensity between species, and the initial conditions of the system dynamics. Observed results include scenarios in which species thrive due to the action of cooperators, but also scenarios in which both species collapse due to lack of cooperation and, consequently, of resources. In particular, a high initial availability of resources may be the determinant factor to the survival of both species. Interestingly, cooperation may be more favored when individuals have less incentive to cooperate with others, and the survival of their populations may depend crucially on their competitive capacities.},

The loser cells are eliminated through programmed cell death , leaving only the winner cells to populate the tissue. Cell competition is context-dependent; the same cell type can win or lose depending on the cell type it is competing against. Hence, winner/loser status is an emergent property. A key question in cell competition is: how do cells acquire their winner/loser status? In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for studying the emergence of winner/loser status based on a set of quantitative criteria that distinguishes competitive from non-competitive outcomes. We apply this framework in a cell-based modelling context, to both highlight the crucial role of active cell death in cell competition and identify the factors that drive cell competition.},

The Waddington landscape posits that gene circuits in a cell form a potential landscape of different cell types, wherein cells follow attractors of the probability landscape to develop into distinct cell types. However, how adult stem cells achieve a delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation remains unclear. We propose that random inheritance of epigenetic states plays a pivotal role in stem cell differentiation and present a hybrid model of stem cell differentiation induced by epigenetic modifications. Our comprehensive model integrates gene regulation networks, epigenetic state inheritance, and cell regeneration, encompassing multi-scale dynamics ranging from transcription regulation to cell population. Through model simulations, we demonstrate that random inheritance of epigenetic states during cell divisions can spontaneously induce cell differentiation, dedifferentiation, and transdifferentiation. Furthermore, we investigate the influences of interfering with epigenetic modifications and introducing additional transcription factors on the probabilities of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation, revealing the underlying mechanism of cell reprogramming. This in silico model provides valuable insights into the intricate mechanism governing stem cell differentiation and cell reprogramming and offers a promising path to enhance the field of regenerative medicine .},

To address these issues, we propose IP3G ( I ntelligent P henotype-detection and G ene expression profile G eneration with G enerative adversarial network), a model based on Generative Adversarial Networks. IP3G tackles two major problems: augmenting gene expression data and unsupervised phenotype discovery. By converting gene expression profiles into 2-Dimensional images and leveraging IP3G, we generate new profiles for specific phenotypes. IP3G learns disentangled representations of gene expression patterns and identifies phenotypes without labeled data. We improve the objective function of the GAN used in IP3G by employing the earth mover distance and a novel mutual information function. IP3G outperforms clustering methods like k-Means, DBSCAN, and GMM in unsupervised phenotype discovery, while also surpassing SVM and CNN classification accuracy by up to 6% through gene expression profile augmentation. The source code for the developed IP3G is accessible to the public on GitHub.},

In this study, we employ an extended spatial public goods game to investigate the evolution of prosocial peer exclusion and its impact on cooperation in the presence of both prosocial and antisocial peer exclusion. Our model encompasses four primary strategies: traditional cooperation and defection, prosocial peer exclusion targeting defectors, and antisocial peer exclusion targeting cooperators. Our findings illuminate that the presence of antisocial peer exclusion significantly disrupts network reciprocity and suppresses cooperation. However, when coexisting with prosocial peer exclusion, it does not undermine the latter’s efficacy in upholding cooperation, except in scenarios with low exclusion costs Unlike the cooperation-sustaining cyclic dominance pattern observed in the exclusive presence of prosocial peer exclusion, the co-presence of prosocial and antisocial peer exclusion gives rise to more intricate pathways for maintaining cooperation. These pathways include cyclic dominance involving traditional cooperation, prosocial peer exclusion, and antisocial peer exclusion, or a similar pattern involving traditional defection and the two exclusion strategies, or even cyclic dominance among all four strategies. In essence, our study enhances the theoretical framework concerning the effectiveness of the prosocial exclusion strategy, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of its dynamics.},

  abstract     = {From the beginning of the usage of radiotherapy (RT) for cancer treatment, mathematical modeling has been integral to understanding radiobiology and for designing treatment approaches and schedules. There has been extensive modeling of response to RT with the inclusion of various degrees of biological complexity. In this study, we compare three models of tumor volume dynamics: (1) exponential growth with RT directly reducing tumor volume, (2) logistic growth with direct tumor volume reduction, and (3) logistic growth with RT reducing the tumor carrying capacity with the objective of understanding the implications of model selection and informing the process of model calibration and parameterization. For all three models, we: examined the rates of change in tumor volume during and RT treatment course; performed parameter sensitivity and identifiability analyses; and investigated the impact of the parameter sensitivity on the tumor volume trajectories. In examining the tumor volume dynamics trends, we coined a new metric – the point of maximum reduction of tumor volume (MRV) – to quantify the magnitude and timing of the expected largest impact of RT during a treatment course. We found distinct timing differences in MRV, dependent on model selection. The parameter identifiability and sensitivity analyses revealed the interdependence of the different model parameters and that it is only possible to independently identify tumor growth and radiation response parameters if the underlying tumor growth rate is sufficiently large. Ultimately, the results of these analyses help us to better understand the implications of model selection while simultaneously generating falsifiable hypotheses about MRV timing that can be tested on longitudinal measurements of tumor volume from pre-clinical or clinical data with high acquisition frequency. Although, our study only compares three particular models, the results demonstrate that caution is necessary in selecting models of response to RT, given the artifacts imposed by each model.},

  abstract     = {Fisher’s geometric model provides a powerful tool for making predictions about key properties of Darwinian adaptation. Here, I apply the geometric model to predict differences between the evolution of altruistic versus nonsocial phenotypes. I recover Kimura’s prediction that probability of fixation is greater for mutations of intermediate size, but I find that the effect size that maximises probability of fixation is relatively small in the context of altruism and relatively large in the context of nonsocial phenotypes, and that the overall probability of fixation is lower for altruism and is higher for nonsocial phenotypes. Accordingly, the first selective substitution is expected to be smaller, and to take longer, in the context of the evolution of altruism. These results strengthen the justification for employing streamlined social evolutionary methodologies that assume adaptations are underpinned by many genes of small effect.},

  abstract     = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a genetically complex hematological cancer characterized by the abnormal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. This disease progresses from a premalignant condition known as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) through sequential genetic alterations involving various genes. These genetic changes contribute to the uncontrolled growth of multiple clones of plasma cells. In this study, we present a phenotype-structured model that captures the intra-clonal heterogeneity and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). The model accurately reproduces the branching evolutionary pattern observed in MM progression, aligning with a previously developed multiscale model. Numerical simulations reveal that higher mutation rates enhance tumor phenotype diversity, while access to growth factors accelerates tumor evolution and increases its final size. Interestingly, the model suggests that further increasing growth factor access primarily amplifies tumor size rather than altering clonal dynamics. Additionally, the model emphasizes that higher mutation frequencies and growth factor availability elevate the chances of drug resistance and relapse. It indicates that the timing of the treatment could trajectory of tumor evolution and clonal emergence in the case of branching evolutionary pattern. Given its low computational cost, our model is well-suited for quantitative studies on MM clonal heterogeneity and its interaction with chemotherapeutic treatments.},

  abstract     = {Natural movement is clearly related to health, however, it is also highly complex and difficult to measure. Most attempts to measure it focus on functional movements in humans, and while this a valid and popular approach, assays focussed on particular movements cannot capture the range of natural movement that occurs outside them. It is also difficult to use current techniques to compare movement across animal species. Interspecies comparison may be useful for identifying conserved biomechanical and/ or computational principles of movement that could inform human and veterinary medicine, plus several other fields of research. It is therefore important that research develops a system for quantifying movement in freely moving animals in natural environments and relating it to length and quality of life (LQOL). The present text proposes a novel theoretical framework for doing so, based on screening movement ability ( MA MA ). MA MA is calculated from three major variables – Movement Quality, Movement Complexity, and Movement Quantity. These may represent the most important components of movement as it relates to LQOL, and offer insight into how and why differences in the relationship between movement and LQOL occur. A constrained version of the framework is validated in Drosophila , which suggests that MA MA may indeed represent a useful new paradigm for understanding the relationship between movement and length and quality of life.},

  abstract     = {Communication via action potentials among neurons has been extensively studied. However, effective communication without action potentials is ubiquitous in biological systems, yet it has received much less attention in comparison. Multi-cellular communication among smooth muscles is crucial for regulating blood flow , for example. Understanding the mechanism of this non-action potential communication is critical in many cases, like synchronization of cellular activity, under normal and pathological conditions. In this paper, we employ a multi-scale asymptotic method to derive a macroscopic homogenized bidomain model from the microscopic electro-neutral (EN) model. This is achieved by considering different diffusion coefficients and incorporating nonlinear interface conditions. Subsequently, the homogenized macroscopic model is used to investigate communication in multi-cellular tissues. Our computational simulations reveal that the membrane potential of syncytia , formed by interconnected cells via connexins , plays a crucial role in propagating oscillations from one region to another, providing an effective means for fast cellular communication. Statement of Significance: In this study, we investigated cellular communication and ion transport in vascular smooth muscle cells, shedding light on their mechanisms under normal and abnormal conditions. Our research highlights the potential of mathematical models in understanding complex biological systems. We developed effective macroscale electro-neutral bi-domain ion transport models and examined their behavior in response to different stimuli. Our findings revealed the crucial role of connexinmediated membrane potential changes and demonstrated the effectiveness of cellular communication through syncytium membranes. Despite some limitations, our study provides valuable insights into these processes and emphasizes the importance of mathematical modeling in unraveling the complexities of cellular communication and ion transport.},

  abstract     = {The coevolution of hosts and symbionts based on virulence and mode of transmission is a complex and diverse biological phenomenon. We introduced a conceptual model to study the stable coexistence and coevolution of an obligate symbiont (mutualist or parasite) with mixed-mode transmission and its host. Using an age-structured Leslie model for the host, we demonstrated how the obligate symbiont could modify the host’s life history traits (survival and fecundity) and the long-term growth rate of the infected lineage. When the symbiont is vertically transmitted, we found that the host and its symbiont could maximize the infected lineage’s evolutionary success (multi-level selection). Our model showed that symbionts’ effect on host longevity and reproduction might differ, even be opposing, and their net effect might often be counterintuitive. The evolutionary stability of the ecologically stable coexistence was analyzed in the framework of coevolutionary dynamics. Moreover, we found conditions for the ecological and evolutionary stability of the resident host-symbiont pair, which does not allow invasion by rare mutants (each mutant dies out by ecological selection). We concluded that, within the context of our simplified model conditions, a host-symbiont system with mixed-mode transmission is evolutionarily stable unconditionally only if the host can maximize the Malthusian parameters of the infected and non-infected lineages using the same strategy. Finally, we performed a game-theoretical analysis of our selection situation and compared two stability definitions.},
