We establish a dichotomy between global existence and scattering versus finite-time blow-up for energy solutions below the ground state threshold in the inter-critical regime. The scattering result is obtained by employing the novel approach developed by Dodson and Murphy (A new proof of scattering below the ground state for the 3D radial focusing cubic NLS, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. (2017)). We employ Tao&#39;s scattering criteria and Morawetz estimates as the foundation of this method. The novelty of our approach lies in two aspects: firstly, we explore the case of nonzero ϱα , and secondly, we consider general energy initial data that need not be radially symmetric. The specific instance of α = 0 α=0 , known as INLS, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Additionally, X. Gao and C. Xu recently investigated the case of ϱ = 0 ϱ=0 in the homogeneous regime, establishing scattering theory for spherically symmetric data in their work (Scattering theory for NLS with inverse-square potential in 2D, J. Math. Anal. Appl. (2020)). In the radial framework, the aforementioned problem can be translated to the INLS with an inverse square potential, which has been extensively studied in higher-dimensional spaces. The Hardy inequality ‖ | x | − 1 f ‖ L 2 ( R N ) ≤ 2 N − 2 ‖ ∇ f ‖ L 2 ( R N ) ‖|x|−1f‖L2(RN)≤2N−2‖∇f‖L2(RN) , which establishes the norm equivalence ‖ f ‖ H 1 ≃ ‖ f ‖ H 1 + ‖ | x | − 1 f ‖ L 2 ‖f‖H1≃‖f‖H1+‖|x|−1f‖L2 , does not hold in two space dimensions. Consequently, it remains unclear how to handle the NLS with an inverse square potential in the H 1 H1 framework for two-dimensional space. This article stands out as the first one to address the NLS with Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potential within the inhomogeneous regime, specifically when ϱ ≠ 0 ϱ≠0 .},

  abstract     = {Traditional robust parameter design (RPD) is an effective offline quality improvement method, but it cannot update the optimal settings in a timely manner. To resolve the drawback of traditional one-time modeling methods, online RPD comes into being. In online RPD, when the setting for controllable factor is unreasonable, it can be regarded as a new sample to update the optimal setting, which improves the efficiency of constructing response surface. Now, one of the mainstream approaches is to use support vector regression (SVR) as a response surface for online RPD. However, in the process of adding samples and updating the response surface, the parameters of the model are not updated. If the parameters do not change after adding samples, the accuracy of the model may decrease, which is obviously not desirable. To address this problem, this paper proposes Bayesian optimization sequential SVR based on online RPD (BOSSVR-RPD) strategy, which can simultaneously update the parameters and response surface in real time. In the proposed strategy, we can use the optimal setting of previously controllable factors, the currently observed noise factor and the corresponding response as new samples to add to the response surface to improve the accuracy of the response surface, and at the same time use the Bayesian optimization method to optimize the parameters of the model. By repeating this process, we can find the desirable optimal setting for controllable factor. This paper verifies the method through four cases, proving that the proposed BOSSVR-RPD strategy can find the optimal setting for controllable factors. Compared with the existing method without parameter optimization, the model proposed in this paper is more accurate, so the optimal setting for controllable factors can be found faster and the controllable factors obtained are more reliable.},

The system is parameterized by three parameters ( α , β , γ ) (α,β,γ) and we consider the case where α &gt; γ + 1 2 α&amp;gt;γ+12 , which presents a singularity at zero. Based on frequency domain analysis, we identify the optimal decay rate and the sharp order of Gevrey class of the semigroup associated with the system. Especially, we propose a clear relationship between the choice of parameters and the decay rates (or the orders of Gevrey class) for the system. Our analysis complements the stability analysis of the system previously discussed in [6] , which was restricted to the region { ( α , β , γ ) | 0 γ + 1 2 α&amp;gt;γ+12 and also add the region 0 &lt; γ &lt; 1 2 0&amp;lt;γ&amp;lt;12 . A complete analysis for the decay rate and regularity of the system is given. We also provide some examples to illuminate our results.}}}},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to studying the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to generalized incommensurate fractional systems. To this end, we first consider fractional systems with rational orders and introduce a criterion that is necessary and sufficient to ensure the stability of such systems. Next, from the fractional order pseudospectrum definition proposed by Šanca et al., we formulate the concept of a rational approximation for the fractional spectrum of incommensurate fractional systems with general, not necessarily rational, orders. Our first important new contribution is to show the equivalence between the fractional spectrum of a incommensurate linear system and its rational approximation. With this result in hand, we use ideas developed in our earlier work to demonstrate the stability of an equilibrium point to nonlinear systems in arbitrary finite-dimensional spaces. A second novel aspect of our work is the fact that the approach is constructive. It is effective and widely applicable in studying the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to linear incommensurate fractional differential systems with constant coefficient matrices and linearized stability theory for nonlinear incommensurate fractional differential systems. Finally, we give numerical simulations to illustrate the merit of the proposed theoretical results.},

For another, we obtain the global (in time) singular limits in the L q Lq framework and the higher order asymptotic profile with respect to small thermal relaxation via the multi-scale analysis and the Fourier analysis.

For the initial value problem of nonlinear wave equations, blow-up results of sign changing solutions are derived by employing the suitable test function technique which is related to the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative and contradiction argument. Additionally, upper bound lifespan estimates of solutions to the small initial value problem of wave equations are established by imposing certain conditions on the initial values. It is worth to mention that crucial difficulty is the setting of test function framework, which has not been applied to the Schwarzschild spacetime in the previous literatures. To the best of our knowledge, the results in Theorem 1.1 , Theorem 1.4 are new.},

This method is designed to address image denoising by considering both texture and smooth components during the recovery process. The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the coupled system are established using Galerkin&#39;s method within a suitable space framework. Experimental analysis demonstrates the model&#39;s effectiveness in image restoration, and it is compared with other competitive models to showcase its performance.},

Write μ 1 o d d ( D ) μ1odd(D) for the lowest nonzero eigenvalue of the Neumann p -Laplacian with an eigenfunction that is odd with respect to the y -axis. For all p &gt; 1 p&amp;gt;1 , we provide a lower bound on μ 1 o d d ( D ) μ1odd(D) when the distance function δ and the signed curvature k of γ satisfy certain geometric constraints. In the linear case ( p = 2 p=2 ), we establish sufficient conditions to guarantee μ 1 o d d ( D ) = μ 1 ( D ) μ1odd(D)=μ1(D) . We finally study the asymptotics of μ 1 ( D ) μ1(D) as the distance function tends to zero.

  abstract     = {This paper concerns dynamic optimization problems with pathwise state constraints, in which the dynamics are formulated as a differential inclusion. First order necessary conditions of optimality are available for these problems. Foremost among these conditions is the Euler Lagrange inclusion (combined with a transversality and Weierstrass conditions), which improves on earlier conditions such as Clarke&#39;s Hamiltonian inclusion. The most recent version of the Euler Lagrange inclusion (which we call the standard Euler Lagrange condition) has been validated under unrestrictive conditions, which allow the velocity sets of the differential inclusion to be non-convex. If the initial state is fixed and located in the boundary of the state constraint set then the Euler Lagrange inclusion conveys no information about minimizers. This is the degeneracy phenomenon for state constrained dynamic optimization. The non-degenerate necessary conditions literature provides additional conditions, to supplement the standard necessary conditions. These typically identify some properties of the boundary values of the maximized Hamiltonian which ensure non-triviality of the necessary conditions, under a simple controllability hypothesis. Non-degenerate conditions, incorporating the Euler Lagrange inclusion are currently available only under the hypothesis that the velocity sets are convex. Using new perturbation techniques, we derive a non-degenerate Euler Lagrange condition that is valid for non-convex velocity sets. These conditions bring into line non-degenerate optimality conditions for differential inclusion problems with those for problems involving controlled differential equations which have previously been validated for non-convex velocity sets.},

He proved that D k 0 ( n ) Dk0(n) is even for k ≥ 1 k≥1 and n ≡ k − 1 ( mod 2 ) n≡k−1(mod2) . Inspired by Andrews&#39; work, many authors investigated congruences for D k 0 ( n ) Dk0(n) modulo 2 or powers of 2. For example, Wang obtained D 2 0 ( 8 n + 4 ) ≡ D 2 0 ( 8 n + 6 ) ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) D20(8n+4)≡D20(8n+6)≡0(mod2) which were first conjectured by Andrews. More recently, Xia proved that D 2 m k 0 ( 2 n + 1 ) ≡ 0 ( mod 2 m + 1 ) D2mk0(2n+1)≡0(mod2m+1) with m , k ≥ 1 m,k≥1 and n ≥ 0 n≥0 . In this paper, we first study the modular properties of the generating function of D 2 0 ( n ) D20(n) which is completed to be a weakly modular form of weight 5 2 52 . As application, we utilize the Hecke operators to establish families of congruences for D 2 0 ( n ) D20(n) modulo powers of primes ℓ ≥ 5 ℓ≥5 .},

It is a non-convex, polynomially convex, C C -convex, star-like about the origin, and inhomogeneous domain. This paper deals with operator theory on the pentablock. We study pentablock unitaries and isometries, providing an algebraic characterization of pentablock isometries. En route, we provide the Wold-type decomposition for pentablock isometries, which consists of three parts: the unitary part, the pure part, and a new component. We define this novel component as the quasi-pentablock unitary and provide a functional model for it. Additionally, a model for a class of pure pentablock isometries has been found, along with some examples. Furthermore, a representation resembling the Beurling-Lax-Halmos paradigm has been presented for the invariant subspaces of pentablock pure isometries.},

In the case η = − 1 η=−1 , the structure of the problem changes significantly, and we proved the existence of a solution using non-variational methods based on an approximating scheme. In both cases, we faced difficulties handling the loss of compactness because the variable exponents involve supercritical growth.

An observer system is presented to estimate the ODE and the heat variables, and the error system is showed to be exponentially convergent. Based on the estimated variables, an output feedback control is designed using two invertible transformations to exponentially stabilize the entire system.

In this asymmetric two-player game, the worker participants act collectively as a single player that claims a share of the surplus, and the sponsoring firm acts as the player who cares about the investment of the surplus fund assets. We formulate the game model in two scenarios, and use the dynamic programming technique to derive the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in each scenario. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm that incorporates a kind of quasi-Newton method and the Runge-Kutta scheme to obtain the equilibrium strategies.

Then, based on the adaptive back-stepping control technique and the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) method, an adaptive fuzzy consensus controller is designed to ensure that the full-state constraints are not violated. Furthermore, we propose a generalized relative threshold that considers neighboring controller errors to significantly reduce computational burden.

Suppose that ( X , X ) (X,X) is a measurable space and E E is a finite-dimensional vector space of measurable mappings of X X into H q Hq . A linear functional Λ on E E is called a moment functional if there exists a positive H q Hq -valued measure μ on ( X , X ) (X,X) such that Λ ( F ) = ∫ X 〈 F , d μ 〉 Λ(F)=∫X〈F,dμ〉 for F ∈ E F∈E . We prove a matricial version of the Richter–Tchakaloff theorem which states that each moment functional on E E has a finitely atomic representing measure. It is shown that strictly positive linear functionals on E E are moment functionals. For a moment functional Λ, we study the set of atoms W ( Λ ) W(Λ) and define two Carathéodory numbers of Λ. Further, we define and investigate the core set V ( Λ ) V(Λ) which generalizes the core variety from the scalar case to the matricial setting. A main result of the paper is the equality W ( Λ ) = V ( Λ ) W(Λ)=V(Λ) .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the joint effect of repulsive predator-taxis and digestion delay in a diffusive predator-prey model. Our theoretical findings reveal that, when both species exhibit logistic growth, the predator-taxis does not lead to Turing bifurcation. However, the introduction of digestion delay gives rise to the occurrence of spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcations which result in spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous periodic solutions. In particular, the inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcations are often accompanied by rich and diverse pattern modes. Under certain conditions, the spatially homogeneous Hopf bifurcation disappears, while the spatially inhomogeneous Hopf bifurcations persist. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of double Hopf bifurcation between homogeneous and inhomogeneous states in the bifurcation diagram. Finally, the numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the emergence of various spatial patterns with different values of predator-taxis coefficients and delays.},

We generalize this theorem to groups of the form R × F R×F , where F is a finite Abelian group such that its 2-component is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers modulo 2. In so doing, coefficients of the linear forms are arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group. Previously, a similar result was proved in the case when the group F contains no elements of order 2. The presence of an element of order 2 in F leads to the fact that a new class of probability distributions is characterized.},

By means of the Lyapunov direct method, an improved algebraic approach to proving the global stability of such systems in the positive cone is presented in this paper. This approach is based on an important finding that the derivative of a Volterra-type Lyapunov function along a polynomial differential system can be expressed as a linear combination of some Volterra-type functions. Applications to some epidemic models demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the approach. Moreover, according to the property of the Volterra-type function and the relation between the endemic equilibrium and the disease-free equilibrium, the applicable Lyapunov function for the disease-free equilibrium can be derived by reformulating the Lyapunov function for the endemic equilibrium. The approach proposed here greatly simplifies the discussion on global stability of the feasible equilibria of some models described by polynomial differential systems.},

In this paper, we establish a topological equivalence sending the solutions of the semilinear evolution equation x ′ = A ( t ) x + f ( t , x , y ) , y ′ = r ( t , x , y ) , x′=A(t)x+f(t,x,y),y′=r(t,x,y), onto those of its nonhyperbolic linearized part x ′ = A ( t ) x , y ′ = 0 . x′=A(t)x,y′=0. We require that one of the linear subsystem x ′ = A ( t ) x x′=A(t)x admits a nonuniform strong exponential dichotomy, but the other is a critical case, i.e., its linear part is a null operator. Then the difficulty arises: how to implement the linearization of the second subsystem? We will overcome the difficulty by introducing an implicit function, which enable us to construct equivalent functions to achieve the topological conjugacy between nonhyperbolic systems.},

For each class from the constructed chain of nested gauged classes of such systems, we single out its singular subclass, which appears to consist of systems being similar to the elementary (free particle) system whereas the regular subclass is the complement of the singular one. This allows us to exhaustively describe the equivalence groupoids of the above classes as well as of their singular and regular subclasses. Applying various algebraic techniques, we establish principal properties of Lie symmetries of the systems under consideration and outline ways for completely classifying these symmetries. In particular, we compute the sharp lower and upper bounds for the dimensions of the maximal Lie invariance algebras possessed by systems from each of the above classes and subclasses. We also show how equivalence transformations and Lie symmetries can be used for reduction of order of such systems and their integration. As an illustrative example of using the theory developed, we solve the complete group classification problems for all these classes in the case of two dependent variables.},

First, we show that given any family T 1 , … , T N T1,…,TN of disjoint hypercyclic operators, one can always select an operator T such that the extended family T 1 , … , T N , T T1,…,TN,T of operators remains disjoint hypercyclic. In fact, we prove that the set of operators T which can extend the family of disjoint hypercyclic operators is dense in the strong operator topology in the algebra of bounded operators. Second, we show the existence of two disjoint weakly mixing operators that fail to possess a dense d-hypercyclic manifold. Thus, these operators satisfy the Disjoint Blow-up/Collapse property but fail to satisfy the Strong Disjoint Blow-up/Collapse property, a notion which was introduced by Salas as a sufficient condition for having a dense linear manifold of disjoint hypercyclic vectors.},

This class includes the overdamped dynamics (i.e. ‘velocity = force’) of charged particles interacting by the Coulomb potential. Particles of opposite sign collide typically in finite time. Upon collision, pairs of colliding particles are removed from the system. In a recent paper by Peletier, Požár and the author, the specific case of the Coulomb potential was studied. Global well-posedness of the corresponding particle system was shown and a discrete-to-continuum limit (i.e. n → ∞ n→∞ ) to a nonlocal PDE for the signed particle density was established. Both results rely on innovative use of techniques in ODE theory and viscosity solutions. The particle system with the Coulomb potential has a limited range of applications. The aim of the present paper is to broadly widen this range by adding an external potential and by considering a large class of interaction potentials which, moreover, may scale with n . Several key steps in the proofs for the Coulomb potential do not carry over; new techniques are developed to establish these steps.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a stochastic multi-species model with the Holling type II functional response, which includes the stochastic competition model, the stochastic mutualism model, and the stochastic hybrid model of competition and mutualism. Sufficient conditions for the stationary distribution and ergodicity of the model are established. We support our analytical findings through extensive simulation studies. We show that under relatively small noise, the model has a stationary distribution and ergodicity, while the relatively large noise leads to the non-persistent and non-stationary distribution of the model through the numerical simulation studies of three species.},

A three-dimensional periodic delay food chain model with initial value is derived from the original model. To establish the threshold dynamics of NPZ model, we first obtain the global attractivity of the positive periodic solution of the nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) subsystem by using the method of sub-super solutions and associated iterations. We then give the integral expression of threshold for the corresponding system, which is convenient for numerical simulations. Based on this, the threshold dynamics is discussed by appealing to the comparison arguments and the persistence theory. Finally, the analytic results are in good consistence with our numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Finite trigonometric sums is a challenging and often quite difficult object of study. In this paper we investigate the finite sum of cosecants ∑ csc ⁡ ( φ + a π l / n ) ∑csc⁡(φ+aπl/n) , where the summation index l runs through 1 to n − 1 n−1 and φ and a are arbitrary parameters, as well as several closely related sums, such as similar sums of a series of secants, of tangents and of cotangents. These trigonometric sums appear in various problems in mathematics, physics, and a variety of related disciplines. Their particular cases were fragmentarily considered in previous works, and it was noted that even a simple particular case ∑ csc ⁡ ( π l / n ) ∑csc⁡(πl/n) does not have a closed–form, i.e. a compact summation formula (similar sums of sines, of cosines, of tangents, of cotangents and even of secants, if they exist, possess such expressions). In this paper, we derive several alternative representations for the above–mentioned sums, study their properties, relate them to many other finite and infinite sums, obtain their complete asymptotic expansions for large n and provide accurate upper and lower bounds (e.g. the typical relative error for the upper bound is lesser than 2 × 10 − 9 2×10−9 for n ⩾ 10 n⩾10 and lesser than 7 × 10 − 14 7×10−14 for n ⩾ 50 n⩾50 , which is much better than the bounds we could find in previous works). Our researches reveal that these sums are deeply related to several special numbers and functions, especially to the digamma function (furthermore, as a by-product, we obtain several interesting summation formulæ for the digamma function). Asymptotical studies show that these sums may have qualitatively different behaviour depending on the choice of φ and a . In particular, as n increases some of them may become sporadically large and we identify the terms of the asymptotics responsible for such a behaviour. Finally, we also provide several historical remarks related to various sums considered in the paper. We show that some results in the field either were rediscovered several times or can easily be deduced from various known formulæ, including some formulæ dating back to the XVIIIth century.},

In this paper, we study the H2 -norm continuity and H∞ -norm discontinuity of Qinn and Qout on some subsets of H∞ . On the other hand, the Beurling theorem connects inner functions and invariant subspaces of the multiplication operator Mz . We show the nonexistence of continuous cross section from some certain invariant subspaces to inner functions in the supremum norm. The continuity problem of Qinn and Qout on Hol(D‾) , the set of all analytic functions in the closed unit disk, are considered.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a generalized interlacing property between Bessel functions, particularly J ν Jν and J μ Jμ , where the difference | ν − μ | |ν−μ| exceeds 2. This interlacing phenomenon is marked by a compensatory interaction with the zeros of Lommel polynomials, extending our understanding beyond the traditional | ν − μ | ≤ 2 |ν−μ|≤2 regime. The paper extends the generalized interlacing property to cylinder functions and the derivative of Bessel functions, as an application. It is also discussed that Siegel&#39;s extension of Bourget hypothesis to rational numbers of ν cannot be further improved to arbitrary real numbers.},

We also obtain the asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction number when the diffusion rates go to infinity and zero, respectively. Further, we numerically study the effects of diffusion rates, the outflow rate by patient crowding and other parameters on R 0 R0 with and without seasonality, and found that the neglect of seasonality does overestimate the infection risk and the disease may be well controlled by avoiding overcrowding of patients rather than increasing the mobility of individuals or bacteria.},

Our approach is based on comparison arguments for an equivalent non-Lipschitz first-order ODE. We formulate sufficient conditions for the existence and non-existence of these generalized solutions and discuss how the convective velocity affects the minimal wave speed compared to the problem without convection. We also provide brief asymptotic analysis of the profiles, for which we need to assume power-type behavior of the diffusion and reaction terms.},

  abstract     = {Generalized digamma functions ψ k ( x ) , studied by Ramanujan, Deninger, Dilcher, Kanemitsu, Ishibashi etc., appear as the Laurent series coefficients of the Hurwitz zeta function. In this paper, a modular relation of the form F k ( α ) = F k ( 1 / α ) containing infinite series of ψ k ( x ) , or, equivalently, between the generalized Stieltjes constants γ k ( x ) , is obtained for any k ∈ N . When k = 0 , it reduces to a famous transformation given on page 220 of Ramanujan&#39;s Lost Notebook. For k = 1 , an integral containing Riemann&#39;s Ξ-function, and corresponding to the aforementioned modular relation, is also obtained along with its asymptotic expansions as α → 0 and α → ∞ . Carlitz-type and Guinand-type finite modular relations involving ψ j ( m ) ( x ) , 0 ≤ j ≤ k , m ∈ N ∪ { 0 } , are also derived, thereby extending previous results on the digamma function ψ ( x ) . The extension of Guinand&#39;s result for ψ j ( m ) ( x ) , m ≥ 2 , involves an interesting combinatorial sum h ( r ) over integer partitions of 2 r into exactly r parts. This sum plays a crucial role in an inversion formula needed for this extension. This formula has connection with the inversion formula for the inverse of a triangular Toeplitz matrix. The modular relation for ψ j ′ ( x ) is subtle and requires delicate analysis.},

  abstract     = {We construct the reduced and essential C*-algebra of a Fell bundle over an étale groupoid (in full generality, without any second countability, local compactness or Hausdorff assumptions, even on the unit space) directly from sections under convolution. This eliminates the j -map commonly seen in the groupoid and Fell bundle C*-algebra literature. We further show how multiplier algebras and other Banach *-bimodules can again be constructed directly from sections. Finally, we extend Varela&#39;s morphisms from C*-bundles to Fell bundles, thus making the reduced C*-algebra construction functorial.},

For a diffusion, the best estimate is already given by Grigor&#39;yan and Telcs, and we make it explicit in our particular case. For jump processes, especially those where the scale of the process is different with that of the jump kernel, we improve the results by Bae, Kang, Kim and Lee. Uniformity of the coefficients (or parameters) in the known estimates and metric transforms play the key role in our proof. We also show by examples how the weak chain condition is valid in practice.},

Specifically, we show that in every infinite dimensional Banach space which admits a WUR (resp. URED) renorming, we can find a norm with the same condition and which moreover fails to be UR (resp. WUR). We prove that these norms can be constructed to be Locally Uniformly Rotund (LUR) in Banach spaces admitting such renormings. Additionally, we obtain that in every Banach space with a LUR norm we can find a LUR renorming which is not URED. These results solve three open problems posed by A.J. Guirao, V. Montesinos and V. Zizler. The norms we construct in this first part are dense. In the last part of this note, we solve a fourth question posed by the same three authors by constructing a C ∞ C∞ -smooth norm in c 0 c0 whose dual norm is not strictly convex.},

We obtain formulas that are more general than previous expressions and deduce linear recursions, which are computationally more efficient than the degree two recursions proved by Zagier. As an application, we provide an answer to a question recently posed by Xie, Zhao and Zhao concerning special values of Dirichlet L -functions. The proofs use the combinatorial Laplacian on cyclic graphs and their twisted coverings. The techniques therefore connect the trigonometric sums to spectral invariants of graphs and open up for future investigations.},

These inclusions are modelled with moderate values of the Lamé coefficients while they have a large relative mass density. These properties allow them to enjoy sequences of resonant frequencies that can be computed via the eigenvalues of the volume integral operator having the Navier fundamental matrix as a kernel, i.e., the Navier volume operator. The dominant field, i.e., the Foldy-Lax field, models the multiple interactions between the inclusions with scattering coefficients that are inversely proportional to the difference between the used incident frequency and the already mentioned resonances. We show, in particular, that to reconstruct remotely the scattered field generated after N interactions between the inclusions, one needs to use an incident frequency appropriately close to the proper resonance of the inclusions. We provide an explicit link between the order N of interactions and the distance from the incident frequency to the resonance. Finally, if the cluster of the inclusions is densely distributed in a given bounded domain, then the expression of the induced dominant field suggests that the equivalent homogenized mass density can change sign depending if the used incident frequencies is smaller or larger than a certain threshold (which is explicitly given in terms of the resonant frequencies of the inclusions).},

These are weighted Sobolev spaces with Lebesgue exponents as small as λ = 4 λ=4 , making them suitable for approximations. The KWO metric is analysed through a bundle of Markov semigroups having generators with irregular first-order terms. Strong a-priori estimates are obtained for the associated parabolic equations. Together with a weak Poincaré/ L p Lp -convergence theorem, these are used to establish the Hölder continuity of the “velocity field” representation of tangent vectors—a property inherited by the KWO metric.

In this paper we focus on two types of results, which allow us to obtain good discretization of the uniform norm with polynomial in N number of points. In the first way we weaken the discretization inequality by allowing a bound of the uniform norm by the discrete norm multiplied by an extra factor, which may depend on N . In the second way we impose restrictions on the finite dimensional subspace under consideration. In particular, we prove a general result, which connects the upper bound on the number of sampling points in the discretization theorem for the uniform norm with the best m -term bilinear approximation of the Dirichlet kernel associated with the given subspace.},

  abstract     = {We explored the multi-solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional Ito equation based on the superposition formula. Firstly, via the superposition of exponential functions, we derived the multi-soliton wave solutions. Secondly, a new type of mixed solutions between multi-arbitrary functions and multi-kink solitons is introduced. Finally, we constructed the multi-localized wave solutions by utilizing the superposition of N-even power functions. Besides, we obtained novel interaction solutions based on the superposition formula of multi-localized wave solutions and multi-arbitrary functions. We illustrated the dynamic analysis and properties of these solutions using 3D, contour and density plots. These findings are essential for showing the propagation behavior of nonlinear waves and for explaining specific physical phenomena. They contribute significantly to the study of nonlinear waves.},

  abstract     = {Linear Maxwell equations for transverse magnetic (TM) polarized fields support single frequency surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) localized at the interface of a metal and a dielectric. Metals are typically dispersive, i.e. the dielectric function depends on the frequency. We prove the bifurcation of localized SPPs in dispersive media in the presence of a cubic nonlinearity and provide an asymptotic expansion of the solution and the frequency. The problem is reduced to a system of nonlinear differential equations in one spatial dimension by assuming a plane wave dependence in the direction tangential to the (flat) interfaces. The number of interfaces is arbitrary and the nonlinear system is solved in a subspace of functions with the H 1 H1 -Sobolev regularity in each material layer. The corresponding linear system is an operator pencil in the frequency parameter due to the material dispersion. The studied bifurcation occurs at a simple isolated eigenvalue of the pencil. For geometries consisting of two or three homogeneous layers we provide explicit conditions on the existence of eigenvalues and on their simpleness and isolatedness. Real frequencies are shown to exist in the nonlinear setting in the case of P T PT -symmetric materials. We also apply a finite difference numerical method to the nonlinear system and compute bifurcating curves.},

By using the variational characterization of the second eigenvalue of the Steklov eigenvalue problem for the p i pi -Laplacian together with the properties of the related truncated energy functionals, which are in general nonsmooth, we show the existence of a nontrivial solution whose components lie between the components of the positive minimal and the negative maximal solution.},

Our primary aim is to conduct a more comprehensive exploration of the fractal dimensions exhibited by graphs resulting from the products and sums of two continuous functions. This article is entirely devoted to the investigation of this specific problem domain. In the course of our research, we furnish explicit formulas for computing both the general upper box dimension and the general lower box dimension associated with the graphs formed by the products and sums of two continuous functions. Additionally, we shed light on the decomposition of continuous functions into the sum of two continuous functions, employing the framework of the general lower and upper box dimensions. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound for the general upper box dimension applicable to each element within a finite ring of polynomials derived from continuous functions defined over the real number field R R . Our inquiry also extends to the examination of general Hausdorff and packing dimensions for the graphs generated through both the summation and multiplication of two continuous functions.},

  abstract     = {In this note we present a singular Sturm comparison theorem for two linear Hamiltonian systems satisfying a standard majorant condition and the identical normality assumption. Both endpoints of the considered interval may be singular. We identify the exact form of the strict majorant condition, which is necessary and sufficient for the property that every solution (conjoined basis) of the majorant system has more focal points than the solutions of the minorant system. We provide a formula for the exact number of focal points of any solution of the majorant system, depending on the number of focal points of solutions of the minorant system and on the number of right focal points of a solution of a certain transformed linear Hamiltonian system. This transformed system may be in general abnormal. Our result extends the previous Sturm comparison theorems for linear Hamiltonian systems by Kratz (1995) [18] on a compact interval and by the authors (2020) [35] , [36] on an open or unbounded interval. The main result is also new for the second order differential equations, where it extends the singular comparison theorem by Aharonov and Elias (2010) [1] .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study a family of nonlinear (conditional) expectations that can be understood as a stochastic process with uncertain parameters. We develop a general framework which can be seen as a version of the martingale problem method of Stroock and Varadhan with parameter uncertainty. To illustrate our methodology, we explain how it can be used to model nonlinear Lévy processes in the sense of Neufeld and Nutz, and we introduce the new class of stochastic partial differential equations under parameter uncertainty. Moreover, we study properties of the nonlinear expectations. We prove the dynamic programming principle, i.e., the tower property, and we establish conditions for the (strong) USC b USCb –Feller property and a strong Markov selection principle.},

Inspired by a work of Cima, we study the limits of convolutions of finitely many f α fα and the convolution of arbitrary unbounded convex mappings. The analysis for the latter is based on the notion of angle at infinity , which provides an estimate for the growth at infinity and determines whether the convolution is bounded or not. A generalization to an arbitrary number of factors shows that the convolution of n randomly chosen unbounded convex mappings has a probability of 1 / n ! 1/n! of remaining unbounded. We provide the precise asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of the functions f α fα .},

In contrast to biharmonic curves p -biharmonic curves do not need to have constant geodesic curvature if p = 1 2 p=12 in which case their equation reduces to the one of 1 2 12 -elastic curves. We will classify 1 2 12 -biharmonic curves on closed surfaces and three-dimensional space forms making use of the results obtained for 1 2 12 -elastic curves from the literature. By making a connection to magnetic geodesic we are able to prove the existence of 1 2 12 -biharmonic curves on closed surfaces. In addition, we will discuss the stability of p -biharmonic curves with respect to normal variations. Our analysis highlights some interesting relations between p -biharmonic and p -elastic curves.},

Firstly, when the speed of the shifting habitat edge c is larger than the spreading speed of the species ⁎ c ⁎ c⁎ , by applying the comparison principle, the Fourier transform and the L 2 L2 -weighted energy estimate, we show that all forced traveling waves with the speed ⁎ c &gt; c ⁎ c&amp;gt;c⁎ are exponentially stable in the form of e − μ t e−μt , for some μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 .

Specifically, we consider a non-homogeneous problem with a source term as a Radon measure, where the leading nonlinear local operator has linear growth and the nonlinearity is allowed to be merely measurable. Moreover, the nonlocal operator is of the type fractional Laplacian with only measurable kernel coefficients. Under some smallness assumption on the local operator, we prove that the gradient of SOLA has the same integrability as that of a fractional maximal function of order 1 of the Radon measure. The proof relies on the use of a new type of maximal functions and novel parabolic tail estimates, which to the best of our knowledge, have not been observed in the previous works. Furthermore, to complement the aforementioned gradient estimates, we prove the existence of SOLA to an initial value problem and derive some gradient estimates with respect to the L 1 L1 -norm.},

  abstract     = {It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.},

The corresponding free boundary problem possesses flat front traveling wave solutions. Linear stability of these solutions under periodic perturbations is considered. It is shown that the solutions are stable for short-wave perturbations while exhibiting long-wave instability under certain conditions on the model parameters (if the traction force is sufficiently strong). Then, considering the prescribed period as the bifurcation parameter, we establish the emergence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions with a finger-like periodic structure (pattern). We also construct asymptotic expansions of the solutions in the vicinity of the bifurcation point and study their stability. We show that, depending on the value of the contractility coefficient, the bifurcation can be a subcritical or a supercritical pitchfork.},

  abstract     = {We consider the damped nonlinear Schrödinger equation with saturation: i.e., the complex evolution equation contains in its left hand side, besides the potential term V ( x ) u V(x)u , a nonlinear term of the form i μ u ( t , x ) / | u ( t , x ) | iμu(t,x)/|u(t,x)| for a given parameter μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 (arising in optical applications on non-Kerr-like fibers). In the right hand side we assume a given forcing term f ( t , x ) f(t,x) . The important new difficulty, in contrast to previous results in the literature, comes from the fact that the spatial domain is assumed to be unbounded. We start by proving the existence and uniqueness of weak and strong solutions according the regularity of the data of the problem. The existence of solutions with a lower regularity is also obtained by working with a sequence of spaces verifying the Radon-Nikodým property. Concerning the asymptotic behavior for large times we prove a strong stabilization result. For instance, in the one dimensional case we prove that there is extinction in finite time of the solutions under the mere assumption that the L ∞ L∞ -norm of the forcing term f ( t , x ) f(t,x) becomes less than μ after a finite time. This presents some analogies with the so called feedback bang-bang controls v (here v = − i μ u / | u | + f ) v=−iμu/|u|+f) .},

The maximal run-length function l n ( x , A ) ln(x,A) of x over A is defined by l n ( x , A ) = max ⁡ { k : x i + 1 x i + 2 ⋯ x i + k ∈ A for some 0 ≤ i ≤ n − k } . ln(x,A)=max⁡{k:xi+1xi+2⋯xi+k∈Afor some0≤i≤n−k}. In a general setting, Wu (2024) [18] proved a metrical property on the asymptotic behavior of l n ( x , A ) ln(x,A) , which extends the famous Erdős-Rényi limit theorem that represents for the special case A = { 1 k : k ≥ 1 } A={1k:k≥1} . Under the assumption that A is factorial (i.e. the language A is closed under subword), Wu studied the exceptional set E = { x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) : lim n → ∞ ⁡ l n ( x , A ) m n = 0 and lim n → ∞ ⁡ l n ( x , A ) = ∞ } , E={x∈[0,1):limn→∞⁡ln(x,A)mn=0andlimn→∞⁡ln(x,A)=∞}, and he obtained a lower bound of the Hausdorff dimension of E with some conditions on m n mn .

For this transformation-based jump-adapted quasi-Milstein scheme, we prove L p Lp -convergence order 3/4. To obtain this result, we prove that under slightly stronger assumptions (but still weaker than assumptions applied before) a related jump-adapted quasi-Milstein scheme has convergence order 3/4; in a special case it even has convergence order 1. Order 3/4 is conjectured to be optimal.},

One of the essential dynamical behaviours researchers are interested in is the asymptotic stability in distribution. However, related work on periodic SDEs is quite little. This paper aims to fill the gap. Technical challenges including time-inhomogeneity and periodicity of SDEs make this a challenging and non-trivial work. The main results are finally demonstrated by an example. Our theory can be easily implemented to different application scenarios.},

We first address the boundary control problem.

Consequently, via the Hilbert Uniqueness Method, we deduce exact boundary controllability for the control system under consideration in any time T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 . Moreover, we investigate the stabilization problem for this class of equations in the range of subcritical coefficients of the singular potential.

In this paper, the classification of Tchebychev affine Kähler hypersurfaces is obtained under the assumption that Weyl curvature tensor vanishes. As corollaries, we completely determine 3-dimensional Tchebychev affine Kähler hypersurfaces in local sense and obtain the classification of Calabi complete Tchebychev affine Kähler hypersurfaces in R 4 R4 , which partially improves the results of Xu-Li.

First of all, we compute a complete family of elliptic solution of this higher-order equation, which can degenerate into two particular cases, i.e., the dnoidal and cnoidal solutions. By using the modified squared wavefunction approach, we solve the spectral problem on the elliptic function background. Then, we derive multi-breather solutions in terms of the theta functions, particular examples of which are the Kuznetsov-Ma breather and the Akhmediev breather. Furthermore, taking the limit of the breather solutions at branch points, we construct higher-order rogue wave solutions by employing a generalized Darboux transformation technique. On the periodic background, we present the first-order, second-order and second-second-order rogue waves. With aid of the theta functions, we explicitly characterize the resulting breathers and rogue waves, and demonstrate their dynamic behaviors by illustrative examples. Finally, we discuss how the parameter of the higher-order effects affects the breathers and rogue waves.},

For example, we find the four tenth-order mock theta functions and their six identities. The six identities themselves are of a spectacular nature and were first proved by Choi. Indeed, in their fifth and final volume on Ramanujan&#39;s lost notebook, Andrews and Berndt proclaimed about one of the six identities “ It is inconceivable that an identity such as ϕ 10 ( q ) − q − 1 ψ 10 ( − q 4 ) + q − 2 χ 10 ( q 8 ) = J ‾ 1 , 2 j ( − q 2 ; − q 10 ) J 2 , 8 could be stumbled upon by a mindless search algorithm without any overarching theoretical insight. ” Recently, the first author discovered and proved three new tenth-order like identities but for sixth-order mock theta functions. Building on this recent discovery, we develop a long sought after overarching theoretical insight hinted at by Andrews and Berndt by finding several general families of tenth-order like identities for Appell functions, which are the building blocks of Ramanujan&#39;s mock theta functions.

  abstract     = {The initial-boundary value problem for the Schrödinger equation with cubic nonlinearities of the form u 3 − k u ¯ k u3−ku¯k is studied on the half-line. Using the Fokas solution formula for the corresponding linear forced problem linear estimates are derived with data in Sobolev spaces and forcing in Bourgain solution spaces. Then, using these linear estimates and the trilinear estimates indicated by the forcing it is shown that the iteration map defined by the Fokas solution formula is a contraction in appropriate solution spaces. Thus, local well-posedness is proved for Sobolev exponents s ≥ 0 s≥0 when k = 0 , 1 , 2 k=0,1,2 , and for s &gt; − 1 / 3 s&amp;gt;−1/3 when k = 3 k=3 . The methodology used is analogous to the one used for the corresponding initial value problems that is based on the Fourier transform for solving the forced linear problem.},

Using certain dispersive and smoothing properties of heat semigroups on Morrey-Lorentz spaces as well as Yamazaki-type estimate on block spaces, we prove the existence of bounded mild solutions for the linear systems corresponding to the Boussinesq systems. Then, we establish a Massera-type theorem to obtain the existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions to corresponding linear systems on the half line time-axis by using a mean-ergodic method. Next, using fixed point arguments, we can pass from linear systems to prove the existence uniqueness and polynomial stability of such solutions for Boussinesq systems.

A new class of energy-preserving schemes is constructed by the ideas of scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) and splitting, from which the nonlinearly implicit schemes have been improved to be linearly implicit. The energy conservation and error estimates are rigorously derived. Based on these results, it is shown that the new proposed schemes have unconditionally energy stability and can be implemented with a cost of solving a linearly implicit system. Numerical experiments are done to confirm these good features of the new schemes.},

Attractive central force problems on state manifolds appear quite often and in several different context ranging from nonlinear control theory to mobile robotics, thermodynamics, artificial intelligence, signal transmission and processing and so on. The aim of the present paper is to analyze the variational properties of the circular periodic orbits in the case of attractive power-law potentials of the Riemannian distance on revolution&#39;s surfaces.

We study SCD points in direct sums of Banach spaces and obtain that an infinite sum of Banach spaces may have an SCD point despite the fact that none of its components have it. We then prove sufficient conditions to get that an elementary tensor x ⊗ y x⊗y is an SCD point in the unit ball of the projective tensor product X ⊗ ˆ π Y X⊗ˆπY . Regarding Lipschitz-free spaces on complete metric spaces, we show that norm-one SCD points of their unit balls are exactly the ones that can be approximated by convex combinations of denting points of the unit ball. Finally, as applications, we prove a new inheritance result for the Daugavet property to its subspaces, we show that separable Banach spaces for which every convex series of slices intersects the unit sphere must contain an isomorphic copy of ℓ 1 ℓ1 , and we get pointwise conditions on an operator on a Banach space with the Daugavet property to satisfy the Daugavet equation.},

  abstract     = {This article explores the innovative use of Hadamard transforms in Hermitian Clifford analysis within Cayley–Dickson algebras. The study focuses on the integration of the Hadamard matrix into these algebras, highlighting its role in establishing a crucial subgroup of the automorphism group. This involves treating each row vector of the matrix as a diagonal matrix. A key finding is the transformation of the Witt basis into the classical basis under the influence of the Hadamard transforms, illustrating a deep connection between these elements. The research also reveals how Hermitian Clifford vectors correspond to twisted vectors through these transforms. Moreover, it introduces a novel method for converting vectors into Cayley–Dickson numbers, expanding the scope of vector manipulation. This advancement allows for the expansion of unit-length vectors into orthogonal matrices, significantly enriching the field of Clifford analysis. Hadamard transforms also facilitate the definition of Hermitian Dirac operators, intricately connected to split complex numbers. The research establishes the Borel-Pompeiu integral formula and the Teodorescu transform for these operators, drawing on their relationship with twisted complex structures. This approach not only uncovers direct relationships between orthogonal and Hermitian Clifford analysis but also introduces the Almansi decomposition and Hermitian Clifford wavelet transforms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model combining local and nonlocal methods for effective image denoising. The model utilizes variable exponents p ( x ) p(x) to achieve adaptive diffusion behavior and preserve image features. Nevertheless, the coupling structure of our proposed process, along with the spatial dependence of p ( x ) p(x) , poses challenges in theoretical analysis. To address this, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of the solution using the Faedo-Galerkin approximation, a priori estimates, and compactness considerations. Through these theoretical investigations, we demonstrate the existence of a weak solution for the coupled parabolic system. Overall, our model outperforms existing methods in noise reduction and image quality preservation.},

Then, the perturbed system possesses the dispersive nature due to the constant magnetic field B ¯ B¯ . The aim of this paper is to control the dispersion and prove the well-posedness of the perturbed system. To this end, we consider scaling critical function spaces of Besov type based on the Fourier–Lebesgue spaces L p ˆ ( R 3 ) Lpˆ(R3) , namely critical Fourier–Besov spaces, and show the global well-posedness for all 1 ⩽ p ⩽ ∞ 1⩽p⩽∞ . Moreover, we focus on the weak dispersive case | B ¯ | ≪ 1 |B¯|≪1 and the strong dispersive case | B ¯ | ≫ 1 |B¯|≫1 . In the former case, the dispersion is negligible and we show the well-posedness in the scaling critical Besov spaces based on the usual Lebesgue space L p Lp . For the latter case, we prove that the global unique solution is established even for arbitrarily large data in the scaling critical L 2 L2 -Besov spaces by virtue of the Strichartz type estimates for the linear solutions.},

Without imposing additional coupling conditions, we obtain the existence, uniqueness and stability of Riemann solutions. Then we study the interaction problem of the CAR model with Chaplygin pressure, which models traffic phenomenon with careless driving in a certain section of the highway. From the solutions to the interaction problem, we can observe the formation and disappearance of traffic jam. The mathematical mechanism of traffic jam is analyzed, and the result is in good agreement with real traffic flow.},

The analytical properties of the operators in the space of classical solutions and the pseudoanalytic Bergman space are established. With the aid of such operators, a complete system of solutions for the main Vekua equation, called radial formal powers, is obtained. The completeness of the radial formal powers is proven with respect to the uniform convergence on compact subsets and in the bicomplex pseudoanalytic Bergman space with the L 2 L2 -norm. For the pseudoanalytic Bergman space on a disk, it is shown that the radial formal powers are an orthogonal basis, and a representation for the Bergman kernel in terms of a such basis is obtained.},

We cope with the disturbance by the approach of active disturbance rejection control. In contrast with the existing results, the assumptions on the derivative of the disturbance are removed. It is necessary to assume that the disturbance is Lipschitz continuous. A state observer together with a disturbance estimator is designed by using the corrupted output. Both the well-posedness and the stability of the closed-loop system are proved. The theoretical results are validated visually by some numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Maxwell equations with anisotropic coefficients and non-trivial conductivity in a domain with finitely many cylindrical ends. We assume that the conductivity vanishes at infinity and that the permittivity and permeability tensors converge to non-constant matrices at infinity, which coincide with a positive real multiple of the identity matrix in each of the cylindrical ends. We establish that the essential spectrum of Maxwell system can be decomposed as the union of the essential spectrum of a bounded multiplication operator acting on gradient fields, and the union of the essential spectra of the Maxwell systems obtained by freezing the coefficients to their different limiting values along the several different cylindrical ends of the domain.},

  abstract     = {Starting from a Riemannian conformal structure on a manifold M , we provide a method to construct a family of Lorentzian manifolds. The construction relies on the choice of a metric in the conformal class and a smooth 1-parameter family of self-adjoint tensor fields. Then, every metric in the conformal class corresponds to the induced metric on M seen as a codimension two spacelike submanifold into these Lorentzian manifolds. Under suitable choices of the 1-parameter family of tensor fields, there exists a lightlike normal vector field along such spacelike submanifolds whose Weingarten endomorphism provide a Möbius structure on the Riemannian conformal structure. Conversely, every Möbius structure on a Riemannian conformal structure arises in this way. Flat Möbius structures are characterized in terms of the extrinsic geometry of the corresponding spacelike surfaces.},

In more geometric parlance, the latter shows that if V 1 V1 and V 2 V2 are Orlicz functions, then random points in the V 1 V1 -Orlicz ball, conditioned on having a small V 2 V2 -Orlicz radius, look like an appropriately scaled V 2 V2 -Orlicz ball.

We investigate the existence of both trivial and non trivial equilibria and their stability. We show how to estimate the size of different human populations using the host incidence which is, in general, the only available information.

Moreover, we introduce a Dunkl analogue of the Bessel functions and K K -Bessel functions, generalizing those of a symmetric cone which occur when the multiplicity parameter k is chosen to be twice the Peirce dimension constant of the cone. In particular, we show that our K K -Bessel function is a solution of a type B system of Dunkl operators which is a generalization of the Bessel system on a symmetric cone. Furthermore, we define zeta distributions and prove a functional equation relating them with their type B Dunkl transform. In the case of symmetric cones the aforementioned functional equation reduces to the known functional equation between zeta distributions and their Fourier transform . For the proof of this functional equation, the K K -Bessel function and its analytic properties turn out to be crucial. Finally, we examine which of the zeta distributions are given by a positive measure.},

The drift of the considered SDEs contains a polynomial term satisfying a one-sided growth condition . Such nonlinearities in high dimensional settings occur, e.g., when stochastic reaction diffusion equations are discretized in space. We provide a brief discussion around existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions. (Almost) stability then is the basis for new concepts of Gramians that we introduce and study in this work. With the help of these Gramians, dominant subspace is identified leading to a balancing related highly accurate reduced order SDE. We provide an algebraic error criterion and an error analysis of the propose model reduction schemes. The paper is concluded by applying our method to spatially discretized reaction diffusion equations.},

Their modeling to predict their evolution can be done with PDE-based models but it requires the parametrization of different cloud micro-physical processes. Simplified models can maintain a balance between complexity and precision, and can still capture qualitative observations made in nature. In this work, we prove global existence and uniqueness of a model for precipitating turbulent convection. The model considers a moisture dynamics with phase changes. It assumes fast auto-conversion and rain evaporation together with a hydrostatic pressure approximation. We also show positivity of the variables associated to moisture and equivalent potential temperature. The existing literature is discussed and the new challenges in this model are highlighted.},

The Vieta-Fibonacci wavelet collocation approach is introduced to solve the Emden-Fowler equation of third order and Chandrasekhar&#39;s white dwarf equation. The obtained solutions are compared and it is observed that the absolute errors between exact and Vieta-Fibonacci wavelet solution are less than between exact and ODE45 solution of Emden-Fowler equation of third order as well as Chandrasekhar&#39;s white dwarf equation.

We prove that the system is not null controllable at any time using localized controls in density and stress equations and even everywhere control in the velocity equation. However, we show that the system is null controllable at any time if the control acting in density or stress equation is everywhere in the domain. This is the best possible null controllability result obtained for this system. Next, we show that the system is approximately controllable at large time using localized controls.

In addition, we provide the sharp sufficient criteria under which the system admits a unique ergodic invariant measure (UEIM), and show that the transition function of the solution of the system exponentially converges to the UEIM under the total variation norm. The findings show that the stability and dynamical bifurcation of the system have close relationships with the random perturbations.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the convergence analysis of finite element method for Dirichlet boundary control problem governed by parabolic equation with measure data. The presence of measure data in the source term and Dirichlet boundary control lead the solution of the state equation to have low regularity, which creates a challenging task for the error analysis . We prove the existence, uniqueness and regularity results of the solution to the control problem. For the discretization of the state and adjoint variables, we employ continuous piecewise linear polynomials while the control variable is approximated by piecewise constant functions. The backward Euler technique provides the foundation for the temporal discretization. For the completely discrete optimal control problem , a priori error bounds for the state variable in the L 2 ( 0 , T ; L 2 ( Ω ) ) L2(0,T;L2(Ω)) -norm and for the control variable in the L 2 ( 0 , T ; L 2 ( ∂ Ω ) ) L2(0,T;L2(∂Ω)) -norm are derived. Numerical experiment is performed to validate our theoretical analysis.},

The exact upper bounds of the number of limit cycles bifurcated from the period annulus under different polynomial perturbations are obtained by analyzing the algebraic structures from explicit expressions of any order Melnikov functions.},

Such a function is the attractor of an iterated function system comprising Banach contractions (on the product of two real compact intervals) with respect to the second variable. In the present paper we enlarge classical Barnsley&#39;s framework by allowing the constitutive functions of the system to be Edelstein contractions in the second variable. As the class of Edelstein contractions contains the class of Matkowski contractions, the class of Meir-Keeler contractions, the class of F -contractions and the class of θ -contractions, we provide a much more flexible framework for the construction of fractal interpolation functions. We also obtain a result concerning the estimation of lower and upper box dimensions of the graph of a fractal interpolation function constructed via our general method.},

We firstly extend this notion, designated ‘generalized rotation set’ ρ ( F ) ρ(F) , to the general continuous map of the circle, not necessarily homotopic to identity. We show that ρ ( F ) ρ(F) is compact and connected, i.e., a closed interval, and moreover, each of its endpoints is a generalized rotation number of a recurrent point of f . We also consider the generalized rotation set for f on its invariant sets . Secondly, we introduce a notion of generalized rotational entropy h r ( f ) hr(f) for f , which follows the definition that Botelho proposed in [3] for the annulus, and then we show that it exactly vanishes.},

These questions are connected by the techniques that we use to study them, which exploit symmetry in various ways even though the surfaces we study do not necessarily have inherent symmetry. In the spirit of the celebrated Hersch-Payne-Schiffer and Weinstock inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues, we obtain a sharp isoperimetric inequality for the mixed Steklov eigenvalues considering the interplay between the eigenvalues of the mixed Steklov-Neumann and Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalues. In 1980, Bandle showed that the unit disk maximizes the k th nonzero normalized Steklov eigenvalue on simply connected domains with rotational symmetry of order p when k ≤ p − 1 k≤p−1 . We discuss whether the disk remains the maximizer in the class of simply connected rotationally symmetric domains when k ≥ p k≥p . In particular, we show that as k → ∞ k→∞ , the upper bound converges to the Hersch-Payne-Schiffer upper bound. We give full asymptotics for mixed Steklov problems on arbitrary surfaces, assuming some conditions at the meeting points of the Steklov boundary with the Dirichlet or Neumann boundary.},

  abstract     = {Let S f , n and K f , n be the functions defined in Schröder&#39;s method of the first and second kind for an entire function f with given order n ( n ≥ 2 ) , respectively. Based on unrefined algebra characterizations of S f , n and K f , n , we obtain some sufficient conditions on f such that both S f , n and K f , n possess given finite pairs of extraneous non-repelling cycles. Here, these conditions are a pair of equations, which have infinitely many polynomials or transcendental entire functions as its solutions. For obtaining some solutions f of such equations, we provide a step-by-step method. We start from any solution g in corresponding equations so that the function S g , 2 possesses the above finite pairs of extraneous cycles but all are super-attracting, and then f can be obtained by a series of formulas concerning the function g , points and multipliers of those cycles. Note that S f , 2 = K f , 2 is identical with Newton&#39;s method for f . In a sense, this fact reveals that some extraneous super-attracting cycles of Newton&#39;s method imply certain extraneous non-repelling cycles of any method from the two families of methods. More generally, for any given orders n and m , some extraneous non-repelling cycles of S f , n or K f , n imply that of S F , m or K F , m for some entire functions f and F . These give a partial answer for the problem of finding possible link between the two families of methods, which was posed by Steven Smale in 1994.},

It turns out that F is a stretch metric or weakly stretch metric if and only if F 1 F1 and F 2 F2 both are stretch metric or weakly stretch metric. Necessary and sufficient conditions for F to be of vanishing χ -curvature or H -curvature are obtained. Under certain condition, we obtain a differential equation to characterize F with almost vanishing χ -curvature. We also prove that F with almost vanishing H -curvature has vanishing H -curvature.},

To this end, we introduce an operator-valued short-time Fourier transform for certain classes of operators with operator windows, and show that the transform acts in a way analogous to the way the short-time Fourier transform for functions acts, in particular giving rise to a family of vector-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces , the so-called coorbit spaces, as spaces of operators. As a result of this structure, the operators generating equivalent norms on the function modulation spaces are fully classified. We show that these classes of operators have the same atomic decomposition properties as the function spaces, and use this to give a characterisation of the spaces using localisation operators.},

Furthermore, we give a substantially new type of characterization of central positive definite elements in terms of a triangle inequality . Namely, we show that for a certain generalized distance measure (emerging from the Kubo-Ando geometric mean), the triangle inequality is satisfied for a given positive definite element A and for all positive definite elements B , C B,C of a ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra exactly when A is central.

However, the S0I property does not characterize inner products in a slightly wider class of norms—for example, there is a family of absolute polygonal norms on C 2 C2 that have the S0I property.

By designing a static feedback with the noncollocated observation and choosing the proper control gain, we stabilize the heat system without disturbances. Then we solve the regulator equation and construct an observer based on the tracking error to obtain the robust output feedback regulator. The closed-loop system is proved to be well-posed and uniformly bounded, and the regulated output tracks the reference signal exponentially.

This problem represents a linearized form of the steady Navier-Stokes equations. In order to better control the behavior at infinity of functions, the use of weighted Sobolev spaces as a functional framework turns out to be adequate. The established results are related to the existence and the uniqueness of weak solutions on L p Lp -theory for any real 1 &lt; p &lt; ∞ 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ . Our analysis is mainly based on the principle that linear exterior problems can be solved by combining their properties in bounded domains which are also established in this paper and their properties well known in the whole space R 2 R2 .},

Then, we obtain exponential ergodicity for neutral SFDEs with Markovian switching by making use of M -matrix theory and a generalized Razumikhin-type argument. Finally, we focus on SFDEs driven by Lévy processes with Markovian switching and prove exponential ergodicity through the Kurtz criterion of tightness for the space D D endowed with the Skorohod topology.

The boundary conditions at x = ℓ x=ℓ correspond to linear combinations of damping moments caused by rotation and angular velocity and also, of forces caused by displacement and velocity, respectively. The system stability analysis based on well-known Lyapunov approach is developed. Under the natural assumptions guaranteeing the existence of a regular weak solution, uniform exponential decay estimate for the energy of the system is derived. The decay rate constant in this estimate depends only on the physical and geometric parameters of the beam, including the viscous external damping coefficient μ ( x ) ≥ 0 μ(x)≥0 , and the boundary springs k r , k d ≥ 0 kr,kd≥0 and dampers k a , k v ≥ 0 ka,kv≥0 .

  abstract     = {This paper considers Markov decision processes (MDPs) with risk-sensitivity. The aim is to explore the effects of state transience and non-communication on the optimal control of the system. A vanishing discount approach is investigated. The approximating system is the MDP evaluated by the usual discounted exponential utility. After being appropriately normalized, it is shown that the optimal discounted value functions converge to the optimal risk-sensitive averages as the discount factor goes to 1. These value functions are shown to depend on certain order structure of the state space. In this way it is also proved that the optimal policies for the discounted system converge to the optimal ones for the risk-sensitive system as the discount factor goes to 1. In proving these, an ordered partition of the state space is introduced, which is closely related to the characteristics of state communication, transience and absorption.},

To be precise we consider the thermo-viscolestic plate with heat conduction of the Green-Naghdi type II and the thermoelastic plate when the heat equation is described by the history-dependent Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation. In both cases we prove the well-posedness of the problems by means of semigroup theory. In the first case we also prove that the solutions decay in an exponential way by means of Prüss characterizations of exponential stable semigroups. In the second case we prove that the solutions decay in a polynomial way with optimal rates of decay, which is proved by Tomilov-Borichev characterizations of polynomial stable semigroups.},

A few explicit examples of these de Branges operators are also discussed. The newly defined RKHS B ( E ) based on the de Branges operator E = ( E − , E + ) has been characterized under some special restrictions. The complete parametrizations and canonical descriptions of all selfadjoint extensions of the closed, symmetric multiplication operator by the independent variable have been given in terms of unitary operators between ranges of reproducing kernels. A sampling formula for the de Branges spaces B ( E ) has been discussed. A particular class of entire operators with infinite deficiency indices has been dealt with and shown that they can be considered as the multiplication operator for a specific class of these de Branges spaces. Finally, a brief discussion on the connection between the characteristic function of a completely nonunitary contraction operator and the de Branges spaces B ( E ) has been given.},

All these strong global and exponential attractors are also the standard global and exponential attractors of optimal regularity. The method used here allows to obtain the stability of the strong attractors with respect to the perturbed parameters in strong topology instead of only standard energy topology.},

In this paper, for partial functional differential equations with nonlinear diffusion, we establish the explicit formulae for the coefficients of normal form associated with Turing-Hopf bifurcation. This provides an explicit connection between the original system and the third-order ordinary differential equations (i.e. normal form) restricted on center manifold. Subsequently, with the aid of extended formulae, we discuss a delayed predator-prey model with predator-taxis and find that Turing-Hopf bifurcation leads to the emergence of a pair of stable single-peak spatially inhomogeneous steady states, a pair of stable multi-peak spatially inhomogeneous periodic orbits and so on. Also, the parameter regions in which these phenomena arise are given quantitatively. It is further shown that the pair of bistable spatially inhomogeneous periodic orbits arise due to the interaction of predator-taxis and time delay, which won&#39;t emerge in the same system without predator-taxis.},

The individual subsystems of the coupled systems are described by general reaction-diffusion (RD) systems, and we account for parameter mismatches between individual subsystems while considering a general coupling scheme. We derive several criteria for the uniform ultimate boundedness of coupled RD systems under different assumptions regarding the properties of the reaction terms and coupling schemes. Using M-matrix theory and iterative methods, we establish an approximate synchronization criterion for the coupled RD systems. This criterion allows the coupled systems to synchronize with synchronization errors arising from parameter mismatches, and perfect synchronization is achieved when there are no parameter mismatches. Moreover, the criterion provides an estimated bound for the synchronization error, which decreases as the degree of inhomogeneity caused by parameter mismatches reduces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, we apply our theories to the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model.},

It allows one to streamline proofs of necessary optimality conditions and calculus relations, unify and simplify the respective statements, clarify and in many cases weaken the assumptions. In this paper we study weaker concepts of quasiuniform infimum , quasiuniform lower semicontinuity and quasiuniform minimum , putting them into the context of the general theory developed by the aforementioned authors. Along the way, we unify the terminology and notation and fill in some gaps in the general theory. We establish rather general primal and dual necessary conditions characterizing quasiuniform ε -minima of the sum of two functions. The obtained fuzzy multiplier rules are formulated in general Banach spaces in terms of Clarke subdifferentials and in Asplund spaces in terms of Fréchet subdifferentials. The mentioned fuzzy multiplier rules naturally lead to certain fuzzy subdifferential calculus results. An application from sparse optimal control illustrates applicability of the obtained findings.},

The dynamical system under consideration involves Caputo fractional derivative of order α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) α∈(0,1) .

Sufficient conditions for controllability are derived using appropriate control function via Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem. An example is provided to validate the results.},

Due to the high level of non-uniqueness and complicated form of the Wiener-Hopf type factorization, it does not appear useful in determining when T Ω TΩ is invertible. In the present paper we use state space methods to characterize invertibility of T Ω TΩ in terms of the existence of a stabilizing solution of an associated nonsymmetric discrete algebraic Riccati equation , which in turn leads to a pseudo-canonical factorization of Ω and concrete formulas of T Ω − 1 TΩ−1 .},

  abstract     = {The bounded linear regularity property plays a key role in the study of the strong convergence and/or convergence rate of the CQ algorithm for solving split feasibility problems. To establish some sufficient conditions ensuring the bounded linear regularity property for split feasibility problems in normed linear spaces , we introduce the notion of a relative regularity condition and its associated relative regularity constant in spirit of the regularity condition used in Burke and Ferris (1995) [12] . Based on convex analysis techniques, we explore equivalent characterizations of the relative regularity condition, which in particular extend the classical results in Burke and Ferris (1995) [12] from the Euclidean space to general normed linear spaces, and then establish some important and useful properties in terms of the related relative regularity constant. Consequently, we develop a new technique to establish some sufficient conditions ensuring the bounded linear regularity property for split feasibility problems in normed linear spaces. The sufficient conditions presented in this paper are in terms of the relative regularity constant, which seem completely new. Applied to the case of Hilbert spaces , our results extend and improve the corresponding ones in Wang et al. (2017) [35] by relaxing the relevant assumptions.},

Our version of this theorem and new extension results for C 1 , + C1,+ and C loc 1 , + Cloc1,+ -smooth functions (i.e., functions with uniformly, resp. locally uniformly continuous derivative), all of which are proved on arbitrary super-reflexive Banach spaces, are further main contributions of our paper.

Zero-set of this polynomial is an algebraic set in the projective space C P n − 1 CPn−1 . This set is called the determinantal hypersurface or determinantal manifold of the tuple ( A 1 , . . . , A n ) (A1,...,An) . It was shown in [7] that determinantal hypersurfaces contain substantial information about representations of finite Coxeter groups . Namely, if G is a non-special Coxeter group of type A , B A,B , or D , ρ 1 ρ1 and ρ 2 ρ2 are two linear representations of G , and the determinantal hypersurfaces of images of the Coxeter generators of G under ρ 1 ρ1 and ρ 2 ρ2 coincide as divisors in the projective space, the characters of ρ 1 ρ1 and ρ 2 ρ2 are equal, and, therefore, ρ 1 ρ1 and ρ 2 ρ2 are equivalent. In [30] this result was extended in the characters part to affine Coxeter groups of types B , C B,C , and D . It was shown there that each such group contains a finite subset such that, if the determinantal hypersurfaces of the images of this set under two finite-dimensional representations coincide as divisors in the projective space, the characters of these representations are equal. Notably, the affine Coxeter groups of A type are not covered by this result, as their combinatorics is quite different. In this paper we explicitly construct a finite set in A ˜ n A˜n having the same property. We also show that every group which is a semidirect product of a finite group and a finitely generated abelian group contains a finite subset with the similar property: for every finite-dimensional representation of the group, the determinantal hypersurface of images of the set determines the representation character.},

We also address the case of higher-order linear q -difference equations, using a classical factorization argument. All these results are illustrated by several examples.},

Under the scaling invariant quantity ( 1 + ‖ ρ 0 ‖ ∞ ) 2 ( ‖ ρ 0 u 0 ‖ 2 2 + ‖ b 0 ‖ 2 2 ) ( ‖ ∇ u 0 ‖ 2 2 + ‖ ∇ b 0 ‖ 2 2 ) is suitably small, the global well-posedness of strong solution to the Cauchy problem is proved. Here, the explicit dependence on the initial norms is given and the smallness depends only on the known parameters in the system. This implies that the global well-posedness result is also valid for some large initial data. Furthermore, the algebraic decay rates of the global solution are obtained.},

In the L p Lp -case, some estimates are also achieved using an exponentially weighted version of the p -norm. Further, a Voronovskaja type formula is proved, finding the exact order of pointwise approximation in case of continuous functions having second derivative at some points. Finally, quantitative estimates for the order of approximation are established in both the continuous and the L p Lp -cases in terms of the modulus of continuity and K-functionals of the involved functions. In the latter estimate, a crucial role is played by the so-called Hardy-Littlewood maximal function.},

The algebraic and analytic properties for the fractional Zernike functions to be established include the connection to special functions, their zeros, their orthogonality property, as well as the differential equations, recurrence and operational formulas they satisfy. Integral representations are also obtained. Their regularity as poly-meromorphic functions is discussed and their generating functions including a bilinear one of “Hardy–Hille type” are derived.

This paper addresses rationally sampled Gabor frames for L 2 ( R + , d μ ) L2(R+,dμ) . Given a function in L 2 ( R + , d μ ) L2(R+,dμ) , we introduce a new Zak transform matrix associated with it, which is different from the conventional Zibulski-Zeevi matrix. It allows us to define a function by designing its Zak transform matrix. Using our Zak transform matrix method, we characterize and express complete Gabor systems, Bessel sequences, Gabor frames, Riesz bases and Gabor duals of an arbitrarily given Gabor frame for L 2 ( R + , d μ ) L2(R+,dμ) , and prove the minimality of the canonical dual frames in some sense.

This is a generalization of Münch&#39;s results for the C D ψ ( m , 0 ) CDψ(m,0) curvature to the C D p ψ ( m , 0 ) CDpψ(m,0) curvature. To do this, we apply the maximum principle and the semigroup method, which are two different strategies, respectively. The unified version of Münch, which is connected to the log-Li-Yau inequality on manifolds and the ⋅ ⋅ -Li-Yau inequality on graphs, is hence enlarged to the broader p-Laplacian setting.

  abstract     = {The Boussinesq system coupled by an energy dissipation brings new challenges in the study of global existence of solutions, for instance, this system does not have scale invariance which makes it difficult to show existence of mild solutions when initial data belongs to scaling invariant function spaces. In this paper we are interested to show global existence of solutions [ u , θ ] [u,θ] for Boussinesq system coupled by bilinear energy dissipation Φ ( u ) = 2 μ E ( u ) ⋅ E ( u ) Φ(u)=2μE(u)⋅E(u) on smooth bounded domain Ω ⊆ R n Ω⊆Rn or whole space R n Rn , n ⩾ 3 n⩾3 , when the initial data [ u 0 , θ 0 ] ∈ X 0 = W σ 1 , n / 2 ( Ω ) × L n / 2 ( Ω ) [u0,θ0]∈X0=Wσ1,n/2(Ω)×Ln/2(Ω) is sufficiently small and the external force F ( θ ) = ϱ f θ e n F(θ)=ϱfθen has low regularity in the sense t 1 / 2 − b / 2 n f ∈ L ∞ ( ( 0 , T ) : L b ( Ω ) ) t1/2−b/2nf∈L∞((0,T):Lb(Ω)) or f ∈ L s ( ( 0 , T ) : L b ( Ω ) ) f∈Ls((0,T):Lb(Ω)) , where 2 s = 1 − n b 2s=1−nb and b ∈ [ n , ∞ ) b∈[n,∞) . It seems that our results on the global and local well-posedness are the first to provide an L p Lp -approach when the initial velocity data u 0 u0 belongs to the space W ˙ σ 1 , n / 2 ( R n ) W˙σ1,n/2(Rn) that is scaling invariant.},

  abstract     = {Despite their frequency, denial-of-service (DoS 5 ) and distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are difficult to prevent and trace, thus posing a constant threat. One of the main defense techniques is to identify the source of the attack by reconstructing the attack graph, and then filtering the messages arriving from this source. One of the most common methods for reconstructing the attack graph is Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM). We focus on edge sampling, which is the most common method. Here, we study the time, in terms of the number of packets, the victim needs to reconstruct the attack graph when there is a single attacker. This random variable plays an important role in the reconstruction algorithm . We mention in passing that the process of reconstructing the attack graph is analogous to a version of the well-known coupon collector&#39;s problem (with coupons having distinct probabilities). Thus, the results may be used in other applications of this problem. Our main theoretical results determine the asymptotic distribution and expected value of the reconstruction time. We present simulations, demonstrating that the approximations, obtained for short real-world attack paths, are pretty accurate.},

In particular, the effect of the state-dependent impulses on the appearance of limit cycles is addressed, which has rarely been studied to date. When a toddler is placed on a swing and pushed gently from behind, the discontinuous changes in the direction and speed of movement of both the toddler and the swing can be described using such a hybrid dynamical system. The main theorem presented in this study reveals that, regardless of the amount of state-dependent impulses, they yield only one stable limit cycle within the region that is identified by the considered system. Moreover, state-dependent impulses lead to destabilization of the equilibrium point. In the proof of the main theorem, a Poincaré mapping is derived by examining the behavior of positive semi-orbits, and the characteristics of the sequence that is obtained from the Poincaré mapping are investigated in detail. Several simulations are performed to demonstrate the main theorem.},

These results lead to several characterizations of Banach spaces with weak ⁎ -separable dual in terms of disjointness properties of operator ranges, which yield a refinement of a theorem of Plichko concerning the spaceability of the complementary set of a proper dense operator range, and an affirmative solution to a problem of Borwein and Tingley for the class of Banach spaces with a separable quotient and weak ⁎ -separable dual. We also provide an extension to these spaces of a theorem of Cross and Shevchik, which guarantees that for every proper dense operator range R in a separable Banach space E there exist two closed quasicomplementary subspaces X and Y of E such that R ∩ ( X + Y ) = { 0 } R∩(X+Y)={0} .

In particular, we analyse the phenomenon of saturation: a state when the entire graph is covered by the moving intervals. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) we prove the existence of the finite moment of permanent saturation for any metric graph with incommensurable edge lengths and any positive length of the intervals; (2) we present an upper bound on the moment of permanent saturation. To show the validity of our results, we reduce the system of moving intervals to the system of dispersing moving points, for the analysis of which we mainly use methods from discrepancy theory and number theory , in particular Kronecker sequences and the famous Three Gap Theorem.},

Obtained improvements we apply to so called strongly f -divergences, a concept of f -divergences for strongly convex functions.

  abstract     = {The variational principles of the metric projection onto closed and convex sets are commonly used as the basis for characterizations of metric projections onto subspaces of Hilbert spaces . However, it is important to realize that the variational principles do not hold as necessary and sufficient conditions in general Banach spaces to characterize the metric projection and its related extensions. This technical handicap prevents the study of metric projection onto subspaces of general Banach spaces from being fully explored. Motivated by this existing lacuna in the literature, we investigate the metric projection and the generalized metric projection onto subspaces of general Banach spaces in this study. Focusing on concrete Banach spaces, we show that even though there are no general variational principles in such spaces for the projection onto subspaces, specific elements satisfy a variational characterization . We provide concrete examples to illustrate various notions of projections in general Banach spaces.},

The time-dependent body force decays, as time t tends to infinity, in a coherent manner. In fact, it is assumed to have a general and complicated asymptotic expansion which involves complex powers of e t et , t , ln ⁡ t ln⁡t , or other iterated logarithmic functions of t . We prove that all Leray–Hopf weak solutions admit an asymptotic expansion which is independent of the solutions and is uniquely determined by the asymptotic expansion of the body force. The proof makes use of the complexifications of the Gevrey–Sobolev spaces together with those of the Stokes operator and the bilinear form of the Navier–Stokes equations.},

Therefore it is easier to obtain high order accuracy in time and space than the conventional finite element methods and has the good stability. Also, it does not need time step size and space mesh parameter to satisfy the stability conditions. In this paper, we show a detailed analysis including the proof of the existence and uniqueness of the numerical solution and the a priori error estimate . Especially, the analysis method given here can be similarly applied to the more general nonlinear problems .

If the set has no accumulation points, the surface may be taken properly embedded. We also prove a Carleman-type theorem for holomorphic Legendrian curves with interpolation. Namely, a Legendrian curve, defined on a certain type of unbounded closed set in a given open Riemann surface R R , may be approximated in the C 0 C0 -topology by an entire Legendrian curve with prescribed finite-order Taylor polynomials at a closed discrete set of points in R R . Under suitable conditions, the approximating map may be made into a proper embedding.},

The case when the pressure p ( ρ ) = ρ γ p(ρ)=ργ , the viscosity ν ( ρ , χ ) = χ α ν(ρ,χ)=χα , the interface thickness δ ( ρ ) = ρ β δ(ρ)=ρβ and the relaxation time function a ( ρ , χ , χ y ) = χ λ a(ρ,χ,χy)=χλ is considered, where ρ &gt; 0 ρ&amp;gt;0 and χ are the density and the phase field variable, respectively, and γ , α , β , λ ∈ R γ,α,β,λ∈R are parameters. Under some conditions on the parameters γ , α , β , λ γ,α,β,λ and the initial data , it is shown that the Cauchy problem of the one-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn system admits a unique global strong nonvacuum solution, which tends to the constant equilibrium state as time goes to infinity. Moreover, the exponential time decay rate of the phase field variable χ is also obtained.

In this paper, we present a novel modeling framework to investigate the effect of infection age on cholera transmission in a heterogeneous population . Our model is constructed on a system with infection age on complex networks, including both direct and indirect transmission routes and demographics. The basic reproduction number R 0 R0 is derived as the spectral radius of the next generation operator, and it is verified that R 0 R0 is a sharp threshold that determines whether cholera becomes extinct or not. Numerical simulations are performed to confirm the theoretical results. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number to the parameters suggests that the implementation of effective drug treatment for infected individuals and the timely removal of pathogens from contaminated water are beneficial to control the spread of cholera.},

The reaction diffusion equations describe the nutrient and inhibitor concentrations. The internal pressure distribution is described by the elliptic equation. The ODE describes the boundary value condition of the tumor model. After some meticulous mathematical analysis of the model system, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the radially symmetric T-periodic positive solution with u ˜ ≤ min 0 ≤ t ≤ T ⁡ ψ ( t ) u˜≤min0≤t≤T⁡ψ(t) , where u ˜ u˜ is a parameter, denoting a threshold concentration for proliferation.

These surfaces are called horizontal tubes. We show that they foliate E ( κ , τ ) E(κ,τ) minus one or two horizontal geodesics provided that ( 1 − x 0 2 ) κ + 4 τ 2 ≤ 0 (1−x02)κ+4τ2≤0 , where x 0 ≈ 0.833557 x0≈0.833557 . We also describe precisely how horizontal and vertical geodesics get deformed by Daniel&#39;s sister correspondence and conclude that the family of horizontal tubes is preserved by the correspondence. These tubes are topologically tori in S 2 × R S2×R and Berger spheres, in which case we compute their conformal type and analyze numerically their isoperimetric profiles.},

We discuss the decomposition of the non-linear operator to expedite the HAM solution&#39;s convergence to its precise values by using the convergence control parameter . The theoretical convergence analysis and the error estimates are studied. Numerical illustrations show that our proposed scheme improves the accuracy of the non-linear problems discussed in the recently published articles [30] and [31] to an excellent extent and also indicate rapid convergence.},

Additionally, we provide specific expansions for the extreme eigenvalues which are the eigenvalues approaching the extreme points of the limiting set. In contrast to previous related works, we study non-Hermitian Toeplitz matrices having non-canonical distribution and a real limiting set. The considered family does not belong to the so-called simple-loop class, nevertheless we manage to extend the theory to this case. The achieved formulas reveal the fine details of the eigenvalue structure and allow us to directly calculate high accuracy eigenvalues, even for matrices of relatively small size.},

In this paper, we formulate a continuous setting and study from a numerical perspective the inverse problem of identifying an obstruction contained in a 2D duct where a Stokes flow hits the boundary (subject to Dirichlet and Navier-slip boundary conditions), generating an acoustic wave. To be precise, using acoustic wave measurements at certain points on the exterior of the duct, we can identify the location, extent, and height of the obstruction. Thus, our framework offers an external approach to solving this inverse-obstacle problem. Synthetic examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed numerical formulation.},

Through the usage of the new introduced class, it propels the work forward with focus on the power of the SUS-t map. Hence this paper establishes that any power of SUS-t map also has historical behaviour.

Furthermore, we obtain an existence result for best approximations in random normed modules: let E be a random normed module, T : E → E T:E→E a random nonexpansive mapping with a fixed point u and C a closed, σ –stable and T –invariant subset of E such that T ( C ) ‾ T(C)‾ is random sequentially compact, then the set of best approximations of u in C is nonempty, which generalizes the classical result of Smoluk. In addition, we also get an existence result for invariant approximations in random normed modules. A significant distinction between the proofs of our results in random normed modules and the corresponding classical results in normed spaces is that the σ –stability of both the sets and mappings involved in the random setting plays a prominent part in the proofs of the main results of this paper.},

In particular, we use the operator introduced by Scarpi in the seventies [23] and later reformulated in the regularized Caputo sense in [5] , inside the framework of the so-called general fractional calculus. The obtained model extends the well-known time-fractional Poisson process of fixed order α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) α∈(0,1) and tries to overcome its limitation consisting in the constancy of the derivative order (and therefore of the memory degree of the inter-arrival times) with respect to time. The variable order renewal process is proved to fall outside the usual subordinated representation, since it can not be simply defined as a Poisson process with random time (as happens in the standard fractional case). Finally a related continuous-time random walk model is analyzed and its limiting behavior established.},

We present the Abadie constraint qualification (abbreviated as, (ACQ)) and a modified version of (ACQ), namely, (NMSIPVC)-tailored Abadie constraint qualification (abbreviated as, (NMSIPVC-ACQ)), for (NMSIPVC). The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (abbreviated as, KKT) type necessary criteria of optimality for (NMSIPVC) are derived by employing (ACQ) and (NMSIPVC-ACQ). Moreover, sufficient criteria of optimality for (NMSIPVC) are derived under generalized geodesic convexity hypotheses and certain mild restrictions on the index sets. Further, we formulate Wolfe type and Mond-Weir type dual models related to (NMSIPVC) and derive several duality results that relate (NMSIPVC) and the corresponding dual models. Non-trivial numerical examples are incorporated to demonstrate the validity of the results established in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is for the first time that constraint qualifications, optimality conditions, and duality results have been investigated for (NMSIPVC) in the setting of Hadamard manifolds.},

  abstract     = {The theory of greedy-like bases started in 1999 when S.V. Konyagin and V.N. Temlyakov introduced in [12] the famous Thresholding Greedy Algorithm . Since this year, different greedy-like bases appeared in the literature, as for instance: quasi-greedy, almost-greedy and greedy bases. The purpose of this paper is to provide a new characterization of 1-greedy bases in terms of the best approximation error of order 1 where we will use the so-called Property (Q ⁎ ) with constant 1 ( [5] ) to achieve this. Moreover, different connections between some well known notions as unconditionality and symmetry for largest coefficients are studied in our context.},

In 1964, Erdős asked whether there exists a non-monomial function so that this quantity is unbounded? tends to infinity? In 1968 Herzog and Piranian constructed an entire map for which it is unbounded. Nevertheless, it is still unknown today whether it is possible that it tends to infinity or not. In this paper, we construct a transcendental entire function that is arbitrarily close to satisfying this property, thereby giving the strongest evidence supporting a positive answer to this question.},

Extensions of Loewner chains of order p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] p∈[1,∞] , i.e., non-normalized Loewner chains that satisfy a locally uniform local L p Lp -continuity condition on their real parameter, using these operators have previously been considered by the author, but, unlike in the case of standard parametric representation, mappings with generalized parametric representation may not be as nicely compatible with Loewner chains. We will consider the ramifications of this. As part of our work, we will see that A -normalized Loewner chains and evolution families will have order p when ‖ A ( ⋅ ) ‖ ‖A(⋅)‖ is locally L p Lp . In addition, we will completely characterize generalized parametric representation in the open unit disk . This characterization involves families of bounded univalent functions and allows us to show that the modified Roper–Suffridge extension operators extend families of univalent functions bounded by some M &gt; 1 M&amp;gt;1 to biholomorphic mappings bounded by M under certain conditions as a consequence of our main extension results.},

Work of Hoshiro and Morimoto in late 80s characterized a necessity of a super-logarithmic gain of derivatives for hypoellipticity of a sum of a degenerate operator and some non-degenerate operators like Laplacian. The operators we consider are similar, but more general. We examine operators of the form L 1 ( x ) + g ( x ) L 2 ( y ) L1(x)+g(x)L2(y) , where L 1 ( x ) L1(x) is one-dimensional and g ( x ) g(x) may itself vanish. The argument of the paper is based on spectral projections , analysis of a spectral differential equation, and interpolation between standard and operator-adapted derivatives. Unlike prior results in the literature, our methods do not require explicit analytic construction in the non-degenerate direction. In fact, our result allows non-analytic and even non-smooth coefficients for the non-degenerate part.},

  abstract     = {Iterated Tikhonov regularization methods are prevalent regularization methods that can make the solution of ill-posed problems less sensitive to noise. As the iteration number grows, their solution gradually converges to the optimum approximation of the desired solution but then changes to the worse, causing a semiconvergence. This difficulty can be reduced by a reliable early termination rule or a strategy for choosing the appropriate regularization parameter at each iteration. Different from the existing methods, this paper describes a novel iterative Tikhonov regularization based on introducing a non-decreasing sequence of relaxation parameters into the stationary iterated Tikhonov regularization, providing a fast and roughly stable convergence. After investigating theoretically the convergence rate of the novel iterative Tikhonov regularization, we propose a series of numerical experiments for the evaluation of its accuracy and finally describe a real-world application in the field of 3-dimensional image restoration problems to verify its efficiency.},

We consider certain invariant subspaces of A A in the Haagerup noncommutative L p Lp space L p ( M ) Lp(M) ( 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ ). Suppose that φ is a faithful normal state on M M with φ ∘ Φ = φ φ∘Φ=φ and { σ t φ : t ∈ R } {σtφ:t∈R} is the modular automorphism group of M M associated with φ , we give a Beurling type representation for those right invariant subspaces of A A in L p ( M ) Lp(M) which are also invariant under { σ t φ : t ∈ R } {σtφ:t∈R} . Furthermore, we give an algebraic characterization for a subdiagonal algebra to be type 1 and also give a type decomposition for a central projection in M M associated with the center of D D .},

The orthonormal system can be of the type ϕ m ( x ) = ϕ m 1 ( 1 ) ( x 1 ) ⋯ ϕ m d ( d ) ( x d ) ϕm(x)=ϕm1(1)(x1)⋯ϕmd(d)(xd) , where each { ϕ l ( j ) } l ∈ N 0 {ϕl(j)}l∈N0 is an orthonormal system, that can be different for each j , for example, it can be a Vilenkin system, a Walsh system on a real sphere or the trigonometric system on the unit circle. General upper and lower bounds for the entropy numbers are established by using Levy means of norms constructed using the orthonormal system. These results are applied to get upper and lower bounds for entropy numbers of specific multiplier operators, which generate, in particular cases, sets of finitely and infinitely differentiable functions , in the usual sense and in the dyadic sense. It is shown that these estimates have order sharp in various important cases.},

As a byproduct of this approach we show that the associated energy functional has non-zero global minimizers only for small parameters.},

This research is a part of a series of wave equations that was initiated by Charão-Ikehata [6] , Charão-D&#39;Abbicco-Ikehata considered in [5] depending on a parameter θ ∈ ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) θ∈(1/2,1) and Piske-Charão-Ikehata [26] for small parameter θ ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) θ∈(0,1/2) . We derive a leading term as t → ∞ t→∞ of the solution, and by using it, a growth and a decay property of the solution itself can be precisely studied in terms of L 2 L2 -norm. An interesting aspect appears in the case of n = 1 n=1 , roughly speaking, a small θ produces a diffusive property, and a large θ gives a kind of singularity, expressed by growth rates.},

  abstract     = {Ill-posed inverse problems arise in a variety of practically important applications including image restoration, medicine, ecology as well as many other branches of pure and applied sciences. In this paper, we consider an ill-posed inverse problem for a two-dimensional nonlinear time-fractional inverse diffusion model involving the Caputo time-fractional derivative as follows: { D t β u ( x , y , t ) = − a ( x ) ( u x ( x , y , t ) + u y ( x , y , t ) ) + ℓ ( x , y , t , u ( x , y , t ) ) , x &gt; 0 , y &gt; 0 , t &gt; 0 , u ( x , y , 0 ) = 0 , x &gt; 0 , y &gt; 0 , lim x → ∞ ⁡ u ( x , y , t ) = 0 , y &gt; 0 , t &gt; 0 , u ( 1 , y , t ) = u 1 ( y , t ) , y &gt; 0 , t &gt; 0 , {Dtβu(x,y,t)=−a(x)(ux(x,y,t)+uy(x,y,t))+ℓ(x,y,t,u(x,y,t)),x&amp;gt;0,y&amp;gt;0,t&amp;gt;0,u(x,y,0)=0,x&amp;gt;0,y&amp;gt;0,limx→∞⁡u(x,y,t)=0,y&amp;gt;0,t&amp;gt;0,u(1,y,t)=u1(y,t),y&amp;gt;0,t&amp;gt;0, where β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) β∈(0,1) is fixed, a is a space-dependent diffusion coefficient , ℓ is a nonlinear function satisfying a Lipschitz condition , and the data u 1 u1 is given approximately. We want to determine u ( x , y , t ) u(x,y,t) for 0 ≤ x &lt; 1 0≤x&amp;lt;1 . There exists a vast literature on regularization results related to the considered problem. We are concerned with regularization results for the nonlinear case . The first regularization results in such a case were studied by Tuan, Hoan and Tatar in [17] . While these results apply to a constant diffusivity coefficient in the one-dimensional setting, the results of Vo and co-worker in [18] , more generally, apply to the case of the space-dependent diffusion coefficient in the two-dimensional setting. In all these papers relatively strong a priori assumptions on the regularity of the exact solution are made. In this work, we weaken such a priori assumptions via two regularization strategies based on the integral equation method. We obtain several explicit error estimates including an error estimate of the Hölder-Logarithmic type for all x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) x∈[0,1) , which can be seen as the improvement and the generalization of error estimates presented by Zheng and Wei in [20] , [21] . Eventually, several numerical examples are presented for the purpose of illustrating the theoretical results.}}},

One feature of this study lies in the conditional mean-field term used in the model. Necessary conditions for both regular and impulse controls are established via convex variational technique, and the verification theorems are obtained under appropriate convexity assumptions as well. A mean-variance investment and consumption example is discussed to test the validity of the theoretical results, and numerical simulations are also carried out to make the results clearer.},

Because the complicated competition between nonlocal Kirchhoff term and sub-cubic nonlinearity , the standard nodal Nehari manifold method does not work.

An interesting finding is that the space dimension and potential have a strong influence on the number of positive or nodal solutions. Moreover, we also give the asymptotic behavior of solutions as λ → + ∞ λ→+∞ and b → 0 + b→0+ . These results improve and generalize the previous results in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Let Ω be a bounded domain of R n + 1 Rn+1 with n ≥ 1 n≥1 . We assume that the boundary Γ of Ω is Lipschitz. Consider the Dirichlet–to–Neumann operator N 0 N0 associated with a system in divergence form of size m with real symmetric and Hölder continuous coefficients. We prove L p ( Γ ) → L q ( Γ ) Lp(Γ)→Lq(Γ) off-diagonal bounds of the form ‖ 1 F e − t N 0 1 E f ‖ q ≲ ( t ∧ 1 ) n q − n p ( 1 + d ( E , F ) t ) − 1 ‖ 1 E f ‖ p ‖1Fe−tN01Ef‖q≲(t∧1)nq−np(1+d(E,F)t)−1‖1Ef‖p for all measurable subsets E and F of Γ. If Γ is C 1 + κ C1+κ for some κ &gt; 0 κ&amp;gt;0 and m = 1 m=1 , we obtain a sharp estimate in the sense that ( 1 + d ( E , F ) t ) − 1 (1+d(E,F)t)−1 can be replaced by ( 1 + d ( E , F ) t ) − ( 1 + n p − n q ) (1+d(E,F)t)−(1+np−nq) . Such bounds are also valid for complex time. For n = 1 n=1 , we apply our off-diagonal bounds to prove that the Dirichlet–to–Neumann operator associated with a system generates an analytic semigroup on L p ( Γ ) Lp(Γ) for all p ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) p∈(1,∞) . In addition, the corresponding evolution problem has L q ( L p ) Lq(Lp) -maximal regularity.},

To reveal the integrable characteristics of the considered equation, such as bilinear BT and Lax pair , the Bell polynomials method is used. By employing this technique, the bilinear representation in the form of classical Hirota operators is derived. Moreover, with the help of bilinear form , the bilinear Bäcklund transformation and the Lax pair of the considered equation are obtained successfully. The three wave method in the form of test function is adopted to generate the analytical solutions of the considered equation. By applying this approach, ten analytical solutions are obtained successfully. For each of the obtained solutions, a 3D graph has been plotted by varying free parametric values. These graphs show the different kinds of wave behaviour, including kink-soliton, anti-kink soliton, periodic wave , dark-soliton, bright-soliton, and some complex kink and periodic-type wave solutions.},

The maximally monotone operator enters the dynamics via its Yosida approximation with an appropriate adjustment of the Yosida regularization parameter, by adopting an approach introduced by Attouch and Peypouquet (2019) [7] and further developed by Attouch and László (2021) [5] . We obtain fast rates of convergence for the velocity and the Yosida regularization term towards zero, while the generated trajectories converge weakly towards a zero of A or, depending on the system parameters, strongly towards the zero of minimum norm of A . Our analysis reveals that the damping coefficient , the Yosida regularization parameter and the Tikhonov parametrization are strongly correlated.},

In this article an additional condition is found. This problem is equivalent to the injectivity of a transform that consist of CRT and the weighted CRT. Also, in this article, a new iterative inversion formula for the transform is presented. This formula allows the reconstruction of an unknown function by local data.

  abstract     = {We develop stochastic optimal control methods for spread financial models defined by the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. To this end, we study the Hamilton - Jacobi - Bellman (HJB) equation using the Feynman - Kac (FK) probability representation. We show an existence and uniqueness theorem for the classical solution of the HJB equation, a quasi-linear partial derivative equation of parabolic type . Then we show a special verification theorem and, as a consequence, construct optimal consumption/investment strategies for power utility functions. Moreover, using fixed point tools we study the numeric approximation for the HJB solution and we establish the convergence rate which, as it turns out in this case, is super geometric, i.e., more rapid than any geometric one. Finally, we illustrate numerically the behavior of the obtained strategies.},

As a consequence of our results we get that there is no wild Lipschitz operator. Furthermore, several examples are presented illustrating our ideas.

This term models a non-instantaneous but a very rapid absorption with q ( x ) q(x) -growth. The minor term depends on a positive integer parameter n and, as n → + ∞ n→+∞ , converges weakly ⋆ to the expression incorporating the Dirac delta function , which, in turn, models an instant absorption at the initial moment. We prove that an infinitesimal initial layer, associated with the Dirac delta function, is formed as n → + ∞ n→+∞ , and that the family of regular weak solutions to the original problem converges to the strong solution of a two-scale microscopic-macroscopic model. This model consists of two equations and the set of initial, boundary, and matching conditions , so that the ‘outer’ macroscopic solution beyond the initial layer is governed by the linear homogeneous pseudoparabolic equation at the macroscopic (‘slow’) timescale, while the initial layer solution is defined at the microscopic level and obeys the semilinear pseudoparabolic equation at the microscopic (‘fast’) timescale. The latter equation inherits the full information about the profile of the original non-instantaneous absorption. In general, the research is devoted to pseudoparabolic equations with measure data depending on an unknown solution.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) were originally devised by Itô to provide a pathwise construction of diffusion processes . A less explored approach to represent them is through Time Change Equations (TCEs) as put forth by Doeblin. TCEs are a generalization of Ordinary Differential Equations driven by random functions. We present a simple example where TCEs have some advantage over SDEs. We represent sticky Lévy processes as the unique solution to a TCE driven by a Lévy process with no negative jumps. The solution is adapted to the time-changed filtration of the Lévy process driving the equation. This is in contrast to the SDE describing sticky Brownian motion, which is known to have no adapted solutions as first proved by Chitashvili. A known consequence of such non-adaptability for SDEs is that certain natural approximations to the solution of the corresponding SDE do not converge in probability , even though they do converge weakly. Instead, we provide strong approximation schemes for the solution of our TCE (by adapting Euler&#39;s method for ODEs), whenever the driving Lévy process is strongly approximated.},

We study Ulam–Hyers stability on the time interval R R of linear differential equations with continuous coefficients, considering solutions with values in X for higher order equations , and solutions with values in X n Xn for first-order systems. Roughly speaking, Ulam–Hyers stability of an equation is its property of having an exact solution close to an approximate solution . For a first-order system x ′ = A x x′=Ax , we obtain that its Ulam–Hyers stability is equivalent to another important property, namely for each continuous and bounded function g : R → X n g:R→Xn there exists a bounded solution of x ′ = A x + g x′=Ax+g . Using this result, theory of Jordan forms of matrices and Floquet theory, we characterize the Ulam–Hyers stability of a system x ′ = A x x′=Ax with periodic coefficients in terms of its characteristic multipliers. Our main result states that the Ulam–Hyers stability of a linear equation with periodic coefficients of order n with unknown x is equivalent to the Ulam–Hyers stability of the corresponding system satisfied by ( x , x ′ , … , x ( n − 1 ) ) (x,x′,…,x(n−1)) .},

  abstract     = {Consider the Stokes equations in the half-space R + n R+n , n ≧ 2 n≧2 . It is shown that the negative of the Stokes operator defined on the homogeneous Besov space B ˙ p , q , σ s ( R + n ) B˙p,q,σs(R+n) generates a bounded strongly continuous semigroup in B ˙ p , q s ( R + n ) B˙p,qs(R+n) provided that 1 &lt; p &lt; ∞ 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ , 1 ≦ q &lt; ∞ 1≦q&amp;lt;∞ , and − 1 + 1 / p &lt; s &lt; 1 / p −1+1/p&amp;lt;s&amp;lt;1/p . As a by-product, the maximal L q Lq -regularity of the Stokes operator is obtained, admitting the limiting case q = 1 q=1 . This will be applied to develop the global well-posedness result for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the maximal L 1 L1 -regularity class provided that the initial data are small in B ˙ p , 1 − 1 + n / p ( R + n ) B˙p,1−1+n/p(R+n) with n − 1 &lt; p &lt; ∞ n−1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ .

The algorithm is based on the Crank-Nicolson Leap-frog (CNLF) scheme and the ensemble timestepping incorporating the artificial compressibility method and the recent scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) idea for developing unconditionally stable schemes for nonlinear flows. The computation of the velocity and pressure is decoupled in the algorithm resulting in smaller linear systems to be solved at each time step. All realizations of the flow corresponding to different model parameters share the same coefficient matrix so that efficient block solvers can be used to reduce the computational cost. The proposed algorithm is efficient in terms of both computer storage and CPU time. We prove the algorithm is long time stable without any timestep conditions. Ample numerical experiments are performed for various flow problems to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm.},

The main difficulty lies in the boundedness of traveling waves caused by nonlocal diffusion operators.

The main result is to compute the Fisher information metric for measuring the instantaneous information gained by a sensor regarding the target. In pursuing this goal, a method for evaluating a class of integrals comprising products of shifted sinc functions and derivatives of such functions is presented. Expressions are also found to allow estimates of the number of terms needed to evaluate the infinite series representation of the Fisher metric to within a given tolerance.

To model the dynamics of the underlying asset process, we employ several jump diffusion models with regime switching. As many exotic financial products exhibit path dependency, Monte Carlo simulation methods have commonly been used for their valuation. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient Fourier-based numerical method that utilizes complex Fourier series expansion to value such products. Through both error analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method is more effective than the Monte Carlo method. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the contract parameters. Our findings have significant implications for the pricing of complex financial products since our proposed method can be readily applied to a variety of derivative products with path dependency.},

If the speeds of propagations are different and the dissipative mechanisms effective only in one or two equations then the solution decays polynomially in general as 1 / t 1/t . The exception is when the frictional dissipative mechanism is effective only over the axial force in which case the rate of decay is 1 / t 4 1/t4 .

The unknown parameter of interest is assumed to be belonging to a closed convex set . The measurement of each node is nonlinearly related to the unknown parameter. The communication among adjacent nodes is corrupted by the additive communication noises. We propose a decentralized projection consensus+innovation algorithm with communication noises to solve the nonlinear estimation problem and develop a novel approach to analyze its convergence. For the case of fixed graph, by introducing an auxiliary matrix and combination of the graph Laplacian and the auxiliary matrix, we prove that the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely if the combined persistence of excitation ( CPE ) condition holds and the measurement function satisfies the Lipschitz continuity and monotonicity conditions. Furthermore, for the case of the time-varying graphs, we establish the jointly combined persistence of excitation ( JCPE ) condition guaranteeing convergence in mean square. Both the CPE and JCPE conditions are proposed for the first time and do not require that the graph is balanced. The JCPE condition holds even when the graph is disconnected at infinitely many time instants. A simulation example is presented to demonstrate our theoretical results.},

The main aim of this paper is to study the evolutions of mature invasive species with competitive ability and determine whether it disrupts the stable ecosystem provided by native species. According to the long-time behaviors under the case of weak-strong competition, strong-weak competition, and weak competition, we obtain respectively the exact asymptotic spreading speed by delay-induced semi-wave problems if the spreading of invasive species occurs. And we demonstrate that, as the moving coefficient goes to infinite, the corresponding Cauchy problem can be viewed as the limiting profile of the model, and the asymptotic spreading speed approaches the minimal speed of the corresponding traveling wavefront solutions. Moreover, under the strong-weak competition situation, the asymptotic spreading speed of invasive species will decrease when the maturation time is longer.},

The elasticity tensor also varies with ε , and it is assumed to be uniformly elliptic but non-uniformly bounded. Namely, we just impose that its norm in L ∞ L∞ is an infinitesimal of 1 / ε 1/ε and its norm in L 1 L1 is bounded. We obtain an homogenized problem corresponding to a linear system in one dimension . It gives an approximation of the solution of the problem in the thin beam which consists in the sum of a Bernouilli-Navier&#39;s deformation plus a torsion term. This limit system provides a general asymptotic model for the behavior of an elastic beam composed by the mixture, at a mesoscopic level, of several materials, and therefore, which does not satisfy any homogeneity and/or isotropy conditions.},

  abstract     = {The Brunn-Minkowski theory in convex geometry concerns, among other things, the volumes, mixed volumes, and surface area measures of convex bodies . We study generalizations of these concepts to Borel measures with density in R n Rn – in particular, the weighted versions of mixed volumes (the so-called mixed measures) when dealing with up to three distinct convex bodies. We then formulate and analyze weighted versions of classical surface area measures, and obtain a new integral formula for the mixed measure of three bodies. As an application, we prove a Bézout-type inequality for rotational invariant log-concave measures, generalizing a result by Artstein-Avidan, Florentin and Ostrover. The results are new and interesting even for the special case of the standard Gaussian measure .},

We consider both necessary and sufficient conditions of the second-order which differ by the strengthening of inequalities in their formulations. The conditions use first and second order approximations (first and second-order tangents) of the set K . The no gap sufficient conditions need additional assumptions in comparison with necessary conditions. We show that these assumptions hold true in the case when the set K is an intersection of a finite number of sets described by smooth inequalities and equalities, like in problems of the mathematical programming . Moreover, we illustrate the new conditions by deducing some mathematical programming results. In this sense the paper is partly a survey. One non-trivial illustrative example in an infinite dimensional space concerns the case when K can not be represented as an intersection described above. The novelty of our approach is due, on one hand, to the arbitrariness of the set K , and on the other hand, to quite straightforward proofs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the diameter two properties (D2Ps), the diametral diameter two properties (diametral D2Ps), and the Daugavet property in Orlicz-Lorentz spaces equipped with the Luxemburg norm. First, we characterize the Radon-Nikodým property of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces in full generality by considering all finite real-valued Orlicz functions. To show this, the fundamental functions of their Köthe dual spaces defined by extended real-valued Orlicz functions are computed. We also show that if an Orlicz function does not satisfy the appropriate Δ 2 Δ2 -condition, the Orlicz-Lorentz space and its order-continuous subspace have the strong diameter two property. Consequently, given that an Orlicz function is an N-function at infinity, the same condition characterizes the diameter two properties of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces as well as the octahedralities of their Köthe dual spaces. The Orlicz-Lorentz function spaces with the Daugavet property and the diametral D2Ps are isometrically isomorphic to L 1 L1 when the weight function is regular. In the process, we observe that every locally uniformly nonsquare point is not a Δ-point. This fact provides another class of real Banach spaces without Δ-points. As another application, it is shown that for Orlicz-Lorentz spaces equipped with the Luxemburg norm defined by an N-function at infinity, their Köthe dual spaces do not have the local diameter two property, and so as other (diametral) diameter two properties and the Daugavet property.},

Moreover, we improve these estimates in the polyhedral normed spaces for an open and dense subset of subspaces of the given dimension. As a consequence, in the polyhedral normed spaces a minimal projection is unique for an open and dense subset of hyperplanes . To prove this, we establish certain new properties of the Chalmers-Metcalf operator. Another consequence is the fact, that for every subspace of a polyhedral normed space, there exists a minimal projection with many norming pairs.},

  abstract     = {A Hankel operator H φ Hφ on the Hardy space H 2 H2 of the unit circle with analytic symbol φ has minimal norm if ‖ H φ ‖ = ‖ φ ‖ 2 ‖Hφ‖=‖φ‖2 and maximal norm if ‖ H φ ‖ = ‖ φ ‖ ∞ ‖Hφ‖=‖φ‖∞ . The Hankel operator H φ Hφ has both minimal and maximal norm if and only if | φ | |φ| is constant almost everywhere on the unit circle or, equivalently, if and only if φ is a constant multiple of an inner function . We show that if H φ Hφ is norm-attaining and has maximal norm, then H φ Hφ has minimal norm. If | φ | |φ| is continuous but not constant, then H φ Hφ has maximal norm if and only if the set at which | φ | = ‖ φ ‖ ∞ |φ|=‖φ‖∞ has nonempty intersection with the spectrum of the inner factor of φ . We obtain further results illustrating that the case of maximal norm is in general related to “irregular” behavior of log ⁡ | φ | log⁡|φ| or the argument of φ near a “maximum point” of | φ | |φ| . The role of certain positive functions coined apical Helson–Szegő weights is discussed in the former context.},

It was proved in [7] that there are no such domains with smooth boundary if n is even, and if n is odd then the only polynomially integrable domains with smooth boundary are ellipsoids. In this article, we modify the notion of polynomial integrability for even n and consider bodies for which the sectional volume function is a polynomial up to a factor which is the square root of a quadratic polynomial , or, equivalently, the Hilbert transform of this function is a polynomial. We prove that ellipsoids in even dimensions are the only convex infinitely smooth bodies satisfying this property.},

This notion is inspired by the quasi-norm attainment of operators introduced and studied in [5] . As a main result, we prove that the set of weak-star quasi norm attaining operators is dense in the space of bounded linear operators regardless of the choice of the Banach spaces, furthermore, that the approximating operator can be chosen with additional properties. This allows us to distinguish the properties of weak-star quasi norm attaining operators from those of quasi norm attaining operators. It is also shown that, under certain conditions, weak-star quasi norm attaining operators share numbers of equivalent properties with other types of norm attaining operators, but that there are also a number of situations in which they behave differently from the others.},

  abstract     = {We investigate time-harmonic electromagnetic wave scattering by an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium. For the case of an orthotropic cylindrical obstacle and fields invariant along the axis of the cylinder, the problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional one. This 2D problem can be written equivalently in terms of two different strongly singular volume integral equations (VIEs), one is vector-valued and the other is scalar-valued. The aim of this study is to analyze the essential spectrum of the integral operators that describe these VIEs in the case where the physical parameters are piecewise valued matrix functions with some bounds on their eigenvalues. For Lipschitz interfaces, we show that the spectrum is contained in some subsets which depend on the spectral properties of the scattering parameters. The results on the spectrum will then be used to derive sufficient conditions which ensure the uniqueness of solutions to the diffraction problem.},

As applications, the authors establish the boundedness of Fourier multipliers on matrix-weighted Triebel–Lizorkin spaces under the generalized Hörmander condition. The main novelty of these results exists in that their proofs need to fully use both the doubling property of matrix weights and the reducing operator associated to matrix weights, which are essentially different from those proofs of the corresponding cases of classical Triebel–Lizorkin spaces that strongly depend on the Fefferman–Stein vector-valued maximal inequality on Lebesgue spaces.},

In the commutative case , building on the work in [9] , one can express well known approximants ( e.g. Hille- and Yosida-approximants) via expectations over certain stochastic processes. Using this, our first result characterises the simultaneous regular unitary dilatability of commuting families of C 0 C0 -semigroups via the dilatability of such approximants as well as via regular polynomial bounds. This extends the results in [13] to the unbounded setting. We secondly consider characterisations of unitary and regular unitary dilations via two distinct functional calculi . Applying these tools to a large class of classical dynamical systems, these two notions of dilation exactly characterise when a system admits unitary approximations under certain distinct notions of weak convergence. This establishes a sharp topological distinction between the two notions of unitary dilations. Our results are applicable to commutative systems as well as non-commutative systems satisfying the canonical commutation relations (CCR) in the Weyl form.},

The system is influenced by several competing forces, including boundary and interior source and damping terms. We stress that the power-type source term acting on the wave equation is allowed to have a supercritical exponent, in the sense that its associated Nemytskii operator is not locally Lipschitz from H 1 H1 into L 2 L2 . In this paper, we prove the blow-up results for weak solutions when the source terms are stronger than damping terms, by considering two scenarios of the initial data : (i) the initial total energy is negative; (ii) the initial total energy is positive but small, while the initial quadratic energy is sufficiently large.

On the lateral surfaces of the thin cylinders and the boundaries of the nodes we account for solution-dependent inhomogeneous Robin boundary conditions which render the associated initial-boundary problem to be nonlinear. The strength of the inhomogeneity is controlled by an intensity factor of order O ( ε α ) O(εα) , α ∈ R α∈R . The asymptotic behavior of the solution is studied as ε → 0 ε→0 , i.e., when the diffusion coefficients are eliminated and the thin three-dimensional network is shrunk into a graph. Three qualitatively different cases are discovered in the asymptotic behavior of the solution depending on the value of the intensity parameter α : α = 1 α=1 , α &gt; 1 α&amp;gt;1 , and α &lt; 1 α&amp;lt;1 . We construct the asymptotic approximation of the solution, which provides us with the hyperbolic limit model for ε → 0 ε→0 for the first two cases, and prove the corresponding uniform pointwise estimates and energy estimates. As the main result, we derive uniform pointwise estimates for the difference between the solutions of the convection-diffusion problem and the zero-order approximation that includes the solution of the corresponding hyperbolic limit problem.},

Then, given an inductive limit of C*-algebras for which each C*-algebra of the inductive limit is equipped with a strongly Leibniz L-seminorm, we provide sufficient conditions for placing a strongly Leibniz L-seminorm on an inductive limit such that the inductive sequence converges to the inductive limit in this new Gromov–Hausdorff propinquity. As an application, we place new strongly Leibniz L-seminorms on AF-algebras using Frobenius–Rieffel norms, for which we have convergence of the Effros–Shen algebras in the Gromov–Hausdorff propinquity with respect to their irrational parameter.},

Sampling discretization results turn out to be very useful in various applications, particularly in sampling recovery. Recent sampling discretization results typically provide existence of good sampling points for discretization. In this paper, we show that independent and identically distributed random points provide good universal discretization with high probability . Furthermore, we demonstrate that a simple greedy algorithm based on those points that are good for universal discretization provides excellent sparse recovery results in the square norm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigated a diffusive predator-prey model with multiple Allee effect, herd behavior. Moreover, we consider the quadratic mortality on predator species . We found that the dynamics of system near the positive equilibria is quite rich. We are more concerned with the spatial dynamics near the positive equilibrium. The necessary conditions for Turing instability occurring are obtained. And the stability and direction of Hopf and steady state bifurcations are explored by using the normal form method. Furthermore, some numerical simulations are presented to support our theoretical analysis. We found that Allee effect does not alter the local stability of the boundary equilibrium and the transcritical bifurcation occurs at the highest intensity of Allee effect. The biomass conversion rate does affect the stability of the system and the occurrence of Turing instability. This indicates that the biomass conversion rate is essentially significant for the predator-prey system, and we can control the biological conversion rate to achieve the coexistence of the predator and prey. Finally, we summarize our findings in the conclusion.},

Denote L a 1 , ∞ ( Ω ) La1,∞(Ω) the space of functions from L 1 , ∞ ( Ω ) L1,∞(Ω) having absolutely continuous quasinorms. This set is essentially smaller than L 1 , ∞ ( Ω ) L1,∞(Ω) but, at the same time, essentially larger than the union of all L 1 , q ( Ω ) L1,q(Ω) , q ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ) q∈[1,∞) . A classical result of late 1980&#39;s states that for p ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) p∈(1,∞) and m ∈ N m∈N , u belongs to the Sobolev space W 0 m , p ( Ω ) W0m,p(Ω) if and only if u / d m ∈ L p ( Ω ) u/dm∈Lp(Ω) and | ∇ m u | ∈ L p ( Ω ) |∇mu|∈Lp(Ω) . During the consequent decades, several authors have spent considerable effort in order to relax the characterizing condition. Recently, it was proved that u ∈ W 0 m , p ( Ω ) u∈W0m,p(Ω) if and only if u / d m ∈ L 1 ( Ω ) u/dm∈L1(Ω) and | ∇ m u | ∈ L p ( Ω ) |∇mu|∈Lp(Ω) . In this paper we show that for N ≥ 1 N≥1 and p ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ) p∈(1,∞) we have u ∈ W 0 1 , p ( Ω ) u∈W01,p(Ω) if and only if u / d ∈ L a 1 , ∞ ( Ω ) u/d∈La1,∞(Ω) and | ∇ u | ∈ L p ( Ω ) |∇u|∈Lp(Ω) . Moreover, we present a counterexample which demonstrates that after relaxing the condition u / d ∈ L a 1 , ∞ ( Ω ) u/d∈La1,∞(Ω) to u / d ∈ L 1 , ∞ ( Ω ) u/d∈L1,∞(Ω) the equivalence no longer holds.},

The same is true for appropriate weak solutions. Moreover, we show examples of time-periodic functions, which do not satisfy the non-resonance condition, such that they are weak, but not classical solutions, and such that they are classical solutions, but not C ∞ C∞ -smooth, neither with respect to t nor with respect to x , even if the PDEs are C ∞ C∞ -smooth with respect to x and u .

The properties of weighted composition operators such as real symmetry, unitariness, complex symmetry, are characterized fully in simple algebraic terms, involving their symbols. As it turns out, a weighted composition operator having a symmetric structure must be bounded.

Several properties equivalent to pointwise convergence in C a r d Card are established and - as by-product of working with conditional distributions (Markov kernels) - alternative simple proofs for the well-known formulas for the level set masses μ C ( L t ) μC(Lt) and the Kendall distribution function F K d FKd as well as a novel geometrical interpretation of the latter are provided. Viewing normalized generators ψ of d -dimensional Archimedean copulas from the perspective of their so-called Williamson measures γ on ( 0 , ∞ ) (0,∞) is then shown to allow not only to derive surprisingly simple expressions for μ C ( L t ) μC(Lt) and F K d FKd in terms of γ and to characterize pointwise convergence in C a r d Card by weak convergence of the Williamson measures but also to prove that regularity/singularity properties of γ directly carry over to the corresponding copula C γ ∈ C a r d Cγ∈Card . These results are finally used to prove the fact that the family of all absolutely continuous and the family of all singular d -dimensional copulas is dense in C a r d Card and to underline that despite of their simple algebraic structure Archimedean copulas may exhibit surprisingly singular behavior in the sense of irregularity of their conditional distribution functions.},
