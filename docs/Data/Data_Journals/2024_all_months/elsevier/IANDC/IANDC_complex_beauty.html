  abstract     = {Reversible circuits have been studied extensively and intensively, and have plenty of applications in various areas, such as digital signal processing, cryptography, and especially quantum computing. In 2003, the lower bound Ω ( 2 n n / log ⁡ n ) for the synthesis of n -wire reversible circuits was proved. Whether this lower bound has a matching upper bound was listed as one of the future challenging open problems in the survey (Saeedi and Markov (2013) [1] ). In this paper we propose an algorithm to implement an arbitrary n -wire reversible circuit with no more than O ( 2 n n / log ⁡ n ) elementary gates, and thus close the open problem.},

  abstract     = {Session types provide guarantees about concurrent behaviour and can be understood through their correspondence with linear logic, with propositions as sessions and proofs as processes. However, strict linearity is limiting since there exist useful communication patterns that rely on non-linear behaviours. For example, shared channels can repeatedly spawn a process with binary communication along a fresh linear channel. Non-linearity can be introduced in a controlled way through the concept of graded modal types , which are a framework encompassing various kinds of coeffect (describing how computations make demands on their context). This paper shows how graded modalities can work alongside session types, enabling various non-linear concurrency behaviours to be re-introduced precisely. The ideas are demonstrated using Granule, a functional language with linear, indexed, and graded modal types. We define a core calculus capturing the requisite features and our new graded primitives, then present an operational model and establish various key properties.},

In this paper we develop a theory of approximation in the style of abstract interpretation, where a system over some concrete domain is abstracted into a system on a suitable abstract domain, ensuring sound and possibly complete over-approximations of the solutions. We also show how up-to techniques, commonly used to simplify coinductive proofs, fit into this framework, interpreted as abstractions. Additionally, we characterise the solution of fixpoint equation systems through parity games, extending prior work limited to continuous lattices. This game-based approach allows for local algorithms that verify system properties, such as determining whether a state satisfies a formula or two states are behaviourally equivalent. We describe a local algorithm, that can be combined with abstraction and up-to techniques to speed up the computation.},

We further use this method to prove that maxflow , a complete problem, is not computable in polylogarithmic time on parallel random access machines ( pram s) working with real numbers. This improves on a result of Mulmuley since the class of machines considered extends the class “ pram s without bit operations”, making more precise the relationship between Mulmuley&#39;s result and similar lower bounds on real pram s.},

Namely, we define Variable P systems in which the rules containing variables need to be instantiated at the start of each computational step with values from some predefined sets of sets of objects. The modelling power of variable P systems is described by simulating some basic arithmetic operations over a (multi)set of positive numbers (addition, multiplication, or a combination of them). The main advantage of using variable P systems consists in the small number of used rules regardless how many numbers are involved in the operation: e.g., the addition requires only 3 rules, while the multiplication only 27 rules.},

Branching program resources and the new measures are compared extensively. The new variants are developed in part in the hope of tackling read- k branching programs for the tree evaluation problem. Other computation problems are studied as well. In particular, a common view of a function studied by Gál and a function studied by Bollig and Wegener leads to the general combinatorics of blocking sets. Technical combinatorial results of independent interest are obtained. New leads towards further progress are discussed. An exponential lower bound for non-deterministic read- k branching programs for the GEN function is also derived, independently from the new measures.},

  abstract     = {Two-player (antagonistic) games on (possibly stochastic) graphs are a prevalent model in theoretical computer science, notably as a framework for reactive synthesis. Optimal strategies may require randomisation when dealing with inherently probabilistic goals, balancing multiple objectives, or in contexts of partial information. There is no unique way to define randomised strategies. For instance, one can use so-called mixed strategies or behavioural ones. In the most general setting, these two classes do not share the same expressiveness. A seminal result in game theory — Kuhn&#39;s theorem — asserts their equivalence in games of perfect recall. This result crucially relies on the possibility for strategies to use infinite memory , i.e., unlimited knowledge of all past observations. However, computer systems are finite in practice. Hence it is pertinent to restrict our attention to finite-memory strategies, defined as automata with outputs. Randomisation can be implemented in these in different ways: the initialisation , outputs or transitions can be randomised or deterministic respectively. Depending on which aspects are randomised, the expressiveness of the corresponding class of finite-memory strategies differs. In this work, we study two-player concurrent stochastic games and provide a complete taxonomy of the classes of finite-memory strategies obtained by varying which of the three aforementioned components are randomised. Our taxonomy holds in games of perfect and imperfect information with perfect recall, and in games with more than two players. We also provide an adapted taxonomy for games with imperfect recall.},

We discuss the quality, i.e., the informative content, of the derived AFDs by considering their entropy and information gain.

Abstracting from the wealth of such instances, we show in this paper that equivalences w.r.t. any self-complementarity logic admitting a characterisation as homomorphism indistinguishability relation can be characterised by homomorphism indistinguishability over a minor-closed graph class. Self-complementarity is a mild property satisfied by most well-studied logics. Furthermore, we classify all graph classes which are in a sense finite and satisfy the maximality condition of being homomorphism distinguishing closed , i.e. adding any graph to the class strictly refines its homomorphism indistinguishability relation. Thereby, we answer various questions raised by Roberson (2022) on properties of the homomorphism distinguishing closure.},

We show that the resulting games are determined and, in particular, admit optimal memoryless deterministic strategies. This contrasts risk measures that previously have been considered in the special case of Markov decision processes and that require randomization and/or memory.

  abstract     = {Detecting causality or the “happens before” relation between events in a distributed system is a fundamental building block for distributed applications. It was recently proved that this problem cannot be solved in an asynchronous distributed system in the presence of Byzantine processes, irrespective of whether the communication mechanism is via unicasts, multicasts, or broadcasts. In light of this impossibility result, we turn attention to synchronous systems and examine the possibility of solving the causality detection problem in such systems. In this paper, we prove that causality detection between events can be solved in the presence of Byzantine processes in a synchronous distributed system. We prove the result by providing two algorithms. The first algorithm uses the Replicated State Machine (RSM) approach and vector clocks. The second algorithm is round-based and uses matrix clocks. The RSM-based algorithm can also run deterministically in partially synchronous systems.},

Due to their strong generalization capability, neural networks are suitable for this problem, but their intrinsic black-box nature often limits their applicability. Temporal decision trees are a relevant alternative to neural networks for the same task regarding classification performances while attaining higher levels of transparency and interpretability. In this work, we approach the problem of hybridizing these two techniques, and present three independent, natural hybridization solutions to study if, and in what measure, both the ability of neural networks to capture complex temporal patterns and the transparency and flexibility of temporal decision trees can be leveraged. To this end, we provide initial experimental results for several tasks in a binary classification setting, showing that our proposed neural-symbolic hybridization schemata may be a step towards accurate and interpretable models.},

Understanding the potential information transfer between nodes in such networks involves calculating the maximal graph diameter. The integral circulant graph ICG n ( D ) ICGn(D) has vertex set Z n = { 0 , 1 , 2 , … , n − 1 } Zn={0,1,2,…,n−1} , with vertices a and b adjacent if gcd ⁡ ( a − b , n ) ∈ D gcd⁡(a−b,n)∈D , where D ⊆ { d : d | n , 1 ≤ d &lt; n } D⊆{d:d|n,1≤d&amp;lt;n} . Building on the upper bound 2 | D | + 1 2|D|+1 for the diameter provided by Saxena, Severini, and Shparlinski, we prove that the maximal diameter of ICG n ( D ) ICGn(D) for a given order n with prime factorization p 1 α 1 ⋯ p k α k p1α1⋯pkαk is r ( n ) r(n) or r ( n ) + 1 r(n)+1 , where r ( n ) = k + | { i | α i &gt; 1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ k } | r(n)=k+|{i|αi&amp;gt;1,1≤i≤k}| .

We propose a novel Zeroing function (ZF) based on the first Penrose equation A X A = A AXA=A . The initiated ZNN design for computing the time-varying inverse and the pseudoinverse is defined and investigated. An explicit form of the defined model is also proposed. The convergence properties of the proposed explicit dynamics are investigated in both the time-invariant and time-varying case.

By encoding DFA computations via comma-free codes, we prove that regular languages are the output of quasi-length-preserving local functions, defined on alphabets with one more letter than in the language. A binary alphabet suffices if the local function is allowed to shorten input length, or if the regular language has polynomial density. If local relations are considered instead of functions, a binary input alphabet suffices for any regular language. A new simpler proof is then obtained of the extension of Medvedev&#39;s theorem stating that any regular language is the homomorphic image of an slt language over an alphabet of double size.},

In this paper, compact representations of detecting arrays using vectors over the finite field are developed. Covering strong separating hash families exploit linear independence over the field, while the weaker elongated covering perfect hash families permit some linear dependence. For both, probabilistic analyses are employed to establish effective upper bounds on the number of tests needed in a detecting array for a wide variety of parameters.

This study investigates an analogous concept in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning, called prime scenario. Specifically, we define a prime scenario of a qualitative constraint network (QCN) as a minimal set of decisions that can uniquely determine solutions of this QCN. We propose in this paper a collection of algorithms designed to address various problems related to prime scenarios, and also show how certain results can be useful for measuring the robustness of a QCN. In addition, we study the relationship between our notions in this paper and the notion of prime sub-QCN in the literature, and establish theoretical results in the process. Further, we devise a language based on the notion of prime scenario for knowledge compilation. Finally, an experimental evaluation is performed with instances of Allen&#39;s Interval Algebra and RCC8 to assess the efficiency of our algorithms and, hence, also the difficulty of the newly introduced problems here.},

  abstract     = {We study the reachability problems of a quantum finite automaton. More precisely, we introduce quantum temporal logic (QTL) that specifies the time-dependent behavior of quantum finite automaton by presenting the time dependence of events temporal operators ◊ (eventually) and □ (always) and employing the projections on subspaces as atomic propositions. The satisfiability of QTL formulae corresponds to various reachability problems of matrix semigroups. We prove that the satisfiability problems for □ ∨ i m p i □∨impi , ◊ □ ∨ i m p i ◊□∨impi and □ ◊ ∨ i m p i □◊∨impi with atomic propositions p i pi are decidable. This result solves the open problem of Li and Ying 2014. Notably, the decidability of □ ◊ p □◊p can be interpreted as a generalization of Skolem-Mahler-Lech&#39;s celebrated theorem based on additive number theory. This paper&#39;s last part shows how the quantum finite automaton can model the general concurrent quantum programs, which may involve an arbitrary classical control flow.},

  abstract     = {Neuro-symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence, which combine neural networks with classical symbolic techniques, are growing in prominence, necessitating formal approaches to reason about their correctness. We propose a novel modelling formalism called neuro-symbolic concurrent stochastic games (NS-CSGs), which comprise two probabilistic finite-state agents interacting in a shared continuous-state environment. Each agent observes the environment using a neural perception mechanism, which converts inputs such as images into symbolic percepts, and makes decisions symbolically. We focus on the class of NS-CSGs with Borel state spaces and prove the existence and measurability of the value function for zero-sum discounted cumulative rewards under piecewise-constant restrictions. To compute values and synthesise strategies, we first introduce a Borel measurable piecewise-constant (B-PWC) representation of value functions and propose a B-PWC value iteration. Second, we introduce two novel representations for the value functions and strategies, and propose a minimax-action-free policy iteration based on alternating player choices.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid Systems are systems having a mixed discrete and continuous behaviour that cannot be characterised faithfully using either discrete or continuous models only. Due to the intrinsic complexity of hybrid systems, it is highly desirable to describe them compositionally, where large systems are seen as the composition of several simpler subparts that are studied independently. Furthermore, since several problems, including reachability, are undecidable for hybrid systems, the availability of approximate decision procedures is another important feature. In this paper, we propose a purely behavioural formalism for hybrid systems that is compositional and supports approximate decision procedures. The formalism is abstract and sufficiently general to subsume or be a semantic framework for most of the concrete formalisms or languages proposed in the literature.},

It was experimentally found that there exist autapses from neurons onto themselves in the brain, i.e., a neuron can transmit a signal back to itself through an autapse. In this work, inspired by the characteristics of autapses, a new variant of the SNP system, termed SNP systems with mute rules (SNPMR systems), is considered. Specifically, mute rules have no communication functioning, namely the execution of a mute rule only applies the change on the number of spikes within its residing neuron, rather than affecting other postsynaptic neurons. The computational power of SNPMR systems is examined by demonstrating that SNPMR systems achieve Turing universality with four or ten neurons. In addition, a simulator for SNPMR systems is developed to provide an experimental validation of the systems designed theoretically.},

In this paper, we present a method to find the small solutions of the former modular cubic equations. Our method is based on Coppersmith&#39;s technique and enables one to find the solutions ( x 0 , y 0 ) (x0,y0) when | x 0 | 3 | y 0 | 2 |x0|3|y0|2 is smaller than the modulus.},

The exact query complexity, denoted as Q E ( f ) QE(f) , is defined to be the minimum number of queries required to determine the function value. An important problem in this area is to give a succinct characterization of a k -query exact quantum algorithm for an arbitrary k . To date, the cases k = 1 k=1 and k = n k=n are already solved and the case k = 2 k=2 remains unknown. Our result is that there are 27 nondegenerate Boolean functions up to isomorphism with Q E ( f ) QE(f) being two, among which only two functions can be solved by a 2-query classical algorithm. The input bit number n of the above 27 functions ranges from 2 to 6, where the case n ≤ 3 n≤3 is already proved and the case n = 4 n=4 is already found by numerically solving semidefinite programming, which is a complete characterization of quantum query algorithm. Assuming the correctness of the numerical result for n = 4 n=4 , we prove that there are four functions in the case n = 5 n=5 , one in the case n = 6 n=6 and none in the case n ≥ 7 n≥7 . We further show that the 25 functions for which quantum algorithm has advantage over classical algorithm contain essentially only four different structures.},

Traditional session types include only one-directional input (external) and output (internal) guarded choices. This prevents the session-processes to explore the full expressive power of the π -calculus where mixed choice was proved more expressive. Recently Casal, Mordido, and Vasconcelos proposed binary session types with mixed choices ( CMV + CMV+ ). Surprisingly, in spite of an inclusion of unrestricted channels with mixed choice, CMV + CMV+ &#39;s mixed choice is rather separate and not mixed. We prove this negative result using two methodologies (using either the leader election problem or a synchronisation pattern as distinguishing feature), showing that there exists no good encoding from the π -calculus into CMV + CMV+ , preserving distribution. We then close their open problem on the encoding from CMV + CMV+ into CMV CMV (without mixed choice), proving its soundness.},

The finite-state relative dimension dim F S Y ( X ) dimFSY(X) of a sequence X relative to Y is the finite-state dimension of X measured using the class of finite-state gamblers with oracle access to Y . We show its mathematical robustness by equivalently characterizing this notion using the relative block entropy rate of X conditioned on Y . We derive inequalities relating the dimension of a sequence to the relative dimension of its subsequences along any arithmetic progression (A. P.). These enable us to obtain a strengthening of Wall&#39;s Theorem on the normality of A. P. subsequences of a normal sequence, in terms of relative dimension. In contrast to the original theorem, this stronger version has an exact converse yielding a new characterization of normality.

We prove a lower bound on the third-order nonlinearity for functions tr n ( x 15 ) trn(x15) , which is the best third-order nonlinearity lower bound.

However, the general problem on digraphs is seemingly untouched in the literature. We fill the gap with the first k / 2 k/2 -approximation algorithm, based on a novel concept of enlarging walk to minimize the number of singletons . Secondly, for k = 3 k=3 , we define a second novel kind of enlarging walks to greedily reduce the number of 2-paths in the 3-path partition and propose an improved 13/9-approximation algorithm.

Aiming to uncover the essential notions of session-based concurrency, prior work defined minimal session types (MSTs), a formulation of session types without the sequentiality construct, and showed a minimality result : every process typable with standard session types can be transformed into a process typable using MSTs. Such a minimality result was proven for a higher-order session π -calculus, in which values are abstractions (functions from names to processes). In this paper, we study MSTs but now for the session π -calculus, the (first-order) language in which values are names and for which session types have been more widely studied. We first show that a new minimality result can be obtained by composing known results. Then, we develop optimizations of this new minimality result and prove also a dynamic correctness guarantee.},

We create a simple type system for the ρ -calculus to show that the encoding is well-typed, and discuss the limitations that must be imposed when working with structured names.

A fundamental result in fractal geometry is Marstrand&#39;s projection theorem , which states that for every analytic set E , for almost every line L , the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of E onto L is maximal. We use Kolmogorov complexity to give two new results on the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of orthogonal projections onto lines. The first shows that the conclusion of Marstrand&#39;s theorem holds whenever the Hausdorff and packing dimensions agree on the set E , even if E is not analytic. Our second result gives a lower bound on the packing dimension of projections of arbitrary sets. Finally, we give a new proof of Marstrand&#39;s theorem using the theory of computing.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade billions of user passwords have been exposed to the dangerous threat of offline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker who has stolen the cryptographic hash of a user&#39;s password can check as many password guesses as s/he likes limited only by the resources that s/he is willing to invest to crack the password. Pepper and key-stretching are two techniques that have been proposed to deter an offline attacker by increasing guessing costs. Pepper ensures that the cost of rejecting an incorrect password guess is higher than the (expected) cost of verifying a correct password guess. This is useful because most of the offline attacker&#39;s guesses will be incorrect. Unfortunately, as we observe the traditional peppering defense seems to be incompatible with modern memory hard key-stretching algorithms such as Argon2 or Scrypt. We introduce an alternative to pepper which we call Cost-Asymmetric Memory Hard Password Authentication which benefits from the same cost-asymmetry as the classical peppering defense i.e., the cost of rejecting an incorrect password guess is larger than the expected cost to authenticate a correct password guess. When configured properly we prove that our mechanism can only reduce the percentage of user passwords that are cracked by a rational offline attacker whose goal is to maximize (expected) profit i.e., the total value of cracked passwords minus the total guessing costs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our mechanism on empirical password datasets against a rational offline attacker. Our empirical analysis shows that our mechanism can reduce the percentage of user passwords that are cracked by a rational attacker by up to 10%.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present new constructions of multi-party homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) based on a new primitive that we call homomorphic encryption with decryption to shares (HEDS). Our first scheme, which we call Scooby Scooby , is based on many popular fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes with a linear decryption property. Scooby Scooby achieves an n -party HSS for general circuits with complexity O ( | F | + log ⁡ n ) O(|F|+log⁡n) , as opposed to O ( n 2 ⋅ | F | ) O(n2⋅|F|) for the prior best construction based on multi-key FHE. Scooby Scooby relies on a trusted setup procedure , and can be based on (ring)-LWE with a super-polynomial modulus-to-noise ratio. In our second construction, Scrappy Scrappy , assuming any generic FHE plus HSS for NC1-circuits, we obtain a HEDS scheme which does not require a super-polynomial modulus. While these schemes all require FHE, in another instantiation , Shaggy Shaggy , we show how it is also possible to obtain multi-party HSS without FHE, instead relying on the DCR assumption to obtain 4-party HSS for constant-degree polynomials.},

Let d 0 , d 1 , … , d N d0,d1,…,dN be equal respectively to the value of some function f ( s ) f(s) and the values of its first N derivatives calculated at a certain complex number a lying not too far from a zero ρ of this function. It is expected that the value of R N ( a , d 0 , d 1 , … , d N ) RN(a,d0,d1,…,dN) is very close to ρ . We demonstrate this phenomenon on several numerical instances with the Riemann zeta function in the role of f ( s ) f(s) . For example, for N = 10 N=10 and a = 0.6 + 14 i a=0.6+14i we have | R 10 ( a , d 0 , d 1 , … , d 10 ) − ρ 1 | &lt; 10 − 18 |R10(a,d0,d1,…,d10)−ρ1|&amp;lt;10−18 where ρ 1 = 0.5 + 14.13 . . . i ρ1=0.5+14.13...i is the first non-trivial zeta zero. Also we define rational functions R N , n ( a , d 0 , d 1 , … , d N ) RN,n(a,d0,d1,…,dN) which (under the same assumptions) have values which are very close to n − ρ n−ρ , that is, to the terms from the Dirichlet series for the zeta function calculated at its zero. In the case when a is between two consecutive zeros, say ρ l ρl and ρ l + 1 ρl+1 , functions R N , n ( a , d 0 , d 1 , … , d N ) RN,n(a,d0,d1,…,dN) approximate neither of n − ρ l n−ρl no n − ρ l + 1 n−ρl+1 ; nevertheless, they allow us to approximate the sum n − ρ l + n − ρ l + 1 n−ρl+n−ρl+1 and the product n − ρ l n − ρ l + 1 n−ρln−ρl+1 and hence to calculate both n − ρ l n−ρl and n − ρ l + 1 n−ρl+1 by solving corresponding quadratic equation .},

It is open to manipulative attacks such as Manipulation where judges (e.g., referees, experts, or jurors) cast their judgments strategically. Previous works have shown that most computational problems corresponding to these manipulative attacks are NP NP -hard. This desired computational barrier, however, often relies on formulas that are either of unbounded size or of complex structure. We revisit the computational complexity for various Manipulation and Bribery problems in premise-based judgment aggregation, now focusing on simple and realistic formulas. We restrict all formulas to be clauses that are monotone, Horn-clauses, or have bounded length. We show that these restrictions make several variants of Manipulation and Bribery , which were in general known to be NP NP -hard, polynomial-time solvable. Moreover, we provide a P vs. NP dichotomy for a large class of clause restrictions (generalizing monotone and Horn clauses).},

The set of variables is partitioned into two parts, with each part controlled by a player. Players take turns to choose valuations for their variables, generating a sequence of valuations. The winning condition is specified by a CLTL formula — the first player wins if the sequence of valuations satisfies the specified formula. We prove that checking whether the first player has a winning strategy in the realizability game for a given CLTL formula is undecidable in general and identify decidable fragments.},

We demonstrate this approach on the recently proposed DLB benchmark. Our finding that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is only O ( n 2 ) O(n2) suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic time . We also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class of unary unbiased algorithms. We therefore shift our attention to algorithms that use the information of more parents to generate new solutions and find that the significance-based compact genetic algorithm can solve the DLB problem in time O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) .},

  abstract     = {Software systems rely on events for logging, coordination, handling unusual situations, and more. Monitoring event streams from systems that provide services can ensure the service complies with policies, regulations, and other business rules. Notably, monitoring to detect violations of rules as early as possible is much desired as, for example, the service may reclaim more resources from erring enactments. The primary goal of this paper is to develop techniques for detecting violations of time constraints as early as possible. We formalize a model for events and a language to specify constraints on event timing and data. We develop algorithms to detect violations of individual rules, then use a chase process to detect violations of acyclic sets of rules. We also present optimization techniques to reduce monitoring overhead. Finally, we implement and evaluate our algorithms through experiments to demonstrate our approach is feasible and beneficial.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the fourth weight of generalized Reed-Muller codes R q ( a ( q − 1 ) + b , m ) Rq(a(q−1)+b,m) have been characterized for 3 ≤ b &lt; q + 4 3 3≤b&amp;lt;q+43 and 0 ≤ a ≤ m − 3 0≤a≤m−3 . In this paper, we study the codewords reaching the fourth weight of generalized Reed-Muller codes. We will determine the fourth weight codewords of generalized Reed-Muller codes of order r = a ( q − 1 ) + b r=a(q−1)+b with 3 ≤ b &lt; q + 4 3 3≤b&amp;lt;q+43 and 0 ≤ a ≤ m − 3 0≤a≤m−3 . Also, we characterize the number of fourth weight codewords of R q ( b , m ) Rq(b,m) for 3 ≤ b &lt; q + 4 3 3≤b&amp;lt;q+43 .},
