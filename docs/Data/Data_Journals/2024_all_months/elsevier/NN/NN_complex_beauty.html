  abstract     = {This study introduces an innovative neural network framework named spectral integrated neural networks (SINNs) to address both forward and inverse dynamic problems in three-dimensional space. In the SINNs, the spectral integration technique is utilized for temporal discretization, followed by the application of a fully connected neural network to solve the resulting partial differential equations in the spatial domain. Furthermore, the polynomial basis functions are employed to expand the unknown function, with the goal of improving the performance of SINNs in tackling inverse problems. The performance of the developed framework is evaluated through several dynamic benchmark examples encompassing linear and nonlinear heat conduction problems, linear and nonlinear wave propagation problems, inverse problem of heat conduction, and long-time heat conduction problem. The numerical results demonstrate that the SINNs can effectively and accurately solve forward and inverse problems involving heat conduction and wave propagation. Additionally, the SINNs provide precise and stable solutions for dynamic problems with extended time durations. Compared to commonly used physics-informed neural networks, the SINNs exhibit superior performance with enhanced convergence speed, computational accuracy, and efficiency.},

Assessing the quality of stereoscopic/3D images (SIQA) is often more complex than that of 2D images due to scene disparities between the left and right views and the intricate process of fusion in binocular vision. To address the problem of quality prediction bias of multi-distortion images, we investigated the visual physiology and the processing of visual information by the primary visual cortex of the human brain and proposed a no-reference stereoscopic image quality evaluation method. The method mainly includes an innovative end-to-end NR-SIQA neural network with a picture patch generation algorithm. The algorithm generates a saliency map by fusing the left and right views and then guides the image cropping in the database based on the saliency map. The proposed models are validated and compared based on publicly available databases. The results show that the model and algorithm together outperform the state-of-the-art NR-SIQA metric in the LIVE 3D database and the WIVC 3D database, and have excellent results in the specific noise metric. The model generalization experiments demonstrate a certain degree of generality of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Amidst advancements in feature extraction techniques, research on multi-view multi-label classifications has attracted widespread interest in recent years. However, real-world scenarios often pose a challenge where the completeness of multiple views and labels cannot be ensured. At present, only a handful of techniques have attempted to address the complex issue of partial multi-view incomplete multi-label classification, and the majority of these approaches overlook the significance of manifold structures between instances. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel partial multi-view incomplete multi-label learning model, termed MSLPP. Differing from existing studies, MSLPP emphasizes retaining the effective inherent structure of data during the feature extraction process, thereby facilitating a richer semantic information extraction. Specifically, MSLPP captures and integrates four types of information: the distance and similarity information in the original feature space, and the distance and similarity information in the extracted feature space. Further, by adopting the graph embedding technique, it simultaneously preserves the intrinsic structure with multi-scale information through a constraint term. Moreover, taking into account the negative impact of the missing views on the model and the possible impact of missing views on the data inherent structure, we further propose a shielding strategy for missing views, which not only eliminates the negative effects of missing views on the model but also more accurately captures the inherent data structure. The experimental results on five widely recognized datasets indicate that the model performs better than many excellent methods.},

We fitted a three-layer neural mass model of a cortical column to intracranial EEG (iEEG) data from a Tetanus Toxin rat model of epilepsy, which also included responses to periodic electrical stimulation. Our results show that some of the connectivity weights between different neural populations correlate significantly with the number of seizures each day, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of neural circuits during epileptogenesis. We also simulated single-pulse electrical stimulation of the neuronal populations to observe their responses after the connectivity weights were optimized to fit background (non-seizure) EEG data. The recovery time, defined as the time from stimulation until the membrane potential returns to baseline, was measured as a representation of the critical slowing down phenomenon observed in nonlinear systems operating near a bifurcation boundary. The results revealed that recovery times in the responses of the computational model fitted to the EEG data were longer during 5 min periods preceding seizures compared to 1 hr before seizures in four out of six rats. Analysis of the iEEG recorded in response to electrical stimulation revealed results similar to the computational model in four out of six rats. This study supports the potential use of this computational model as a model-based biomarker for seizure prediction when direct electrical stimulation to the brain is not feasible.},

  abstract     = {In data analysis and forecasting, particularly for multivariate long-term time series, challenges persist. The Transformer model in deep learning methods has shown significant potential in time series forecasting. The Transformer model’s dot-product attention mechanism, however, due to its quadratic computational complexity, impairs training and forecasting efficiency. In addition, the Transformer architecture has limitations in modeling local features and dealing with multivariate cross-dimensional dependency relationship. In this article, a Multi-Scale Convolution Enhanced Transformer model (MSCformer) is proposed for multivariate long-term time series forecasting. As an alternative to modeling the time series in its entirety, a segmentation strategy is designed to convert the input original series into segmented forms with different lengths, then process time series segments using a new constructed multi-Dependency Aggregation module. This multi-Scale segmentation approach reduces the computational complexity of the attention mechanism part in subsequent models, and for each segment of length corresponds to a specific time scale, it also ensures that each segment retains the semantic information of the data sequence level, thereby comprehensively utilizing the multi-scale information of the data while more accurately capturing the real dependency of the time series. The Multi-Dependence Aggregate module captures both cross-temporal and cross-dimensional dependencies of multivariate long-term time series and compensates for local dependencies within the segments thereby captures local series features comprehensively and addressing the issue of insufficient information utilization. MSCformer synthesizes dependency information extracted from various temporal segments at different scales and reconstructs future series using linear layers. MSCformer exhibits higher forecasting accuracy, outperforming existing methods in multiple domains including energy, transportation, weather, electricity, disease and finance.},

  abstract     = {Video captioning aims at automatically generating descriptive sentences based on the given video, establishing an association between the visual contents and textual languages, has attracted great attention and plays a significant role in many practical applications. Previous researches focus more on the aspect of caption generation, ignoring the alignment of multimodal feature and just simply concatenating them. Besides, video feature extraction is usually done in an off-line manner, which leads to the fact that the extracted feature may not adapted to the subsequent caption generation task. To improve the applicability of extracted features for downstream caption generation and to address the issue of multimodal semantic alignment fusion, we propose an end-to-end center-enhanced video captioning model with multimodal semantic alignment, which integrates feature extraction and caption generation task into a unified framework. In order to enhance the completeness of semantic features, we design a center enhancement strategy where the visual–textual deep joint semantic feature can be captured via incremental clustering, then the cluster centers can serve as the guidance for better caption generation. Moreover, we propose to promote the visual–textual multimodal alignment fusion by learning the visual and textual representation in a shared latent semantic space, so as to alleviate the multimodal misalignment problem. Experimental results on two popular datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that the proposed model could outperform the state-of-the-art methods, obtaining higher-quality caption results.},

  abstract     = {State representations considerably accelerate learning speed and improve data efficiency for deep reinforcement learning (DRL), especially for visual tasks. Task-relevant state representations could focus on features relevant to the task, filter out irrelevant elements, and thus further improve performance. However, task-relevant representations are typically obtained through model-based DRL methods, which involves the challenging task of learning a transition function. Moreover, inaccuracies in the learned transition function can potentially lead to performance degradation and negatively impact the learning of the policy. In this paper, to address the above issue, we propose a novel method of explainable task-relevant state representation (ETrSR) for model-free DRL that is direct, robust, and without any requirement of learning of a transition model. More specifically, the proposed ETrSR first disentangles the features from the states based on the beta variational autoencoder ( β -VAE). Then, a reward prediction model is employed to bootstrap these features to be relevant to the task, and the explainable states can be obtained by decoding the task-related features. Finally, we validate our proposed method on the CarRacing environment and various tasks in the DeepMind control suite (DMC), which demonstrates the explainability for better understanding of the decision-making process and the outstanding performance of the proposed method even in environments with strong distractions.},

In this paper, we introduce a residual back projection technique (RBP) that improves the performance of deep image prior framework in iterative CT reconstruction, especially when the reconstruction problem is highly ill-posed. The RBP-DIP framework uses an untrained U-net in conjunction with a novel residual back projection connection to minimize the objective function while improving reconstruction accuracy. In each iteration, the weights of the untrained U-net are optimized, and the output of the U-net in the current iteration is used to update the input of the U-net in the next iteration through the proposed RBP connection. The introduction of the RBP connection strengthens the regularization effects of the DIP framework in the context of iterative CT reconstruction leading to improvements in accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the RBP-DIP framework offers improvements over other state-of-the-art conventional IR methods, as well as pre-trained and untrained models with similar network structures under multiple conditions. These improvements are particularly significant in the few-view and limited-angle CT reconstructions, where the corresponding inverse problems are highly ill-posed and the training data is limited. Furthermore, RBP-DIP has the potential for further improvement. Most existing IR algorithms, pre-trained models, and enhancements applicable to the original DIP algorithm can also be integrated into the RBP-DIP framework.},

  abstract     = {The goal of Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) is to transfer a neural network from a source domain (joint source distribution) to a distinct target domain (joint target distribution), where the source label space subsumes the target label space. To address the PDA problem, existing works have proposed to learn the marginal source weights to match the weighted marginal source distribution to the marginal target distribution. However, this is sub-optimal, since the neural network’s target performance is concerned with the joint distribution disparity, not the marginal distribution disparity. In this paper, we propose a Joint Weight Optimization (JWO) approach that optimizes the joint source weights to match the weighted joint source distribution to the joint target distribution in the neural network’s feature space. To measure the joint distribution disparity, we exploit two statistical distances: the distribution-difference-based L 2 -distance and the distribution-ratio-based χ 2 -divergence. Since these two distances are unknown in practice, we propose a Kernel Statistical Distance Estimation (KSDE) method to estimate them from the weighted source data and the target data. Our KSDE method explicitly expresses the two estimated statistical distances as functions of the joint source weights. Therefore, we can optimize the joint weights to minimize the estimated distance functions and reduce the joint distribution disparity. Finally, we achieve the PDA goal by training the neural network on the weighted source data. Experiments on several popular datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  abstract     = {The world today has made prescriptive analytics that uses data-driven insights to guide future actions. The distribution of data, however, differs depending on the scenario, making it difficult to interpret and comprehend the data efficiently. Different neural network models are used to solve this, taking inspiration from the complex network architecture in the human brain. The activation function is crucial in introducing non-linearity to process data gradients effectively. Although popular activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, Swish, and Tanh have advantages and disadvantages, they may struggle to adapt to diverse data characteristics. A generalized activation function named the Generalized Exponential Parametric Activation Function (GEPAF) is proposed to address this issue. This function consists of three parameters expressed: α , which stands for a differencing factor similar to the mean; σ , which stands for a variance to control distribution spread; and p , which is a power factor that improves flexibility; all these parameters are present in the exponent. When p = 2 , the activation function resembles a Gaussian function. Initially, this paper describes the mathematical derivation and validation of the properties of this function mathematically and graphically. After this, the GEPAF function is practically implemented in real-world supply chain datasets. One dataset features a small sample size but exhibits high variance, while the other shows significant variance with a moderate amount of data. An LSTM network processes the dataset for sales and profit prediction. The suggested function performs better than popular activation functions when a comparative analysis of the activation function is performed, showing at least 30% improvement in regression evaluation metrics and better loss decay characteristics.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the consensus control issue for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) subject to irregular state constraints and actuator faults using an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm. Unlike the regular state constraints considered in previous studies, this paper addresses irregular state constraints that may exhibit asymmetry, time variation, and can emerge or disappear during operation. By developing a system transformation method based on one-to-one state mapping, equivalent unconstrained MASs can be obtained. Subsequently, a finite-time distributed observer is designed to estimate the state information of the leader, and the consensus control problem is transformed into the tracking control problem for each agent to ensure that actuator faults of any agent cannot affect its neighboring agents. Then, a critic-only ADP-based fault tolerant control strategy, which consists of the optimal control policy for nominal system and online fault compensation for time-varying addictive faults, is proposed to achieve optimal tracking control. To enhance the learning efficiency of critic neural networks (NNs), an improved weight learning law utilizing stored historical data is employed, ensuring the convergence of critic NN weights towards ideal values under a finite excitation condition. Finally, a practical example of multiple manipulator systems is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control method.},

  abstract     = {It is extremely challenging to classify steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in scenarios characterized by a huge scarcity of calibration data where only one calibration trial is available for each stimulus target. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach named OS-SSVEP, which combines a dual domain cross-subject fusion network (CSDuDoFN) with the task-related and task-discriminant component analysis (TRCA and TDCA) based on data augmentation. The CSDuDoFN framework is designed to comprehensively transfer information from source subjects, while TRCA and TDCA are employed to exploit the information from the single available calibration trial of the target subject. Specifically, CSDuDoFN uses multi-reference least-squares transformation (MLST) to map data from both the source subjects and the target subject into the domain of sine-cosine templates, thereby reducing cross-subject domain gap and benefiting transfer learning. In addition, CSDuDoFN is fed with both transformed and original data, with an adequate fusion of their features occurring at different network layers. To capitalize on the calibration trial of the target subject, OS-SSVEP utilizes source aliasing matrix estimation (SAME)-based data augmentation to incorporate into the training process of the ensemble TRCA (eTRCA) and TDCA models. Ultimately, the outputs of CSDuDoFN, eTRCA, and TDCA are combined for the SSVEP classification. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is comprehensively evaluated on three publicly available SSVEP datasets, achieving the best performance on two datasets and competitive performance on the third. Further, it is worth noting that our method follows a different technical route from the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method and the two are complementary. The performance is significantly improved when our method is combined with the SOTA method. This study underscores the potential to integrate the SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) into daily life.

  abstract     = {Improperly-exposed images often have unsatisfactory visual characteristics like inadequate illumination, low contrast, and the loss of small structures and details. The mapping relationship from an improperly-exposed condition to a well-exposed one may vary significantly due to the presence of multiple exposure conditions. Consequently, the enhancement methods that do not pay specific attention to this issue tend to yield inconsistent results when applied to the same scene under different exposure conditions. In order to obtain consistent enhancement results for various exposures while restoring rich details, we propose an illumination-aware divide-and-conquer network (IDNet). Specifically, to address the challenge of directly learning a sophisticated nonlinear mapping from an improperly-exposed condition to a well-exposed one, we utilize the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the image into the low-frequency (LF) component, which primarily captures brightness and contrast, and the high-frequency (HF) components that depict fine-scale structures. To mitigate the inconsistency in correction across various exposures, we extract a conditional feature from the input that represents illumination-related global information. This feature is then utilized to modulate the dynamic convolution weights, enabling precise correction of the LF component. Furthermore, as the co-located positions of LF and HF components are highly correlated, we create a mask to distill useful knowledge from the corrected LF component, and integrate it into the HF component to support the restoration of fine-scale details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDNet is superior to several state-of-the-art enhancement methods on two datasets with multiple exposures.},

  abstract     = {Blood coagulation, which involves a group of complex biochemical reactions, is a crucial step in hemostasis to stop bleeding at the injury site of a blood vessel. Coagulation abnormalities, such as hypercoagulation and hypocoagulation, could either cause thrombosis or hemorrhage, resulting in severe clinical consequences. Mathematical models of blood coagulation have been widely used to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology of coagulation disorders, guide the design and testing of new anticoagulants or other therapeutic agents, and promote precision medicine. However, estimating the parameters in these coagulation models has been challenging as not all reaction rate constants and new parameters derived from model assumptions are measurable. Although various conventional methods have been employed for parameter estimation for coagulation models, the existing approaches have several shortcomings. Inspired by the physics-informed neural networks, we propose Coagulo-Net, which synergizes the strengths of deep neural networks with the mechanistic understanding of the blood coagulation processes to enhance the mathematical models of the blood coagulation cascade. We assess the performance of the Coagulo-Net using two existing coagulation models with different extents of complexity. Our simulation results illustrate that Coagulo-Net can efficiently infer the unknown model parameters and dynamics of species based on sparse measurement data and data contaminated with noise. In addition, we show that Coagulo-Net can process a mixture of synthetic and experimental data and refine the predictions of existing mathematical models of coagulation. These results demonstrate the promise of Coagulo-Net in enhancing current coagulation models and aiding the creation of novel models for physiological and pathological research. These results showcase the potential of Coagulo-Net to advance computational modeling in the study of blood coagulation, improving both research methodologies and the development of new therapies for treating patients with coagulation disorders.},

  abstract     = {Estimating intracranial current sources underlying the electromagnetic signals observed from extracranial sensors is a perennial challenge in non-invasive neuroimaging. Established solutions to this inverse problem treat time samples independently without considering the temporal dynamics of event-related brain processes. This paper describes current source estimation from simultaneously recorded magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEEG) using a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns sequential relationships from neural data. The RNN was trained in two phases: (1) pre-training and (2) transfer learning with L1 regularization applied to the source estimation layer. Performance of using scaled labels derived from MEEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electroencephalography (EEG) were compared, as were results from volumetric source space with free dipole orientation and surface source space with fixed dipole orientation. Exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) and mixed-norm L1/L2 (MxNE) source estimation methods were also applied to these data for comparison with the RNN method. The RNN approach outperformed other methods in terms of output signal-to-noise ratio, correlation and mean-squared error metrics evaluated against reference event-related field (ERF) and event-related potential (ERP) waveforms. Using MEEG labels with fixed-orientation surface sources produced the most consistent estimates. To estimate sources of ERF and ERP waveforms, the RNN generates temporal dynamics within its internal computational units, driven by sequential structure in neural data used as training labels. It thus provides a data-driven model of computational transformations from psychophysiological events into corresponding event-related neural signals, which is unique among MEEG source reconstruction solutions.},

This network is implemented by coupling two-dimensional Morris–Lecar neuron models and using a memristor synaptic synapse to mimic synaptic plasticity. The complex bursting activities and dynamical effects are revealed numerically through dynamical analysis. By examining the synchronous behavior, the desynchronization mechanism of the memristor synapse is uncovered. The study demonstrates that synaptic connections lead to the appearance of time-lagged or asynchrony in completely synchronized firing activities. Additionally, the memristive two-neuron network is implemented in hardware based on FPGA, and experimental results confirm the abundant neuronal electrical activities and chaotic dynamical behaviors.

We demonstrated that the electrodiffusive Pinsky–Rinzel (edPR) model developed by NCMD is well-suited for BrainS. All dynamic properties, such as changes in membrane potential and ion concentrations, can be easily explored. In addition, SNNs constructed by NCMD can achieve an accuracy of 86.67% on the test set of the Iris dataset.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advent and abundance of remote sensing data in different modalities, cross-modal retrieval tasks have gained importance in the research community. Cross-modal retrieval belongs to the research paradigm in which the query is of one modality and the retrieved output is of the other modality. In this paper, the remote sensing (RS) data modalities considered are the earth observation optical data (aerial photos) and the corresponding hand-drawn sketches. The main challenge of the cross-modal retrieval research objective for optical remote sensing images and the corresponding sketches is the distribution gap between the shared embedding space of the modalities. Prior attempts to resolve this issue have not yielded satisfactory outcomes regarding accurately retrieving cross-modal sketch-image RS data. The state-of-the-art architectures used conventional convolutional architectures, which focused on local pixel-wise information about the modalities to be retrieved. This limits the interaction between the sketch texture and the corresponding image, making these models susceptible to overfitting datasets with particular scenarios. To circumvent this limitation, we suggest establishing multi-modal correspondence using a novel architecture of the combined self and cross-attention algorithms, SPCA-Net to minimize the modality gap by employing attention mechanisms for the query and other modalities. Efficient cross-modal retrieval is achieved through the suggested attention architecture, which empirically emphasizes the global information of the relevant query modality and bridges the domain gap through a unique pairwise cross-attention network. In addition to the novel architecture, this paper introduces a unique loss function, label-specific supervised contrastive loss , tailored to the intricacies of the task and to enhance the discriminative power of the learned embeddings. Extensive evaluations are conducted on two sketch-image remote sensing datasets, Earth-on-Canvas and RSketch. Under the same experimental conditions, the performance metrics of our proposed model beat the state-of-the-art architectures by significant margins of 16.7%, 18.9%, 33.7%, and 40.9% correspondingly.},

Most of the existing studies have limited performance in repairing the noisy triple that contains more than one incorrect entity or relation, which significantly constrains their implementation in real-world KGs. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end model (BGAT-CCRF) that achieves better noise correction results. Specifically, we construct a b alanced-based g raph at tention model (BGAT) to learn the features of nodes in triples’ neighborhoods and capture the correlation between nodes based on their position and frequency. Additionally, we design a c onstrained c onditional r andom f ield model (CCRF) to select suitable candidates guided by three constraints for correcting one or more noises in the triple. In this way, BGAT-CCRF can select multiple candidates from a smaller domain to repair multiple noises in triples simultaneously, rather than selecting candidates from the whole KG to repair noisy triples as traditional methods do, which can only repair one noise in the triple at a time. The effectiveness of BGAT-CCRF is validated by the KG noise correction experiment. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, BGAT-CCRF improves the fMRR metric by 3.58% on the FB15K dataset. Hence, it has the potential to facilitate the implementation of KGs in the real world.},

  abstract     = {We here analyse the question of developing artificial consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, taking the evolution of the human brain and its relation with consciousness as a reference model or as a benchmark. This kind of analysis reveals several structural and functional features of the human brain that appear to be key for reaching human-like complex conscious experience and that current research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) should take into account in its attempt to develop systems capable of human-like conscious processing. We argue that, even if AI is limited in its ability to emulate human consciousness for both intrinsic (i.e., structural and architectural) and extrinsic (i.e., related to the current stage of scientific and technological knowledge) reasons, taking inspiration from those characteristics of the brain that make human-like conscious processing possible and/or modulate it, is a potentially promising strategy towards developing conscious AI. Also, it cannot be theoretically excluded that AI research can develop partial or potentially alternative forms of consciousness that are qualitatively different from the human form, and that may be either more or less sophisticated depending on the perspectives. Therefore, we recommend neuroscience-inspired caution in talking about artificial consciousness: since the use of the same word “consciousness” for humans and AI becomes ambiguous and potentially misleading, we propose to clearly specify which level and/or type of consciousness AI research aims to develop, as well as what would be common versus differ in AI conscious processing compared to human conscious experience.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents theoretical results on the multistability and fixed-time synchronization of switched neural networks with multiple almost-periodic solutions and state-dependent switching rules. It is shown herein that the number, location, and stability of the almost-periodic solutions of the switched neural networks can be characterized by making use of the state-space partition. Two sets of sufficient conditions are derived to ascertain the existence of 3 n 3n exponentially stable almost-periodic solutions. Subsequently, this paper introduces the novel concept of fixed-time multisynchronization in switched neural networks associated with a range of almost-periodic parameters within multiple stable equilibrium states for the first time. Based on the multistability results, it is demonstrated that there are 3 n 3n synchronization manifolds, wherein n n is the number of neurons. Additionally, an estimation for the settling time required for drive–response switched neural networks to achieve synchronization is provided. It should be noted that this paper considers stable equilibrium points (static multisynchronization), stable almost-periodic orbits (dynamical multisynchronization), and hybrid stable equilibrium states (hybrid multisynchronization) as special cases of multistability (multisynchronization). Two numerical examples are elaborated to substantiate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial attacks dramatically change the output of an otherwise accurate learning system using a seemingly inconsequential modification to a piece of input data. Paradoxically, empirical evidence indicates that even systems which are robust to large random perturbations of the input data remain susceptible to small, easily constructed, adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Here, we show that this may be seen as a fundamental feature of classifiers working with high dimensional input data. We introduce a simple generic and generalisable framework for which key behaviours observed in practical systems arise with high probability—notably the simultaneous susceptibility of the (otherwise accurate) model to easily constructed adversarial attacks, and robustness to random perturbations of the input data. We confirm that the same phenomena are directly observed in practical neural networks trained on standard image classification problems, where even large additive random noise fails to trigger the adversarial instability of the network. A surprising takeaway is that even small margins separating a classifier’s decision surface from training and testing data can hide adversarial susceptibility from being detected using randomly sampled perturbations. Counter-intuitively, using additive noise during training or testing is therefore inefficient for eradicating or detecting adversarial examples, and more demanding adversarial training is required.},

  abstract     = {For current image caption tasks used to encode region features and grid features Transformer-based encoders have become commonplace, because of their multi-head self-attention mechanism, the encoder can better capture the relationship between different regions in the image and contextual information. However, stacking Transformer blocks necessitates quadratic computation through self-attention to visual features, not only resulting in the computation of numerous redundant features but also significantly increasing computational overhead. This paper presents a novel Distilled Cross-Combination Transformer (DCCT) network. Technically, we first introduce a distillation cascade fusion encoder (DCFE), where a probabilistic sparse self-attention layer is used to filter out some redundant and distracting features that affect attention focus, aiming to obtain more refined visual features and enhance encoding efficiency. Next, we develop a parallel cross-fusion attention module (PCFA) that fully exploits the complementarity and correlation between grid and region features to better fuse the encoded dual visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on the MSCOCO dataset demonstrate that our proposed DCCT method achieves outstanding performance, rivaling current state-of-the-art approaches.},

Most existing SSL methods utilize pseudo-labeling to propagate useful supervised information for training unlabeled data. However, these methods ignore learning temporal representations, making it challenging to obtain a well-separable feature space for modeling explicit class boundaries. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised T ime S eries classification framework via B idirectional C onsistency with T emporal-aware ( TS-BCT ), which regularizes the feature space distribution by learning temporal representations through pseudo-label-guided contrastive learning. Specifically, TS-BCT utilizes time-specific augmentation to transform the entire raw time series into two distinct views, avoiding sampling bias. The pseudo-labels for each view, generated through confidence estimation in the feature space, are then employed to propagate class-related information into unlabeled samples. Subsequently, we introduce a temporal-aware contrastive learning module that learns discriminative temporal-invariant representations. Finally, we design a bidirectional consistency strategy by incorporating pseudo-labels from two distinct views into temporal-aware contrastive learning to construct a class-related contrastive pattern. This strategy enables the model to learn well-separated feature spaces, making class boundaries more discriminative. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-BCT compared to baselines.},

  abstract     = {Neural network pruning provides a promising prospect for the deployment of neural networks on embedded or mobile devices with limited resources. Although current structured strategies are unconstrained by specific hardware architecture in the phase of forward inference, the decline in classification accuracy of structured methods is beyond the tolerance at the level of general pruning rate. This inspires us to develop a technique that satisfies high pruning rate with a small decline in accuracy and has the general nature of structured pruning. In this paper, we propose a new pruning method, namely KEP (Kernel Elements Pruning), to compress deep convolutional neural networks by exploring the significance of elements in each kernel plane and removing unimportant elements. In this method, we apply a controllable regularization penalty to constrain unimportant elements by adding a prior knowledge mask and obtain a compact model. In the calculation procedure of forward inference, we introduce a sparse convolution operation which is different from the sliding window to eliminate invalid zero calculations and verify the effectiveness of the operation for further deployment on FPGA. A massive variety of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of KEP on two datasets: CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Specially, with few indexes of non-zero weights introduced, KEP has a significant improvement over the latest structured methods in terms of parameter and float-point operation (FLOPs) reduction, and performs well on large datasets.},

  abstract     = {Approximating nonlinear differential equations using a neural network provides a robust and efficient tool for various scientific computing tasks, including real-time predictions, inverse problems, optimal controls, and surrogate modeling. Previous works have focused on embedding dynamical systems into networks through two approaches: learning a single operator ( i.e ., the mapping from input parameterised functions to solutions) or learning the governing system of equations ( i.e ., the constitutive model relative to the state variables). Both of these approaches yield different representations for the same underlying data or function. Observing that families of differential equations often share key characteristics, we seek one network representation across a wide range of equations. Our multimodality approach, called Pr edicting Multiple O perators and S ymbolic E xpressions (PROSE), is capable of constructing multi-operators and governing equations simultaneously through a novel fusion structure. In particular, PROSE solves differential equations, predicts future states, and generates the underlying equations of motion by incorporating symbolic “words” through a language model. Experiments with 25600 distinct equations show that PROSE benefits from its multimodal nature, resulting in robust generalization ( e.g . noisy observations, equation misspecification, and data imbalance) supported by comparison and ablation studies. PROSE provides a new operator learning framework that incorporates multimodal input/output and language models for solving forward and inverse problems related to differential equations.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have drawn great attention in handling graph-structured data. To characterize the message-passing mechanism of GNNs, recent studies have established a unified framework that models the graph convolution operation as a graph signal denoising problem. While increasing interpretability, this framework often performs poorly on heterophilic graphs and also leads to shallow and fragile GNNs in practice. The key reason is that it encourages feature smoothness, but ignores the high-frequency information of node features. To address this issue, we propose a general framework for GNNs via relaxation of the smoothness regularization. In particular, it employs an information aggregation mechanism to learn the low- and high-frequency components adaptively from data, offering more flexible graph convolution operators compared to the smoothness-promoted framework. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that our framework can capture both low- and high-frequency information of node features, effectively. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets show that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Furthermore, it can be used to handle deep models and adversarial attacks.},

PIML is characterized by the incorporation of physical laws into the training process of machine learning models in lieu of large data when solving PDE problems. Despite the overall success of this collection of methods, it remains incredibly difficult to analyze, benchmark, and generally compare one approach to another. Using Kolmogorov n-widths as a measure of effectiveness of approximating functions, we judiciously apply this metric in the comparison of various multitask PIML architectures. We compute lower accuracy bounds and analyze the model’s learned basis functions on various PDE problems. This is the first objective metric for comparing multitask PIML architectures and helps remove uncertainty in model validation from selective sampling and overfitting. We also identify avenues of improvement for model architectures, such as the choice of activation function, which can drastically affect model generalization to “worst-case” scenarios, which is not observed when reporting task-specific errors. We also incorporate this metric into the optimization process through regularization, which improves the models’ generalizability over the multitask PDE problem.},

  abstract     = {Real-world data is typically distributed on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Accurately extracting spatial distribution features on general manifolds that reflect the intrinsic characteristics of data is crucial for effective feature representation. Therefore, we propose a generalized geodesic basis function neural network (G 2 BFNN) architecture. The generalized geodesic basis functions (G 2 BF) are defined based on generalized geodesic distances. The generalized geodesic distance metric (G 2 DM) is obtained by learning the manifold structure. To implement this architecture, a specific G 2 BFNN, named discriminative local preserving projection-based G 2 BFNN (DLPP-G 2 BFNN) is proposed. DLPP-G 2 BFNN mainly contains two modules, namely the manifold structure learning module (MSLM) and the network mapping module (NMM). In the MSLM module, a supervised adjacency graph matrix is constructed to constrain the learning of the manifold structure. This enables the learned features in the embedding subspace to maintain the manifold structure while enhancing the discriminability. The features and G 2 DM learned in the MSLM are fed into the NMM. Through the G 2 BF in the NMM, the spatial distribution features on manifold are obtained. Finally, the output of the network is obtained through the fully connected layer. Compared with the local response neural network based on Euclidean distance, the proposed network can reveal more essential spatial structure characteristics of the data. Meanwhile, the proposed G 2 BFNN is a generalized network architecture that can be combined with any manifold learning method, showcasing high scalability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DLPP-G 2 BFNN outperforms existing methods by utilizing fewer kernels while achieving higher recognition performance.},

However, current NAS methods generally use hard-coded search spaces, and predefined hierarchical architectures. As a consequence, adapting them to a new problem can be cumbersome, and it is hard to know which of the NAS algorithm or the predefined hierarchical structure impacts performance the most. To improve flexibility, and be less reliant on expert knowledge, this paper proposes a NAS methodology in which the search space is easily customizable, and allows for full network search. NAS is performed with Gaussian Process (GP)-based Bayesian Optimization (BO) in a continuous architecture embedding space. This embedding is built upon a Wasserstein Autoencoder, regularized by both a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) penalization and a Fully Input Convex Neural Network (FICNN) latent predictor, trained to infer the parameter count of architectures. This paper first assesses the embedding’s suitability for optimization by solving 2 computationally inexpensive problems: minimizing the number of parameters, and maximizing a zero-shot accuracy proxy. Then, two variants of complexity-aware NAS are performed on CIFAR-10 and STL-10, based on two different search spaces, providing competitive NN architectures with limited model sizes.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant success of deep learning in object detection tasks, the standard training of deep neural networks requires access to a substantial quantity of annotated images across all classes. Data annotation is an arduous and time-consuming endeavor, particularly when dealing with infrequent objects. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) methods have emerged as a solution to the limitations of classic object detection approaches based on deep learning. FSOD methods demonstrate remarkable performance by achieving robust object detection using a significantly smaller amount of training data. A challenge for FSOD is that instances from novel classes that do not belong to the fixed set of training classes appear in the background and the base model may pick them up as potential objects. These objects behave similarly to label noise because they are classified as one of the training dataset classes, leading to FSOD performance degradation. We develop a semi-supervised algorithm to detect and then utilize these unlabeled novel objects as positive samples during the FSOD training stage to improve FSOD performance. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical ternary classification region proposal network (HTRPN) to localize the potential unlabeled novel objects and assign them new objectness labels to distinguish these objects from the base training dataset classes. Our improved hierarchical sampling strategy for the region proposal network (RPN) also boosts the perception ability of the object detection model for large objects. We test our approach and COCO and PASCAL VOC baselines that are commonly used in FSOD literature. Our experimental results indicate that our method is effective and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSOD methods. Our implementation is provided as a supplement to support reproducibility of the results https://github.com/zshanggu/HTRPN . 1},

  abstract     = {In the real world, the correct recognition of traffic signs plays a crucial role in vehicle autonomous driving and traffic monitoring. The research on its adversarial attack can test the security of vehicle autonomous driving system and provide enlightenment for improving the recognition algorithm. However, with the development of transportation infrastructure, new traffic signs may be introduced. The adversarial attack model for traffic signs needs to adapt to the addition of new types. Based on this, class incremental learning for traffic sign adversarial attacks has become an interesting research field. We propose a class incremental learning method for adversarial attacks on traffic signs. First, this method uses Pinpoint Region Probability Estimation Network (PRPEN) to predict the probability of each pixel being attacked in old samples. It helps to identify the high attack probability regions of the samples. Subsequently, based on the size of high probability pixel concentration area, the replay sample set is constructed. Old samples with smaller concentration areas receive higher priority and are prioritized for incremental learning. The experimental results show that compared with other sample selection methods, our method selects more representative samples and can train PRPEN more effectively to generate probability maps, thereby better generating adversarial attacks on traffic signs.},

  abstract     = {Local feature extraction plays a crucial role in numerous critical visual tasks. However, there remains room for improvement in both descriptors and keypoints, particularly regarding the discriminative power of descriptors and the localization precision of keypoints. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel local feature extraction pipeline named OSDFeat (Object and Spatial Discrimination Feature). OSDFeat employs a decoupling strategy, training descriptor and detection networks independently. Inspired by semantic correspondence, we propose an Object and Spatial Discrimination ResUNet (OSD-ResUNet). OSD-ResUNet captures features from the feature map that differentiate object appearance and spatial context, thus enhancing descriptor performance. To further improve the discriminative capability of descriptors, we propose a Discrimination Information Retained Normalization module (DIRN). DIRN complementarily integrates spatial-wise normalization and channel-wise normalization, yielding descriptors that are more distinguishable and informative. In the detection network, we propose a Cross Saliency Pooling module (CSP). CSP employs a cross-shaped kernel to aggregate long-range context in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. By enhancing the saliency of keypoints, CSP enables the detection network to effectively utilize descriptor information and achieve more precise localization of keypoints. Compared to the previous best local feature extraction methods, OSDFeat achieves Mean Matching Accuracy of 79.4% in local feature matching task, improving by 1.9% and achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, OSDFeat achieves competitive results in Visual Localization and 3D Reconstruction. The results of this study indicate that object and spatial discrimination can improve the accuracy and robustness of local feature, even in challenging environments.

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in the deep clustering research, there remain three critical limitations to most of the existing approaches. First, they often derive the clustering result by associating some distribution-based loss to specific network layers, neglecting the potential benefits of leveraging the contrastive sample-wise relationships. Second, they frequently focus on representation learning at the full-image scale, overlooking the discriminative information latent in partial image regions. Third, although some prior studies perform the learning process at multiple levels, they mostly lack the ability to exploit the interaction between different learning levels. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel deep image clustering approach via Partial Information discrimination and Cross-level Interaction (PICI). Specifically, we utilize a Transformer encoder as the backbone, coupled with two types of augmentations to formulate two parallel views. The augmented samples, integrated with masked patches, are processed through the Transformer encoder to produce the class tokens. Subsequently, three partial information learning modules are jointly enforced, namely, the partial information self-discrimination (PISD) module for masked image reconstruction, the partial information contrastive discrimination (PICD) module for the simultaneous instance- and cluster-level contrastive learning, and the cross-level interaction (CLI) module to ensure the consistency across different learning levels. Through this unified formulation, our PICI approach for the first time, to our knowledge, bridges the gap between the masked image modeling and the deep contrastive clustering, offering a novel pathway for enhanced representation learning and clustering. Experimental results across six image datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PICI approach over the state-of-the-art. In particular, our approach achieves an ACC of 0.772 (0.634) on the RSOD (UC-Merced) dataset, which shows an improvement of 29.7% (24.8%) over the best baseline.

Control synthesis for switched systems, especially integrating safety constraints, is recognized as a significant and challenging topic. This study focuses on devising a learning-based control strategy for switched nonlinear systems operating under arbitrary switching law. It aims to maintain stability and uphold safety constraints despite limited system data. To achieve these goals, we employ the control barrier function method and Lyapunov theory to synthesize a controller that delivers both safety and stability performance. To overcome the difficulties associated with constructing the specific control barrier and Lyapunov function and take advantage of switching characteristics, we create a neural control barrier function and a neural Lyapunov function separately for control policies through a state transition learning approach. These neural barrier and Lyapunov functions facilitate the design of the safe controller. The corresponding control policy is governed by learning from two components: policy loss and forward state estimation. The effectiveness of the developing scheme is verified through simulation examples.},

However, with the emergence of adversarial attacks, most existing palm-vein recognition methods are vulnerable to adversarial image attacks, and to the best of our knowledge, there is still no study specifically focusing on palm-vein image attacks. In this paper, we propose an adversarial palm-vein image attack network that generates highly similar adversarial palm-vein images to the original samples, but with altered palm-identities. Unlike most existing generator-oriented methods that directly learn image features via concatenated convolutional layers, our proposed network first maps palm-vein images into multi-scale high-dimensional shallow representation, and then develops attention-based dual-path feature learning modules to extensively exploit diverse palm-vein-specific features. After that, we design visual-consistency and identity-aware loss functions to specially decouple the visual and identity features to reconstruct the adversarial palm-vein images. By doing this, the visual characteristics of palm-vein images can be largely preserved while the identity information is removed in the adversarial palm-vein images, such that high-aggressive adversarial palm-vein samples can be obtained. Extensive white-box and black-box attack experiments conducted on three widely used databases clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed network.},

Besides, the traditional image augmentation methods that are widely used have limited improvements for forgery detection tasks and require more specialized augmentation methods specifically designed for forgery detection tasks.

To address these issues, we propose a pseudo self-distillation based CycleGAN with enhanced local adversarial interaction for image dehazing, termed as PSD-ELGAN. On the one hand, we leverage the characteristic of CycleGAN to generate pseudo image pairs during training. Knowledge distillation is employed in this unsupervised framework to transfer the informative high-quality features from the self-reconstruction network of real clean images to the dehazing generator of paired pseudo hazy images, which effectively improves its haze-free feature representation ability without increasing network parameters. On the other hand, in the output of dehazing generator, four non-uniform image patches severely affected by residual haze are adaptively selected as input samples. The local discriminator could easily distinguish their hazy style, thereby further compelling the dehazing generator to suppress haze residues in such regions, thus enhancing its dehazing performance.

Existing FUL studies mainly focus on eliminating bad data influences and neglecting scenarios where other factors, such as adversarial attacks and communication constraints, also contribute to negative influences that require mitigation. In this paper, we introduce Local Model Refining (LMR), a FUL method designed to address the negative impacts of bad data as well as other factors on the global model. LMR consists of three components: (i) Identifying and categorizing unreliable local models into two classes based on their influence source: bad data or other factors. (ii) Bad Data Influence Unlearning (BDIU): BDIU is a client-side algorithm that identifies affected layers in unreliable models and employs gradient ascent to mitigate bad data influences. Boosting training is applied when necessary under specific conditions. (iii) Other Influence Unlearning (OIU): OIU is a server-side algorithm that identifies unaffected parameters in the unreliable local model and combines them with corresponding parameters of the previous global model to construct the updated local model. Finally, LMR aggregates updated local models with remaining local models to produce the unlearned global model. Extensive evaluation shows LMR enhances accuracy and accelerates average unlearning speed by 5x compared to comparison methods on MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets.},

  abstract     = {Vision Transformer have achieved impressive performance in image super-resolution. However, they suffer from low inference speed mainly because of the quadratic complexity of multi-head self-attention (MHSA), which is the key to learning long-range dependencies. On the contrary, most CNN-based methods neglect the important effect of global contextual information, resulting in inaccurate and blurring details. If one can make the best of both Transformers and CNNs, it will achieve a better trade-off between image quality and inference speed. Based on this observation, firstly assume that the main factor affecting the performance in the Transformer-based SR models is the general architecture design, not the specific MHSA component. To verify this, some ablation studies are made by replacing MHSA with large kernel convolutions, alongside other essential module replacements. Surprisingly, the derived models achieve competitive performance. Therefore, a general architecture design GlobalSR is extracted by not specifying the core modules including blocks and domain embeddings of Transformer-based SR models. It also contains three practical guidelines for designing a lightweight SR network utilizing image-level global contextual information to reconstruct SR images. Following the guidelines, the blocks and domain embeddings of GlobalSR are instantiated via Deformable Convolution Attention Block (DCAB) and Fast Fourier Convolution Domain Embedding (FCDE), respectively. The instantiation of general architecture, termed GlobalSR-DF, proposes a DCA to extract the global contextual feature by utilizing Deformable Convolution and a Hadamard product as the attention map at the block level. Meanwhile, the FCDE utilizes the Fast Fourier to transform the input spatial feature into frequency space and then extract image-level global information from it by convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GlobalSR is the key part in achieving a superior trade-off between SR quality and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed GlobalSR-DF outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and ViT-based SISR models regarding accuracy-speed trade-offs with sharp and natural details.},

  abstract     = {Humans have the ability to constantly learn new knowledge. However, for artificial intelligence, trying to continuously learn new knowledge usually results in catastrophic forgetting, the existing regularization-based and dynamic structure-based approaches have shown great potential for alleviating. Nevertheless, these approaches have certain limitations. They usually do not fully consider the problem of incompatible feature embeddings. Instead, they tend to focus only on the features of new or previous classes and fail to comprehensively consider the entire model. Therefore, we propose a two-stage learning paradigm to solve feature embedding incompatibility problems. Specifically, we retain the previous model and freeze all its parameters in the first stage while dynamically expanding a new module to alleviate feature embedding incompatibility questions. In the second stage, a fusion knowledge distillation approach is used to compress the redundant feature dimensions. Moreover, we propose weight pruning and consolidation approaches to improve the efficiency of the model. Our experimental results obtained on the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1000 benchmark datasets show that the proposed approaches achieve the best performance among all the compared approaches. For example, on the ImageNet-100 dataset, the maximal accuracy improvement is 5.08%. Code is available at https://github.com/ybyangjing/CIL-FCE .},

  abstract     = {Image clustering aims to divide a set of unlabeled images into multiple clusters. Recently, clustering methods based on contrastive learning have attracted much attention due to their ability to learn discriminative feature representations. Nevertheless, existing clustering algorithms face challenges in capturing global information and preserving semantic continuity. Additionally, these methods often exhibit relatively singular feature distributions, limiting the full potential of contrastive learning in clustering. These problems can have a negative impact on the performance of image clustering. To address the above problems, we propose a deep clustering framework termed E fficient C ontrastive C lustering via Pseudo-Siamese Vision T ransformer and Multi-view Augmentation (ECCT). The core idea is to introduce Vision Transformer (ViT) to provide the global view, and improve it with Hilbert Patch Embedding (HPE) module to construct a new ViT branch. Finally, we fuse the features extracted from the two ViT branches to obtain both global view and semantic coherence. In addition, we employ multi-view random aggressive augmentation to broaden the feature distribution, enabling the model to learn more comprehensive and richer contrastive features. Our results on five datasets demonstrate that ECCT outperforms previous clustering methods. In particular, the ARI metric of ECCT on the STL-10 (ImageNet-Dogs) dataset is 0.852 (0.424), which is 10.3% (4.8%) higher than the best baseline.},

  abstract     = {Single-channel speech enhancement primarily relies on deep learning models to recover clean speech signals from noise-contaminated speech. These models establish a mapping relationship between noisy and clean speech. However, considering the sparse distribution characteristics of speech energy across the entire time–frequency spectrogram, constructing the mapping relationship from noisy to clean speech exhibits significant differences in regions where speech energy is concentrated and non-concentrated. Utilizing one deep model to simultaneously address these two distinct regression tasks increases the complexity of the mapping relationships, consequently restricting the model’s performance. To validate our hypothesis, we propose a dual-region speech enhancement model based on voiceprint region segmentation. Specifically, we first train a voiceprint segmentation model to classify noisy speech into two regions. Subsequently, we establish dedicated speech enhancement models for each region, with the dual-region models concurrently constructing mapping relationships for noise-corrupted speech to clean speech in distinct regions. Finally, by merging the results, the complete restored speech can be obtained. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive speech enhancement performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Ablation study results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing model performance.},

We construct a dual-path architecture based on we proposed feature differentiate modules: One path, guided by the source domain data, utilizes multiple discriminators to confuse and align domain-invariant features. The other path, specifically tailored to the target domain, learns its distinctive characteristics based on pseudo-labeled target data. Subsequently, we implement an interactive enhanced mechanism between these paths to ensure stable learning of features and mitigate interference from pseudo-label noise during the iterative optimization. Additionally, we devise a hierarchical pseudo-label fusion module that consolidates more comprehensive and reliable results. In addition, we analyze the generalization error bound of JFDI, which provides a theoretical basis for the effectiveness of JFDI.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain zero-shot learning (CDZSL) approach specifically designed for HVCB fault diagnosis. This approach incorporates an adaptive weighted fusion strategy that combines vibration and current signals. To bypass the constraints of manual fault semantics, we develop an automatic semantic construction method. Furthermore, a multi-channel residual convolutional neural network is engineered to distill deep, low-level features, ensuring robust cross-domain diagnostic capabilities. Our model is further enhanced with a local subspace embedding technique that effectively aligns semantic features within the embedding space.

The context-aware dual attention module integrates these two levels of encoding, utilizing contextual information to reduce redundancy and enhance detection accuracy.

DLTC utilizes a learnable delay shift, which assigns varying levels of importance to different informational elements. This is complemented by an adjustable threshold that regulates firing times, allowing for earlier or later neuron activation as needed. We have tested DLTC’s effectiveness in various contexts, including vision and auditory classification tasks, where it consistently outperformed traditional weight-only SNNs. The results indicate that DLTC achieves remarkable improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency, marking a step forward in advancing SNNs towards real-world applications.

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy.

Unfortunately, a majority of existing MVML methods are based on the assumption of data completeness, making them useless in practical applications with partially missing views or some uncertain labels. Recently, many approaches have been proposed for incomplete data, but few of them can handle the case of both missing views and labels. Moreover, these few existing works commonly ignore potentially valuable information about unknown labels or do not sufficiently explore latent label information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a label semantic-guided contrastive learning method named LSGC for the dual incomplete multi-view multi-label classification problem. Concretely, LSGC employs deep neural networks to extract high-level features of samples. Inspired by the observation of exploiting label correlations to improve the feature discriminability, we introduce a graph convolutional network to effectively capture label semantics. Furthermore, we introduce a new sample-label contrastive loss to explore the label semantic information and enhance the feature representation learning. For missing labels, we adopt a pseudo-label filling strategy and develop a weighting mechanism to explore the confidently recovered label information. We validate the framework on five standard datasets and the experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.},

It is composed of two newly designed light-weight Transformer blocks. Firstly, the scale-aware gated block is designed to capture multi-scale features through different heads and expand the receptive fields, which facilitates to generate images with fine-grained details. Secondly, we introduce a simple parallel attention block, which integrates the window-based self-attention and gated channel attention in parallel, resulting in simultaneously global–local pixel illumination relationship modeling capability. Besides, we propose an efficient simple feed forward network to filter out less informative features and allow the features to contribute to generating photo-realistic harmonized results passing through.

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, massive Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been accumulated in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and many other healthcare scenarios. The rich and comprehensive information recorded presents an exceptional opportunity for patient outcome predictions. Nevertheless, due to the diversity of data modalities, EHRs exhibit a heterogeneous characteristic, raising a difficulty to organically leverage information from various modalities. It is an urgent need to capture the underlying correlations among different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Multimodal Fusion Network (MFNet) for ICU patient outcome prediction. First, we incorporate multiple modality-specific encoders to learn different modality representations. Notably, a graph guided encoder is designed to capture underlying global relationships among medical codes, and a text encoder with pre-fine-tuning strategy is adopted to extract appropriate text representations. Second, we propose to pairwise merge multimodal representations with a tailored hierarchical fusion mechanism. The experiments conducted on the eICU-CRD dataset validate that MFNet achieves superior performance on mortality prediction and Length of Stay (LoS) prediction compared with various representative and state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, comprehensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of each component of MFNet.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs the sampled-data control (SDC) scheme to delve into the synchronization problem of fuzzy inertial cellular neural networks (FICNNs). Technically, the rate at which the information or activation of cellular neuronal transmission made can be described in a first-order differential model, but the network response concerning the received information may be dependent on time that can be modeled as a second-order (inertial) cellular neural network (ICNN) model. Generally, a fuzzy cellular neural network (FCNN) is a combination of fuzzy logic and a cellular neural network. Fuzzy logic models are composed of input and output templates which are in the form of a sum of product operations that help to evaluate the information transmission on a rule-basis. Hence, this study proposes a user-controlled FICNNs model with the same dynamic properties as FICNN model. In this regard, the synchronization approach is considerably effective in ensuring the dynamical properties of the drive (without control input) and response (with external control input). Theoretically, the synchronization between the drive-response can be ensured by analyzing the error model derived from the drive-response but due to nonlinearities, the Lyapunov stability theory can be utilized to derive sufficient stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that will guarantee the convergence of the error model onto the origin. Distinct from the existing stability conditions, this paper derives the stability conditions by involving the delay information in the form of a quadratic function with lower and upper bounds, which are evaluated through the negative determination lemma (NDL). Besides, numerical simulations that support the validation of proposed theoretical frameworks are discussed. As a direct application, the FICNN model is considered as a cryptosystem in image encryption and decryption algorithm, and the corresponding outcomes are illustrated along with security measures.},

  abstract     = {Radiologists must utilize medical images of multiple modalities for tumor segmentation and diagnosis due to the limitations of medical imaging technology and the diversity of tumor signals. This has led to the development of multimodal learning in medical image segmentation. However, the redundancy among modalities creates challenges for existing subtraction -based joint learning methods, such as misjudging the importance of modalities, ignoring specific modal information, and increasing cognitive load. These thorny issues ultimately decrease segmentation accuracy and increase the risk of overfitting. This paper presents the complementary information mutual learning (CIML) framework, which can mathematically model and address the negative impact of inter-modal redundant information. CIML adopts the idea of addition and removes inter-modal redundant information through inductive bias-driven task decomposition and message passing-based redundancy filtering. CIML first decomposes the multimodal segmentation task into multiple subtasks based on expert prior knowledge, minimizing the information dependence between modalities. Furthermore, CIML introduces a scheme in which each modality can extract information from other modalities additively through message passing. To achieve non-redundancy of extracted information, the redundant filtering is transformed into complementary information learning inspired by the variational information bottleneck. The complementary information learning procedure can be efficiently solved by variational inference and cross-modal spatial attention. Numerical results from the verification task and standard benchmarks indicate that CIML efficiently removes redundant information between modalities, outperforming SOTA methods regarding validation accuracy and segmentation effect. To emphasize, message-passing-based redundancy filtering allows neural network visualization techniques to visualize the knowledge relationship among different modalities, which reflects interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised graph learning techniques have garnered increasing interest among researchers. These methods employ the technique of maximizing mutual information to generate representations of nodes and graphs. We show that these methods are susceptible to backdoor attacks, wherein the adversary can poison a small portion of unlabeled graph data ( e.g ., node features and graph structure) by introducing triggers into the graph. This tampering disrupts the representations and increases the risk to various downstream applications. Previous backdoor attacks in supervised learning primarily operate directly on the label space and may not be suitable for unlabeled graph data. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GRBA, 1 a gradient-based first-order backdoor attack method. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes a pioneering endeavor in investigating backdoor attacks within the domain of unsupervised graph learning. The initiation of this method does not necessitate prior knowledge of downstream tasks, as it directly focuses on representations. Furthermore, it is versatile and can be applied to various downstream tasks, including node classification, node clustering and graph classification. We evaluate GRBA on state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models, and the experimental results substantiate the effectiveness and evasiveness of GRBA in both node-level and graph-level tasks.},

The AIQL-based algorithm has two Q values Q i A QiA and Q i B QiB for each agent i i , where Q i A QiA is used for improving the control policy and Q i B QiB is used for evaluating the value of the control policy. Moreover, the convergence of LNES is given. It is shown that the LNES converges to 0 and the tracking problem is solved. A neural network-based actor-critic framework is used to implement AIQL. The critic network of AIQL is composed of two neural networks, which are used for approximating Q i A QiA and Q i B QiB respectively. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the performance of the developed algorithm.

The classifiers are developed by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, requiring a large dataset for training to build reliable and accurate models. However, collecting large enough EEG datasets is difficult due to intra-/inter-subject variabilities and experimental costs. This leads to the data scarcity problem, which causes overfitting issues to training samples, resulting in reducing generalization performance. To solve the EEG data scarcity problem and improve the performance of the EEG classifiers, we propose a novel EEG data augmentation (DA) framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). An experimental study is implemented with two public EEG datasets, including motor imagery (MI) tasks (BCI competition IV IIa and III IVa), to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EEG DA method for the EEG classifiers. To evaluate the proposed cGAN-based DA method, we tested eight EEG classifiers for the experiment, including traditional MLs and state-of-the-art DLs with three existing EEG DA methods. Experimental results showed that most DA methods with proper DA proportion in the training dataset had higher classification performances than without DA. Moreover, applying the proposed DA method showed superior classification performance improvement than the other DA methods. This shows that the proposed method is a promising EEG DA method for enhancing the performances of the EEG classifiers in MI-based BCIs.},

  abstract     = {Complex-valued convolutional neural networks (CVCNNs) have been demonstrated effectiveness in classifying complex signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, due to the introduction of complex-valued parameters, CVCNNs tend to become redundant with heavy floating-point operations. Model sparsity is emerged as an efficient method of removing the redundancy without much loss of performance. Currently, there are few studies on the sparsity problem of CVCNNs. Therefore, a complex-valued soft-log threshold reweighting (CV-SLTR) algorithm is proposed for the design of sparse CVCNN to reduce the number of weight parameters and simplify the structure of CVCNN. On one hand, considering the difference between complex and real numbers, we redefine and derive the complex-valued log-sum threshold method. On the other hand, by considering the distinctive characteristics of complex-valued convolutional (CConv) layers and complex-valued fully connected (CFC) layers of CVCNNs, the complex-valued soft and log-sum threshold methods are respectively developed to prune the weights of different layers during the forward propagation, and the sparsity thresholds are optimized during the backward propagation by inducing a sparsity budget. Furthermore, different optimizers can be integrated with CV-SLTR. When stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used, the convergence of CV-SLTR is proved if Lipschitzian continuity is satisfied. Experiments on the RadioML 2016.10A and S1SLC-CVDL datasets show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for the sparsity of CVCNNs. It is worth noting that the proposed algorithm has fast sparsity speed while maintaining high classification accuracy. These demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the CV-SLTR algorithm.},

It is typically achieved through fine-tuning pretrained models on target tasks. However, naï ve fine-tuning may not fully leverage knowledge embedded in pretrained models. In this study, we introduce a novel fine-tuning method, called stochastic cross-attention (StochCA), specific to Transformer architectures. This method modifies the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism to selectively utilize knowledge from pretrained models during fine-tuning. Specifically, in each block, instead of self-attention, cross-attention is performed stochastically according to the predefined probability, where keys and values are extracted from the corresponding block of a pretrained model. By doing so, queries and channel-mixing multi-layer perceptron layers of a target model are fine-tuned to target tasks to learn how to effectively exploit rich representations of pretrained models. To verify the effectiveness of StochCA, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmarks in the areas of transfer learning and domain generalization, where the exploitation of pretrained models is critical. Our experimental results show the superiority of StochCA over state-of-the-art approaches in both areas. Furthermore, we demonstrate that StochCA is complementary to existing approaches, i.e., it can be combined with them to further improve performance.

The key contributions of this work are as follows: (1) Seeking to enhance the coherence of multi-view image features, we investigate the relation aware feature perception. With the help of spatial relation vector decomposition, the distribution consistency perception of image features in the horizontal H → H→ and vertical W → W→ directions is realized. (2) In order to establish the metric consistency relationship, the large-scale local information perception strategy is studied to realize the relative trade-off scale selection under the size of mainstream aerial images and satellite images. (3) After obtaining the multi-scale metric features, in order to improve the metric confidence, the feature selection and fusion strategy is proposed. The significance of distinct feature levels in the backbone network is systematically assessed prior to fusion, leading to an enhancement in the representation of pivotal components within the metric features during the fusion process. The experimental results obtained from the University-1652 dataset and the collected real scene data affirm the efficacy of the proposed method in enhancing the reliability of the metric model. The demonstrated effectiveness of this method suggests its applicability to diverse scene matching tasks.},

The FBNs estimated using current methods tend to be homogeneous, indicating that different brain regions exhibit the same type of correlation. This homogeneity limits our ability to accurately encode complex interactions within the brain. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, in the present study, for the first time, we propose the existence of heterogeneous FBNs and introduce a novel FBN estimation model that adaptively assigns heterogeneous connections to different pairs of brain regions, thereby effectively encoding the complex interaction patterns in the brain. Specifically, we first construct multiple types of candidate correlations from different views or based on different methods and then develop an improved orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to select at most one correlation for each brain region pair under the guidance of label information. These adaptively estimated heterogeneous FBNs were then used to distinguish subjects with neurological/mental disorders from healthy controls and identify potential biomarkers related to these disorders. Experimental results on real datasets show that the proposed scheme improves classification performance by 7.07% and 7.58% at the two sites, respectively, compared with the baseline approaches.

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation on time-series data, which is often encountered in the field of industry, like anomaly detection and sensor data forecasting, but received limited attention in academia, is an important but challenging task in real-world scenarios. Most of the existing methods for time-series data use the covariate shift assumption for non-time-series data to extract the domain-invariant representation, but this assumption is hard to meet in practice due to the complex dependence among variables and a small change of the time lags may lead to a huge change of future values. To address this challenge, we leverage the stableness of causal structures among different domains. To further avoid the strong assumptions in causal discovery like linear non-Gaussian assumption, we relax it to mine the stable sparse associative structures instead of discovering the causal structures directly. Besides the domain-invariant structures, we also find that some domain-specific information like the strengths of the structures is important for prediction. Based on the aforementioned intuition, we extend the sparse associative structure alignment model in the conference version to the S parse A ssociative S tructure A lignment model with domain-specific information enhancement ( SASA2 in short), which aligns the invariant unweighted spare associative structures and considers the variant information for time-series unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, we first generate the segment set to exclude the obstacle of offsets. Second, we extract the unweighted sparse associative structures via sparse attention mechanisms. Third, we extract the domain-specific information via an autoregressive module. Finally, we employ a unidirectional alignment restriction to guide the transformation from the source to the target. Moreover, we further provide a generalization analysis to show the theoretical superiority of our method. Compared with existing methods, our method yields state-of-the-art performance, with a 5% relative improvement in three real-world datasets, covering different applications: air quality, in-hospital healthcare, and anomaly detection. Furthermore, visualization results of sparse associative structures illustrate what knowledge can be transferred, boosting the transparency and interpretability of our method.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the exponential synchronization issue of stochastic complex networks with time delays and time-varying multi-links (SCNTM) is discussed via a novel aperiodic intermittent dynamic event-triggered control (AIDE-TC). The AIDE-TC is designed by combining intermittent control with an exponential function and dynamic event-triggered control, aiming to minimize the number of the required triggers. Then, based on the proposed control strategy, the sufficient conditions for exponential synchronization in mean square of SCNTM are obtained by adopting graph theoretic approach and Lyapunov function method. In the meanwhile, it is proven that the Zeno behavior can be excluded under the AIDE-TC, which ensures the feasibility of the control mechanism to realize the synchronization of SCNTM. Finally, we provide a numerical simulation on islanded microgrid systems to validate the effectiveness of main results and the simulation comparison results show that the AIDE-TC can reduce the number of event triggers.},

  abstract     = {Different brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities provide diverse tumor-specific information. Previous works have enhanced brain tumor segmentation performance by integrating multiple MRI modalities. However, multi-modal MRI data are often unavailable in clinical practice. An incomplete modality leads to missing tumor-specific information, which degrades the performance of existing models. Various strategies have been proposed to transfer knowledge from a full modality network (teacher) to an incomplete modality one (student) to address this issue. However, they neglect the fact that brain tumor segmentation is a structural prediction problem that requires voxel semantic relations. In this paper, we propose a Reconstruct Incomplete Relation Network (RIRN) that transfers voxel semantic relational knowledge from the teacher to the student. Specifically, we propose two types of voxel relations to incorporate structural knowledge: Class-relative relations (CRR) and Class-agnostic relations (CAR). The CRR groups voxels into different tumor regions and constructs a relation between them. The CAR builds a global relation between all voxel features, complementing the local inter-region relation. Moreover, we use adversarial learning to align the holistic structural prediction between the teacher and the student. Extensive experimentation on both the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets establishes that our method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new hybrid learning and control method that can tune their parameters based on reinforcement learning. In the new proposed method, nonlinear controllers are considered multi-input multi-output functions and then the functions are replaced with SNNs with reinforcement learning algorithms. Dopamine-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is used for reinforcement learning and manipulating the synaptic weights between the input and output of neuronal groups (for parameter adjustment). Details of the method are presented and some case studies are done on nonlinear controllers such as Fractional Order PID (FOPID) and Feedback Linearization. The structure and the dynamic equations for learning are presented, and the proposed algorithm is tested on robots and results are compared with other works. Moreover, to demonstrate the effectiveness of SNNFOPID, we conducted rigorous testing on a variety of systems including a two-wheel mobile robot, a double inverted pendulum, and a four-link manipulator robot. The results revealed impressively low errors of 0.01 m, 0.03 rad, and 0.03 rad for each system, respectively. The method is tested on another controller named Feedback Linearization, which provides acceptable results. Results show that the new method has better performance in terms of Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and is highly useful in hardware implementation due to its low energy consumption, high speed, and accuracy. The duration necessary for achieving full and stable proficiency in the control of various robotic systems using SNNFOPD, and SNNFL on an Asus Core i5 system within Simulink’s Simscape environment is as follows: – Two-link robot manipulator with SNNFOPID: 19.85656 hours – Two-link robot manipulator with SNNFL: 0.45828 hours – Double inverted pendulum with SNNFOPID: 3.455 hours – Mobile robot with SNNFOPID: 3.71948 hours – Four-link robot manipulator with SNNFOPID: 16.6789 hours.

Most event related potential-based BCI applications make use of decoding models, which requires training. This training process is often time-consuming and inconvenient for new users. In recent years, deep learning models, especially participant-independent models, have garnered significant attention in the domain of ERP classification. However, individual differences in EEG signals hamper model generalization, as the ERP component and other aspects of the EEG signal vary across participants, even when they are exposed to the same stimuli. This paper proposes a novel One-source domain transfer learning method based Attention Domain Adversarial Neural Network (OADANN) to mitigate data distribution discrepancies for cross-participant classification tasks. We train and validate our proposed model on both a publicly available OpenBMI dataset and a Self-collected dataset, employing a leave one participant out cross validation scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OADANN method achieves the highest and most robust classification performance and exhibits significant improvements when compared to baseline methods (CNN, EEGNet, ShallowNet, DeepCovNet) and domain generalization methods (ERM, Mixup, and Groupdro). These findings underscore the efficacy of our proposed method.},

Alternatively, recent studies demonstrate that deep learning has great potential to accelerate and refine metasurface designs. Here, we present XGAN, an extended generative adversarial network (GAN) with a surrogate for high-quality free-form metasurface designs. The proposed surrogate provides a physical constraint to XGAN so that XGAN can accurately generate metasurfaces monolithically from input spectral responses. In comparative experiments involving 20000 free-form metasurface designs, XGAN achieves 0.9734 average accuracy and is 500 times faster than the conventional methodology. This method facilitates the metasurface library building for specific spectral responses and can be extended to various inverse design problems, including optical metamaterials, nanophotonic devices, and drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have demonstrated remarkable performance on various computer vision tasks, thanks to its competence in capturing global visual dependencies through self-attention. However, global self-attention suffers from high computational cost due to quadratic computational overhead, especially for the high-resolution vision tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation). Many recent works have attempted to reduce the cost by applying fine-grained local attention, but these approaches cripple the long-range modeling power of the original self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, these approaches usually have similar receptive fields within each layer, thus limiting the ability of each self-attention layer to capture multi-scale features, resulting in performance degradation when handling images with objects of different scales. To address these issues, we develop the Diagonal-shaped Window (DiagSWin) attention mechanism for modeling attentions in diagonal regions at hybrid scales per attention layer. The key idea of DiagSWin attention is to inject multi-scale receptive field sizes into tokens: before computing the self-attention matrix, each token attends its closest surrounding tokens at fine granularity and the tokens far away at coarse granularity. This mechanism is able to effectively capture multi-scale context information while reducing computational complexity. With DiagSwin attention, we present a new variant of Vision Transformer models, called DiagSWin Transformers, and demonstrate their superiority in extensive experiments across various tasks. Specifically, the DiagSwin Transformer with a large size achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms the SOTA CSWin Transformer on ImageNet with 40% fewer model size and computation cost. When employed as backbones, DiagSWin Transformers achieve significant improvements over the current SOTA modules. In addition, our DiagSWin-Base model yields 51.1 box mAP and 45.8 mask mAP on COCO for object detection and segmentation, and 52.3 mIoU on the ADE20K for semantic segmentation.},

Message passing neural networks, which learn representations through recursively aggregating information from each node and its neighbors, are among the most commonly-used GNNs. However, a wealth of structural information of individual nodes and full graphs is often ignored in such process, which restricts the expressive power of GNNs. Various graph data augmentation methods that enable the message passing with richer structure knowledge have been introduced as one main way to tackle this issue, but they are often focused on individual structure features and difficult to scale up with more structure features. In this work we propose a novel approach, namely co llective s tructure knowledge-augmented g raph n eural n etwork (CoS-GNN), in which a new message passing method is introduced to allow GNNs to harness a diverse set of node- and graph-level structure features, together with original node features/attributes, in augmented graphs. In doing so, our approach largely improves the structural knowledge modeling of GNNs in both node and graph levels, resulting in substantially improved graph representations. This is justified by extensive empirical results where CoS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in various graph-level learning tasks, including graph classification, anomaly detection, and out-of-distribution generalization.},

  abstract     = {Real-world graphs exhibit increasing heterophily, where nodes no longer tend to be connected to nodes with the same label, challenging the homophily assumption of classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and impeding their performance. Intriguingly, from the observation of heterophilous data, we notice that certain high-order information exhibits higher homophily, which motivates us to involve high-order information in node representation learning. However, common practices in GNNs to acquire high-order information mainly through increasing model depth and altering message-passing mechanisms, which, albeit effective to a certain extent, suffer from three shortcomings: (1) over-smoothing due to excessive model depth and propagation times; (2) high-order information is not fully utilized; (3) low computational efficiency. In this regard, we design a similarity-based path sampling strategy to capture smooth paths containing high-order homophily. Then we propose a lightweight model based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), named PathMLP, which can encode messages carried by paths via simple transformation and concatenation operations, and effectively learn node representations in heterophilous graphs through adaptive path aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on 16 out of 20 datasets, underlining its effectiveness and superiority in alleviating the heterophily problem. In addition, our method is immune to over-smoothing and has high computational efficiency. The source code will be available in https://github.com/Graph4Sec-Team/PathMLP .},

The development of learning-based IM methods is still constrained by a number of fundamental hardships, including (1) solving the objective function efficiently, (2) struggling to characterize the diverse underlying diffusion patterns, and (3) adapting the solution to different node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To address the aforementioned issues, we design a novel framework DeepIM for generatively characterizing the latent representation of seed sets, as well as learning the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end way. Subsequently, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints.

However, most GCN-based methods often require complex preliminary operations such as sparsification, which may bring additional computation costs and training difficulties. Additionally, as the number of stacking layers increases in most GCN, over-smoothing problem arises, resulting in ineffective utilization of GCN capabilities. In this paper, we propose an attention-based stackable graph convolutional network that captures consistency across views and combines attention mechanism to exploit the powerful aggregation capability of GCN to effectively mitigate over-smoothing. Specifically, we introduce node self-attention to establish dynamic connections between nodes and generate view-specific representations. To maintain cross-view consistency, a data-driven approach is devised to assign attention weights to views, forming a common representation. Finally, based on residual connectivity, we apply an attention mechanism to the original projection features to generate layer-specific complementarity, which compensates for the information loss during graph convolution. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in multi-view semi-supervised tasks.},

  abstract     = {Learning electronic health records (EHRs) has received emerging attention because of its capability to facilitate accurate medical diagnosis. Since the EHRs contain enriched information specifying complex interactions between entities, modeling EHRs with graphs is shown to be effective in practice. The EHRs, however, present a great degree of heterogeneity, sparsity, and complexity, which hamper the performance of most of the models applied to them. Moreover, existing approaches modeling EHRs often focus on learning the representations for a single task, overlooking the multi-task nature of EHR analysis problems and resulting in limited generalizability across different tasks. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel framework for EHR modeling, namely MulT-EHR ( Mul ti- T ask EHR), which leverages a heterogeneous graph to mine the complex relations and model the heterogeneity in the EHRs. To mitigate the large degree of noise, we introduce a denoising module based on the causal inference framework to adjust for severe confounding effects and reduce noise in the EHR data. Additionally, since our model adopts a single graph neural network for simultaneous multi-task prediction, we design a multi-task learning module to leverage the inter-task knowledge to regularize the training process. Extensive empirical studies on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets validate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art designs in four popular EHR analysis tasks — drug recommendation, and predictions of the length of stay, mortality, and readmission. Thorough ablation studies demonstrate the robustness of our method upon variations to key components and hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {Emotional recognition is highly important in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, due to the individual variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and the challenges in obtaining accurate emotional labels, traditional methods have shown poor performance in cross-subject emotion recognition. In this study, we propose a cross-subject EEG emotion recognition method based on a semi-supervised fine-tuning self-supervised graph attention network (SFT-SGAT). First, we model multi-channel EEG signals by constructing a graph structure that dynamically captures the spatiotemporal topological features of EEG signals. Second, we employ a self-supervised graph attention neural network to facilitate model training, mitigating the impact of signal noise on the model. Finally, a semi-supervised approach is used to fine-tune the model, enhancing its generalization ability in cross-subject classification. By combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, the SFT-SGAT maximizes the utility of limited labeled data in EEG emotion recognition tasks, thereby enhancing the model’s performance. Experiments based on leave-one-subject-out cross-validation demonstrate that SFT-SGAT achieves state-of-the-art cross-subject emotion recognition performance on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets, with accuracies of 92.04% and 82.76%, respectively. Furthermore, experiments conducted on a self-collected dataset comprising ten healthy subjects and eight patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) revealed that the SFT-SGAT attains high classification performance in healthy subjects (maximum accuracy of 95.84%) and was successfully applied to DOC patients, with four patients achieving emotion recognition accuracies exceeding 60%. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SFT-SGAT model in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition and its potential for assessing levels of consciousness in patients with DOC.},

Existing methods exhibit limitations by relying on unrealistic simulations with uniformly dropped labels, overlooking how ambiguous instances and instance-level factors impacts label ambiguity in real-world datasets. To address this deficiency, our paper introduces a realistic partial label setting grounded in instance ambiguity, complemented by Reliable Ambiguity-Aware Instance Weighting (R-AAIW)—a strategy that utilizes importance weighting to adapt dynamically to the inherent ambiguity of multi-label instances. The strategy leverages an ambiguity score to prioritize learning from clearer instances. As proficiency of the model improves, the weights are dynamically modulated to gradually shift focus towards more ambiguous instances. By employing an adaptive re-weighting method that adjusts to the complexity of each instance, our approach not only enhances the model’s capability to detect subtle variations among labels but also ensures comprehensive learning without excluding difficult instances. Extensive experimentation across various benchmarks highlights our approach’s superiority over existing methods, showcasing its ability to provide a more accurate and adaptable framework for multi-label recognition tasks.},

In this work, we examine the interplay between the width p p and the number of transitions between layers L L (corresponding to a depth of L + 1 L+1 ). Specifically, we construct explicit controls interpolating either a finite dataset D D , comprising N N pairs of points in R d Rd , or two probability measures within a Wasserstein error margin ɛ &gt; 0 ɛ&amp;gt;0 . Our findings reveal a balancing trade-off between p p and L L , with L L scaling as 1 + O ( N / p ) 1+O(N/p) for data interpolation, and as 1 + O p − 1 + ( 1 + p ) − 1 ɛ − d 1+Op−1+(1+p)−1ɛ−d for measures. In the high-dimensional and wide setting where d , p &gt; N d,p&amp;gt;N , our result can be refined to achieve L = 0 L=0 . This naturally raises the problem of data interpolation in the autonomous regime, characterized by L = 0 L=0 . We adopt two alternative approaches: either controlling in a probabilistic sense, or by relaxing the target condition. In the first case, when p = N p=N we develop an inductive control strategy based on a separability assumption whose probability increases with d d . In the second one, we establish an explicit error decay rate with respect to p p which results from applying a universal approximation theorem to a custom-built Lipschitz vector field interpolating D D .},

  abstract     = {In the era of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), face forgery models pose significant security threats. These models have caused widespread negative impacts through the creation of forged products targeting public figures, national leaders, and other Persons-of-interest (POI). To address this, we propose the Face Omron Ring (FOR) to proactively protect the POI from face forgery. Specifically, by introducing FOR into a target face forgery model, the model will proactively refuse to forge any face image of protected identities without compromising the forgery capability for unprotected ones. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 face forgery models, StarGAN, AGGAN, AttGAN, and HiSD on the widely used large-scale face image datasets CelebA, CelebA-HQ, and PubFig83. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively protect 5000 different identities with a 100% protection success rate, for each of which only about 100 face images are needed. Our method also shows great robustness against multiple image processing attacks, such as JPEG, cropping, noise addition, and blurring. Compared to existing proactive defense methods, our method offers identity-centric protection for any image of the protected identity without requiring any special preprocessing, resulting in improved scalability and security. We hope that this work can provide a solution for responsible AIGC companies in regulating the use of face forgery models.},

Our study introduces a structural framework called SimDetector, which is a Local–Global Multi-Scale Similarity Contrast network. Specifically, the restructured and enhanced GRU module extracts more generalized local features, including long-term cyclical trends. The multi-scale sparse attention module efficiently extracts multi-scale global features with pattern information.

These approaches resulted in the exclusion of valuable general features, potentially leading to a performance decline and, consequently, a failure to fully exploit the potential of biometric information in assisting DeepFake detection. Moreover, insufficient attention has been dedicated to scrutinizing gaze authenticity within the realm of DeepFake detection in recent years.

More specifically, focusing on node classification, we aim to select representative nodes from a graph used to train GNNs to achieve the best performance. To solve this problem, we are inspired by the popular lottery ticket hypothesis, typically used for sparse architectures, and we propose the following subset hypothesis for graph data: “There exists a core subset when selecting a fixed-size dataset from the dense training dataset, that can represent the properties of the dataset, and GNNs trained on this core subset can achieve a better graph representation”. Equipped with this subset hypothesis, we present an efficient algorithm to identify the core data in the graph for GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the selected data (as a training set) can obtain performance improvements across various datasets and GNNs architectures.},

  abstract     = {In the construction process of radial basis function (RBF) networks, two common crucial issues arise: the selection of RBF centers and the effective utilization of the given source without encountering the overfitting problem. Another important issue is the fault tolerant capability. That is, when noise or faults exist in a trained network, it is crucial that the network’s performance does not undergo significant deterioration or decrease. However, without employing a fault tolerant procedure, a trained RBF network may exhibit significantly poor performance. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms are unable to simultaneously address all of the aforementioned issues. This paper proposes fault tolerant training algorithms that can simultaneously select RBF nodes and train RBF output weights. Additionally, our algorithms can directly control the number of RBF nodes in an explicit manner, eliminating the need for a time-consuming procedure to tune the regularization parameter and achieve the target RBF network size. Based on simulation results, our algorithms demonstrate improved test set performance when more RBF nodes are used, effectively utilizing the given source without encountering the overfitting problem. This paper first defines a fault tolerant objective function, which includes a term to suppress the effects of weight faults and weight noise. This term also prevents the issue of overfitting, resulting in better test set performance when more RBF nodes are utilized. With the defined objective function, the training process is designed to solve a generalized M -sparse problem by incorporating an ℓ0 -norm constraint. The ℓ0 -norm constraint allows us to directly and explicitly control the number of RBF nodes. To address the generalized M -sparse problem, we introduce the noise-resistant iterative hard thresholding (NR-IHT) algorithm. The convergence properties of the NR-IHT algorithm are subsequently discussed theoretically. To further enhance performance, we incorporate the momentum concept into the NR-IHT algorithm, referring to the modified version as “NR-IHT-Mom”. Simulation results show that both the NR-IHT algorithm and the NR-IHT-Mom algorithm outperform several state-of-the-art comparison algorithms.},

However, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are a type of vector-valued neural network defined on an algebra with additional algebraic or geometric properties. This paper extends the universal approximation theorem for a wide range of vector-valued neural networks, including hypercomplex-valued models as particular instances.

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are naturally suited to process sequence tasks such as NLP with low power, due to its brain-inspired spatio-temporal dynamics and spike-driven nature. Current SNNs employ ”repeat coding” that re-enter all input tokens at each timestep, which fails to fully exploit temporal relationships between the tokens and introduces memory overhead. In this work, we align the number of input tokens with the timestep and refer to this input coding as ”individual coding”. To cope with the increase in training time for individual encoded SNNs due to the dramatic increase in timesteps, we design a Bidirectional Parallel Spiking Neuron (BPSN) with following features: First, BPSN supports spike parallel computing and effectively avoids the issue of uninterrupted firing; Second, BPSN excels in handling adaptive sequence length tasks, which is a capability that existing work does not have; Third, the fusion of bidirectional information enhances the temporal information modeling capabilities of SNNs; To validate the effectiveness of our BPSN, we present the SNN-BERT, a deep direct training SNN architecture based on the BERT model in NLP. Compared to prior repeat 4-timestep coding baseline, our method achieves a 6.46 × × reduction in energy consumption and a significant 16.1% improvement, raising the performance upper bound of the SNN domain on the GLUE dataset to 74.4%. Additionally, our method achieves 3.5 × × training acceleration and 3.8 × × training memory optimization. Compared with artificial neural networks of similar architecture, we obtain comparable performance but up to 22.5 × × energy efficiency. We would provide the codes.},

  abstract     = {Recently, point cloud domain adaptation (DA) practices have been implemented to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models on point cloud data. However, variations across domains often result in decreased performance of models trained on different distributed data sources. Previous studies have focused on output-level domain alignment to address this challenge. But this approach may increase the amount of errors experienced when aligning different domains, particularly for targets that would otherwise be predicted incorrectly. Therefore, in this study, we propose an input-level discretization-based matching to enhance the generalization ability of DA. Specifically, an efficient geometric deformation depth decoupling network (3DeNet) is implemented to learn the knowledge from the source domain and embed it into an implicit feature space, which facilitates the effective constraint of unsupervised predictions for downstream tasks. Secondly, we demonstrate that the sparsity within the implicit feature space varies between domains, rendering domain differences difficult to support. Consequently, we match sets of neighboring points with different densities and biases by differentiating the adaptive densities. Finally, inter-domain differences are aligned by constraining the loss originating from and between the target domains. We conduct experiments on point cloud DA datasets PointDA-10 and PointSegDA, achieving advanced results (over 1.2% and 1% on average).},

Additionally, we quantify entity confidence at the feature and category levels, improving the precision of embeddings during information propagation and aggregation.

Several twin support vector machine-based MVL (MvTSVM) models have been introduced and demonstrated outstanding performance in various learning tasks. However, MvTSVM-based models face significant challenges in the form of computational complexity due to four matrix inversions, the need to reformulate optimization problems in order to employ kernel-generated surfaces for handling non-linear cases, and the constraint of uniform noise assumption in the training data. Particularly in cases where the data possesses a heteroscedastic error structure, these challenges become even more pronounced. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose multiview twin parametric margin support vector machine (MvTPMSVM). MvTPMSVM constructs parametric margin hyperplanes corresponding to both classes, aiming to regulate and manage the impact of the heteroscedastic noise structure existing within the data. The proposed MvTPMSVM model avoids the explicit computation of matrix inversions in the dual formulation, leading to enhanced computational efficiency. We perform an extensive assessment of the MvTPMSVM model using benchmark datasets such as UCI, KEEL, synthetic, and Animals with Attributes (AwA). Our experimental results, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, confirm the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed MvTPMSVM model compared to the baseline models.

  abstract     = {Thin pancake-like neuronal networks cultured on top of a planar microelectrode array have been extensively tried out in neuroengineering, as a substrate for the mobile robot’s control unit, i.e., as a cyborg’s brain. Most of these attempts failed due to intricate self-organizing dynamics in the neuronal systems. In particular, the networks may exhibit an emergent spatial map of steady nucleation sites (“n-sites”) of spontaneous population spikes. Being unpredictable and independent of the surface electrode locations, the n-sites drastically change local ability of the network to generate spikes. Here, using a spiking neuronal network model with generative spatially-embedded connectome, we systematically show in simulations that the number, location, and relative activity of spontaneously formed n-sites (“the vitals”) crucially depend on the samplings of three distributions: (1) the network distribution of neuronal excitability, (2) the distribution of connections between neurons of the network, and (3) the distribution of maximal amplitudes of a single synaptic current pulse. Moreover, blocking the dynamics of a small fraction (about 4%) of non-pacemaker neurons having the highest excitability was enough to completely suppress the occurrence of population spikes and their n-sites. This key result is explained theoretically. Remarkably, the n-sites occur taking into account only short-term synaptic plasticity, i.e., without a Hebbian-type plasticity. As the spiking network model used in this study is strictly deterministic, all simulation results can be accurately reproduced. The model, which has already demonstrated a very high richness-to-complexity ratio, can also be directly extended into the three-dimensional case, e.g., for targeting peculiarities of spiking dynamics in cerebral (or brain) organoids. We recommend the model as an excellent illustrative tool for teaching network-level computational neuroscience, complementing a few benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn from datasets without further environment interaction, facing errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Although effective methods have been proposed to conservatively estimate the Q-values of those OOD actions to mitigate this problem, insufficient or excessive pessimism under constant constraints often harms the policy learning process. Moreover, since the distribution of each task on the dataset varies among different environments and behavior policies, it is desirable to learn an adaptive weight for balancing constraints on the conservative estimation of Q-value and the standard RL objectives depending on each task. To achieve this, in this paper, we point out that the quantile of the Q-value is an effective metric to refer to the Q-value distribution of the fixed data set. Based on this observation, we design Adaptive Pessimism via a Target Q-value (APTQ) algorithm that balances between the pessimism constraint and the RL objective; this leads the expectation of Q-value to stably converge to a given target Q-value from a reasonable quantile of the Q-value distribution of the dataset. Experiments show that our method remarkably improves the performance of the state-of-the-art method CQL by 6.20% on the D4RL-v0 and 1.89% on the D4RL-v2.},

  abstract     = {Person Re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across non-overlapping cameras. The existing approaches formulate this task as fine-grained representation learning with deep neural networks, which involves extracting image features using a deep convolutional network, followed by mapping the features into a discriminative space through another smaller network, in order to make full use of all possible cues. However, recent Re-ID methods that strive to capture every cue and make the space more discriminative have resulted in longer features, ranging from 1024 to 14336, leading to higher time (distance computation) and space (feature storage) complexities. There are two potential solutions: reduction-after-training methods (such as Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis) and reduction-during-training methods (such as 1 × 1 Convolution). The former utilizes a statistical approach aiming for a global optimum but lacking end-to-end optimization of large data and deep neural networks. The latter lacks theoretical guarantees and may be vulnerable to training noise such as dataset noise or initialization seed. To address these limitations, we propose a method called Euclidean-Distance-Preserving Feature Reduction (EDPFR) that combines the strengths of both reduction-after-training and reduction-during-training methods. EDPFR first formulates the feature reduction process as a matrix decomposition and derives a condition to preserve the Euclidean distance between features, thus ensuring accuracy in theory. Furthermore, the method integrates the matrix decomposition process into a deep neural network to enable end-to-end optimization and batch training, while maintaining the theoretical guarantee. The result of the EDPFR is a reduction of the feature dimensions from f a fa and f b fb to f a ′ fa′ and f b ′ fb′ , while preserving their Euclidean distance, i.e. L 2 ( f a , f b ) = L 2 ( f a ′ , f b ′ ) L2(fa,fb)=L2(fa′,fb′) . In addition to its Euclidean-Distance-Preserving capability, EDPFR also features a novel feature-level distillation loss. One of the main challenges in knowledge distillation is dimension mismatch. While previous distillation losses, usually project the mismatched features to matched class-level, spatial-level, or similarity-level spaces, this can result in a loss of information and decrease the flexibility and efficiency of distillation. Our proposed feature-level distillation leverages the benefits of the Euclidean-Distance-Preserving property and performs distillation directly in the feature space, resulting in a more flexible and efficient approach. Extensive on three Re-ID datasets, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Euclidean-Distance-Preserving Feature Reduction.},

  abstract     = {Parameter efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods provide an efficient alternative for fine-tuning. However, typical PETL methods inject the same structures to all Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) layers and only use the final hidden states for downstream tasks, regardless of the knowledge diversity across PLM layers. Additionally, the backpropagation path of existing PETL methods still passes through the frozen PLM during training, which is computational and memory inefficient. In this paper, we propose FLAT, a generic PETL method that explicitly and individually combines knowledge across all PLM layers based on the tokens to perform a better transferring. FLAT considers the backbone PLM as a feature extractor and combines the features in a side-network, hence the backpropagation does not involve the PLM, which results in much less memory requirement than previous methods. The results on the GLUE benchmark show that FLAT outperforms other tuning techniques in the low-resource scenarios and achieves on-par performance in the high-resource scenarios with only 0.53% trainable parameters per task and 3 . 2 × 3.2× less GPU memory usagewith BERT base base . Besides, further ablation study is conducted to reveal that the proposed fusion layer effectively combines knowledge from PLM and helps the classifier to exploit the PLM knowledge to downstream tasks.

  abstract     = {Domain Generalization (DG) focuses on the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, which is able to learn a robust model that generalizes the knowledge acquired from the source domain to the unseen target domain. However, due to the existence of the domain shift, domain-invariant representation learning is challenging. Guided by fine-grained knowledge, we propose a novel paradigm Mask-Shift-Inference (MSI) for DG based on the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Different from relying on a series of constraints and assumptions for model optimization, this paradigm novelly shifts the focus to feature channels in the latent space for domain-invariant representation learning. We put forward a two-branch working mode of a main module and multiple domain-specific sub-modules. The latter can only achieve good prediction performance in its own specific domain but poor predictions in other source domains, which provides the main module with the fine-grained knowledge guidance and contributes to the improvement of the cognitive ability of MSI. Firstly, during the forward propagation of the main module, the proposed MSI accurately discards unstable channels based on spurious classifications varying across domains, which have domain-specific prediction limitations and are not conducive to generalization. In this process, a progressive scheme is adopted to adaptively increase the masking ratio according to the training progress to further reduce the risk of overfitting. Subsequently, our paradigm enters the compatible shifting stage before the formal prediction. Based on maximizing semantic retention, we implement the domain style matching and shifting through the simple transformation through Fourier transform, which can explicitly and safely shift the target domain back to the source domain whose style is closest to it, requiring no additional model updates and reducing the domain gap. Eventually, the paradigm MSI enters the formal inference stage. The updated target domain is predicted in the main module trained in the previous stage with the benefit of familiar knowledge from the nearest source domain masking scheme. Our paradigm is logically progressive, which can intuitively exclude the confounding influence of domain-specific spurious information along with mitigating domain shifts and implicitly perform semantically invariant representation learning, achieving robust OOD generalization. Extensive experimental results on PACS, VLCS, Office-Home and DomainNet datasets verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Dictionary learning is an important sparse representation algorithm which has been widely used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, for massive data in the big data era, classical dictionary learning algorithms are computationally expensive and even can be infeasible. To overcome this difficulty, we propose new dictionary learning methods based on randomized algorithms. The contributions of this work are as follows. First, we find that dictionary matrix is often numerically low-rank. Based on this property, we apply randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) to the dictionary matrix, and propose a randomized algorithm for linear dictionary learning. Compared with the classical K-SVD algorithm, an advantage is that one can update all the elements of the dictionary matrix simultaneously. Second, to the best of our knowledge, there are few theoretical results on why one can solve the involved matrix computation problems inexactly in dictionary learning. To fill-in this gap, we show the rationality of this randomized algorithm with inexact solving, from a matrix perturbation analysis point of view. Third, based on the numerically low-rank property and Nyström approximation of the kernel matrix, we propose a randomized kernel dictionary learning algorithm, and establish the distance between the exact solution and the computed solution, to show the effectiveness of the proposed randomized kernel dictionary learning algorithm. Fourth, we propose an efficient scheme for the testing stage in kernel dictionary learning. By using this strategy, there is no need to form nor store kernel matrices explicitly both in the training and the testing stages. Comprehensive numerical experiments are performed on some real-world data sets. Numerical results demonstrate the rationality of our strategies, and show that the proposed algorithms are much efficient than some state-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms. The MATLAB codes of the proposed algorithms are publicly available from https://github.com/Jiali-yang/RALDL_RAKDL .},

  abstract     = {Data heterogeneity (Non-IID) on Federated Learning (FL) is currently a widely publicized problem, which leads to local model drift and performance degradation. Because of the advantage of knowledge distillation, it has been explored in some recent work to refine global models. However, these approaches rely on a proxy dataset or a data generator. First, in many FL scenarios, proxy dataset do not necessarily exist on the server. Second, the quality of data generated by the generator is unstable and the generator depends on the computing resources of the server. In this work, we propose a novel data-Free knowledge distillation approach via generator-Free Data Generation for Non-IID FL, dubbed as FedF 2 DG. Specifically, FedF 2 DG requires only local models to generate pseudo datasets for each client, and can generate hard samples by adding an additional regularization term that exploit disagreements between local model and global model. Meanwhile, FedF 2 DG enables flexible utilization of computational resources by generating pseudo dataset locally or on the server. And to address the label distribution shift in Non-IID FL, we propose a Data Generation Principle that can adaptively control the label distribution and number of pseudo dataset based on client current state, and this allows for the extraction of more client knowledge. Then knowledge distillation is performed to transfer the knowledge in local models to the global model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art FL methods and can serve as plugin for existing Federated Learning methds such as FedAvg, FedProx, etc, and improve their performance.},

The smoothing approximation method is combined with multi-agent systems to avoid the introduction of set-valued subgradient terms, thereby facilitating the practical implementation of the neurodynamic approach. In addition, using the adaptive penalty technique, private inequality constraints are processed, which eliminates the need for additional quantitative estimation of penalty parameters and significantly reduces the computational cost. Moreover, to reduce the impact of smoothing approximation on the convergence of the neurodynamic approach, time-varying control parameters are introduced. Due to the parallel computing characteristics of multi-agent systems, the neurodynamic approach proposed in this paper is completely distributed. Theoretical proof shows that the state solution of the neurodynamic approach converges to the optimal solution of NRAP. Finally, two application examples are used to validate the feasibility of the neurodynamic approach.},

However, current approaches fail to accurately capture the intricate effects of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across different brain regions on emotion recognition. Therefore, this paper designs a transformer-based method, denoted by R2G-STLT, which relies on a spatial–temporal transformer encoder with regional to global hierarchical learning that learns the representative spatiotemporal features from the electrode level to the brain-region level. The regional spatial–temporal transformer (RST-Trans) encoder is designed to obtain spatial information and context dependence at the electrode level aiming to learn the regional spatiotemporal features. Then, the global spatial–temporal transformer (GST-Trans) encoder is utilized to extract reliable global spatiotemporal features, reflecting the impact of various brain regions on emotion recognition tasks. Moreover, the multi-head attention mechanism is placed into the GST-Trans encoder to empower it to capture the long-range spatial–temporal information among the brain regions. Finally, subject-independent experiments are conducted on each frequency band of the DEAP, SEED, and SEED-IV datasets to assess the performance of the proposed model. Results indicate that the R2G-STLT model surpasses several state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR point clouds can effectively depict the motion and posture of objects in three-dimensional space. Many studies accomplish the 3D object detection by voxelizing point clouds. However, in autonomous driving scenarios, the sparsity and hollowness of point clouds create some difficulties for voxel-based methods. The sparsity of point clouds makes it challenging to describe the geometric features of objects. The hollowness of point clouds poses difficulties for the aggregation of 3D features. We propose a two-stage 3D object detection framework, called MS 2 3D. (1) We propose a method using voxel feature points from multi-branch to construct the 3D feature layer. Using voxel feature points from different branches, we construct a relatively compact 3D feature layer with rich semantic features. Additionally, we propose a distance-weighted sampling method, reducing the loss of foreground points caused by downsampling and allowing the 3D feature layer to retain more foreground points. (2) In response to the hollowness of point clouds, we predict the offsets between deep-level feature points and the object’s centroid, making them as close as possible to the object’s centroid. This enables the aggregation of these feature points with abundant semantic features. For feature points from shallow-level, we retain them on the object’s surface to describe the geometric features of the object. To validate our approach, we evaluated its effectiveness on both the KITTI and ONCE datasets.},

  abstract     = {Dark video human action recognition has a wide range of applications in the real world. General action recognition methods focus on the actor or the action itself, ignoring the dark scene where the action happens, resulting in unsatisfied accuracy in recognition. For dark scenes, the existing two-step action recognition methods are stage complex due to introducing additional augmentation steps, and the one-step pipeline method is not lightweight enough. To address these issues, a one-step Transformer-based method named Dark Domain Shift for Action Recognition (Dark-DSAR) is proposed in this paper, which integrates the tasks of domain migration and classification into a single step and enhances the model’s functional coherence with respect to these two tasks, making our Dark-DSAR has low computation but high accuracy. Specifically, the domain shift module (DSM) achieves domain adaption from dark to bright to reduce the number of parameters and the computational cost. Besides, we explore the matching relationship between the input video size and the model, which can further optimize the inference efficiency by removing the redundant information in videos through spatial resolution dropping. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the datasets of ARID1.5, HMDB51-Dark, and UAV-human-night. Results show that the proposed Dark-DSAR obtains the best Top-1 accuracy on ARID1.5 with 89.49%, which is 2.56% higher than the state-of-the-art method, 67.13% and 61.9% on HMDB51-Dark and UAV-human-night, respectively. In addition, ablation experiments reveal that the action classifiers can gain ≥ ≥ 1% in accuracy compared to the original model when equipped with our DSM.},

In addition, existing methods focus on handling the offloading task in a certain time slot with statically allocated resources, but ignore the heterogeneous tasks’ different resource requirements, resulting in resource wastage. To solve the real-time task offloading and heterogeneous resource allocation problem in VEC system, we propose a decentralized solution based on the attention mechanism and recurrent neural networks (RNN) with a multi-agent distributed deep deterministic policy gradient (AR-MAD4PG). First, to address the partial observability of agents, we construct a shared agent graph and propose a periodic communication mechanism that enables edge nodes to aggregate information from other edge nodes. Second, to help agents better understand the current system state, we design an RNN-based feature extraction network to capture the historical state and resource allocation information of the VEC system. Thirdly, to tackle the challenges of excessive joint observation-action space and ineffective information interference, we adopt the multi-head attention mechanism to compress the dimension of the observation-action space of agents. Finally, we build a simulation model based on the actual vehicle trajectories, and the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The recently introduced neural operator (NO) has been employed as a gain approximator in the backstepping stabilization control of first-order hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems. Due to the global approximation ability of the DeepONet, the NO provides approximate spatial gain function with arbitrary accuracy. The closed-loop system stability can be ensured by the backstepping controller involving the approximate gain with sufficiently small error. In this paper, the NO theory is leveraged to solve the robust output regulation problem for a class of uncertain hyperbolic PDE systems under the design framework of backstepping-based regulator. The NO is trained offline on a dataset containing a sufficient number of system parameters and corresponding prior solutions of the kernel equation, so as to generate feedback gain for the robust regulator. Once the NO is trained, the kernel equation does not need to be solved ever again, for any new system parameters that do not exceed the range of the training set. Based on the internal model principle, the regulator is inherently robust to a degree of parameter uncertainty and error in approximate gain. Therefore, the tracking error can still converge to 0 if the extended regulator equations are solvable and the parameter uncertainty leads to an asymptotically stable origin. We provide a series of theory proofs and a numerical test under the approximate control and observation gains to demonstrate the robust regulation problem. It is shown that the NO is almost three orders of magnitude faster than PDE solver in generating kernel function, and the loss remains on the order of 1 0 − 4 10−4 in the test. This provides an opportunity to use the NO methodology for accelerated gain scheduling regulation for PDEs with time-varying system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Federated fault diagnosis has attracted increasing attention in industrial cloud–edge collaboration scenarios, where a ubiquitous assumption is that client models have the same architecture. Practically, this assumption cannot always be fulfilled due to requirements for personalized models, thereby resulting in the problem of model heterogeneity. Many approaches dealing with heterogeneous models tend to neglect the issue of representation bias, particularly in the context of non-identically and independently distributed data. In this article, to address the representation bias problem, Fed erated M odel- A gnostic K nowledge E xtraction (FedMAKE) is proposed. To bridge the information gap among clients, different from methods with public datasets, we initially develop two novel architecture-independent knowledge carriers. These carriers are derived based on the importance of process variables, without the need for additional datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a bi-directional distillation algorithm utilizing the two knowledge carriers. This algorithm facilitates the mutual transfer of knowledge embedded in carriers between a generative network and client models, thereby enabling the generation of fault data that is unbiased and well-balanced across categories. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity, we formulate a local objective for each client using two global knowledge carriers to guide local knowledge extraction and constrain client drift. Extensive experiments conducted on two prevalent industry datasets (TE and CWRU) illustrate that our proposed FedMAKE outperforms baseline methods. Specifically, FedMAKE enhances fault diagnosis accuracy by up to 11.7% on the TE dataset and up to 3.31% on the CWRU dataset compared to the sub-optimal method.},

  abstract     = {Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is an important technique that aims to combine the focused regions of multiple source images into a fully clear image. Decision-map methods are widely used in MFIF to maximize the preservation of information from the source images. While many decision-map methods have been proposed, they often struggle with difficulties in determining focus and non-focus boundaries, further affecting the quality of the fused images. Dynamic threshold neural P (DTNP) systems are computational models inspired by biological spiking neurons, featuring dynamic threshold and spiking mechanisms to better distinguish focused and unfocused regions for decision map generation. However, original DTNP systems require manual parameter configuration and have only one stimulus. Therefore, they are not suitable to be used directly for generating high-precision decision maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a variant called parameter adaptive dual channel DTNP (PADCDTNP) systems. Inspired by the spiking mechanisms of PADCDTNP systems, we further develop a new MFIF method. As a new neural model, PADCDTNP systems adaptively estimate parameters according to multiple external inputs to produce decision maps with robust boundaries, resulting in high-quality fusion results. Comprehensive experiments on the Lytro/MFFW/MFI-WHU dataset show that our method achieves advanced performance and yields comparable results to the fourteen representative MFIF methods. In addition, compared to the standard DTNP systems, PADCDTNP systems improve the fusion performance and fusion efficiency on the three datasets by 5.69% and 86.03%, respectively. The codes for both the proposed method and the comparison methods are released at https://github.com/MorvanLi/MFIF-PADCDTNP .},

  abstract     = {In the majority of existing multi-view clustering methods, the prerequisite is that the data have the correct cross-view correspondence. However, this strong assumption may not always hold in real-world applications, giving rise to the so-called View-shuffled Problem (VsP). To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method, namely View-shuffled Clustering via the Modified Hungarian Algorithm (VsC-mH). Specifically, we first establish the cross-view correspondence of the shuffled data utilizing strategies of the global alignment and modified Hungarian algorithm (mH) based intra-category alignment. Subsequently, we generate the partition of the aligned data employing matrix factorization. The fusion of these two processes facilitates the interaction of information, resulting in improved quality of both data alignment and partition. VsC-mH is capable of handling the data with alignment ratios ranging from 0 to 100%. Both experimental and theoretical evidence guarantees the convergence of the proposed optimization algorithm. Extensive experimental results obtained on six practical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with high-dimensional problems has always been a key and challenging issue in the field of fuzzy systems. Traditional Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems face the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity when applied to high-dimensional data. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach for optimizing TSK fuzzy systems by integrating the spectral Dai-Yuan conjugate gradient (SDYCG) algorithm and the smoothing group L 0 L0 regularization technique. This method aims to address the challenges faced by TSK fuzzy systems in handling high-dimensional problems. The smoothing group L 0 L0 regularization technique is employed to introduce sparsity, select relevant features, and improve the generalization ability of the model. The SDYCG algorithm effectively accelerates convergence and enhances the learning performance of the network. Furthermore, we prove the weak convergence and strong convergence of the new algorithm under the strong Wolfe criterion, which means that the gradient norm of the error function with respect to the weight vector converges to zero, and the weight sequence approaches a fixed point.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various domains, such as face recognition, object detection, and image segmentation. However, the lack of transparency and limited interpretability inherent in CNNs pose challenges in fields such as medical diagnosis, autonomous driving, finance, and military applications. Several studies have explored the interpretability of CNNs and proposed various post-hoc interpretable methods. The majority of these methods are feature-based, focusing on the influence of input variables on outputs. Few methods undertake the analysis of parameters in CNNs and their overall structure. To explore the structure of CNNs and intuitively comprehend the role of their internal parameters, we propose an Attribution Graph-based Interpretable method for CNNs (AGIC) which models the overall structure of CNNs as graphs and provides interpretability from global and local perspectives. The runtime parameters of CNNs and feature maps of each image sample are applied to construct attribution graphs (At-GCs), where the convolutional kernels are represented as nodes and the SHAP values between kernel outputs are assigned as edges. These At-GCs are then employed to pretrain a newly designed heterogeneous graph encoder based on Deep Graph Infomax (DGI). To comprehensively delve into the overall structure of CNNs, the pretrained encoder is used for two types of interpretable tasks: (1) a classifier is attached to the pretrained encoder for the classification of At-GCs, revealing the dependency of At-GC’s topological characteristics on the image sample categories, and (2) a scoring aggregation (SA) network is constructed to assess the importance of each node in At-GCs, thus reflecting the relative importance of kernels in CNNs. The experimental results indicate that the topological characteristics of At-GC exhibit a dependency on the sample category used in its construction, which reveals that kernels in CNNs show distinct combined activation patterns for processing different image categories, meanwhile, the kernels that receive high scores from SA network are crucial for feature extraction, whereas low-scoring kernels can be pruned without affecting model performance, thereby enhancing the interpretability of CNNs.},

  abstract     = {De novo molecular design is the process of learning knowledge from existing data to propose new chemical structures that satisfy the desired properties. By using de novo design to generate compounds in a directed manner, better solutions can be obtained in large chemical libraries with less comparison cost. But drug design needs to take multiple factors into consideration. For example, in polypharmacology, molecules that activate or inhibit multiple target proteins produce multiple pharmacological activities and are less susceptible to drug resistance. However, most existing molecular generation methods either focus only on affinity for a single target or fail to effectively balance the relationship between multiple targets, resulting in insufficient validity and desirability of the generated molecules. To address the problems, an approach called clustered Pareto-based reinforcement learning (CPRL) is proposed. In CPRL, a pre-trained model is constructed to grasp existing molecular knowledge in a supervised learning manner. In addition, the clustered Pareto optimization algorithm is presented to find the best solution between different objectives. The algorithm first extracts an update set from the sampled molecules through the designed aggregation-based molecular clustering. Then, the final reward is computed by constructing the Pareto frontier ranking of the molecules from the updated set. To explore the vast chemical space, a reinforcement learning agent is designed in CPRL that can be updated under the guidance of the final reward to balance multiple properties. Furthermore, to increase the internal diversity of the molecules, a fixed-parameter exploration model is used for sampling in conjunction with the agent. The experimental results demonstrate that CPRL is capable of balancing multiple properties of the molecule and has higher desirability and validity, reaching 0.9551 and 0.9923, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) leveraging metapaths have garnered extensive utilization. Nevertheless, the escalating parameters and data corpus within graph pre-training models incur mounting training costs. Consequently, GNN models encounter hurdles including diminished generalization capacity and compromised performance amidst small sample datasets. Drawing inspiration from the efficacy demonstrated by self-supervised learning methodologies in natural language processing, we embark on an exploration. We endeavor to imbue graph data with augmentable, learnable prompt vectors targeting node representation enhancement to foster superior adaptability to downstream tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach, the Metapath Integrated Graph Prompt Neural Network (MIGP), which leverages learnable prompt vectors to enhance node representations within a pretrained model framework. By leveraging learnable prompt vectors, MIGP aims to address the limitations posed by mall sample datasets and improve GNNs’ model generalization. In the pretraining stage, we split symmetric metapaths in heterogeneous graphs into short metapaths and explicitly propagate information along the metapaths to update node representations. In the prompt-tuning stage, the parameters of the pretrained model are fixed, a set of independent basis vectors is introduced, and an attention mechanism is employed to generate task-specific learnable prompt vectors for each node. Another notable contribution of our work is the introduction of three patent datasets, which is a pioneering application in related fields. We will make these three patent datasets publicly available to facilitate further research on large-scale patent data analysis. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on three patent datasets and three other public datasets, i.e., ACM, IMDB, and DBLP, we demonstrate the superior performance of the MIGP model in enhancing model applicability and performance across a variety of downstream datasets.

To advance in this quest, here we analyze the capacity of the HEENS hardware architecture to operate in a similar manner as an in vitro neuronal network grown in the laboratory. For that, we considered data of spontaneous activity in living neuronal cultures of about 400 neurons and compared their collective dynamics and functional behavior with those obtained from direct numerical simulations ( in silico ) and hardware implementations ( in duris silico ). The results show that HEENS is capable to mimic both the in vitro and in silico systems with high efficient-cost ratio, and on different network topological designs. Our work shows that compact low-cost hardware implementations are feasible, opening new avenues for future, highly efficient neuromorphic devices and advanced human–machine interfacing.},

  abstract     = {Brain age (BA) is defined as a measure of brain maturity and could help characterize both the typical brain development and neuropsychiatric disorders in mammals. Various biological phenotypes have been successfully applied to predict BA of human using chronological age (CA) as label. However, whether the BA of macaque, one of the most important animal models, can also be reliably predicted is largely unknown. To address this question, we propose a novel deep learning model called Multi-Branch Vision Transformer (MB-ViT) to fuse multi-scale (i.e., from coarse-grained to fine-grained) brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data to predict BA of macaques. The discriminative functional connections and the related brain regions contributing to the prediction are further identified based on Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) method. Our proposed model successfully predicts BA of 450 normal rhesus macaques from the publicly available PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) dataset with lower mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) as well as higher Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient (PCC) and coefficient of determination ( R 2 R2 ) compared to other baseline models. The correlation between the predicted BA and CA reaches as high as 0.82 of our proposed method. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the functional connections predominantly contributing to the prediction results are situated in the primary motor cortex (M1), visual cortex, area v23 in the posterior cingulate cortex, and dysgranular temporal pole. In summary, our proposed deep learning model provides an effective tool to accurately predict BA of primates (macaque in this study), and lays a solid foundation for future studies of age-related brain diseases in those animal models.},

Specifically, the D-Net is designed for image deblurring while the SD-Net is used to simulate the spatial-variant degradation. Furthermore, the off-the-shelf pre-trained model is employed as the prior of our model, which facilitates image deblurring.

  abstract     = {Real-world adversarial patches were shown to be successful in compromising state-of-the-art models in various computer vision applications. Most existing defenses rely on analyzing input or feature level gradients to detect the patch. However, these methods have been compromised by recent GAN-based attacks that generate naturalistic patches. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to defend against adversarial patches based on the entropy carried by the input, rather than on its saliency. We present Jedi , a new defense against adversarial patches that tackles the patch localization problem from an information theory perspective; leveraging the high entropy of adversarial patches to identify potential patch zones, and using an autoencoder to complete patch regions from high entropy kernels. Jedi achieves high-precision adversarial patch localization and removal, detecting on average 90% of adversarial patches across different benchmarks, and recovering up to 94% of successful patch attacks. Since Jedi relies on an input entropy analysis, it is model-agnostic , and can be applied to off-the-shelf models without changes to the training or inference of the models. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive qualitative analysis that investigates the cases where Jedi fails, comparatively with related methods. Interestingly, we find a significant core failure cases among the different defenses share one common property: high entropy. We think that this work offers a new perspective to understand the adversarial effect under physical-world settings. We also leverage these findings to enhance Jedi’s handling of entropy outliers by introducing Adaptive Jedi, which boosts performance by up to 9% in challenging images.},

  abstract     = {Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) is a task which converts a sign language video into a gloss sequence. The existing deep learning based sign language recognition methods usually rely on large-scale training data and rich supervised information. However, current sign language datasets are limited, and they are only annotated at sentence-level rather than frame-level. Inadequate supervision of sign language data poses a serious challenge for sign language recognition, which may result in insufficient training of sign language recognition models. To address above problems, we propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation method for continuous sign language recognition, which contains two teacher models and one student model. One of the teacher models is the Sign2Text dialogue teacher model, which takes a sign language video and a dialogue sentence as input and outputs the sign language recognition result. The other teacher model is the Text2Gloss translation teacher model, which targets to translate a text sentence into a gloss sequence. Both teacher models can provide information-rich soft labels to assist the training of the student model, which is a general sign language recognition model. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple commonly used sign language datasets, i.e., PHOENIX 2014T, CSL-Daily and QSL, the results show that the proposed cross-modal knowledge distillation method can effectively improve the sign language recognition accuracy by transferring multi-modal information from teacher models to the student model.

The conventional discussions about V t &gt; 1 Vt&amp;gt;1 and 0 &lt; V t ⩽ 1 0&amp;lt;Vt⩽1 are no longer required. For the purpose of verifying the new lemmas, complex-valued fuzzy cellular neural networks (CVFCNNs) with discontinuous activation functions are studied with a nontraditional non-separation method, which could reduce the conservatism of the obtained results greatly. Besides, FXT synchronization is discussed simultaneously. When contrasted with the results of other similar prominent pioneering works nowadays, the accuracy of settling times (STs) is quite enhanced. At last, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the validity and superiority of our established theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning has emerged as a cornerstone in unsupervised representation learning. Its primary paradigm involves an instance discrimination task utilizing InfoNCE loss where the loss has been proven to be a form of mutual information. Consequently, it has become a common practice to analyze contrastive learning using mutual information as a measure. Yet, this analysis approach presents difficulties due to the necessity of estimating mutual information for real-world applications. This creates a gap between the elegance of its mathematical foundation and the complexity of its estimation, thereby hampering the ability to derive solid and meaningful insights from mutual information analysis. In this study, we introduce three novel methods and a few related theorems, aimed at enhancing the rigor of mutual information analysis. Despite their simplicity, these methods can carry substantial utility. Leveraging these approaches, we reassess three instances of contrastive learning analysis, illustrating the capacity of the proposed methods to facilitate deeper comprehension or to rectify pre-existing misconceptions. The main results can be summarized as follows: (1) While small batch sizes influence the range of training loss, they do not inherently limit learned representation’s information content or affect downstream performance adversely; (2) Mutual information, with careful selection of positive pairings and post-training estimation, proves to be a superior measure for evaluating practical networks; and (3) Distinguishing between task-relevant and irrelevant information presents challenges, yet irrelevant information sources do not necessarily compromise the generalization of downstream tasks.},

To solve these problems, we present an unsupervised multi-view contrastive learning framework with an attention-based reranking strategy for entity alignment, named AR-Align. In AR-Align, two kinds of data augmentation methods are employed to provide a complementary view for neighborhood and attribute, respectively. Next, a multi-view contrastive learning method is introduced to reduce the semantic gap between different views of the augmented entities. Moreover, an attention-based reranking strategy is proposed to rerank the hard entities through calculating their weighted sum of embedding similarities on different structures.

Texts are input into MPNet to generate sentence embedding containing emotional semantic information.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a weakly supervised learning technique that classifies images in the target domain when the source domain has labeled samples, and the target domain has unlabeled samples. Due to the complexity of imaging conditions and the content of remote sensing images, the use of UDA to accurately extract artificial features such as buildings from high-spatial-resolution (HSR) imagery is still challenging. In this study, we propose a new UDA method for building extraction, the contrastive domain adaptation network (CDANet), by utilizing adversarial learning and contrastive learning techniques. CDANet consists of a single multitask generator and dual discriminators. The generator employs a region and edge dual-branch structure that strengthens its edge extraction ability and is beneficial for the extraction of small and densely distributed buildings. The dual discriminators receive the region and edge prediction outputs and achieve multilevel adversarial learning. During adversarial training processing, CDANet aligns the cross-domain of similar pixel features in the embedding space by constructing the regional pixelwise contrastive loss. A self-training (ST) strategy based on pseudolabel generation is further utilized to address the target intradomain discrepancy. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate CDANet on three publicly accessible datasets, namely the WHU, Austin, and Massachusetts. Ablation experiments show that the generator network structure, contrastive loss and ST strategy all improve the building extraction accuracy. Method comparisons validate that CDANet achieves superior performance to several state-of-the-art methods, including AdaptSegNet, AdvEnt, IntraDA, FDANet and ADRS, in terms of F1 score and mIoU.},

  abstract     = {Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect the target speaker from brain signals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have shown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on traditional convolutional neural networks designed for processing Euclidean data like images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess non-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which does not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively represent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph convolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG signals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial attention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection performance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and hierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These strategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest network layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second time window, we achieve results of 90.0% and 79.6% accuracy on KUL and DTU, respectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the experimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed DGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100 times.},

  abstract     = {How to accurately learn task-relevant state representations from high-dimensional observations with visual distractions is a realistic and challenging problem in visual reinforcement learning. Recently, unsupervised representation learning methods based on bisimulation metrics, contrast, prediction, and reconstruction have shown the ability for task-relevant information extraction. However, due to the lack of appropriate mechanisms for the extraction of task information in the prediction, contrast, and reconstruction-related approaches and the limitations of bisimulation-related methods in domains with sparse rewards, it is still difficult for these methods to be effectively extended to environments with distractions. To alleviate these problems, in the paper, the action sequences, which contain task-intensive signals, are incorporated into representation learning. Specifically, we propose a S equential A ction–induced invariant R epresentation (SAR) method, which decouples the controlled part (i.e., task-relevant information) and the uncontrolled part (i.e., task-irrelevant information) in noisy observations through sequential actions, thereby extracting effective representations related to decision tasks. To achieve it, the characteristic function of the action sequence’s probability distribution is modeled to specifically optimize the state encoder. We conduct extensive experiments on the distracting DeepMind Control suite while achieving the best performance over strong baselines. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at disregarding task-irrelevant information by applying SAR to real-world CARLA-based autonomous driving with natural distractions. Finally, we provide the analysis results of generalization drawn from the generalization decay and t-SNE visualization. Code and demo videos are available at https://github.com/DMU-XMU/SAR.git .},

To alleviate the background shortcuts, in this paper, we propose a c ross- v iew m otion c onsistent (CVMC) self-supervised video inter-intra contrastive model to focus on the learning of local details and long-term temporal relationships. Specifically, we first extract the dynamic features of consecutive video snippets and then align these features based on multi-view motion consistency. Meanwhile, we compare the optimized dynamic features for instance comparison of different videos and local spatial fine-grained with temporal order in the same video, respectively. Ultimately, the joint optimization of spatio-temporal alignment and motion discrimination effectively fills the challenges of the missing components of instance recognition, spatial compactness, and temporal perception in self-supervised learning. Experimental results show that our proposed self-supervised model can effectively learn visual representation information and achieve highly competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods in both action recognition and video retrieval tasks.},

  abstract     = {The enormous data and computational resources required by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) hinder the practical application on mobile devices. To solve this restrictive problem, filter pruning has become one of the practical approaches. At present, most existing pruning methods are currently developed and practiced with respect to the spatial domain, which ignores the potential interconnections in the model structure and the decentralized distribution of image energy in the spatial domain. The image frequency domain transform method can remove the correlation between image pixels and concentrate the image energy distribution, which results in lossy compression of images. In this study, we find that the frequency domain transform method is also applicable to the feature maps of CNNs. The filter pruning via wavelet transform (WT) is proposed in this paper (FPWT), which combines the frequency domain information of WT with the output feature map to more obviously find the correlation between feature maps and make the energy into a relatively concentrated distribution in the frequency domain. Moreover, the importance score of each feature map is calculated by the cosine similarity and the energy-weighted coefficients of the high and low frequency components, and prune the filter based on its importance score. Experiments on two image classification datasets validate the effectiveness of FPWT. For ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10, FPWT reduces FLOPs and parameters by more than 60.0 % with 0.53 % accuracy improvement. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet, FPWT reduces FLOPs by 53.8 % and removes parameters by 49.7 % with only 0.97 % loss of Top-1 accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Visible–infrared person re-identification (VIPR) plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. Modal discrepancies between visible and infrared images seriously confuse person appearance discrimination, e.g., the similarity of the same class of different modalities is lower than the similarity between different classes of the same modality. Worse still, the modal discrepancies and appearance discrepancies are coupled with each other. The prevailing practice is to disentangle modal and appearance discrepancies, but it usually requires complex decoupling networks. In this paper, rather than disentanglement, we propose to measure and optimize modal discrepancies. We explore a cross-modal group-relation (CMGR) to describe the relationship between the same group of people in two different modalities. The CMGR has great potential in modal invariance because it considers more stable groups rather than individuals, so it is a good measurement for modal discrepancies. Furthermore, we design a group-relation correlation (GRC) loss function based on Pearson correlations to optimize CMGR, which can be easily integrated with the learning of VIPR’s appearance features. Consequently, our CMGR model serves as a pivotal constraint to minimize modal discrepancies, operating in a manner similar to a loss function. It is applied solely during the training phase, thereby obviating the need for any execution during the inference phase. Experimental results on two public datasets (i.e., RegDB and SYSU-MM01) demonstrate that our CMGR method is superior to state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, on the RegDB dataset, with the help of CMGR, the rank-1 identification rate has improved by more than 7% compared to the case of not using CMGR.},

SGX computes node intersections for subgraph exchange and expansion, while local differential privacy ensures privacy.

Existing transformer-based methods often focus on self-attention to model the global relations among spatial features or temporal features, which cannot well focus on important expression-related locality structures from both spatial and temporal features for the in-the-wild expression videos. To this end, we incorporate diverse graph structures into transformers and propose a CDGT method to construct diverse graph transformers for efficient emotion recognition from in-the-wild videos. Specifically, our method contains a spatial dual-graphs transformer and a temporal hyperbolic-graph transformer. The former deploys a dual-graph constrained attention to capture latent emotion-related graph geometry structures among local spatial tokens for efficient feature representation, especially for the video frames with pose variations and partial occlusions. The latter adopts a hyperbolic-graph constrained self-attention that explores important temporal graph structure information under hyperbolic space to model more subtle changes of dynamic emotion. Extensive experimental results on in-the-wild video-based facial expression databases show that our proposed CDGT outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Controllable Pareto front learning (CPFL) approximates the Pareto optimal solution set and then locates a non-dominated point with respect to a given reference vector. However, decision-maker objectives were limited to a constraint region in practice, so instead of training on the entire decision space, we only trained on the constraint region. Controllable Pareto front learning with Split Feasibility Constraints (SFC) is a way to find the best Pareto solutions to a split multi-objective optimization problem that meets certain constraints. In the previous study, CPFL used a Hypernetwork model comprising multi-layer perceptron (Hyper-MLP) blocks. Transformer can be more effective than previous architectures on numerous modern deep learning tasks in certain situations due to their distinctive advantages. Therefore, we have developed a hyper-transformer (Hyper-Trans) model for CPFL with SFC. We use the theory of universal approximation for the sequence-to-sequence function to show that the Hyper-Trans model makes MED errors smaller in computational experiments than the Hyper-MLP model.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommendation typically utilizes deep neural networks to mine rich information in interaction sequences. However, existing methods often face the issue of insufficient interaction data. To alleviate the sparsity issue, self-supervised learning is introduced into sequential recommendation. Despite its effectiveness, we argue that current self-supervised learning-based (i.e., SSL-based) sequential recommendation models have the following limitations: (1) using only a single self-supervised learning method, either contrastive self-supervised learning or generative self-supervised learning. (2) employing a simple data augmentation strategy in either the graph structure domain or the node feature domain. We believe that they have not fully utilized the capabilities of both self-supervised methods and have not sufficiently explored the advantages of combining graph augmentation schemes. As a result, they often fail to learn better item representations. In light of this, we propose a novel multi-task sequential recommendation framework named A A daptive S S elf-supervised L L earning for sequential Rec Rec ommendation (ASLRec) (ASLRec) . Specifically, our framework combines contrastive and generative self-supervised learning methods adaptively, simultaneously applying different perturbations at both the graph topology and node feature levels. This approach constructs diverse augmented graph views and employs multiple loss functions (including contrastive loss, generative loss, mask loss, and prediction loss) for joint training. By encompassing the capabilities of various methods, our model learns item representations across different augmented graph views to achieve better performance and effectively mitigate interaction noise and sparsity. In addition, we add a small proportion of random uniform noise to item representations, making the item representations more uniform and mitigating the inherent popularity bias in interaction records. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets to evaluate our model. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 14 other competitive methods: the hit rate (HR) improved by over 14.39%, and the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) increased by over 18.67%.},

However, previous research on driver intention recognition has not fully considered the influence of the driving environment on speed intentions and has not exploited the temporal dependency inherent in the lateral intentions to prevent erroneous changes in recognition. Furthermore, the coupling of speed and lateral intentions was overlooked; they were generally considered separately. To address these limitations, a unified recognition approach for speed and lateral intentions based on deep learning is presented in this study. First, extensive naturalistic driving data are collected, and information related to road slope and driving trajectories is extracted. A comprehensive classification of driver intentions is then performed. Toeplitz inverse covariance-based clustering and trajectory clustering methods are applied separately to label speed and lateral intentions, so that the influence of driving environments and the coupling of speed and lateral intentions are integrated into intention recognition. Finally, a deep-learning-based unified recognition model for driver intention is developed. This model uses a hierarchical recognition approach for speed intentions and includes a double-layer networks architecture with long short-term memory for the recognition of lateral intention. The validation results show that the created driver intention recognition model can accurately and stably recognize both speed and lateral intentions in complex driving environments.},

  abstract     = {Dilated convolution has been widely used in various computer vision tasks due to its ability to expand the receptive field while maintaining the resolution of feature maps. However, the critical challenge is the gridding problem caused by the isomorphic structure of the dilated convolution, where the holes filled in the dilated convolution destroy the integrity of the extracted information and cut off the relevance of neighboring pixels. In this work, a novel heterogeneous dilated convolution, called HDConv, is proposed to address this issue by setting independent dilation rates on grouped channels while keeping the general convolution operation. The heterogeneous structure can effectively avoid the gridding problem while introducing multi-scale kernels in the filters. Based on the heterogeneous structure of the proposed HDConv, we also explore the benefit of large receptive fields to feature extraction by comparing different combinations of dilated rates. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of some computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. The results show the proposed HDConv can achieve a competitive performance on ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff10k, COCO, and a medical image dataset UESTC-COVID-19. The proposed module can readily replace conventional convolutions in existing convolutional neural networks (i.e., plug-and-play), and it is promising to further extend dilated convolution to wider scenarios in the field of image segmentation.},

  abstract     = {While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in processing non-Euclidean structured data, the neighborhood fetching of GNNs is time-consuming and computationally intensive, making them difficult to deploy in low-latency industrial applications. To address the issue, a feasible solution is graph knowledge distillation (KD), which can learn high-performance student Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to replace GNNs by mimicking the superior output of teacher GNNs. However, state-of-the-art graph knowledge distillation methods are mainly based on distilling deep features from intermediate hidden layers, this leads to the significance of logit layer distillation being greatly overlooked. To provide a novel viewpoint for studying logits-based KD methods, we introduce the idea of decoupling into graph knowledge distillation. Specifically, we first reformulate the classical graph knowledge distillation loss into two parts, i.e., the target class graph distillation (TCGD) loss and the non-target class graph distillation (NCGD) loss. Next, we decouple the negative correlation between GNN’s prediction confidence and NCGD loss, as well as eliminate the fixed weight between TCGD and NCGD. We named this logits-based method Decoupled Graph Knowledge Distillation (DGKD). It can flexibly adjust the weights of TCGD and NCGD for different data samples, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of the student MLP. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, DGKD can be incorporated into any existing graph knowledge distillation framework as a plug-and-play loss function, further improving distillation performance.

  abstract     = {In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, agents jointly optimize a centralized value function based on the rewards shared by all agents and learn decentralized policies through value function decomposition. Although such a learning framework is considered effective, estimating individual contribution from the rewards, which is essential for learning highly cooperative behaviors, is difficult. In addition, it becomes more challenging when reinforcement and punishment, help in increasing or decreasing the specific behaviors of agents, coexist because the processes of maximizing reinforcement and minimizing punishment can often conflict in practice. This study proposes a novel exploration scheme called multi-agent decomposed reward-based exploration (MuDE), which preferably explores the action spaces associated with positive sub-rewards based on a modified reward decomposition scheme, thus effectively exploring action spaces not reachable by existing exploration schemes. We evaluate MuDE with a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement and modified predator–prey tasks extended to include reinforcement and punishment. The results show that MuDE accurately estimates sub-rewards and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both convergence speed and win rates.},

To fill this gap, we propose a novel multi-view clustering network termed CodingNet to explore the diverse and consistent information simultaneously in this paper. Specifically, instead of utilizing the conventional auto-encoder, we design an asymmetric structure network to extract shallow and deep features separately. Then, by approximating the similarity matrix on the shallow feature to the zero matrix, we ensure the diversity for the shallow features, thus offering a better description of multi-view data. Moreover, we propose a dual contrastive mechanism that maintains consistency for deep features at both view-feature and pseudo-label levels.

Most existing works utilize high-resource modern Chinese to understand low-resource ancient Chinese, but they fail to fully consider the semantic and syntactic gaps between them due to their changes over time, resulting in the misunderstanding of ancient Chinese. Hence, we propose a novel language pre-training framework for ancient Chinese understanding based on the Cross-temporal Contrastive Disentanglement Model (CCDM), which bridges the gap between modern and ancient Chinese with their parallel corpus. Specifically, we first explore a cross-temporal data augmentation method by disentangling and reconstructing the parallel ancient-modern corpus. It is noteworthy that the proposed decoupling strategy takes full account of the cross-temporal character between ancient and modern Chinese. Then, cross-temporal contrastive learning is exploited to train the model by fully leveraging the cross-temporal information. Finally, the trained language model is utilized for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on six ancient Chinese understanding tasks. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework also holds potential applicability to other languages that have undergone evolutionary changes, leading to shifts in syntax and semantics. 1},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained visual categorization in zero-shot setting is a challenging problem in the computer vision community. It requires algorithms to accurately identify fine-grained categories that do not appear during the training phase and have high visual similarity to each other. Existing methods usually address this problem by using attribute information as intermediate knowledge, which provides sufficient fine-grained characteristics of categories and can be transferred from seen categories to unseen categories. However, the learning of attribute visual features is not trivial due to the following two reasons: (i) The visual information about attributes of different types may interfere with the visual feature learning of each other. (ii) The visual characteristics of the same attribute may vary in different categories. To solve these issues, we propose a Multi-Group Multi-Stream attribute Attention network (MGMSA), which not only separates the feature learning of attributes of different types, but also isolates the learning of attribute visual features for categories with big differences in attribute appearance. This avoids the interference between uncorrelated attributes and helps to learn category-specific attribute-related visual features. This is beneficial for distinguishing fine-grained categories with subtle visual differences. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MGMSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on attribute prediction and fine-grained zero-shot learning.},

Recent studies have demonstrated promising outcomes by employing a vision transformer backbone pre-trained on an image-level dataset in a self-supervised manner. However, those methods always depend on complex architectures or meticulously designed inputs. Naturally, we are attempting to explore the investment with a straightforward approach. To prevent over-complication, we introduce a simple Dense Embedding Contrast network (DECNet) for unsupervised semantic segmentation in this paper. Specifically, we propose a Nearest Neighbor Similarity strategy (NNS) to establish well-defined positive and negative pairs for dense contrastive learning. Meanwhile, we optimize a contrastive objective named Ortho-InfoNCE to alleviate the false negative problem inherent in contrastive learning for further enhancing dense representations.

Leveraging statistical data on communication-induced delays, a novel PETP is proposed that adjusts transmission frequencies through a probabilistic delay division method. The dynamic adjustment of event trigger conditions based on real-time neural network is realized, and the responsiveness of the system is enhanced, which is of great significance for improving the performance and reliability of the communication system.

  abstract     = {Lossy image coding techniques usually result in various undesirable compression artifacts. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have seen encouraging advances in compression artifact reduction. However, most of them focus on the restoration of the luma channel without considering the chroma components. Besides, most deep convolutional neural networks are hard to deploy in practical applications because of their high model complexity. In this article, we propose a dual-stage feedback network (DSFN) for lightweight color image compression artifact reduction. Specifically, we propose a novel curriculum learning strategy to drive a DSFN to reduce color image compression artifacts in a luma-to-RGB manner. In the first stage, the DSFN is dedicated to reconstructing the luma channel, whose high-level features containing rich structural information are then rerouted to the second stage by a feedback connection to guide the RGB image restoration. Furthermore, we present a novel enhanced feedback block for efficient high-level feature extraction, in which an adaptive iterative self-refinement module is carefully designed to refine the low-level features progressively, and an enhanced separable convolution is advanced to exploit multiscale image information fully. Extensive experiments show the notable advantage of our DSFN over several state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative indices and visual effects with lower model complexity.},

  abstract     = {The success of the ClassSR has led to a strategy of decomposing images being used for large image SR. The decomposed image patches have different recovery difficulties. Therefore, in ClassSR, image patches are reconstructed by different networks to greatly reduce the computational cost. However, in ClassSR, the training of multiple sub-networks inevitably increases the training difficulty. Furthermore, decomposing images with overlapping not only increases the computational cost but also inevitably produces artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end general framework, named patches separation and artifacts removal SR (PSAR-SR). In PSAR-SR, we propose an image information complexity module (IICM) to efficiently determine the difficulty of recovering image patches. Then, we propose a patches classification and separation module (PCSM), which can dynamically select an appropriate SR path for image patches of different recovery difficulties. Moreover, we propose a multi-attention artifacts removal module (MARM) in the network backend, which can not only greatly reduce the computational cost but also solve the artifacts problem well under the overlapping-free decomposition. Further, we propose two loss functions — threshold penalty loss (TP-Loss) and artifacts removal loss (AR-Loss). TP-Loss can better select appropriate SR paths for image patches. AR-Loss can effectively guarantee the reconstruction quality between image patches. Experiments show that compared to the leading methods, PSAR-SR well eliminates artifacts under the overlapping-free decomposition and achieves superior performance on existing methods ( e.g. , FSRCNN, CARN, SRResNet, RCAN and CAMixerSR). Moreover, PSAR-SR saves 53%–65% FLOPs in computational cost far beyond the leading methods. The code will be made available: https://github.com/dywang95/PSAR-SR .},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal representation learning has received significant attention across diverse research domains due to its ability to model a scenario comprehensively. Learning the cross-modal interactions is essential to combining multi-modal data into a joint representation. However, conventional cross-attention mechanisms can produce noisy and non-meaningful values in the absence of useful cross-modal interactions among input features, thereby introducing uncertainty into the feature representation. These factors have the potential to degrade the performance of downstream tasks. This paper introduces a novel Pre-gating and Contextual Attention Gate (PCAG) module for multi-modal learning comprising two gating mechanisms that operate at distinct information processing levels within the deep learning model. The first gate filters out interactions that lack informativeness for the downstream task, while the second gate reduces the uncertainty introduced by the cross-attention module. Experimental results on eight multi-modal classification tasks spanning various domains show that the multi-modal fusion model with PCAG outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal fusion models. Additionally, we elucidate how PCAG effectively processes cross-modality interactions},

Specifically, we design a state-to-PF representation model that describes agents’ states as potential fields, allowing easy measurement of the interaction effect for both allied and enemy agents. With the PF representation, a subgoal selector is designed to automatically generate multiple subgoals for each agent, drawn from the experience replay buffer that contains both individual and total PF values. Based on the determined subgoals, we define an intrinsic reward function to guide the agent to reach their respective subgoals while maximizing the joint action-value.

  abstract     = {Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) classification provides valuable auxiliary information for assisting disease diagnosis and has received much attention in research. The success of existing classification models relies on fitting the labeled samples for every ECG type. However, in practice, well-annotated ECG datasets usually cover only limited ECG types. It thus raises an issue: conventional classification models trained with limited ECG types can only identify those ECG types that have already been observed in the training set, but fail to recognize unseen (or unknown) ECG types that exist in the wild and are not included in training data. In this work, we investigate an important problem called open-world ECG classification that can predict fine-grained observed ECG classes and identify unseen classes. Accordingly, we propose a customized method that first incorporates clinical knowledge into contrastive learning by generating “hard negative” samples to guide learning diagnostic ECG features (i.e., distinguishable representations), and then performs multi-hypersphere learning to learn compact ECG representations for classification. The experiment results on 12-lead ECG datasets (CPSC2018, PTB-XL, and Georgia) demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our method achieves superior accuracy than the comparative methods on the unseen ECG class and certain seen classes. Overall, the investigated problem (i.e., open-world ECG classification) helps to draw attention to the reliability of automatic ECG diagnosis, and the proposed method is proven effective in tackling the challenges.

We successfully trained a light language model to learn these tasks and ran a number of experiments to investigate the extrapolation capabilities and internal information processing.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is crucial for efficient traffic management. It involves predicting vehicle movement patterns to reduce congestion and enhance traffic flow. However, the highly non-linear and complex patterns commonly observed in traffic flow pose significant challenges for this task. Current Graph Neural Network (GNN) models often construct shallow networks, which limits their ability to extract deeper spatio-temporal representations. Neural ordinary differential equations for traffic prediction address over-smoothing but require significant computational resources, leading to inefficiencies, and sometimes deeper networks may lead to poorer predictions for complex traffic information. In this study, we propose an Adaptive Decision spatio-temporal Neural Ordinary Differential Network, which can adaptively determine the number of layers of ODE according to the complexity of traffic information. It can solve the over-smoothing problem better, improving overall efficiency and prediction accuracy. In addition, traditional temporal convolution methods make it difficult to deal with complex and variable traffic time information with a large time span. Therefore, we introduce a multi-kernel temporal dynamic expansive convolution to handle the traffic time information. Multi-kernel temporal dynamic expansive convolution employs a dynamic dilation strategy, dynamically adjusting the network’s receptive field across levels, effectively capturing temporal dependencies, and can better adapt to the changing time data of traffic information. Additionally, multi-kernel temporal dynamic expansive convolution integrates multi-scale convolution kernels, enabling the model to learn features across diverse temporal scales. We evaluated our proposed method on several real-world traffic datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperformed state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called O ptimistic S equential S oft Actor Critic with M otivational C ommunication (OSSMC). The key idea of OSSMC is to utilize a greedy-driven approach to explore the potential value of individual policies, named optimistic Q-values, which serve as an upper bound for the Q-value of the current policy. We then integrate a sequential update mechanism with optimistic Q-value for agents, aiming to ensure monotonic improvement in the joint policy optimization process. Moreover, we establish motivational communication modules for each agent to disseminate motivational messages to promote cooperative behaviors. Finally, we employ a value regularization strategy from the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) method to maximize entropy and improve exploration capabilities. The performance of OSSMC was rigorously evaluated against a series of challenging benchmark sets. Empirical results demonstrate that OSSMC not only surpasses current baseline algorithms but also exhibits a more rapid convergence rate.},

  abstract     = {Recent successes in robot learning have significantly enhanced autonomous systems across a wide range of tasks. However, they are prone to generate similar or the same solutions, limiting the controllability of the robot to behave according to user intentions. These limited robot behaviors may lead to collisions and potential harm to humans. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a semi-autonomous teleoperation framework that enables users to operate a robot by selecting a high-level command, referred to as option . Our approach aims to provide effective and diverse options by a learned policy, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the proposed framework. In this work, we propose a quality-diversity (QD) based sampling method that simultaneously optimizes both the quality and diversity of options using reinforcement learning (RL). Additionally, we present a mixture of latent variable models to learn multiple policy distributions defined as options. In experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of the success rate and diversity of the options in simulation environments. We further demonstrate that our method outperforms manual keyboard control for time duration over cluttered real-world environments.},

  abstract     = {Self-supervised clustering has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to discover latent clustering structures without the need for external labels. However, most existing approaches on self-supervised clustering lack of inherent interpretability in the data clustering process. In this paper, we propose a differentiable self-supervised clustering method with intrinsic interpretability (DSC2I), which provides an interpretable data clustering mechanism by reformulating clustering process based on differentiable programming. To be specific, we first design a differentiable mutual information measurement to explicitly train a neural network with analytical gradients, which avoids variational inference and learns a discriminative and compact representation. Then, an interpretable clustering mechanism based on differentiable programming is devised to transform fundamental clustering process (i.e., minimum intra-cluster distance, maximum inter-cluster distance) into neural networks and convert cluster centers to learnable neural parameters, which allows us to obtain a transparent and interpretable clustering layer. Finally, a unified optimization method is designed, in which the differentiable representation learning and interpretable clustering can be optimized simultaneously in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSC2I method compared with 16 clustering approaches.},

  abstract     = {Compressed Sensing (CS) is a groundbreaking paradigm in image acquisition, challenging the constraints of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. This enables high-quality image reconstruction using a minimal number of measurements. Neural Networks’ potent feature induction capabilities enable advanced data-driven CS methods to achieve high-fidelity image reconstruction. However, achieving satisfactory reconstruction performance, particularly in terms of perceptual quality, remains challenging at extremely low sampling rates. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage image CS framework based on latent diffusion, named LD-CSNet. In the first stage, we utilize an autoencoder pre-trained on a large dataset to represent natural images as low-dimensional latent vectors, establishing prior knowledge distinct from sparsity and effectively reducing the dimensionality of the solution space. In the second stage, we employ a conditional diffusion model for maximum likelihood estimates in the latent space. This is supported by a measurement embedding module designed to encode measurements, making them suitable for a denoising network. This guides the generation process in reconstructing low-dimensional latent vectors. Finally, the image is reconstructed using a pre-trained decoder. Experimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate LD-CSNet’s superior perceptual quality and robustness to noise. It maintains fidelity and visual quality at lower sampling rates. Research findings suggest the promising application of diffusion models in image CS. Future research can focus on developing more appropriate models for the first stage.},

The spatial feature distribution based on feature path length is introduced for the first time. The results show that the bidirectional network has better significant differentiation. The rhythmic feature change trend and spatial characteristic distribution of this network can be used as a measure of the impact on global information processing in the brain after treatment. And localized brain regions variability in features and differences in the ability to interact with information between brain regions have potential as biomarkers for medication assessment in WEST syndrome.

This challenge arises from two main factors: the insufficient discriminability of ReID features and the predominant utilization of linear motion models in MOT. In this context, we introduce a novel motion-based tracker, MotionTrack, centered around a learnable motion predictor that relies solely on object trajectory information. This predictor comprehensively integrates two levels of granularity in motion features to enhance the modeling of temporal dynamics and facilitate precise future motion prediction for individual objects. Specifically, the proposed approach adopts a self-attention mechanism to capture token-level information and a Dynamic MLP layer to model channel-level features. MotionTrack is a simple, online tracking approach.

Nevertheless, a tricky reality is the frequent occurrence of missing bike flow, which hinders us from accurately understanding flow patterns. This study investigates an interesting task, i.e., Bike -sharing demand r ecovery ( Biker ). Biker is not a simple time-series imputation problem, rather, it confronts three concerns: observation uncertainty, complex dependencies, and environmental facts. To this end, we present a novel diffusion probabilistic solution with factual knowledge fusion, namely DBiker . Specifically, DBiker is the first attempt to extend the diffusion probabilistic models to the Biker task, along with a conditional Markov decision-making process. In contrast to existing probabilistic solutions, DBiker forecasts missing observations through progressive steps guided by an adaptive prior. Particularly, we introduce a Flow Conditioner with step embedding and a Factual Extractor to explore the complex dependencies and multiple environmental facts, respectively. Additionally, we devise a self-gated fusion layer that adaptively selects valuable knowledge to act as an adaptive prior, guiding the generation of missing observations. Finally, experiments conducted on three real-world bike systems demonstrate the superiority of DBiker against several baselines.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio management (PM) is a popular financial process that concerns the occasional reallocation of a particular quantity of capital into a portfolio of assets, with the main aim of maximizing profitability conditioned to a certain level of risk. Given the inherent dynamicity of stock exchanges and development for long-term performance, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominating solution for solving the problem of portfolio management in an automated and efficient manner. Nevertheless, the present RL-based PM methods just take into account the variations in prices of portfolio assets and the implications of price variations, while overlooking the significant relationships among different assets in the market, which are extremely valuable for managerial decisions. To close this gap, this paper introduces a novel deep model that combines two subnetworks; one to learn a temporal representation of historical prices using a refined temporal learner, while the other learns the relationships between different stocks in the market using a relation graph learner (RGL). Then, the above learners are integrated into the curriculum RL scheme for formulating the PM as a curriculum Markov Decision Process, in which an adaptive curriculum policy is presented to enable the agent to adaptively minimize risk value and maximize cumulative return. Proof-of-concept experiments are performed on data from three public stock indices (namely S&amp;P500, NYSE, and NASDAQ), and the results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework in improving the portfolio management performance over the competing RL solutions.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain few-shot Learning (CDFSL) is proposed to first pre-train deep models on a source domain dataset where sufficient data is available, and then generalize models to target domains to learn from only limited data. However, the gap between the source and target domains greatly hampers the generalization and target-domain few-shot finetuning. To address this problem, we analyze the domain gap from the aspect of frequency-domain analysis. We find the domain gap could be reflected by the compositions of source-domain spectra, and the lack of compositions in the source datasets limits the generalization. Therefore, we aim to expand the coverage of spectra composition in the source datasets to help the source domain cover a larger range of possible target-domain information, to mitigate the domain gap. To achieve this goal, we propose the Spectral Decomposition and Transformation (SDT) method, which first randomly decomposes the spectrogram of the source datasets into orthogonal bases, and then randomly samples different coordinates in the space formed by these bases. We integrate the above process into a data augmentation module, and further design a two-stream network to handle augmented images and original images respectively. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the CDFSL benchmark dataset.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal 3D object detection is instrumental in identifying and localizing objects within 3D space. It combines RGB images from cameras and point-clouds data from lidar sensors, serving as a fundamental technology for autonomous driving applications. Current methods commonly employ simplistic element-wise additions or multiplications to aggregate multi-modal features extracted from point-clouds and images. While these methods enhance detection accuracy, the utilization of basic operations presents challenges in effectively balancing the significance between modalities. This can potentially introduce noise and irrelevant information during the feature aggregation process. Additionally, the multi-level features extracted from images display imbalances in receptive fields. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose two innovative networks: a cross-modality balance network (CMN) and a cross-scale balance network (CSN). CMN incorporates cross-modality attention mechanisms and introduces an auxiliary 2D detection head to balance the significance of both modalities. Meanwhile, CSN leverages cross-scale attention mechanisms to mitigate the gap in receptive fields between different image levels. Additionally, we introduce a novel Local with Global Voxel Attention Encoder (LGVAE) designed to capture global semantics by extracting more comprehensive point-level information into voxel-level features. We perform comprehensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks: KITTI, Dense and nuScenes. The results consistently demonstrate improvements across multiple 3D object detection frameworks, affirming the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed method. Remarkably, our approach achieves a substantial absolute gain of 3.1% over the baseline MVXNet on the challenging Hard set of the Dense test set.},

Unlike conventional methods that employ simple and abrupt threshold processing, the proposed method introduces a reweighting mechanism to assign importance to the weights in DNNs. Compared to other ADMM-based methods, the new method not only achieves higher accuracy but also saves considerable time thanks to the reduced number of necessary hyperparameters.

Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in terms of compression ratios and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods. In particular, on the LeNet-5 model for the MNIST dataset, it achieves compression ratios of 355.9 × × with a slight improvement in accuracy; on the ResNet-50 model trained with the ImageNet dataset, it achieves compression ratios of 4.24 × × without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The increasing size of pre-trained language models has led to a growing interest in model compression. Pruning and distillation are the primary methods employed to compress these models. Existing pruning and distillation methods are effective in maintaining model accuracy and reducing its size. However, they come with limitations. For instance, pruning is often suboptimal and biased by transforming it into a continuous optimization problem. Distillation relies primarily on one-to-one layer mappings for knowledge transfer, which leads to underutilization of the rich knowledge in teacher. Therefore, we propose a method of joint pruning and distillation for automatic pruning of pre-trained language models. Specifically, we first propose Gradient Progressive Pruning (GPP), which achieves a smooth transition of indicator vector values from real to binary by progressively converging the values of unimportant units’ indicator vectors to zero before the end of the search phase. This effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional pruning methods while supporting compression with higher sparsity. In addition, we propose the Dual Feature Distillation (DFD). DFD adaptively globally fuses teacher features and locally fuses student features, and then uses the dual features of global teacher features and local student features for knowledge distillation. This realizes a “preview-review” mechanism that can better extract useful information from multi-level teacher information and transfer it to student. Comparative experiments on the GLUE benchmark dataset and ablation experiments indicate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {As an effective strategy for reducing the noisy and redundant information for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), hyperspectral band selection intends to select a subset of original hyperspectral bands, which boosts the subsequent different tasks. In this paper, we introduce a multi-dimensional high-order structure preserved clustering method for hyperspectral band selection, referred to as MHSPC briefly. By regarding original hyperspectral images as a tensor cube, we apply the tensor CP (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) decomposition on it to exploit the multi-dimensional structural information as well as generate a low-dimensional latent feature representation. In order to capture the local geometrical structure along the spectral dimension, a graph regularizer is imposed on the new feature representation in the lower dimensional space. In addition, since the low rankness of HSIs is an important global property, we utilize a nuclear norm constraint on the latent feature representation matrix to capture the global data structure information. Different to most of previous clustering based hyperspectral band selection methods which vectorize each band as a vector without considering the 2-D spatial information, the proposed MHSPC can effectively capture the spatial structure as well as the spectral correlation of original hyperspectral cube in both local and global perspectives. An efficient alternatively updating algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee is designed to solve the resultant optimization problem, and extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed MHSPC over other state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {This research delves into the reachable set estimation (RSE) problem for general switched delayed neural networks (SDNNs) in the discrete-time context. Note that existing relevant research on SDNNs predominantly relies on either time-dependent or state-dependent switching approaches. The time-dependent versions necessitate the stability of each subnetwork beforehand, whereas the state-dependent switching strategies solely depend on the current state, thus disregarding the historical information of the neuron states. For fully harnessing the historical information pertaining to neuron states, a delicate combined switching strategy (CSS) is formulated with the explicit goal of furnishing a relaxed and less conservative design framework tailored for discrete-time SDNNs, where all subnetworks can also be unstable. By resorting to the established time-dependent multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (TDMLF) technique, the improved criteria are subsequently presented, ensuring that the reachable set encompassing all potential states of SDNNs is confined to an anticipated bounded set. Ultimately, the practicality and superiority of the presented RSE approach are thoroughly validated by two illustrative simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Recently considerable advances have been achieved in the incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) research. However, the current IMC works are often faced with three challenging issues. First, they mostly lack the ability to recover the nonlinear subspace structures in the multiple kernel spaces. Second, they usually neglect the high-order relationship in multiple representations. Third, they often have two or even more hyper-parameters and may not be practical for some real-world applications. To tackle these issues, we present a Tensorized Incomplete Multi-view Kernel Subspace Clustering (TIMKSC) approach. Specifically, by incorporating the kernel learning technique into an incomplete subspace clustering framework, our approach can robustly explore the latent subspace structure hidden in multiple views. Furthermore, we impute the incomplete kernel matrices and learn the low-rank tensor representations in a mutual enhancement manner. Notably, our approach can discover the underlying relationship among the observed and missing samples while capturing the high-order correlation to assist subspace clustering. To solve the proposed optimization model, we design a three-step algorithm to efficiently minimize the unified objective function, which only involves one hyper-parameter that requires tuning. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

It is a multi-task learning architecture based on a fully shared neural network and an augmented input vector containing trainable task parameters. The architecture is interesting due to its powerful task adaption mechanism, which facilitates a low-dimensional task parameter space. Theoretically, we show that a scalar task parameter is sufficient for universal approximation of all tasks, which is not necessarily the case for more common architectures. Empirically it is shown that, for homogeneous tasks, the dimension of the task parameter may vary with the complexity of the tasks, but a small task parameter space is generally viable. The task parameter space is found to be well-behaved, which simplifies workflows related to updating models as new data arrives, and learning new tasks with the shared parameters are frozen. Additionally, the architecture displays robustness towards datasets where tasks have few data points. The architecture’s performance is compared to similar neural network architectures on ten datasets, with competitive results.},

Because of the virus’s unknown mutations and the vaccine’s waning potency, forecasting is still essential for resurgence prevention and medical resource management. Computational efficiency and long-term accuracy are two bottlenecks for national-level forecasting. This study develops a novel multivariate time series forecasting model, the densely connected highly flexible dendritic neuron model (DFDNM) to predict daily and weekly positive COVID-19 cases. DFDNM’s high flexibility mechanism improves its capacity to deal with nonlinear challenges. The dense introduction of shortcut connections alleviates the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, encourages feature reuse, and improves feature extraction. To deal with the rapidly growing parameters, an improved variation of the adaptive moment estimation (AdamW) algorithm is employed as the learning algorithm for the DFDNM because of its strong optimization ability. The experimental results and statistical analysis conducted across three Japanese prefectures confirm the efficacy and feasibility of the DFDNM while outperforming various state-of-the-art machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed DFDNM is the first to restructure the dendritic neuron model’s neural architecture, demonstrating promising use in multivariate time series prediction. Because of its optimal performance, the DFDNM may serve as an important reference for national and regional government decision-makers aiming to optimize pandemic prevention and medical resource management. We also verify that DFDMN is efficiently applicable not only to COVID-19 transmission prediction, but also to more general multivariate prediction tasks. It leads us to believe that it might be applied as a promising prediction model in other fields.},

  abstract     = {As two alternative options in a forced choice task are separated by design, two classes of computational models of decision-making have thrived independently in the literature for nearly five decades. While sequential sampling models (SSM) focus on response times and keypresses in binary decisions in experimental paradigms, dynamic neural fields (DNF) focus on continuous sensorimotor dimensions and tasks found in perception and robotics. Recent attempts have been made to address limitations in their application to other domains, but strong similarities and compatibility between prominent models from both classes were hardly considered. This article is an attempt at bridging the gap between these classes of models, and simultaneously between disciplines and paradigms relying on binary or continuous responses. A unifying formulation of representative SSM and DNF equations is proposed, varying the number of units which interact and compete to reach a decision. The embodiment of decisions is also considered by coupling cognitive and sensorimotor processes, enabling the model to generate decision trajectories at trial level. The resulting mechanistic model is therefore able to target different paradigms (forced choices or continuous response scales) and measures (final responses or dynamics). The validity of the model is assessed statistically by fitting empirical distributions obtained from human participants in moral decision-making mouse-tracking tasks, for which both dichotomous and nuanced responses are meaningful. Comparing equations at the theoretical level, and model parametrizations at the empirical level, the implications for psychological decision-making processes, as well as the fundamental assumptions and limitations of models and paradigms are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Human pose estimation typically encompasses three categories: heatmap-, regression-, and integral-based methods. While integral-based methods possess advantages such as end-to-end learning, full-convolution learning, and being free from quantization errors, they have garnered comparatively less attention due to inferior performance. In this paper, we revisit integral-based approaches for human pose estimation and propose a novel implicit heatmap learning framework. The framework learns the true distribution of keypoints from the perspective of maximum likelihood estimation, aiming to mitigate inherent ambiguity in shape and variance associated with implicit heatmaps. Specifically, Simple Implicit Heatmap Normalization (SIHN) is first introduced to calculate implicit heatmaps as an efficient and effective representation for keypoint localization, which replaces the vanilla softmax normalization method. As implicit heatmaps may introduce potential challenges related to variance and shape ambiguity arising from the inherent nature of implicit heatmaps, we thus propose a Differentiable Spatial-to-Distributive Transform (DSDT) method to aptly map those implicit heatmaps onto the transformation coefficients of a deformed distribution. The deformed distribution is predicted by a likelihood-based generative model to unravel the shape ambiguity quandary effectively, and the transformation coefficients are learned by a regression model to resolve the variance ambiguity issue. Additionally, to expedite the acquisition of precise shape representations throughout the training process, we introduce a Wasserstein Distance-based Constraint (WDC) to ensure stable and reasonable supervision during the initial generation of implicit heatmaps. Experimental results on both the MSCOCO and MPII datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive performance against heatmap-based approaches while maintaining the advantages of integral-based approaches.

  abstract     = {Community detection in multi-layer networks stands as a prominent subject within network analysis research. However, the majority of existing techniques for identifying communities encounter two primary constraints: they lack suitability for high-dimensional data within multi-layer networks and fail to fully leverage additional auxiliary information among communities to enhance detection accuracy. To address these limitations, a novel approach named weighted prior tensor training decomposition (WPTTD) is proposed for multi-layer network community detection. Specifically, the WPTTD method harnesses the tensor feature optimization techniques to effectively manage high-dimensional data in multi-layer networks. Additionally, it employs a weighted flattened network to construct prior information for each dimension of the multi-layer network, thereby continuously exploring inter-community connections. To preserve the cohesive structure of communities and to harness comprehensive information within the multi-layer network for more effective community detection, the common community manifold learning (CCML) is integrated into the WPTTD framework for enhancing the performance. Experimental evaluations conducted on both artificial and real-world networks have verified that this algorithm outperforms several mainstream multi-layer network community detection algorithms.},

To accommodate this issue, we propose Probability Graph Complementation Contrastive Learning (PGCCL) which adaptively constructs the complementation graph. We employ Beta Mixture Model (BMM) to distinguish intra-class similarity and inter-class similarity. Based on the posterior probability, we construct Probability Complementation Graphs to form contrastive views. The contrastive learning prompts the model to preserve complementary information for each node from different views. By combining original graph embedding and complementary graph embedding, the final embedding is able to capture rich semantics in the finetuning stage. At last, comprehensive experimental results on 20 datasets including homophilic and heterophilic graphs firmly verify the effectiveness of our algorithm as well as the quality of probability complementation graph compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper proposes a method called Mining Core Information by Evaluating Semantic Importance (MCIESI) for Unpaired Image Captioning, which is a method for image captioning using unpaired images and sentences. The main difference from the existing methods is that MCIESI focuses on mining the information that should be described in the image and embodies them in the generated natural language that conforms to human thinking. To achieve this goal, we use scene graphs to represent the semantics of images and evaluates the importance of objects and interaction relationships to mine core information in images, which are then encouraged to be embodied in generated sentences through semantic constraint. Combined with grammatical constraint using adversarial training with real sentence corpus and relative constraint using a triplet loss, the generator is trained to generate semantically plausible and grammatically correct sentences. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of MCIESI.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) as the emerging neural networks have shown great success in Prognostics and Health Management because they can not only extract node features but can also mine relationship between nodes in the graph data. However, the most existing GCNs-based methods are still limited by graph quality, variable working conditions, and limited data, making them difficult to obtain remarkable performance. Therefore, it is proposed in this paper a two stage importance-aware subgraph convolutional network based on multi-source sensors named I 2 SGCN I2SGCN to address the above-mentioned limitations. In the real-world scenarios, it is found that the diagnostic performance of the most existing GCNs is commonly bounded by the graph quality because it is hard to get high quality through a single sensor. Therefore, we leveraged multi-source sensors to construct graphs that contain more fault-based information of mechanical equipment. Then, we discovered that unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods only use single stage to achieve cross-domain fault diagnosis and ignore more refined feature extraction, which can make the representations contained in the features inadequate. Hence, it is proposed the two-stage fault diagnosis in the whole framework to achieve UDA. In the first stage, the multiple-instance learning is adopted to obtain the importance factor of each sensor towards preliminary fault diagnosis. In the second stage, it is proposed I 2 SGCN I2SGCN to achieve refined cross-domain fault diagnosis. Moreover, we observed that deficient and limited data may cause label bias and biased training, leading to reduced generalization capacity of the proposed method. Therefore, we constructed the feature-based graph and importance-based graph to jointly mine more effective relationship and then presented a subgraph learning strategy, which not only enriches sufficient and complementary features but also regularizes the training. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method for cross-domain fault diagnosis, which outperforms the state-of-the art methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which learns node or graph representation from supervision signals derived from the graph data itself, has recently attracted extensive research attention and achieved great success. Remarkably, most of the existing GCL encoders essentially perform low-frequency filtering on graph, which however limits their expressive power on heterophilous graphs where dissimilar nodes tend to be connected. This raises an interesting question: can high frequency be informative for GCL? In this work, we experimentally study the influence of high-frequency signals on GCL and find that adding some high-frequency signals in contrasting is beneficial for improving GCL performance. That motivates us to design a more general GCL framework beyond low-pass filtering, which simultaneously performs low-pass and high-pass signal contrasts, so as to capture both low and high-frequency information in general graphs. Furthermore, to enable the representation learning to be aware of neighbor diversity in heterophilic graphs, we propose a novel graph contrastive loss, termed Adap-infoNCE, which can automatically decide the weights of negative samples based on feature representations of neighboring nodes. Here two types of neighbors are considered, i.e., spatial neighbors and featural neighbors, whose effectiveness is verified using empirical study on synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method brings significant and consistent improvements over the base GCL approach and exceeds multiple state-of-the-art results on several unsupervised benchmarks, even surpassing the performance of supervised benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) enable effective modeling of knowledge dynamics and event evolution, facilitating deeper insights and analysis into temporal information. Recently, extrapolation of TKG reasoning has attracted great significance due to its remarkable ability to capture historical correlations and predict future events. Existing studies of extrapolation aim mainly at encoding the structural and temporal semantics based on snapshot sequences, which contain graph aggregators for the association within snapshots and recurrent units for the evolution. However, these methods are limited to modeling long-distance history, as they primarily focus on capturing temporal correlations over shorter periods. Besides, a few approaches rely on compiling historical repetitive statistics of TKGs for predicting future facts. But they often overlook explicit interactions in the graph structure among concurrent events. To address these issues, we propose a P otentia L concurr E nt A ggregation and contra S tive learn ING (PLEASING) method for TKG extrapolation. PLEASING is a two-step reasoning framework that effectively leverages the historical and potential features of TKGs. It includes two encoders for historical and global events with an adaptive gated mechanism, acquiring predictions with appropriate weight of the two aspects. Specifically, PLEASING constructs two auxiliary graphs to capture temporal interaction among timestamps and correlations among potential concurrent events, respectively, enabling a holistic investigation of temporal characteristics and future potential possibilities in TKGs. Furthermore, PLEASING incorporates contrastive learning to strengthen its capacity to identify whether queries are related to history. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performances of PLEASING and its comprehensive ability to model TKG semantics.},

  abstract     = {Accurate image reconstruction is crucial for photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct PA images with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground truth labels. However, practical implementations encounter inevitable trade-offs between cost and performance due to the expensive nature of employing additional channels for accessing more measurements. Here, we propose a masked cross-domain self-supervised (CDSS) reconstruction strategy to overcome the lack of ground truth labels from limited PA measurements. We implement the self-supervised reconstruction in a model-based form. Simultaneously, we take advantage of self-supervision to enforce the consistency of measurements and images across three partitions of the measured PA data, achieved by randomly masking different channels. Our findings indicate that dynamically masking a substantial proportion of channels, such as 80%, yields meaningful self-supervisors in both the image and signal domains. Consequently, this approach reduces the multiplicity of pseudo solutions and enables efficient image reconstruction using fewer PA measurements, ultimately minimizing reconstruction error. Experimental results on in-vivo PACT dataset of mice demonstrate the potential of our self-supervised framework. Moreover, our method exhibits impressive performance, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.87 in an extreme sparse case utilizing only 13 channels, which outperforms the performance of the supervised scheme with 16 channels (0.77 SSIM). Adding to its advantages, our method can be deployed on different trainable models in an end-to-end manner, further enhancing its versatility and applicability.},

  abstract     = {Shuffling-type gradient method is a popular machine learning algorithm that solves finite-sum optimization problems by randomly shuffling samples during iterations. In this paper, we explore the convergence properties of shuffling-type gradient method under mild assumptions. Specifically, we employ the bandwidth-based step size strategy that covers both monotonic and non-monotonic step sizes, thereby providing a unified convergence guarantee in terms of step size. Additionally, we replace the lower bound assumption of the objective function with that of the loss function, thereby eliminating the restrictions on the variance and the second-order moment of stochastic gradient that are difficult to verify in practice. For non-convex objectives, we recover the last iteration convergence of shuffling-type gradient algorithm with a less cumbersome proof. Meanwhile, we also establish the convergence rate for the minimum iteration of gradient norms. Under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we prove that the function value of last iteration converges to the lower bound of the objective function. By selecting appropriate boundary functions, we further improve the previous sublinear convergence rate results. Overall, this paper contributes to the understanding of shuffling-type gradient method and its convergence properties, providing insights for optimizing finite-sum problems in machine learning.

However, based on a case study, our investigation reveals that the teacher model exhibits over-confidence in unseen new samples. In this article, we conduct empirical experiments and provide theoretical analysis to investigate the over-confident phenomenon and the impact of KD in exemplar-free CIL, where access to old samples is unavailable. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel approach, Learning with Humbler Teacher, by systematically selecting an appropriate checkpoint model as a humbler teacher to mitigate CF.

However, existing embedding methods are often optimization-based, with the embedding dimension determined in a heuristic or ad hoc way, which can cause potential bias in downstream statistical inference. Additionally, existing deep embedding methods can suffer from a nonidentifiability issue due to the universal approximation power of deep neural networks. We address these issues within a rigorous statistical framework. We treat the embedding vectors as missing data, reconstruct the network features using a sparse decoder, and simultaneously impute the embedding vectors and train the sparse decoder using an adaptive stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Under mild conditions, we show that the sparse decoder provides a parsimonious mapping from the embedding space to network features, enabling effective selection of the embedding dimension and overcoming the nonidentifiability issue encountered by existing deep embedding methods. Furthermore, we show that the embedding vectors converge weakly to a desired posterior distribution in the 2-Wasserstein distance, addressing the potential bias issue experienced by existing embedding methods.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method combining structural prior-driven feature extraction with gradient-momentum (SPGM), from the perspectives of consistent feature learning and precise parameter updates, to enhance the accuracy and stability of image classification. Specifically, SPGM leverages a structural prior-driven feature extraction (SPFE) approach to calculate gradients of multi-level features and original images to construct structural information, which is then transformed into prior knowledge to drive the network to learn features consistent with the original images. Additionally, an optimization strategy integrating gradients and momentum (GMO) is introduced, dynamically adjusting the direction and step size of parameter updates based on the angle and norm of the sum of gradients and momentum, enabling precise model parameter updates. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets demonstrate that the SPGM method significantly reduces the top-1 error rate in image classification, enhances the classification performance, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Establishing the relationships among hierarchical visual attributes of objects in the visual world is crucial for human cognition. The classic convolution neural network (CNN) can successfully extract hierarchical features but ignore the relationships among features, resulting in shortcomings compared to humans in areas like interpretability and domain generalization. Recently, algorithms have introduced feature relationships by external prior knowledge and special auxiliary modules, which have been proven to bring multiple improvements in many computer vision tasks. However, prior knowledge is often difficult to obtain, and auxiliary modules bring additional consumption of computing and storage resources, which limits the flexibility and practicality of the algorithm. In this paper, we aim to drive the CNN model to learn the relationships among hierarchical deep features without prior knowledge and consumption increasing, while enhancing the fundamental performance of some aspects. Firstly, the task of learning the relationships among hierarchical features in CNN is defined and three key problems related to this task are pointed out, including the quantitative metric of connection intensity, the threshold of useless connections, and the updating strategy of relation graph. Secondly, Relational Embedding Convolution (RE-Conv) layer is proposed for the representation of feature relationships in convolution layer, followed by a scheme called use &amp; disuse strategy which aims to address the three problems of feature relation learning. Finally, the improvements brought by the proposed feature relation learning scheme have been demonstrated through numerous experiments, including interpretability, domain generalization, noise robustness, and inference efficiency. In particular, the proposed scheme outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in the domain generalization community and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods for further improvement. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable precision to the original CNN model while reducing floating point operations (FLOPs) by approximately 50%.},

It is well-known in the information theory community that most autoencoders coding processes are inevitably accompanied by a certain loss of information. In this dual ForkNet, we focus on mitigating the information loss problem and propose a novel architectural recalibration approach, which we term the “Informetrics Recalibration” (IR). It can adaptively recalibrate latent feature representation by explicitly modeling the similarity between the corresponding feature maps of encoder and decoder, and retain more useful semantic information to generate greater differentiation between normal and abnormal events. Additionally, because the structure of the autoencoder itself determines the difficulty to obtain deep semantic information, we introduce a Secondary Encoder (SE) in each ForkNet, so as to recalibrate target features responses of latent feature representation. Our model is easy to be trained and robust to be applied, because it basically consists of some ResNet blocks without using complicated modules.

Subsequently, a predictor utilizes this continuous latent representation as input and outputs an estimated performance for the given architecture. The latent representation is then optimized through gradient descent within the continuous latent space based on the predicted performance. The optimized latent representation is finally mapped back to a discrete architecture via the decoder. To enhance the quality of the latent representation, we pre-train the encoder on a substantial dataset of circuit architectures using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL).

However, most existing methods lack a reasonable strategy to explore the discriminative semantics of multi-scale ICH regions, making it difficult to address the challenge of complex morphology in clinical data. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale object equalization learning network (MOEL-Net) for accurate ICH region segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a shallow feature extraction module (SFEM) for obtaining shallow semantic representations to maintain sufficient and effective detailed location information. Then, a deep feature extraction module (DFEM) is leveraged to extract the deep semantic information of the ICH region from the combination of SFEM and original image features. To further achieve equalization learning in different scales of ICH regions, we introduce a multi-level semantic feature equalization fusion module (MSFEFM), which explores the equalized fusion features of the described objects with the assistance of shallow and deep semantic information provided by SFEM and DFEM. Driven by the above three designs, MOEL-Net shows a solid capacity to capture more discriminative features in various ICH region segmentation. To promote the research of clinical automatic ICH region segmentation, we collect two datasets, VMICH and FRICH (divided into Test A and Test B) for evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the Dice scores of 88.28%, 90.92%, and 90.95% on the VMICH, FRICH Test A, and Test B, respectively, which outperform fourteen competing methods.},

What we possess are numerous isolated filed-specific datasets, thus, it is appealing to jointly pretrain models across aggregation of datasets to enhance data volume and diversity. In this paper, we propose a strong framework for utilizing M ultiple datasets to pretrain D ETR -like detectors, termed METR , without the need for manual label spaces integration. It converts the typical multi-classification in object detection into binary classification by introducing a pre-trained language model. Specifically, we design a category extraction module for extracting potential categories involved in an image and assign these categories into different queries by language embeddings. Each query is only responsible for predicting a class-specific object. Besides, to adapt our novel detection paradigm, we propose a Class-wise Bipartite Matching strategy that limits the ground truths to match queries assigned to the same category. Extensive experiments demonstrate that METR achieves extraordinary results on either multi-task joint training or the pretrain &amp; finetune paradigm. Notably, our pre-trained models have high flexible transferability and increase the performance upon various DETR-like detectors on COCO val2017 benchmark.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new unlabeled dataset (target). Despite the impressive performance, existing approaches have largely focused on image-based UDA only, and video-based UDA has been relatively understudied and received less attention due to the difficulty of adapting diverse modal video features and modeling temporal associations efficiently. To address this, existing studies use optical flow to capture motion cues between in-domain consecutive frames, but is limited by heavy compute requirements and modeling flow patterns across diverse domains is equally challenging. In this work, we propose an adversarial domain adaptation approach for video semantic segmentation that aims to align temporally associated pixels in successive source and target domain frames without relying on optical flow. Specifically, we introduce a Perceptual Consistency Matching (PCM) strategy that leverages perceptual similarity to identify pixels with high correlation across consecutive frames, and infer that such pixels should correspond to the same class. Therefore, we can enhance prediction accuracy for video-UDA by enforcing consistency not only between in-domain frames, but across domains using PCM objectives during model training. Extensive experiments on public datasets show the benefit of our approach over existing state-of-the-art UDA methods. Our approach not only addresses a crucial task in video domain adaptation but also offers notable improvements in performance with faster inference times.},

However, existing FDMC methods suffer from the interference of view-specific information for fusion representation, affecting the learning of discriminative cluster structure. In this paper, we propose a new framework of Progressive Neighbor-masked Contrastive Learning for FDMC (PNCL-FDMC) to tackle the aforementioned issues. Specifically, by using neighbor-masked contrastive learning, PNCL-FDMC can explicitly maintain the local structure during the embedding aggregation, which is beneficial to the common semantics enhancement on the fusion view. Based on the consistent aggregation, the fusion view is further enhanced by diversity-aware cluster structure enhancement. In this process, the enhanced cluster assignments and cluster discrepancies are employed to guide the weighted neighbor-masked contrastive alignment of semantic structure between individual views and the fusion view. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, revealing its ability in discriminative representation learning and improving clustering performance.},

  abstract     = {There are primarily two classes of bio-inspired looming perception visual systems. The first class employs hierarchical neural networks inspired by well-acknowledged anatomical pathways responsible for looming perception, and the second maps nonlinear relationships between physical stimulus attributes and neuronal activity. However, even with multi-layered structures, the former class is sometimes fragile in looming selectivity, i.e. , the ability to well discriminate between approaching and other categories of movements. While the latter class leaves qualms regarding how to encode visual movements to indicate physical attributes like angular velocity/size. Beyond those, we propose a novel looming perception model based on dynamic neural field (DNF). The DNF is a brain-inspired framework that incorporates both lateral excitation and inhibition within the field through instant feedback, it could be an easily-built model to fulfill the looming sensitivity observed in biological visual systems. To achieve our target of looming perception with computational efficiency, we introduce a single-field DNF with adaptive lateral interactions and dynamic activation threshold. The former mechanism creates antagonism to translating motion, and the latter suppresses excitation during receding. Accordingly, the proposed model exhibits the strongest response to moving objects signaling approaching over other types of external stimuli. The effectiveness of the proposed model is supported by relevant mathematical analysis and ablation study. The computational efficiency and robustness of the model are verified through systematic experiments including on-line collision-detection tasks in micro-mobile robots, at success rate of 93% compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate its superiority over the model-based methods concerning looming perception.},

The surrogate gradient (SG) algorithm has recently enabled spiking neural networks to shine in neuromorphic hardware. However, introducing surrogate gradients has caused SNNs to lose their original sparsity, thus leading to the potential performance loss. In this paper, we first analyze the current problem of direct training using SGs and then propose Masked Surrogate Gradients (MSGs) to balance the effectiveness of training and the sparseness of the gradient, thereby improving the generalization ability of SNNs. Moreover, we introduce a temporally weighted output (TWO) method to decode the network output, reinforcing the importance of correct timesteps.

  abstract     = {The non-stationarity of EEG signals results in variability across sessions, impeding model building and data sharing. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method called GPL, which simultaneously considers global knowledge and prototype-based local class information to enhance the classification accuracy of motor imagery signals. Depending on the amount of labeled data available in the target domain, the method is implemented in both unsupervised and semi-supervised versions. Specifically, at the global level, we employ the maximum mean difference (MMD) loss to globally constrain the feature space, achieving comprehensive alignment. In the context of class-level operations, we propose two memory banks designed to accommodate class prototypes in each domain and constrain feature embeddings by applying two prototype-based contrastive losses. The source contrastive loss is used to organize source features spatially based on categories, thereby reconciling inter-class and intra-class relationships, while the interactive contrastive loss is employed to facilitate cross-domain information interaction. Simultaneously, in unsupervised scenarios, to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive pseudo-labels, we introduce an entropy-aware strategy that dynamically evaluates the confidence level of target data and personalized constraints on the participation of interactive contrastive loss. To validate our approach, extensive experiments were conducted on a highly regarded public EEG dataset, namely Dataset IIa of the BCI Competition IV, as well as a large-scale EEG dataset called GigaDB. The experiments yielded average classification accuracies of 86.03% and 84.22% respectively. These results demonstrate that our method is an effective EEG decoding model, conducive to advancing the development of motor imagery brain–computer interfaces.

Some prior works, such as heuristic methods, attempted to search for suitable sparse structures during the pruning process, which may be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, an efficient cross-layer importance evaluation (CIE) method is proposed to automatically calculate proportional relationships among convolutional layers. Firstly, every layer is pruned separately by grid sampling way to obtain the accuracy of the model for all sampling points. And then, contribution matrices are built to describe the importance of each layer to model accuracy. Finally, the binary search algorithm is used to search the optimal sparse structure under a target pruned value. Extensive experiments on multiple representative image classification tasks demonstrate that proposed method acquires better compression performance under a little time cost compared to existing pruning algorithms. For instance, it reduces more than 50% FLOPs with only a small loss of 0.93% and 0.43% in the top-1 and top-5 accuracy for ResNet50, respectively. At the cost of only 0.24% accuracy loss, the pruned VGG19 model parameters are successfully compressed by 27.23 × × and the throughput has increased by 2.46 × × . On the whole, CIE has an excellent effect on the deployment and application of the CNNs model in edge device in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

We introduce an evaluation protocol for Continual Pre-Training which monitors forgetting against a Forgetting Control dataset not present in the continual stream. We disentangle the impact on forgetting of 3 main factors: the input modality (NLP, Vision), the architecture type (Transformer, ResNet) and the pre-training protocol (supervised, self-supervised). Moreover, we propose a Sample-Efficient Pre-training method (SEP) that speeds up the pre-training phase. We show that the pre-training protocol is the most important factor accounting for forgetting. Surprisingly, we discovered that self-supervised continual pre-training in both NLP and Vision is sufficient to mitigate forgetting without the use of any Continual Learning strategy.

Most methods aim to utilize single-domain and cross-domain information as much as possible for personalized preference extraction and effective integration. However, on one hand, most models ignore that cross-domain information is composed of multiple single-domains when generating representations. They still treat cross-domain information the same way as single-domain information, resulting in noisy representation generation. Only by imposing certain constraints on cross-domain information during representation generation can subsequent models minimize interference when considering user preferences. On the other hand, some methods neglect the joint consideration of users’ long-term and short-term preferences and reduce the weight of cross-domain user preferences to minimize noise interference. To better consider the mutual promotion of cross-domain and single-domains factors, we propose a novel model ( C 2 D R E I F C2DREIF ) that utilizes Gaussian graph encoders to handle information, effectively constraining the correlation of information and capturing useful contextual information more accurately. It also employs a Top-down transformer to accurately extract user intents within each domain, taking into account the user’s long-term and short-term preferences. Additionally, entropy regularized is applied to enhance contrastive learning and mitigate the impact of randomness caused by negative sample composition.},

  abstract     = {Class incremental learning is committed to solving representation learning and classification assignments while avoiding catastrophic forgetting in scenarios where categories are increasing. In this work, a unified method named Balanced Embedding Discrimination Maximization (BEDM) is developed to make the intermediate embedding more distinctive. Specifically, we utilize an orthogonality constraint based on doubly-blocked Toeplitz matrix to minimize the correlation of convolution kernels, and an algorithm for similarity visualization is introduced. Furthermore, uneven samples and distribution shift among old and new tasks eventuate strongly biased classifiers. To mitigate the imbalance, we propose an adaptive balance weighting in softmax to compensate insufficient categories dynamically. In addition, hybrid embedding learning is introduced to preserve knowledge from old models, which involves less hyper-parameters than conventional knowledge distillation. Our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches on three mainstream benchmark datasets. Moreover, we technically visualize that our method can produce a more uniform similarity histogram and more stable spectrum. Grad-CAM and t-SNE visualizations further confirm its effectiveness.

This new class is characterized by the readouts with a certain integral representation built on infinite-dimensional state–space systems. It is shown that this class is very rich and possesses useful features and universal approximation properties. The reservoir architectures used for the approximation and estimation of elements in the new class are randomly generated echo state networks with either linear or ReLU activation functions. Their readouts are built using randomly generated neural networks in which only the output layer is trained (extreme learning machines or random feature neural networks). The results in the paper yield a recurrent neural network-based learning algorithm with provable convergence guarantees that do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality when learning input/output systems in the class of generalized Barron functionals and measuring the error in a mean-squared sense.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) aim to suggest next item for a user based on her historical interaction sequences. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to attenuate the influence of noisy items in sequences by either assigning them with lower attention weights or discarding them directly. The major limitation of these methods is that the former would still prone to overfit noisy items while the latter may overlook informative items. To the end, in this paper, we propose a novel model named M ulti-level S equence D enoising with C ross-signal C ontrastive L earning (MSDCCL) for sequential recommendation. To be specific, we first introduce a target-aware user interest extractor to simultaneously capture users’ long and short term interest with the guidance of target items. Then, we develop a multi-level sequence denoising module to alleviate the impact of noisy items by employing both soft and hard signal denoising strategies. Additionally, we extend existing curriculum learning by simulating the learning pattern of human beings. It is worth noting that our proposed model can be seamlessly integrated with a majority of existing recommendation models and significantly boost their effectiveness. Experimental studies on five public datasets are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed MSDCCL is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines.

Through mining feature information of MMKGs, entities are aligned to tackle the issue that an MMKG is incapable of effective integration. The recent attempt at neighbors and attribute fusion mainly focuses on aggregating multi-modal attributes, neglecting the structure effect with multi-modal attributes for entity alignment. This paper proposes an innovative approach, namely TriFac , to exploit embedding refinement for factorizing the original multi-modal knowledge graphs through a two-stage MMKG factorization.

  abstract     = {Multi-modal attention mechanisms have been successfully used in multi-modal graph learning for various tasks. However, existing attention-based multi-modal graph learning (AMGL) architectures heavily rely on manual design, requiring huge effort and expert experience. Meanwhile, graph neural architecture search (GNAS) has made great progress toward automatically designing graph-based learning architectures. However, it is challenging to directly adopt existing GNAS methods to search for better AMGL architectures because of the search spaces that only focus on designing graph neural network architectures and the search objective that ignores multi-modal interactive information between modalities and long-term content dependencies within different modalities. To address these issues, we propose an automated attention-based multi-modal graph learning architecture search (AutoAMS) framework, which can automatically design the optimal AMGL architectures for different multi-modal tasks. Specifically, we design an effective attention-based multi-modal (AM) search space consisting of four sub-spaces, which can jointly support the automatic search of multi-modal attention representation and other components of multi-modal graph learning architecture. In addition, a novel search objective based on an unsupervised multi-modal reconstruction loss and task-specific loss is introduced to search and train AMGL architectures. The search objective can extract the global features and capture multi-modal interactions from multiple modalities. The experimental results on multi-modal tasks show strong evidence that AutoAMS is capable of designing high-performance AMGL architectures.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to monitor students’ evolving knowledge states through their learning interactions with concept-related questions, and can be indirectly evaluated by predicting how students will perform on future questions. In this paper, we observe that there is a common phenomenon of answer bias, i.e., a highly unbalanced distribution of correct and incorrect answers for each question. Existing models tend to memorize the answer bias as a shortcut for achieving high prediction performance in KT, thereby failing to fully understand students’ knowledge states. To address this issue, we approach the KT task from a causality perspective. A causal graph of KT is first established, from which we identify that the impact of answer bias lies in the direct causal effect of questions on students’ responses. A novel COunterfactual REasoning (CORE) framework for KT is further proposed, which separately captures the total causal effect and direct causal effect during training, and mitigates answer bias by subtracting the latter from the former in testing. The CORE framework is applicable to various existing KT models, and we implement it based on the prevailing DKT, DKVMN, and AKT models, respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE in making the debiased inference for KT. We have released our code at https://github.com/lucky7-code/CORE .},

Our research is based on the hypothesis that an SNN that implements the Hebbian learning paradigm is capable of becoming specialized in the detection of statistically significant word patterns in the presence of adequately tailored sequential input. To support this hypothesis, we propose a novel spiking topic model (STM) that transforms text into a sequence of spikes and uses that sequence to train single-layer SNNs. In STM, each SNN neuron represents one topic, and each of the neuron’s weights corresponds to one word. STM synaptic connections are modified according to spike-timing-dependent plasticity; after training, the neurons’ strongest weights are interpreted as the words that represent topics. We compare the performance of STM with four other TM methods Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Biterm Topic Model (BTM), Embedding Topic Model (ETM) and BERTopic on three datasets: 20Newsgroups , BBC news , and AG news . The results demonstrate that STM can discover high-quality topics and successfully compete with comparative classical methods. This sheds new light on the possibility of the adaptation of SNN models in unsupervised natural language processing.},

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking, which is primarily based on visible light image sequences, encounters numerous challenges in complicated scenarios, such as low light conditions, high dynamic ranges, and background clutter. To address these challenges, incorporating the advantages of multiple visual modalities is a promising solution for achieving reliable object tracking. However, the existing approaches usually integrate multimodal inputs through adaptive local feature interactions, which cannot leverage the full potential of visual cues, thus resulting in insufficient feature modeling. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal hybrid tracker (MMHT) that utilizes frame-event-based data for reliable single object tracking. The MMHT model employs a hybrid backbone consisting of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a spiking neural network (SNN) to extract dominant features from different visual modalities and then uses a unified encoder to align the features across different domains. Moreover, we propose an enhanced transformer-based module to fuse multimodal features using attention mechanisms. With these methods, the MMHT model can effectively construct a multiscale and multidimensional visual feature space and achieve discriminative feature modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MMHT model exhibits competitive performance in comparison with that of other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our results highlight the effectiveness of the MMHT model in terms of addressing the challenges faced in visual object tracking tasks.},

These advantages are illustrated by some numerical experiments, where it is shown that the TLFNN model can achieve a convergence accuracy of 1 0 − 13 10−13 within 5 s 5s while the TLNN model can only acquire 1 0 − 6 10−6 in 1 0 5 s 105s when some random coefficient matrices are applied.

  abstract     = {Model Inversion Attack reconstructs confidential training dataset from a target deep learning model. Most of the existing methods assume the adversary has an auxiliary dataset that has similar distribution with the private dataset. However, this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios. Since the private dataset is unknown, the domain divergence between the auxiliary dataset and the private dataset is inevitable. In this paper, we use Cross Domain Model Inversion Attack to represent the distribution divergence scenario in MIA. With the distribution divergence between the private images and auxiliary images, the distribution between the feature vectors of the private images and those of the auxiliary images is also different. Moreover, the outputted prediction vectors of the auxiliary images are also misclassified. The inversion attack is thus hard to be performed. We perform both the feature vector inversion task and prediction vector inversion task in this cross domain setting. For feature vector inversion, Domain Alignment MIA (DA-MIA) is proposed. While performing the reconstruction task, DA-MIA aligns the feature vectors of auxiliary images with the feature vectors of private images in an adversarial manner to mitigate the domain divergence between them. Thus, semantically meaningful images can be reconstructed. For prediction vector inversion, we further introduce an auxiliary classifier and propose Domain Alignment MIA with Auxiliary Classifier (DA-MIA-AC). The auxiliary classifier is pretrained by the auxiliary dataset and fine-tuned during the adversarial training stage. Thus, the misclassification problem caused by domain divergence can be solved, and the images can be reconstructed correctly. Various experiments are performed to show the advancement of our methods, the results show that DA-MIA can improve the SSIM score of the reconstructed images for up to 191%, DA-MIA-AC can increase the classification accuracy score of the reconstructed images from 9.18% to 81.32% in Cross Domain Model Inversion Attack.},

Therefore, this study focuses on different medical image segmentation tasks and the issue of blurriness. By addressing these tasks, the study significantly improves diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, contributing to the overall enhancement of healthcare outcomes. To optimize segmentation performance and leverage feature information, we propose a Neighborhood Fuzzy c-Means Multiscale Pyramid Hybrid Attention Unet (NFMPAtt-Unet) model.

The MDWFP dynamically adjusts weights across multiple scales, improving feature information capture. The HWA enhances the network’s ability to capture and utilize crucial features, while the NFCMFE, grounded in neighborhood rough set concepts, aids in fuzzy C-means feature extraction, addressing complex structures and uncertainties in medical images, thereby enhancing adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that NFMPAtt-Unet outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its efficacy in medical image segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in processing various types of graph data, such as citation networks and social networks, etc. Although many of these GNNs prove their superiority in handling homophilic graphs, they often overlook the other kind of widespread heterophilic graphs, in which adjacent nodes tend to have different classes or dissimilar features. Recent methods attempt to address heterophilic graphs from the graph spatial domain, which try to aggregate more similar nodes or prevent dissimilar nodes with negative weights. However, they may neglect valuable heterophilic information or extract heterophilic information ineffectively, which could cause poor performance of downstream tasks on heterophilic graphs, including node classification and graph classification, etc. Hence, a novel framework named GARN is proposed to effectively extract both homophilic and heterophilic information. First, we analyze the shortcomings of most GNNs in tackling heterophilic graphs from the perspective of graph spectral and spatial theory. Then, motivated by these analyses, a Graph Aggregating-Repelling Convolution (GARC) mechanism is designed with the objective of fusing both low-pass and high-pass graph filters. Technically, it learns positive attention weights as a low-pass filter to aggregate similar adjacent nodes, and learns negative attention weights as a high-pass filter to repel dissimilar adjacent nodes. A learnable integration weight is used to adaptively fuse these two filters and balance the proportion of the learned positive and negative weights, which could control our GARC to evolve into different types of graph filters and prevent it from over-relying on high intra-class similarity. Finally, a framework named GARN is established by simply stacking several layers of GARC to evaluate its graph representation learning ability on both the node classification and image-converted graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple homophilic and heterophilic graphs and complex real-world image-converted graphs indicate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and mechanism over several representative GNN baselines.},

Additionally, there exists a significant estimation bias, regardless of the method used in the critic initialization phase. To address these challenges and reduce estimation errors, we propose CEILING, a simple and compatible framework that can be applied to any model-free Actor–Critic methods. The core idea of CEILING is to evaluate the superiority of different estimation methods by incorporating the true Q -value, calculated using Monte Carlo, during the training process. CEILING consists of two implementations: the Direct Picking Operation and the Exponential Softmax Weighting Operation. The first implementation selects the optimal method at each fixed step and applies it in subsequent interactions until the next selection. The other implementation utilizes a nonlinear weighting function that dynamically assigns larger weights to more accurate methods. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our methods provide a more accurate and stable Q -value estimation. Additionally, we analyze the upper bound of the estimation bias. Based on two implementations, we propose specific algorithms and their variants, and our methods achieve superior performance on several benchmark tasks.},

  abstract     = {In practical engineering, obtaining labeled high-quality fault samples poses challenges. Conventional fault diagnosis methods based on deep learning struggle to discern the underlying causes of mechanical faults from a fine-grained perspective, due to the scarcity of annotated data. To tackle those issue, we propose a novel semi-supervised Gaussian Mixed Variational Autoencoder method, SeGMVAE, aimed at acquiring unsupervised representations that can be transferred across fine-grained fault diagnostic tasks, enabling the identification of previously unseen faults using only the small number of labeled samples. Initially, Gaussian mixtures are introduced as a multimodal prior distribution for the Variational Autoencoder. This distribution is dynamically optimized for each task through an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm, constructing a latent representation of the bridging task and unlabeled samples. Subsequently, a set variational posterior approach is presented to encode each task sample into the latent space, facilitating meta-learning. Finally, semi-supervised EM integrates the posterior of labeled data by acquiring task-specific parameters for diagnosing unseen faults. Results from two experiments demonstrate that SeGMVAE excels in identifying new fine-grained faults and exhibits outstanding performance in cross-domain fault diagnosis across different machines.

In particular, BSCB is a class of discrete-time NNs obtained by projecting a linear system onto a convex body of R n . The main result in the paper is that the BSCB is convergent when the matrix of the linear system is symmetric and positive semidefinite or, otherwise, it is symmetric and the step size does not exceed a given bound depending only on the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix. This result generalizes previous results in the literature for BSB and BSCB and it gives a solid foundation for the use of BSCB as a content addressable memory (CAM). The result is proved via Lyapunov method and LaSalle’s Invariance Principle for discrete-time systems and by using some fundamental inequalities enjoyed by the projection operator onto convex sets as Bourbaki–Cheney–Goldstein inequality.},

  abstract     = {ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing profound physical disability that severely impairs a patient&#39;s life expectancy and quality of life. It also leads to muscular atrophy and progressive weakness of muscles due to insufficient nutrition in the body. At present, there are no disease-modifying therapies to cure ALS, and there is a lack of preventive tools. The general clinical assessments are based on symptom reports, neurophysiological tests, neurological examinations, and neuroimaging. But, these techniques possess various limitations of low reliability, lack of standardized protocols, and lack of sensitivity, especially in the early stages of disease. So, effective methods are required to detect the progression of the disease and minimize the suffering of patients. Extensive studies concentrated on investigating the causes of neurological disease, which creates a barrier to precise identification and classification of genes accompanied with ALS disease. Hence, the proposed system implements a deep RSFFNN CNN (Resemble Single Feed Forward Neural Network-Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm to effectively classify the clinical associations of ALS. It involves the addition of custom weights to the kernel initializer and neutralizer ‘k’ parameter to each hidden layer in the network. This is done to increase the stability and learning ability of the classifier. Additionally, the comparison of the proposed approach is performed with SFNN (Single Feed NN) and ML (Machine Learning) based algorithms, namely, NB (Naïve Bayes), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and RF (Random Forest), to estimate the efficacy of the proposed model. The reliability of the proposed algorithm is measured by deploying performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Clothing change person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match images of the same person wearing different clothes across diverse scenes. Leveraging biological features or clothing labels, existing CC-ReID methods have demonstrated promising performance. However, current research primarily focuses on supervised CC-ReID methods, which require a substantial number of manually annotated labels. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel clothing-invariant contrastive learning (CICL) framework for unsupervised CC-ReID task. Firstly, to obtain clothing change positive pairs at a low computational cost, we propose a random clothing augmentation (RCA) method. RCA initially partitions clothing regions based on parsing images, then applies random augmentation to different clothing regions, ultimately generating clothing change positive pairs to facilitate clothing-invariant learning. Secondly, to generate pseudo-labels strongly correlated with identity in an unsupervised manner, we design semantic fusion clustering (SFC), which enhances identity-related information through semantic fusion. Additionally, we develop a semantic alignment contrastive loss (SAC loss) to encourages the model to learn features strongly correlated with identity and enhances the model’s robustness to clothing changes. Unlike existing optimization methods that forcibly bring closer clusters with different pseudo-labels, SAC loss aligns the clustering results of real image features with those generated by SFC, forming a mutually reinforcing scheme with SFC. Experimental results on multiple CC-ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed CICL not only outperforms existing unsupervised methods but can even achieves competitive performance with supervised CC-ReID methods.

For L eq Leq -loss, it not only enhances the robustness of SVM and SVR against outliers but also improves the robustness of SVM to resampling from a different perspective. Furthermore, EQSVM and EQSVR were constructed based on L eq Leq -loss, and the influence functions and breakdown point lower bounds of their estimators are derived. It is proved that the influence functions are bounded, and the breakdown point lower bounds can reach the highest asymptotic breakdown point of 1 / 2 1/2 . Additionally, we demonstrated the robustness of EQSVM to resampling and derived its generalization error bound based on Rademacher complexity. Due to the L eq Leq -loss being non-convex, we can use the concave–convex procedure (CCCP) technique to transform the problem into a series of convex optimization problems and use the ClipDCD algorithm to solve these convex optimization problems. Numerous experiments have been conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed EQSVM and EQSVR.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted attention due to their biological plausibility and the potential for low-energy applications on neuromorphic hardware. Two mainstream approaches are commonly used to obtain SNNs, i.e. , ANN-to-SNN conversion methods, and Directly-trained-SNN methods. However, the former achieve excellent performance at the cost of a large number of time steps ( i.e. , latency), while the latter exhibit lower latency but suffers from suboptimal performance. To tackle the performance-latency trade-off, we propose Self-Architectural Knowledge Distillation (SAKD), an intuitive and effective method for SNNs leveraging Knowledge Distillation (KD). We adopt a bilevel teacher–student training strategy in SAKD, i.e. , level-1 involves directly transferring same-architectural pre-trained ANN weights to SNNs, and level-2 encourages the SNNs to mimic ANN’s behavior, considering both final responses and intermediate features aspects. Learning with informative supervision signals fostered by labels and ANNs, our SAKD achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a few time steps on widely-used classification benchmark datasets. On ImageNet-1K, with only 4 time steps, our Spiking-ResNet34 model attains a Top-1 accuracy of 70.04%, outperforming the previous same-architectural SOTA methods. Notably, our SEW-ResNet152 model reaches a Top-1 accuracy of 77.30% on ImageNet-1K, setting a new SOTA benchmark for SNNs. Furthermore, we apply our SAKD to various dense prediction downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, demonstrating strong generalization ability and superior performance. In conclusion, our proposed SAKD framework presents a promising approach for achieving both high performance and low latency in SNNs, potentially paving the way for future advancements in the field.},

Neuromorphic engineering aims to mimic biology in order to develop new systems capable of incorporating such capabilities. Bio-inspired learning systems continue to be a challenge that must be solved, and much work needs to be done in this regard. Among all brain regions, the hippocampus stands out as an autoassociative short-term memory with the capacity to learn and recall memories from any fragment of them. These characteristics make the hippocampus an ideal candidate for developing bio-inspired learning systems that, in addition, resemble content-addressable memories. Therefore, in this work we propose a bio-inspired spiking content-addressable memory model based on the CA3 region of the hippocampus with the ability to learn, forget and recall memories, both orthogonal and non-orthogonal, from any fragment of them. The model was implemented on the SpiNNaker hardware platform using Spiking Neural Networks. A set of experiments based on functional, stress and applicability tests were performed to demonstrate its correct functioning. This work presents the first hardware implementation of a fully-functional bio-inspired spiking hippocampal content-addressable memory model, paving the way for the development of future more complex neuromorphic systems.},

Gradient-based CAMs are efficient, while the performance is heavily affected by gradient vanishing and exploding. In contrast, gradient-free CAMs can avoid computing gradients to produce more understandable results. However, they are quite time-consuming because hundreds of forward interference per image are required. In this paper, we proposed Cluster-CAM, an effective and efficient gradient-free CNN interpretation algorithm. Cluster-CAM can significantly reduce the times of forward propagation by splitting the feature maps into clusters. Furthermore, we propose an artful strategy to forge a cognition-base map and cognition-scissors from clustered feature maps. The final salience heatmap will be produced by merging the above cognition maps. Qualitative results conspicuously show that Cluster-CAM can produce heatmaps where the highlighted regions match the human’s cognition more precisely than existing CAMs. The quantitative evaluation further demonstrates the superiority of Cluster-CAM in both effectiveness and efficiency.},

This rigid methodology presents obstacles when attempting to integrate with burgeoning techniques such as meta-learning and large language models. To address this issue, we introduce a unique neural skill representation that abstracts the activation of neurons in each neural layer. Based on this, a novel end-to-end robotic reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed, in which two sub-networks, i.e., generator and worker networks, implement collaborative inferences via neural skills. Specifically, the generator produces a series of multi-spatial neural skills, providing efficient guidance for subsequent decision-making; by integrating these skills, the worker can determine its own network weights and biases to cope with various environmental conditions. Therefore, actions can be sampled with flexibly changeable network parameters through the collaboration between generator and worker networks. The experiments demonstrate that GeneWorker can achieve a mean success rate of over 90.67% on continuous robotic tasks and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a minimum of 54% on the pick-and-place task.},

Initially, STaRNet integrates a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction module that captures both global and local features, facilitating the construction of Riemannian manifolds from these comprehensive spatio-temporal features. Subsequently, a matrix logarithm operation transforms the manifold-based features into the tangent space, followed by a dense layer for classification. Without preprocessing, STaRNet surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by achieving an average decoding accuracy of 83.29% and a kappa value of 0.777 on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset, and 95.45% accuracy with a kappa value of 0.939 on the High Gamma Dataset. Additionally, a comparative analysis between STaRNet and several SOTA models, focusing on the most challenging subjects from both datasets, highlights exceptional robustness of STaRNet. Finally, the visualizations of learned frequency bands demonstrate that temporal convolutions have learned MI-related frequency bands, and the t-SNE analyses of features across multiple layers of STaRNet exhibit strong feature extraction capabilities.

In CLS model, we incorporate self-attention mechanism and supervised contrastive learning into a deep neural network to extract important information from electroencephalography (EEG) signals as features.

The results demonstrate that CLS outperforms six baseline algorithms, achieving a mean classification accuracy improvement of 1.3 % and 4.71 % than the best algorithm on the Giga dataset and OpenBMI dataset, respectively.

In this paper, we proposed a markerless augmented reality framework to enhance safety by avoiding intra-operative bleeding, which is a high risk caused by collision between surgical instruments and delicate blood vessels (arteries or veins). Advanced stereo reconstruction and segmentation networks are compared to find the best combination to reconstruct the intra-operative blood vessel in 3D space for registration with the pre-operative model, and the minimum distance detection between the instruments and the blood vessel is implemented. A robot-assisted lymphadenectomy is emulated on the da Vinci Research Kit in a dry lab, and ten human subjects perform this operation to explore the usability of the proposed framework. The result shows that the augmented reality framework can help the users to avoid the dangerous collision between the instruments and the delicate blood vessel while not introducing an extra load. It provides a flexible framework that integrates augmented reality into the medical robotic platform to enhance safety during surgery.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graph reasoning, vital for addressing incompleteness and supporting applications, faces challenges with the continuous growth of graphs. To address this challenge, several inductive reasoning models for encoding emerging entities have been proposed. However, they do not consider the multi-batch emergence scenario, where new entities and new facts are usually added to knowledge graphs (KGs) in multiple batches in the order of their emergence. To simulate the continuous growth of knowledge graphs, a novel multi-batch emergence (MBE) scenario has recently been proposed. We propose a path-based inductive model to handle multi-batch entity growth, enhancing entity encoding with type information. Specifically, we observe a noteworthy pattern in which entity types at the head and tail of the same relation exhibit relative regularity. To utilize this regularity, we introduce a pair of learnable parameters for each relation, representing entity type features linked to the relation. The type features are dedicated to encoding and updating the features of entities. Meanwhile, our model incorporates a novel attention mechanism, combining statistical co-occurrence and semantic similarity of relations effectively for contextual information capture. After generating embeddings, we employ reinforcement learning for path reasoning. To reduce sparsity and expand the action space, our model generates soft candidate facts by grounding a set of soft path rules. Meanwhile, we incorporate the confidence scores of these facts in the action space to facilitate the agent to better distinguish between original facts and rule-generated soft facts. Performances on three multi-batch entity growth datasets demonstrate robust performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the research on transferable feature-level adversarial attack has become a hot spot due to attacking unknown deep neural networks successfully. But the following problems limit its transferability. Existing feature disruption methods often focus on computing feature weights precisely, while overlooking the noise influence of feature maps, which results in disturbing non-critical features. Meanwhile, geometric augmentation algorithms are used to enhance image diversity but compromise information integrity, which hamper models from capturing comprehensive features. Furthermore, current feature perturbation could not pay attention to the density distribution of object-relevant key features, which mainly concentrate in salient region and fewer in the most distributed background region, and get limited transferability. To tackle these challenges, a feature distribution-aware transferable adversarial attack method, called FDAA, is proposed to implement distinct strategies for different image regions in the paper. A novel Aggregated Feature Map Attack (AFMA) is presented to significantly denoise feature maps, and an input transformation strategy, called Smixup, is introduced to help feature disruption algorithms to capture comprehensive features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scheme proposed achieves better transferability with an average success rate of 78.6% on adversarially trained models.},

Our work aims to contribute to this field by providing a topological measure for evaluating loss complexity in the case of multilayer neural networks. We compare deep and shallow architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions by deriving upper and lower bounds for the complexity of their respective loss functions and revealing how that complexity is influenced by the number of hidden units, training models, and the activation function used. Additionally, we found that certain variations in the loss function or model architecture, such as adding an ℓ 2 ℓ2 regularization term or implementing skip connections in a feedforward network, do not affect loss topology in specific cases.},

  abstract     = {For convenient transmission, omnidirectional images (ODIs) usually follow the equirectangular projection (ERP) format and are low-resolution. To provide better immersive experience, omnidirectional image super resolution (ODISR) is essential. However, ERP ODIs suffer from serious geometric distortion and pixel stretching across latitudes, generating massive redundant information at high latitudes. This characteristic poses a huge challenge for the traditional SR methods, which can only obtain the suboptimal ODISR performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel position attention network (PAN) for ODISR in this paper. Specifically, a two-branch structure is introduced, in which the basic enhancement branch (BE) serves to achieve coarse deep feature enhancement for extracted shallow features. Meanwhile, the position attention enhancement branch (PAE) builds a positional attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the contribution of features at different latitudes in the ERP representation according to their positions and stretching degrees, which achieves the enhancement for the differentiated information, suppresses the redundant information, and modulate the deep features with spatial distortion. Subsequently, the features of two branches are fused effectively to achieve the further refinement and adapt the distortion characteristic of ODIs. After that, we exploit a long-term memory module (LM), promoting information interactions and fusions between the branches to enhance the perception of the distortion, aggregating the prior hierarchical features to keep the long-term memory and boosting the ODISR performance. Extensive results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and the high efficiency of our PAN in ODISR.},

To solve the challenging problem, methods based on the neural networks, such as zeroing neural network and gradient neural network, are commonly adopted due to their performance on handling nonlinear problems. However, the traditional zeroing neural network algorithm requires computing the matrix inverse during the solving process, which is a complicated and time-consuming operation. Although the gradient neural network algorithm does not require computing the matrix inverse, its accuracy is not high enough. Therefore, a novel inverse-free zeroing neural network algorithm without matrix inverse is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm not only avoids the matrix inverse, but also avoids matrix multiplication, greatly reducing the computational complexity. In addition, detailed theoretical analyses of the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm is provided to guarantee its excellent capability in solving time-variant optimization problems. Numerical simulations and comparative experiments with traditional zeroing neural network and gradient neural network algorithms substantiate the accuracy and superiority of the novel inverse-free zeroing neural network algorithm. To further validate the performance of the novel inverse-free zeroing neural network algorithm in practical applications, path tracking tasks of three manipulators (i.e., Universal Robot 5, Franka Emika Panda, and Kinova JACO2 manipulators) are conducted, and the results verify the applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

For instance, exchange-based and gradient-based attacks may become trapped in local optima and require excessive queries, hindering the generation of adversarial examples with high semantic similarity and low perturbation under limited query conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called HyGloadAttack ( ad versarial Attack s via Hy brid optimization and Glo bal random initialization) for crafting high-quality adversarial examples. HyGloadAttack utilizes a perturbation matrix in the word embedding space to find nearby adversarial examples after global initialization and selects synonyms that maximize similarity while maintaining adversarial properties.

Extensive experiments on five datasets of text classification and natural language inference, as well as two real APIs, demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed HyGloadAttack method over state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

Besides, the parameter of low- and high-frequency wavelet coefficients within each pyramid level and across pyramid levels is shared. A multi-resolution wavelet pyramid fusion (WPF) module is devised to facilitate information transfer across network pyramid levels.

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel hyperparameter in the Softmax function to regulate the rate of gradient decay, which is dependent on sample probability. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that both model generalization and calibration are significantly influenced by the gradient decay rate, particularly as confidence probability increases. Notably, the gradient decay varies in a convex or concave manner with rising sample probability. When employing a smaller gradient decay, we observe a curriculum learning sequence. This sequence highlights hard samples only after easy samples are adequately trained, and allows well-separated samples to receive a higher gradient, effectively reducing intra-class distances. However, this approach has a drawback: small gradient decay tends to exacerbate model overconfidence, shedding light on the calibration issues prevalent in modern neural networks. In contrast, a larger gradient decay addresses these issues effectively, surpassing even models that utilize post-calibration methods. Our findings provide substantial evidence that large margin Softmax can influence the local Lipschitz constraint by manipulating the probability-dependent gradient decay rate. This research contributes a fresh perspective and understanding of the interplay between large margin Softmax, curriculum learning, and model calibration through an exploration of gradient decay rates. Additionally, we propose a novel warm-up strategy that dynamically adjusts the gradient decay for a smoother L L -constraint in early training, then mitigating overconfidence in the final model.},

KLSANet demonstrates superior performance on three benchmark datasets (CUB, Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in 1-shot and 5-shot settings with average improvements of 3.95% and 2.56% respectively. Visualization experiments demonstrate the interpretability of KLSANet predictions. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZitZhengWang/KLSANet .},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic representation learning from multi-view datasets, distinct from most existing methodologies which typically handle single-view data individually, maintaining a shared semantic link across the multi-view data via a unified optimization process. Notably, even recent advancements, such as Co-GCN, continue to treat each view as an independent graph, subsequently aggregating the respective GCN representations to form output representations, which ignores the complex semantic interactions among heterogeneous data. To address the issue, we design a unified framework to connect multi-view data with heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, our study envisions multi-view data as a heterogeneous graph composed of shared isomorphic nodes and multi-type edges, wherein the same nodes are shared across different views, but each specific view possesses its own unique edge type. This perspective motivates us to utilize the heterogeneous graph convolutional network (HGCN) to extract semantic representations from multi-view data for semi-supervised classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is an early attempt to transfigure multi-view data into a heterogeneous graph within the realm of multi-view semi-supervised learning. In our approach, the original input of the HGCN is composed of concatenated multi-view matrices, and its convolutional operator (the graph Laplacian matrix) is adaptively learned from multi-type edges in a data-driven fashion. After rigorous experimentation on eight public datasets, our proposed method, hereafter referred to as HGCN-MVSC, demonstrated encouraging superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors for semi-supervised classification tasks.},

Here we investigated principles guiding the topographical organization of object selectivities in the VTC by constructing a hybrid Self-Organizing Map (SOM) model that harnesses a biologically inspired algorithm of wiring cost minimization and adheres to the constraints of the lateral wiring span of human VTC neurons. In a series of in silico experiments with functional brain neuroimaging and neurophysiological single-unit data from humans and non-human primates, the VTC-SOM predicted the topographical structure of fine-scale category-selective regions (face-, tool-, body-, and place-selective regions) and the boundary in large-scale abstract functional maps (animate vs. inanimate, real-word small-size vs. big-size, central vs. peripheral), with no significant loss in functionality (e.g., categorical selectivity and view-invariant representations). In addition, when the same principle was applied to V1 orientation preferences, a pinwheel-like topology emerged, suggesting the model&#39;s broad applicability. In summary, our study illustrates that the simple principle of wiring cost minimization, coupled with the appropriate biological constraint of lateral wiring span, is able to implement the high-dimensional object space in a two-dimensional cortical surface.},

Even though the structure and performance of broad learning are gradually showing superiority, private data leakage in broad learning systems is still a problem that needs to be solved. Recently, Multiparty Secure Broad Learning System (MSBLS) is proposed to allow two clients to participate training. However, privacy-preserving broad learning across multiple clients has received limited attention. In this paper, we propose a Self-Balancing Incremental Broad Learning System (SIBLS) with privacy protection by considering the effect of different data sample sizes from clients, which allows multiple clients to be involved in the incremental learning. Specifically, we design a client selection strategy to select two clients in each round by reducing the gap in the number of data samples in the incremental updating process. To ensure the security under the participation of multiple clients, we introduce a mediator in the data encryption and feature mapping process. Three classical datasets are used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed SIBLS, including MNIST, Fashion and NORB datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed SIBLS can have comparable performance with MSBLS while achieving better performance than federated learning in terms of accuracy and running time.},

Generally, LRR-based methods use denoized data as dictionaries for data reconstruction purpose. However, the dictionaries used in LRR-based algorithms are fixed, leading to poor clustering performance. In addition, most of these methods assume that the input data are linearly correlated. However, in practice, data are mostly nonlinearly correlated. To address these problems, we propose a novel adaptive kernel dictionary-based LRR (AKDLRR) method for SC. Specifically, to explore nonlinear information, the given data are mapped to the Hilbert space via the kernel technique. The dictionary in AKDLRR is not fixed; it adaptively learns from the data in the kernel space, making AKDLRR robust to noise and yielding good clustering performance. To solve the AKDLRR model, an efficient procedure including an alternative optimization strategy is proposed. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the convergence performance of AKDLRR is presented, which reveals that AKDLRR can converge in at most three iterations under certain conditions. The experimental results show that AKDLRR can achieve the best clustering performance and has excellent speed in comparison with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Video frame interpolation methodologies endeavor to create novel frames betwixt extant ones, with the intent of augmenting the video’s frame frequency. However, current methods are prone to image blurring and spurious artifacts in challenging scenarios involving occlusions and discontinuous motion. Moreover, they typically rely on optical flow estimation, which adds complexity to modeling and computational costs. To address these issues, we introduce a Motion-Aware Video Frame Interpolation (MA-VFI) network, which directly estimates intermediate optical flow from consecutive frames by introducing a novel hierarchical pyramid module. It not only extracts global semantic relationships and spatial details from input frames with different receptive fields, enabling the model to capture intricate motion patterns, but also effectively reduces the required computational cost and complexity. Subsequently, a cross-scale motion structure is presented to estimate and refine intermediate flow maps by the extracted features. This approach facilitates the interplay between input frame features and flow maps during the frame interpolation process and markedly heightens the precision of the intervening flow delineations. Finally, a discerningly fashioned loss centered around an intermediate flow is meticulously contrived, serving as a deft rudder to skillfully guide the prognostication of said intermediate flow, thereby substantially refining the precision of the intervening flow mappings. Experiments illustrate that MA-VFI surpasses several representative VFI methods across various datasets, and can enhance efficiency while maintaining commendable efficacy.},

Unfortunately, in previous communication schemes, agents may potentially receive irrelevant information, which increases training difficulty and leads to poor performance in complex settings. Furthermore, most existing works lack the consideration of the impact of small coalitions formed by agents in the multi-agent system. To address these challenges, we propose HyperComm , a novel framework that uses the hypergraph to model the multi-agent system, improving the accuracy and specificity of communication among agents. Our approach brings the concept of hypergraph for the first time in multi-agent communication for MARL. Within this framework, each agent can communicate more effectively with other agents within the same hyperedge, leading to better cooperation in environments with multiple agents.

Previous works fail to take advantage of this bidirectional opportunity.

Additionally, we redefine emotion-cause pair extraction as a closed-loop structure detection problem to alleviate the mismatch between emotion and cause clauses. To enhance the training of the architecture, we provide a procedure for estimating the confidence of the extraction system for its emotion-cause pairs.

  abstract     = {Although recent studies on blind single image super-resolution (SISR) have achieved significant success, most of them typically require supervised training on synthetic low resolution (LR)-high resolution (HR) paired images. This leads to re-training necessity for different degradations and restricted applications in real-world scenarios with unfavorable inputs. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised blind SISR method with input underlying different degradations, named different degradations blind super-resolution (DDSR). It formulates a Gaussian modeling on blur degradation and employs a meta-learning framework for solving different image degradations. Specifically, a neural network-based kernel generator is optimized by learning from random kernel samples, referred to as random kernel learning. This operation provides effective initialization for blur degradation optimization. At the same time, a meta-learning framework is proposed to resolve multiple degradation modelings on the basis of alternative optimization between blur degradation and image restoration, respectively. Differing from the pre-trained deep-learning methods, the proposed DDSR is implemented in a plug-and-play manner, and is capable of restoring HR image from unfavorable LR input with degradations such as partial coverage, noise addition, and darkening. Extensive simulations illustrate the superior performance of the proposed DDSR approach compared to the state-of-the-arts on public datasets with comparable memory load and time consumption, yet exhibiting better application flexibility and convenience, and significantly better generalization ability towards multiple degradations.

  abstract     = {In overcoming the challenges faced in adapting to paired real-world data, recent unsupervised single image deraining (SID) methods have proven capable of accomplishing notably acceptable deraining performance. However, the previous methods usually fail to produce a high quality rain-free image due to neglecting sufficient attention to semantic representation and the image content, which results in the inability to completely separate the content from the rain layer. In this paper, we develop a novel cycle contrastive adversarial framework for unsupervised SID, which mainly consists of cycle contrastive learning (CCL) and location contrastive learning (LCL). Specifically, CCL achieves high-quality image reconstruction and rain-layer stripping by pulling similar features together while pushing dissimilar features further in both semantic and discriminant latent spaces. Meanwhile, LCL implicitly constrains the mutual information of the same location of different exemplars to maintain the content information. In addition, recently inspired by the powerful Segment Anything Model (SAM) that can effectively extract widely applicable semantic structural details, we formulate a structural-consistency regularization to fine-tune our network using SAM. Apart from this, we attempt to introduce vision transformer (VIT) into our network architecture to further improve the performance. In our designed transformer-based GAN, to obtain a stronger representation, we propose a multi-layer channel compression attention module (MCCAM) to extract a richer feature. Equipped with the above techniques, our proposed unsupervised SID algorithm, called CCLformer, can show advantageous image deraining performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the superiority of our method and the effectiveness of each module in CCLformer. The code is available at https://github.com/zhihefang/CCLGAN .},

  abstract     = {Multi-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging image registration makes a substantial contribution to medical image analysis. However, existing methods (e.g., VoxelMorph, CycleMorph) often encounter the problem of image information misalignment in deformable registration tasks, posing challenges to the practical application. To address this issue, we propose a novel smooth image sampling method to align full organic information to realize detail-preserving image warping. In this paper, we clarify that the phenomenon about image information mismatch is attributed to imbalanced sampling. Then, a sampling frequency map constructed by sampling frequency estimators is utilized to instruct smooth sampling by reducing the spatial gradient and discrepancy between all-ones matrix and sampling frequency map. In addition, our estimator determines the sampling frequency of a grid voxel in the moving image by aggregating the sum of interpolation weights from warped non-grid sampling points in its vicinity and vectorially constructs sampling frequency map through projection and scatteration. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on two in-house datasets. The results showcase that our method preserves nearly complete details with ideal registration accuracy compared with several state-of-the-art registration methods. Additionally, our method exhibits a statistically significant difference in the regularity of the registration field compared to other methods, at a significance level of p &lt; &amp;lt; 0.05.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates containment control for fractional-order networked systems. Two novel intermittent sampled position communication protocols, where controllers only need to keep working during communication width of every sampling period under the past sampled position communication of neighbors’ agents. Then, some necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee containment about the differential order, sampling period, communication width, coupling strengths, and networked structure. Taking into account of the delay, a detailed discussion to guarantee containment is given with respect to the delay, sampling period, and communication width. Interestingly, it is discovered that containment control cannot be guaranteed without delay or past sampled position communication under the proposed protocols. Finally, the effectiveness of theoretical results is demonstrated by some numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In natural language processing, fact verification is a very challenging task, which requires retrieving multiple evidence sentences from a reliable corpus to verify the authenticity of a claim. Although most of the current deep learning methods use the attention mechanism for fact verification, they have not considered imposing attentional constraints on important related words in the claim and evidence sentences, resulting in inaccurate attention for some irrelevant words. In this paper, we propose a syntactic evidence network (SENet) model which incorporates entity keywords, syntactic information and sentence attention for fact verification. The SENet model extracts entity keywords from claim and evidence sentences, and uses a pre-trained syntactic dependency parser to extract the corresponding syntactic sentence structures and incorporates the extracted syntactic information into the attention mechanism for language-driven word representation. In addition, the sentence attention mechanism is applied to obtain a richer semantic representation. We have conducted experiments on the FEVER and UKP Snopes datasets for performance evaluation. Our SENet model has achieved 78.69% in Label Accuracy and 75.63% in FEVER Score on the FEVER dataset. In addition, our SENet model also has achieved 65.0% in precision and 61.2% in macro F1 on the UKP Snopes dataset. The experimental results have shown that our proposed SENet model has outperformed the baseline models and achieved the state-of-the-art performance for fact verification.},

  abstract     = {Generative models based on neural networks present a substantial challenge within deep learning. As it stands, such models are primarily limited to the domain of artificial neural networks. Spiking neural networks, as the third generation of neural networks, offer a closer approximation to brain-like processing due to their rich spatiotemporal dynamics. However, generative models based on spiking neural networks are not well studied. Particularly, previous works on generative adversarial networks based on spiking neural networks are conducted on simple datasets and do not perform well. In this work, we pioneer constructing a spiking generative adversarial network capable of handling complex images and having higher performance. Our first task is to identify the problems of out-of-domain inconsistency and temporal inconsistency inherent in spiking generative adversarial networks. We address these issues by incorporating the Earth-Mover distance and an attention-based weighted decoding method, significantly enhancing the performance of our algorithm across several datasets. Experimental results reveal that our approach outperforms existing methods on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA. In addition to our examination of static datasets, this study marks our inaugural investigation into event-based data, through which we achieved noteworthy results. Moreover, compared with hybrid spiking generative adversarial networks, where the discriminator is an artificial analog neural network, our methodology demonstrates closer alignment with the information processing patterns observed in the mouse.

  abstract     = {Locomotion and scratching are basic motor functions which are critically important for animal survival. Although the spinal circuits governing forward locomotion have been extensively investigated, the organization of spinal circuits and neural mechanisms regulating backward locomotion and scratching remain unclear. Here, we extend a model by Danner et al. to propose a spinal circuit model with asymmetrical cervical-lumbar layout to investigate these issues. In the model, the left–right alternation within the cervical and lumbar circuits is mediated by V 0 D V 0D and V 0 V V 0V commissural interneurons (CINs), respectively. With different control strategies, the model closely reproduces multiple experimental data of quadrupeds in different motor behaviors. Specifically, under the supraspinal drive, walk and trot are expressed in control condition, half-bound is expressed after deletion of V 0 V V 0V CINs, and bound is expressed after deletion of V0 ( V 0 D V 0D and V 0 V V 0V ) CINs; in addition, unilateral hindlimb scratching occurs in control condition and synchronous bilateral hindlimb scratching appears after deletion of V 0 V V 0V CINs. Under the combined drive of afferent feedback and perineal stimulation, different coordination patterns between hindlimbs during BBS (backward-biped-spinal) locomotion are generated. The results suggest that (1) the cervical and lumbar circuits in the spinal network are asymmetrically recruited during particular rhythmic limb movements. (2) Multiple motor behaviors share a single spinal network under the reconfiguration of the spinal network by supraspinal inputs or somatosensory feedback. Our model provides new insights into the organization of motor circuits and neural control of rhythmic limb movements.},

However, the best recognition accuracy on recent public dataset is still low compared to the accuracy of macro-expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolution network (GCN) for MER achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Different to existing GCN with fixed graph structure, we define a stochastic graph structure in which some neighbors are selected randomly. As shown by numerical examples, randomness enables better feature characterization while reducing computational complexity. The whole network consists of two branches, one is the spatial branch taking micro-expression images as input, the other is the temporal branch taking optical flow images as input. Because the micro-expression dataset does not have enough images for training the GCN, we employ the transfer learning mechanism. That is, different stochastic GCNs (SGCN) have been trained by the macro-expression dataset in the source network. Then the well-trained SGCNs are transferred to the target network. It is shown that our proposed method achieves the state-of-art performance on all four well-known datasets. This paper explores stochastic GCN and transfer learning with this random structure in the MER task, which is of great importance to improve the recognition performance.},

Based on this model, we provide a theoretical analysis of energy complexity related to the computation of a fully-connected layer when its inputs, outputs, and weights are transferred between two kinds of memories (DRAM and Buffer). First, we establish a general lower bound on this energy complexity. Then, we present two dataflows and calculate their energy costs to achieve the corresponding upper bounds. In the case of a partitioned Buffer, we prove by the weak duality theorem from linear programming that the lower and upper bounds coincide up to an additive constant, and therefore establish the optimal energy complexity. Finally, the asymptotically optimal quadratic energy complexity of fully-connected layers is experimentally validated by estimating their energy consumption on the Simba and Eyeriss hardware.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, UDA performance often relies heavily on the accuracy of source domain labels, which are frequently noisy or missing in real applications. To address unreliable source labels, we propose a novel framework for extracting robust, discriminative features via iterative pseudo-labeling, queue-based clustering, and bidirectional subdomain alignment (BSA). The proposed framework begins by generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled source data and constructing codebooks via iterative clustering to obtain label-independent class centroids. Then, the proposed framework performs two main tasks: rectifying features from both domains using BSA to match subdomain distributions and enhance features; and employing a two-stage adversarial process for global feature alignment. The feature rectification is done before feature enhancement, while the global alignment is done after feature enhancement. To optimize our framework, we formulate BSA and adversarial learning as maximizing a log-likelihood function, which is implemented via the Expectation–Maximization algorithm. The proposed framework shows significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods on Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA-2017 datasets, achieving average accuracies of 91.5%, 76.6%, and 87.4%, respectively. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method shows consistent superiority in unsupervised domain adaptation tasks with both fully and weakly labeled source domains.},

How to provide participants with accurate and fast summarizing service has attracted extensive attention. Existing meeting summarizing models overlook the utilization of multi-modal information and the information offsetting during summarizing. In this paper, we develop a knowledge-enhanced multi-modal summarizing framework. Firstly, we construct a three-layer multi-modal meeting knowledge graph, including basic, knowledge, and multi-modal layer, to integrate meeting information thoroughly. Then, we raise a topic-based hierarchical clustering approach, which considers information entropy and difference simultaneously, to capture the semantic evolution of meetings. Next, we devise a multi-modal enhanced encoding strategy, including a sentence-level cross-modal encoder, a joint loss function, and a knowledge graph embedding module, to learn the meeting and topic-level presentations. Finally, when generating summaries, we design a topic-enhanced decoding strategy for the Transformer decoder which mitigates semantic offsetting with the aid of topic information. Extensive experiments show that our proposed work consistently outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on the Chinese meeting dataset, where the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L are 49.98%, 21.03%, and 32.03% respectively.},

  abstract     = {We propose a neuromimetic architecture capable of always-on pattern recognition, i.e. at any time during processing. To achieve this, we have extended an existing event-based algorithm (Lagorce et al., 2017), which introduced novel spatio-temporal features as a Hierarchy Of Time-Surfaces (HOTS). Built from asynchronous events captured by a neuromorphic camera, these time surfaces allow to encode the local dynamics of a visual scene and to create an efficient event-based pattern recognition architecture. Inspired by neuroscience, we have extended this method to improve its performance. First, we add a homeostatic gain control on the activity of neurons to improve the learning of spatio-temporal patterns (Grimaldi et al., 2021). We also provide a new mathematical formalism that allows an analogy to be drawn between the HOTS algorithm and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). Following this analogy, we transform the offline pattern categorization method into an online and event-driven layer. This classifier uses the spiking output of the network to define new time surfaces and we then perform the online classification with a neuromimetic implementation of a multinomial logistic regression. These improvements not only consistently increase the performance of the network, but also bring this event-driven pattern recognition algorithm fully online. The results have been validated on different datasets: Poker-DVS (Serrano-Gotarredona and Linares-Barranco, 2015), N-MNIST (Orchard, Jayawant et al., 2015) and DVS Gesture (Amir et al., 2017). This demonstrates the efficiency of this bio-realistic SNN for ultra-fast object recognition through an event-by-event categorization process.},

Low-rank adaptation methods, such as LoRA, have gained significant attention due to their outstanding parameter efficiency and no additional inference latency. This paper investigates a more general form of adapter module based on the analysis that parallel and sequential adaptation branches learn novel and general features during fine-tuning, respectively. The proposed method, named Hydra, combines parallel and sequential branch to integrate capabilities, which is more expressive than existing single branch methods and enables the exploration of a broader range of optimal points in the fine-tuning process. In addition, the proposed method explicitly leverages the pre-trained weights by performing a linear combination of the pre-trained features. It allows the learned features to have better generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of each adaptation branch with empirical evidence. Through an extensive range of experiments, we substantiate the efficiency and demonstrate the superior performance of Hydra.

By constantly learning and adjusting parameters, EDNNs can gradually approximate the dynamic behavior of the real system to achieve more effective control. Aiming at accommodating diverse input constraints, the non-quadratic value function constructed from a smoothly bounded function is devised. Then, the polynomial parameterized adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is employed to approximate the solution of the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi equation (HJE), deriving optimal control laws for two players. To improve the efficiency of data communication, three adaptive sampling mechanisms including event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with relative threshold, dynamic ETM (DETM) and self-triggered mechanism (STM) are introduced in turn during the iterative learning process of control sequences. DETM further extends sampling intervals by incorporating internal dynamic variables, while STM determines the next trigger time through soft calculation without hardware monitoring. All three trigger modes can ensure the system stability while avoiding the Zeno phenomenon, and relevant proofs are given. Finally, the simulation validates the effectiveness of the designed algorithm and highlights the unique characteristics of each trigger mode.},

  abstract     = {Memristors are of great theoretical and practical significance for chaotic dynamics research of brain-like neural networks due to their excellent physical properties such as brain synapse-like memorability and nonlinearity, especially crucial for the promotion of AI big models, cloud computing, and intelligent systems in the artificial intelligence field. In this paper, we introduce memristors as self-connecting synapses into a four-dimensional Hopfield neural network, constructing a central cyclic memristive neural network (CCMNN), and achieving its effective control. The model adopts a central loop topology and exhibits a variety of complex dynamic behaviors such as chaos, bifurcation, and homogeneous and heterogeneous coexisting attractors. The complex dynamic behaviors of the CCMNN are investigated in depth numerically by equilibrium point stability analysis as well as phase trajectory maps, bifurcation maps, time-domain maps, and LEs. It is found that with the variation of the internal parameters of the memristor, asymmetric heterogeneous attractor coexistence phenomena appear under different initial conditions, including the multi-stable coexistence behaviors of periodic-periodic, periodic-stable point, periodic-chaotic, and stable point-chaotic. In addition, by adjusting the structural parameters, a wide range of amplitude control can be realized without changing the chaotic state of the system. Finally, based on the CCMNN model, an adaptive synchronization controller is designed to achieve finite-time synchronization control, and its application prospect in simple secure communication is discussed. A microcontroller-based hardware circuit and NIST test are conducted to verify the correctness of the numerical results and theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Multi-center disease diagnosis aims to build a global model for all involved medical centers. Due to privacy concerns, it is infeasible to collect data from multiple centers for training (i.e., centralized learning). Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized framework that enables multiple clients (e.g., medical centers) to collaboratively train a global model while retaining patient data locally for privacy. However, in practice, the data across medical centers are not independently and identically distributed (Non-IID), causing two challenging issues: (1) catastrophic forgetting at clients, i.e., the local model at clients will forget the knowledge received from the global model after local training, causing reduced performance; and (2) invalid aggregation at the server, i.e., the global model at the server may not be favorable to some clients after model aggregation, resulting in a slow convergence rate. To mitigate these issues, an innovative Fed erated learning using Mo del P rojection (FedMoP) is proposed, which guarantees: (1) the loss of local model on global data does not increase after local training without accessing the global data so that the performance will not be degenerated; and (2) the loss of global model on local data does not increase after aggregation without accessing local data so that convergence rate can be improved. Extensive experimental results show that our FedMoP outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of accuracy, convergence rate and communication cost. In particular, our FedMoP also achieves comparable or even higher accuracy than centralized learning. Thus, our FedMoP can ensure privacy protection while outperforming centralized learning in accuracy and communication cost.},

The theoretical and experimental study of the neural network’s dynamics has been conducted using phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams, and Lyapunov exponents spectras.

  abstract     = {Support tensor machine (STM), as a higher-order extension of support vector machine, is adept at effectively addressing tensorial data classification problems, which maintains the inherent structure in tensors and mitigates the curse of dimensionality. However, it needs to resort to the alternating projection iterative technique, which is very time-consuming. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose an efficient sequential safe static and dynamic screening rule (SS-SDSR) for accelerating STM in this paper. Its main idea is to reduce every projection iterative sub-model by identifying and deleting the redundant variables before and during the training process without sacrificing accuracy. Its construction mainly consists of two parts: (1) The static screening rule and dynamic screening rule are first built based on the variational inequality and duality gap, respectively. (2) The sequential screening process is achieved by using the static screening rule with the different adjacent parameters and applying the dynamic screening rule under the same parameter. In the experiment, on the one hand, to verify the influence of different parameter intervals, screening frequencies, and forms of data on the effectiveness of our method, three experiments on artificial datasets are conducted, which indicate that our method is effective for any forms of data when the parameter interval is small and the screening frequency is appropriate. On the other hand, to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our SS-SDSR, numerical experiments on eleven vector-based datasets, and six tensor-based datasets are conducted and compared with the other five algorithms. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and safety of our SS-SDSR.},

Light-insensitive RGB-T SOD models mitigate the above problems to some extent, but they are limited in performance as they only focus on spatial feature fusion while ignoring the frequency discrepancy. To this end, we propose an RGB-T SOD model by mining spatial-frequency cues, called SFMNet, for low-light scenes. Our SFMNet consists of spatial-frequency feature exploration (SFFE) modules and spatial-frequency feature interaction (SFFI) modules. To be specific, the SFFE module aims to separate spatial-frequency features and adaptively extract high and low-frequency features. Moreover, the SFFI module integrates cross-modality and cross-domain information to capture effective feature representations. By deploying both modules in a top-down pathway, our method generates high-quality saliency predictions. Furthermore, we construct the first low-light RGB-T SOD dataset as a benchmark for evaluating performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SFMNet can achieve higher accuracy than the existing models for low-light scenes.},

Additionally, existing methods often overlook the visual feature correlations among cells, which are crucial in cervical lesion cell detection as pathologists commonly rely on surrounding cells for identification. In this paper, we propose a distillation framework that utilizes a patch-level pre-training network to guide the training of an image-level detection network, which can be applied to various detectors without changing their architectures during inference. The main contribution is three-fold: (1) We propose the Balanced Pre-training Model (BPM) as the patch-level cervical cell classification model, which employs an image synthesis model to construct a class-balanced patch dataset for pre-training. (2) We design the Score Correction Loss (SCL) to enable the detection network to distill knowledge from the BPM model, thereby mitigating the impact of incomplete annotations. (3) We design the Patch Correlation Consistency (PCC) strategy to exploit the correlation information of extracted cells, consistent with the behavior of cytopathologists.

However, due to the inherent differences between image and text, these two modalities inevitably suffer from semantic mismatch problems. To tackle this issue, this paper adopts a multi-grained visual pivot-guided multi-modal fusion strategy with cross-modal contrastive disentangling to eliminate the linguistic gaps between different languages. By using the disentangled multi-grained visual information as a cross-lingual pivot, we can enhance the alignment between different languages and improve the performance of MNMT. We first introduce text-guided stacked cross-modal disentangling modules to progressively disentangle image into two types of visual information: MT-related visual and background information. Then we effectively integrate these two kinds of multi-grained visual elements to assist target sentence generation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark MNMT datasets are conducted, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves significant improvement over the other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on all test sets. The in-depth analysis highlights the benefits of text-guided cross-modal disentangling and visual pivot-based multi-modal fusion strategies in MNMT.

The classification performance of most existing grid fault diagnosis methods depends on the richness and reliability of the data, in addition, it is difficult to obtain sufficient feature information from unimodal circuit signals. To address these issues, we propose a deep residual convolutional neural network (DRCNN)-based framework for grid fault diagnosis. First, we design a comprehensive information entropy value (CIEV) evaluation metric that combines fuzzy entropy (FuzEn) and mutual approximation entropy (MutEn) to integrate multiple decomposition subsequences. Then, DRCNN and heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) are constructed for extracting multimodal features and considering modal variability. In addition, to obtain the implicit information of multimodal features and control the degree of their performance, we propose to incorporate the cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF) mechanism in the synthesis framework. We validate the proposed method on the three-phase transmission line dataset and VSB power line dataset with accuracies of 99.4 % and 99.0 %, respectively. The proposed method also achieves superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this challenge, we introduce an Error-area Feature Refinement Mechanism (EFR) that supplies context features for ill-posed regions. In EFR, we innovatively obtain the suspected error region according to aggregation perturbations, then a simple Transformer module is designed to synthesize global context and correspondence relation with the identified error mask. To better overcome existing texture overfitting, we put forward a Dual-constraint Cost Volume (DCV) that integrates supplementary constraints. This effectively improves the robustness and diversity of disparity clues, resulting in enhanced details and structural accuracy.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present CORING, which is short for effiCient tensOr decomposition-based filteR prunING, a novel filter pruning methodology for neural networks. CORING is crafted to achieve efficient tensor decomposition-based pruning, a stark departure from conventional approaches that rely on vectorized or matricized filter representations. Our approach represents a significant leap forward in the field by introducing tensor decompositions, specifically the HOSVD, which preserves the multidimensional nature of filters while providing a low-rank approximation, thus substantially reducing complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a versatile method for calculating filter similarity by using the low-rank approximation offered by the HOSVD. This obviates the need for using full filters or reshaped versions and enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Extensive experimentation across diverse architectures and datasets spanning various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection, validates CORING’s prowess. Remarkably, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reducing MACs and parameters, consistently enhancing validation accuracy. Furthermore, we supplement our quantitative results with a comprehensive ablation study, providing substantial evidence of the efficiency of our tensor-based approach. Beyond quantitative outcomes, qualitative results vividly illustrate CORING’s ability to retain essential features within pruned neural networks. Our code is available for research purposes.},

  abstract     = {Fluid motion can be considered as a point cloud transformation when using the SPH method. Compared to traditional numerical analysis methods, using machine learning techniques to learn physics simulations can achieve near-accurate results, while significantly increasing efficiency. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for 3D fluid simulations utilizing an Attention-based Dual-pipeline Network, which employs a dual-pipeline architecture, seamlessly integrated with an Attention-based Feature Fusion Module. Unlike previous methods, which often make difficult trade-offs between global fluid control and physical law constraints, we find a way to achieve a better balance between these two crucial aspects with a well-designed dual-pipeline approach. Additionally, we design a Type-aware Input Module to adaptively recognize particles of different types and perform feature fusion afterward, such that fluid-solid coupling issues can be better dealt with. Furthermore, we propose a new dataset, Tank3D, to further explore the network’s ability to handle more complicated scenes. The experiments demonstrate that our approach not only attains a quantitative enhancement in various metrics, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods, but also signifies a qualitative leap in neural network-based simulation by faithfully adhering to the physical laws.

This limitation results in the segmentation network only learning global inter-domain invariant features but ignoring the category-specific inter-domain invariant features, which degenerates the segmentation performance. To address this issue, we present an Unsupervised Domain Adaptive algorithm based on two-level Category Alignment in two different spaces for semantic segmentation tasks, denoted as UDA c a + ca+ . The first level is image-level category alignment based on class activation map (CAM), and the second one is pixel-level category alignment based on pseudo label. By utilizing category information, UDA c a + ca+ can effectively capture domain-invariant yet category-discriminative feature representations to improve segmentation accuracy. In addition, an adversarial learning-based strategy in mixed domain is designed to train the proposed network. Moreover, a confidence calculation method is introduced to mitigate the misleading issues of negative transfer and over-alignment caused by the noise in image-level pseudo labels. UDA c a + ca+ achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two synthetic-to-real adaptative tasks, and verifies its effectiveness for image segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. Existing methods either seek a mixture of distributions across various domains or combine multiple single-source models for weighted fusion in the decision process, with little insight into the distributional discrepancy between different source domains and the target domain. Considering the discrepancies in global and local feature distributions between different domains and the complexity of obtaining category boundaries across domains, this paper proposes a novel Active Dynamic Weighting (ADW) for multi-source domain adaptation. Specifically, to effectively utilize the locally advantageous features in the source domains, ADW designs a multi-source dynamic adjustment mechanism during the training process to dynamically control the degree of feature alignment between each source and target domain in the training batch. In addition, to ensure the cross-domain categories can be distinguished, ADW devises a dynamic boundary loss to guide the model to focus on the hard samples near the decision boundary, which enhances the clarity of the decision boundary and improves the model’s classification ability. Meanwhile, ADW applies active learning to multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation for the first time, guided by dynamic boundary loss, proposes an efficient importance sampling strategy to select target domain hard samples to annotate at a minimal annotation budget, integrates it into the training process, and further refines the domain alignment at the category level. Experiments on various benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract     = {Missing modality sentiment analysis is a prevalent and challenging issue in real life. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of multimodality often leads to an imbalance in optimization when attempting to optimize the same objective across all modalities in multimodal networks. Previous works have consistently overlooked the optimization imbalance of the network in cases when modalities are absent. This paper presents a Prototype-Based Sample-Weighted Distillation Unified Framework Adapted to Missing Modality Sentiment Analysis (PSWD). Specifically, it fuses features with a more efficient transformer-based cross-modal hierarchical cyclic fusion module. Subsequently, we propose two strategies, namely sample-weighted distillation and prototype regularization network, to address the issues of missing modality and optimization imbalance. The sample-weighted distillation strategy assigns higher weights to samples that are located closer to class boundaries. This facilitates the obtaining of complete knowledge by the student network from the teacher’s network. The prototype regularization network calculates a balanced metric for each modality, which adaptively adjusts the gradient based on the prototype cross-entropy loss. Unlike conventional approaches, PSWD not only connects the sentiment analysis study in the missing modality to the full modality, but the proposed prototype regularization network is not reliant on the network structure and can be expanded to more multimodal studies. Massive experiments conducted on IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV show that our method achieves the best results compared to the latest baseline methods, which demonstrates its value for application in sentiment analysis.},

Therefore, the task of transferring knowledge from a label-rich graph (source domain) to a completely unlabeled graph (target domain) becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised graph domain adaptation framework called Structure Enhanced Prototypical Alignment (SEPA), which aims to learn domain-invariant representations on non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data. Specifically, SEPA captures class-wise semantics by constructing a prototype-based graph and introduces an explicit domain discrepancy metric to align the source and target domains. The proposed SEPA framework is optimized in an end-to-end manner, which could be incorporated into various GNN architectures.

  abstract     = {Although existing reconstruction-based multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD) methods have shown advanced performance, most assume the training data is clean. When faced with noise or contamination in training data, they can also reconstruct the anomaly well, weakening the distinction between normal and anomaly. Some probabilistic generation-based methods have been used to address this issue because of their implicit robust structure to noise, but the training process and suppression of anomalous generalization are not stable. The recently proposed explicit method based on the memory module would also sacrifice the reconstruction effect of normal patterns, resulting in limited performance improvement. Moreover, most existing MTSAD methods use a single fixed-length window for input, which weakens their ability to extract long-term dependency. This paper proposes a robust multi-scale feature extraction framework with the dual memory module to comprehensively extract features fusing different levels of semantic information and lengths of temporal dependency. First, this paper designs consecutive neighboring windows as inputs to allow the model to extract local and long-term dependency information. Secondly, a dual memory-augmented encoder is proposed to extract global typical patterns and local common features. It ensures the reconstruction ability of normal data while suppressing the generalization of the anomaly. Finally, this paper proposes a multi-scale fusion module to fuse latent variables representing different levels of semantic information and uses the reconstructed latent variables to reconstruct samples for anomaly detection. Experimental results on five datasets from diverse domains show that the proposed method outperforms 16 typical baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been increasingly investigated to enhance the transparency of black-box artificial intelligence models, promoting better user understanding and trust. Developing an XAI that is faithful to models and plausible to users is both a necessity and a challenge. This work examines whether embedding human attention knowledge into saliency-based XAI methods for computer vision models could enhance their plausibility and faithfulness. Two novel XAI methods for object detection models, namely FullGrad-CAM and FullGrad-CAM++, were first developed to generate object-specific explanations by extending the current gradient-based XAI methods for image classification models. Using human attention as the objective plausibility measure, these methods achieve higher explanation plausibility. Interestingly, all current XAI methods when applied to object detection models generally produce saliency maps that are less faithful to the model than human attention maps from the same object detection task. Accordingly, human attention-guided XAI (HAG-XAI) was proposed to learn from human attention how to best combine explanatory information from the models to enhance explanation plausibility by using trainable activation functions and smoothing kernels to maximize the similarity between XAI saliency map and human attention map. The proposed XAI methods were evaluated on widely used BDD-100K, MS-COCO, and ImageNet datasets and compared with typical gradient-based and perturbation-based XAI methods. Results suggest that HAG-XAI enhanced explanation plausibility and user trust at the expense of faithfulness for image classification models, and it enhanced plausibility, faithfulness, and user trust simultaneously and outperformed existing state-of-the-art XAI methods for object detection models.},

Thus, we can design strategies to avoid overfitting that are formulated in terms of regularization and early-stopping tuning.

Also, we give a novel nonquadratic function to settle the asymmetric constraints. One thing worth noting is that the method used in this paper to solve asymmetric constraints eliminates the strict restriction on the control matrix compared to the previous ones. Further, the optimal controls, the worst disturbances, and the tracking Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation are derived. Next, a single critic neural network is built to estimate the optimal cost function, thus obtaining the approximations of the optimal controls and the worst disturbances. The critic network weight is updated by the normalized steepest descent algorithm. Additionally, based on the Lyapunov method, the stability of the tracking error and the weight estimation error of the critic network is analyzed.

  abstract     = {In modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, optimizing the Bellman error is a critical element across various algorithms, notably in deep Q-Learning and related methodologies. Traditional approaches predominantly employ the mean-squared Bellman error (MSELoss) as the standard loss function. However, the assumption of Bellman errors following the Gaussian distribution may oversimplify the nuanced characteristics of RL applications. In this work, we revisit the distribution of Bellman error in RL training, demonstrating that it tends to follow the Logistic distribution rather than the commonly assumed Normal distribution. We propose replacing MSELoss with a Logistic maximum likelihood function (LLoss) and rigorously test this hypothesis through extensive numerical experiments across diverse online and offline RL environments. Our findings consistently show that integrating the Logistic correction into the loss functions of various baseline RL methods leads to superior performance compared to their MSE counterparts. Additionally, we employ Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests to substantiate that the Logistic distribution offers a more accurate fit for approximating Bellman errors. This study also offers a novel theoretical contribution by establishing a clear connection between the distribution of Bellman error and the practice of proportional reward scaling, a common technique for performance enhancement in RL. Moreover, we explore the sample-accuracy trade-off involved in approximating the Logistic distribution, leveraging the Bias–Variance decomposition to mitigate excessive computational resources. The theoretical and empirical insights presented in this study lay a significant foundation for future research, potentially advancing methodologies, and understanding in RL, particularly in the distribution-based optimization of Bellman error.},

  abstract     = {In scenarios like privacy protection or large-scale data transmission, data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods are proposed to learn Knowledge Distillation (KD) when data is not accessible. They generate pseudo samples by extracting the knowledge from teacher model, and utilize above pseudo samples for KD. The challenge in previous DFKD methods lies in the static nature of their target distributions and they focus on learning the instance-level distributions, causing its reliance on the pretrained teacher model. To address above concerns, our study introduces a novel DFKD approach known as AdaDFKD, designed to establish and utilize relationships among pseudo samples, which is adaptive to the student model, and finally effectively mitigates the aforementioned risk. We achieve this by generating from “easy-to-discriminate” samples to “hard-to-discriminate” samples as human does. We design a relationship refinement module (R 2 2 M) to optimize the generation process, wherein we learn a progressive conditional distribution of negative samples and maximize the log-likelihood of inter-sample similarity of pseudosamples. Theoretically, we discover that such design of AdaDFKD both minimize the divergence and maximize the mutual information between the distribution of teacher and student models. Above results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art (SOTA) DFKD methods across various benchmarks, teacher–student pairs, and evaluation metrics, as well as robustness and fast convergence.},

  abstract     = {Occluded person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task, as pedestrians are often obstructed by various occlusions, such as non-pedestrian objects or non-target pedestrians. Previous methods have heavily relied on auxiliary models to obtain information in unoccluded regions, such as human pose estimation. However, these auxiliary models fall short in accounting for pedestrian occlusions, thereby leading to potential misrepresentations. In addition, some previous works learned feature representations from single images, ignoring the potential relations among samples. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Multi-Level Relation-Aware Transformer (MLRAT) model for occluded person Re-ID. This model mainly encompasses two novel modules: Patch-Level Relation-Aware (PLRA) and Sample-Level Relation-Aware (SLRA). PLRA learns fine-grained local features by modeling the structural relations between key patches, bypassing the dependency on auxiliary models. It adopts a model-free method to select key patches that have high semantic correlation with the final pedestrian representation. In particular, to alleviate the interference of occlusion, PLRA captures the structural relations among key patches via a two-layer Graph Convolution Network (GCN), effectively guiding the local feature fusion and learning. SLRA is designed to facilitate the model to learn discriminative features by modeling the relations among samples. Specifically, to mitigate noisy relations of irrelevant samples, we present a Relation-Aware Transformer (RAT) block to capture the relations among neighbors. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between training and testing phases, a self-distillation method is employed to transfer the sample-level relations captured by SLRA to the backbone. Extensive experiments are conducted on four occluded datasets, two partial datasets and two holistic datasets. The results show that the proposed MLRAT model significantly outperforms existing baselines on four occluded datasets, while maintains top performance on two partial datasets and two holistic datasets.},

  abstract     = {Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE), a subtask of fine-grained sentiment analysis, aims to extract aspect terms, opinion terms, and their corresponding sentiment polarities from sentences. Previous methods often enumerated all possible spans of aspects and opinions as candidate spans that contain many invalid and irrelevant spans. This made the model training and prediction more difficult due to noised spans, leading to poor performance. To address this issue, we first propose a novel span-level approach that explicitly considers prior grammatical knowledge to generate possible candidate spans by part-of-speech filtering. In this way, our approach can make the model easier to be trained and achieve higher performance at the test stage. Besides, the quality of span-level representation of aspects and opinions is crucial for predicting their sentiment relation. To build a high-quality span-level representation of aspects and opinions, we first incorporate the contextual embedding of the entire sequence into span-level representations. Then, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on contrastive learning to make a more compact representation of the same polarities. Experimental evaluations on the 14Lap, 14Res, 15Res, and 16Res datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in span-based triplet extraction.},

  abstract     = {Homeostasis is a self-regulatory process, wherein an organism maintains a specific internal physiological state. Homeostatic reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework recently proposed in computational neuroscience to explain animal behavior. Homeostatic RL organizes the behaviors of autonomous embodied agents according to the demands of the internal dynamics of their bodies, coupled with the external environment. Thus, it provides a basis for real-world autonomous agents, such as robots, to continually acquire and learn integrated behaviors for survival. However, prior studies have generally explored problems pertaining to limited size, as the agent must handle observations of such coupled dynamics. To overcome this restriction, we developed an advanced method to realize scaled-up homeostatic RL using deep RL. Furthermore, several rewards for homeostasis have been proposed in the literature. We identified that the reward definition that uses the difference in drive function yields the best results. We created two benchmark environments for homeostasis and performed a behavioral analysis. The analysis showed that the trained agents in each environment changed their behavior based on their internal physiological states. Finally, we extended our method to address vision using deep convolutional neural networks. The analysis of a trained agent revealed that it has visual saliency rooted in the survival environment and internal representations resulting from multimodal input.},

  abstract     = {The circuitry and pathways in the brains of humans and other species have long inspired researchers and system designers to develop accurate and efficient systems capable of solving real-world problems and responding in real-time. We propose the Syllable-Specific Temporal Encoding (SSTE) to learn vocal sequences in a reservoir of Izhikevich neurons, by forming associations between exclusive input activities and their corresponding syllables in the sequence. Our model converts the audio signals to cochleograms using the CAR-FAC model to simulate a brain-like auditory learning and memorization process. The reservoir is trained using a hardware-friendly approach to FORCE learning. Reservoir computing could yield associative memory dynamics with far less computational complexity compared to RNNs. The SSTE-based learning enables competent accuracy and stable recall of spatiotemporal sequences with fewer reservoir inputs compared with existing encodings in the literature for similar purpose, offering resource savings. The encoding points to syllable onsets and allows recalling from a desired point in the sequence, making it particularly suitable for recalling subsets of long vocal sequences. The SSTE demonstrates the capability of learning new signals without forgetting previously memorized sequences and displays robustness against occasional noise, a characteristic of real-world scenarios. The components of this model are configured to improve resource consumption and computational intensity, addressing some of the cost-efficiency issues that might arise in future implementations aiming for compactness and real-time, low-power operation. Overall, this model proposes a brain-inspired pattern generation network for vocal sequences that can be extended with other bio-inspired computations to explore their potentials for brain-like auditory perception. Future designs could inspire from this model to implement embedded devices that learn vocal sequences and recall them as needed in real-time. Such systems could acquire language and speech, operate as artificial assistants, and transcribe text to speech, in the presence of natural noise and corruption on audio data.},

To address these challenges, we present a novel semi-supervised, consistency-based approach termed the data-efficient medical segmenter (DEMS). The DEMS features an encoder–decoder architecture and incorporates the developed online automatic augmenter (OAA) and residual robustness enhancement (RRE) blocks. The OAA augments input data with various image transformations, thereby diversifying the dataset to improve the generalization ability. The RRE enriches feature diversity and introduces perturbations to create varied inputs for different decoders, thereby providing enhanced variability. Moreover, we introduce a sensitive loss to further enhance consistency across different decoders and stabilize the training process. Extensive experimental results on both our own and three public datasets affirm the effectiveness of DEMS. Under extreme data shortage scenarios, our DEMS achieves 16.85% and 10.37% improvement in dice score compared with the U-Net and top-performed state-of-the-art method, respectively. Given its superior data efficiency, DEMS could present significant advancements in medical segmentation under small data regimes.

Some models employ simple static distributions, i.e. uniform or Bernoulli distribution, and it is difficult for these methods to be trained distinguishably because of the sampled uninformative negative triplets. Furthermore, current methods are confined to constructing negative triplets from existing entities within the knowledge graph, limiting their ability to explore harder negatives. We introduce a novel mixing strategy in knowledge graphs called M 2 2 ixKG.

A common approach to designing these algorithms is crafting a processing pipeline by hand. Unfortunately, once the context changes, the researcher may need to define a new function to adapt. A deep hashing approach exploits the feature learning capabilities in deep networks to generate a feature vector that summarizes the perceptual content in the image, achieving outstanding performance for the image retrieval task, which requires measuring semantic and perceptual similarity between items. However, its application to robust content identification systems is an open area of opportunity. Also, image hashing functions are valuable tools for image authentication. However, to our knowledge, its application to content-preserving manipulation detection for image forensics tasks is still an open research area.

  abstract     = {The rich information underlying graphs has inspired further investigation of unsupervised graph representation. Existing studies mainly depend on node features and topological properties within static graphs to create self-supervised signals, neglecting the temporal components carried by real-world graph data, such as timestamps of edges. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores how to model temporal evolution on dynamic graphs elegantly. Specifically, we introduce a new inductive bias, namely temporal translation invariance, which illustrates the tendency of the identical node to keep similar labels across different timespans. Based on this assumption, we develop a dynamic graph representation framework CLDG that encourages the node to maintain locally consistent temporal translation invariance through contrastive learning on different timespans. Except for standard CLDG which only considers explicit topological links, our further proposed CLDG＋＋additionally employs graph diffusion to uncover global contextual correlations between nodes, and designs a multi-scale contrastive learning objective composed of local–local, local–global, and global–global contrasts to enhance representation capabilities. Interestingly, by measuring the consistency between different timespans to shape anomaly indicators, CLDG and CLDG＋＋are seamlessly integrated with the task of spotting anomalies on dynamic graphs, which has broad applications in many high-impact domains, such as finance, cybersecurity, and healthcare. Experiments demonstrate that CLDG and CLDG＋＋both exhibit desirable performance in downstream tasks including node classification and dynamic graph anomaly detection. Moreover, CLDG significantly reduces time and space complexity by implicitly exploiting temporal cues instead of complicated sequence models.

  abstract     = {Most trackers formulate visual tracking as common classification and regression ( i.e. , bounding box regression) tasks. Correlation features that are computed through depth-wise convolution or channel-wise multiplication operations are input into both the classification and regression branches for inference. However, this matching computation with the linear correlation method tends to lose semantic features and obtain only a local optimum. Moreover, these trackers use an unreliable ranking based on the classification score and the intersection over union (IoU) loss for the regression training, thus degrading the tracking performance. In this paper, we introduce a deformable transformer model, which effectively computes the correlation features of the training and search sets. A new loss called the quality-aware focal loss (QAFL) is used to train the classification network; it efficiently alleviates the inconsistency between the classification and localization quality predictions. We use a new regression loss called α α -GIoU to train the regression network, and it effectively improves localization accuracy. To further improve the tracker’s robustness, the candidate object location is predicted by using a combination of online learning scores with a transformer-assisted framework and classification scores. An extensive experiment on six testing datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. In particular, the proposed method attains a success score of 71.7% on the OTB-2015 dataset and an AUC score of 67.3% on the NFS30 dataset, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The curse-of-dimensionality taxes computational resources heavily with exponentially increasing computational cost as the dimension increases. This poses great challenges in solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), as Richard E. Bellman first pointed out over 60 years ago. While there has been some recent success in solving numerical PDEs in high dimensions, such computations are prohibitively expensive, and true scaling of general nonlinear PDEs to high dimensions has never been achieved. We develop a new method of scaling up physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve arbitrary high-dimensional PDEs. The new method, called Stochastic Dimension Gradient Descent (SDGD), decomposes a gradient of PDEs’ and PINNs’ residual into pieces corresponding to different dimensions and randomly samples a subset of these dimensional pieces in each iteration of training PINNs. We prove theoretically the convergence and other desired properties of the proposed method. We demonstrate in various diverse tests that the proposed method can solve many notoriously hard high-dimensional PDEs, including the Hamilton–Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and the Schrödinger equations in tens of thousands of dimensions very fast on a single GPU using the PINNs mesh-free approach. Notably, we solve nonlinear PDEs with nontrivial, anisotropic, and inseparable solutions in less than one hour for 1000 dimensions and in 12 h for 100,000 dimensions on a single GPU using SDGD with PINNs. Since SDGD is a general training methodology of PINNs, it can be applied to any current and future variants of PINNs to scale them up for arbitrary high-dimensional PDEs.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing the evolution pattern of traffic condition and making accurate prediction play a vital role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). With the massive increase of available traffic data, deep learning-based models have attracted considerable attention for their impressive performance in traffic forecasting. However, the majority of existing approaches neglect to model of asynchronously dynamic spatio-temporal correlation and fail to consider the impact of historical traffic data on future condition. Additionally, the attribute of deep learning method presents challenges in interpreting the explicit spatiotemporal relationships. In order to enhance the accuracy of traffic prediction as well as extract comprehensive and explainable spatial–temporal relevance in traffic networks, we propose a novel attention-based local spatial and temporal relation discovery (ALSTRD) model. Our model firstly implements feature representation learning to effectively express latent input traffic information. Then, a local attention mechanism structure is established to model asynchronous dependencies of historical input data. Finally, another attention network and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient method are introduced to extract the elaborate influence of the historical traffic condition of neighboring roads on the future condition of the target road. The experiment results on several datasets demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to other baseline methods, which can be attributed to its ability to extract the fine-grained correlation among historical traffic data and capture the dynamic association between past and future data. In addition, the incorporation of attention mechanism and Pearson Correlation Coefficient promotes the model’s ability to elucidate spatiotemporal correlations among traffic data, thereby providing a more robust explanation.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning-based deep multi-view clustering methods have become a mainstream solution for unlabeled multi-view data. These methods usually utilize a basic structure that combines autoencoder, contrastive learning, or/and MLP projectors to generate more representative latent representations for the final clustering stage. However, existing deep contrastive multi-view clustering ignores two key points: (i) the latent representations projecting from one or more layers of MLP or new representations directly obtained from autoencoder fail to mine inherent relationship inner-view or cross-views; (ii) more existing frameworks only employ a one or dual-contrastive learning module, i.e., view- or/and category-oriented, which may result in the lack of communication between latent representations and clustering assignments. This paper proposes a new composite attention framework for contrastive multi-view clustering to address the above two challenges. Our method learns latent representations utilizing composite attention structure, i.e., Hierarchical Transformer for each view and Shared Attention for all views, rather than simple MLP. As a result, the learned representations can simultaneously preserve important features inside the view and balance the contributions across views. In addition, we add a new communication loss in our new dual contrastive framework. The common semantics will be brought into clustering assignments by pushing clustering assignments closer to the fused latent representations. Therefore, our method will provide a higher quality of clustering assignments for the segmentation problem of unlabeled multi-view data. The extensive experiments on several real data demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance over many state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, especially the significant improvement of an average of 10% on datasets Caltech and its subsets according to accuracy.},

Among various community detection methods, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)-based community detection approaches have become a popular research topic. However, most NMF-based methods overlook the network’s multi-hop information, let alone the community detection results specific to each hop of the network. In this paper, we propose Dual-learning Multi-hop NMF (DL-MHNMF), a method that considers not only the multi-hop connectivity between two nodes but also factors in the shared results across multiple hops and the impact of differences in the specific results at each hop on the shared outcomes. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm with guaranteed theoretical convergence is proposed for solving DL-MHNMF. Methodologically, by iteratively removing the specific results during the optimization process of DL-MHNMF, we achieve enhanced detection accuracy, which is also verified by subsequent experiments. Specifically, we compare fourteen algorithms on eleven publicly available datasets, and experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes an end-to-end algorithm framework for solving MOTSP based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). By decomposing strategies, solving MOTSP is transformed into solving multiple single-objective optimization subproblems. Through linear transformation, the features of the MOTSP are combined with the weights of the objective function. Subsequently, a modified graph pointer network (GPN) model is used to solve the decomposed subproblems. Compared with the previous DRL model, the proposed algorithm can solve all the subproblems using only one model without adding weight information as input features. Furthermore, our algorithm can output a corresponding solution for each weight, which increases the diversity of solutions. In order to verify the performance of our proposed algorithm, it is compared with four classical evolutionary algorithms and two DRL algorithms on several MOTSP instances. The comparison shows that our proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms both in terms of training time and the quality of the resulting solutions.},

However, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are confined to learning local vessel features, making it challenging to capture the graph structural information and fail to perceive the global context of vessels. Therefore, we propose a novel graph neural network-guided vision transformer enhanced network (G2ViT) for vessel segmentation. G2ViT skillfully orchestrates the Convolutional Neural Network, Graph Neural Network, and Vision Transformer to enhance comprehension of the entire graphical structure of blood vessels. To achieve deeper insights into the global graph structure and higher-level global context cognizance, we investigate a graph neural network-guided vision transformer module. This module constructs graph-structured representation in an unprecedented manner using the high-level features extracted by CNNs for graph reasoning. To increase the receptive field while ensuring minimal loss of edge information, G2ViT introduces a multi-scale edge feature attention module (MEFA), leveraging dilated convolutions with different dilation rates and the Sobel edge detection algorithm to obtain multi-scale edge information of vessels. To avoid critical information loss during upsampling and downsampling, we design a multi-level feature fusion module (MLF2) to fuse complementary information between coarse and fine features. Experiments on retinal vessel datasets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF) and coronary angiography datasets (DCA1 and CHUAC) indicate that the G2ViT excels in robustness, generality, and applicability. Furthermore, it has acceptable inference time and computational complexity and presents a new solution for blood vessel segmentation.},

In this study, we propose a threshold learning algorithm for a variation-tolerant ternary neural network in a memristor crossbar array. This algorithm utilizes two tightly separated resistance states in memristive devices to represent weight values. The high-resistance state (HRS) and low-resistance state (LRS) defined as read current of 1 μA, respectively, were successfully programmed in a 32 × 32 crossbar array, and exhibited half-normal distributions due to the programming method. To validate our approach experimentally, a 64 × 10 single-layer fully connected network were trained in the fabricated crossbar for an 8 × 8 MNIST dataset using the threshold learning algorithm, where the weight value is updated when a gradient determined by backpropagation exceeds a threshold value. Thanks to the large margin between the two states of the memristor, we observed only a 0.42 % drop in classification accuracy compared to the baseline network results. The threshold learning algorithm is expected to alleviate the programming burden and be utilized in variation-tolerant neuromorphic architectures.},

However, it requires a large amount of simulated data, which can be costly to collect. This can be avoided by learning physics from the physics-constrained loss, which we refer to it as mean squared residual (MSR) loss constructed by the discretized PDE. We investigate the physical information in the MSR loss, which we called long-range entanglements, and identify the challenge that the neural network requires the capacity to model the long-range entanglements in the spatial domain of the PDE, whose patterns vary in different PDEs. To tackle the challenge, we propose LordNet, a tunable and efficient neural network for modeling various entanglements. Inspired by the traditional solvers, LordNet models the long-range entanglements with a series of matrix multiplications, which can be seen as the low-rank approximation to the general fully-connected layers and extracts the dominant pattern with reduced computational cost. The experiments on solving Poisson’s equation and (2D and 3D) Navier–Stokes equation demonstrate that the long-range entanglements from the MSR loss can be well modeled by the LordNet, yielding better accuracy and generalization ability than other neural networks. The results show that the Lordnet can be 40 × 40× faster than traditional PDE solvers. In addition, LordNet outperforms other modern neural network architectures in accuracy and efficiency with the smallest parameter size.},

As garment transfer leverages wild and cheap garment input, it has attracted tremendous attention in the community and has a huge commercial potential. Since the ground truth of garment transfer is almost unavailable in reality, previous studies have treated garment transfer as either pose transfer or garment-pose disentanglement, and trained garment transfer in self-supervised learning, However, these implementation methods do not cover garment transfer intentions completely and face the robustness issue in the testing phase. Notably, virtual try-on technology has exhibited superior performance using self-supervised learning, we propose to supervise the garment transfer training via knowledge distillation from virtual try-on. Specifically, the overall pipeline is first to infer a garment transfer parsing, and to use it to guide downstream warping and inpainting tasks. The transfer parsing reasoning model learns the response and feature knowledge from the try-on parsing reasoning model and absorbs the hard knowledge from the ground truth. The progressive flow warping model learns the content knowledge from virtual try-on for a reasonable and precise garment warping. To enhance transfer realism, we propose an arm regrowth task to infer exposed skin. Experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance in transferring garments between persons compared with other virtual try-on and garment transfer methods.},

Our method learns representations concurrently using metric and reconstruction learning as similarity constraints, and augments response of network to objects through semantic feature constraints for better generalization performance. Furthermore, rotation matrices serve as templates for codebook construction, leading to excellent matching accuracy compared to rendered images. Notably, it contributes to the effective decoupling of object categories and templates, necessitating the maintenance of only a shared codebook in multi-object pose estimation tasks. Extensive experiments on Linemod, Linemod-Occluded and TLESS datasets demonstrate that the proposed method employing shared templates achieves superior matching accuracy. Moreover, proposed method exhibits robustness on a collected aircraft dataset, further validating its efficacy.},

  abstract     = {A brain–computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are currently the most popular for able-bodied users. To increase user-friendliness, usually a small amount of user-specific EEG data are used for calibration, which may not be enough to develop a pure data-driven decoding model. To cope with this typical calibration data shortage challenge in EEG-based BCIs, this paper proposes a parameter-free channel reflection (CR) data augmentation approach that incorporates prior knowledge on the channel distributions of different BCI paradigms in data augmentation. Experiments on eight public EEG datasets across four different BCI paradigms (motor imagery, steady-state visual evoked potential, P300, and seizure classifications) using different decoding algorithms demonstrated that: (1) CR is effective, i.e., it can noticeably improve the classification accuracy; (2) CR is robust, i.e., it consistently outperforms existing data augmentation approaches in the literature; and, (3) CR is flexible, i.e., it can be combined with other data augmentation approaches to further improve the performance. We suggest that data augmentation approaches like CR should be an essential step in EEG-based BCIs. Our code is available online.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful approach to learning visual representations without requiring extensive manual annotation. One popular technique involves using rotation transformations of images, which provide a clear visual signal for learning semantic representation. However, in this work, we revisit the pretext task of predicting image rotation in self-supervised learning and discover that it tends to marginalise the perception of features located near the centre of an image. To address this limitation, we propose a new self-supervised learning method, namely FullRot, which spotlights underrated regions by resizing the randomly selected and cropped regions of images. Moreover, FullRot increases the complexity of the rotation pretext task by applying the degree-free rotation to the region cropped into a circle. To encourage models to learn from different general parts of an image, we introduce a new data mixture technique called WRMix, which merges two random intra-image patches. By combining these innovative crop and rotation methods with the data mixture scheme, our approach, FullRot + WRMix, surpasses the state-of-the-art self-supervision methods in classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks on ten benchmark datasets with an improvement of up to +13.98% accuracy on STL-10, +8.56% accuracy on CIFAR-10, +10.20% accuracy on Sports-100, +15.86% accuracy on Mammals-45, +15.15% accuracy on PAD-UFES-20, +32.44% mIoU on VOC 2012, +7.62% mIoU on ISIC 2018, +9.70% mIoU on FloodArea, +25.16% AP 50 on VOC 2007, and +58.69% AP 50 on UTDAC 2020.

  abstract     = {Generalized Person Re-Identification (GReID) aims to develop a model capable of robust generalization across unseen target domains, even with training on a limited set of observed domains. Recently, methods based on the Attack-Defense mechanism are emerging as a prevailing technology to this issue, which treats domain transformation as a type of attack and enhances the model’s generalization performance on the target domain by equipping it with a defense module. However, a significant limitation of most existing approaches is their inability to effectively model complex domain transformations, largely due to the separation of attack and defense components. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an innovative Interactive Attack-Defense (IAD) mechanism for GReID. The core of IAD is the interactive learning of two models: an attack model and a defense model. The attack model dynamically generates directional attack information responsive to the current state of the defense model, while the defense model is designed to derive generalizable representations by utilizing a variety of attack samples. The training approach involves a dual process: for the attack model, the aim is to increase the challenge for the defense model in countering the attack; conversely, for the defense model, the focus is on minimizing the effects instigated by the attack model. This interactive framework allows for mutual learning between attack and defense, creating a synergistic learning environment. Our diverse experiments across datasets confirm IAD’s effectiveness, consistently surpassing current state-of-the-art methods, and using MSMT17 as the target domain in different protocols resulted in a notable 13.4% improvement in GReID task average Rank-1 accuracy.

Recent works construct auxiliary losses based on reconstruction or mutual information to extract joint representations from multiple sensory inputs to improve the sample efficiency and performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the representations learned by these methods could capture information irrelevant to learning a policy and may degrade the performance. We argue that compressing information in the learned joint representations about raw multimodal observations is helpful, and propose a multimodal information bottleneck model to learn task-relevant joint representations from egocentric images and proprioception. Our model compresses and retains the predictive information in multimodal observations for learning a compressed joint representation, which fuses complementary information from visual and proprioceptive feedback and meanwhile filters out task-irrelevant information in raw multimodal observations. We propose to minimize the upper bound of our multimodal information bottleneck objective for computationally tractable optimization. Experimental evaluations on several challenging locomotion tasks with egocentric images and proprioception show that our method achieves better sample efficiency and zero-shot robustness to unseen white noise than leading baselines. We also empirically demonstrate that leveraging information from egocentric images and proprioception is more helpful for learning policies on locomotion tasks than solely using one single modality.},

A popular way of building high-performance deep SNNs is to convert ANNs to SNNs, taking advantage of advanced and well-trained ANNs. Here we propose an ANN to SNN conversion methodology that uses a time-based coding scheme, named At-most-two-spike Exponential Coding (AEC), and a corresponding AEC spiking neuron model for ANN-SNN conversion. AEC neurons employ quantization-compensating spikes to improve coding accuracy and capacity, with each neuron generating up to two spikes within the time window. Two exponential decay functions with tunable parameters are proposed to represent the dynamic encoding thresholds, based on which pixel intensities are encoded into spike times and spike times are decoded into pixel intensities. The hyper-parameters of AEC neurons are fine-tuned based on the loss function of SNN-decoded values and ANN-activation values. In addition, we design two regularization terms for the number of spikes, providing the possibility to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy, latency and power consumption. The experimental results show that, compared to other similar methods, the proposed scheme not only obtains deep SNNs with higher accuracy, but also has more significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency and inference latency.

  abstract     = {Local Interpretability Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is a well-known post-hoc technique for explaining black-box models. While very useful, recent research highlights challenges around the explanations generated. In particular, there is a potential lack of stability, where the explanations provided vary over repeated runs of the algorithm, casting doubt on their reliability. This paper investigates the stability of LIME when applied to multivariate time series classification. We demonstrate that the traditional methods for generating neighbours used in LIME carry a high risk of creating ‘fake’ neighbours, which are out-of-distribution in respect to the trained model and far away from the input to be explained. This risk is particularly pronounced for time series data because of their substantial temporal dependencies. We discuss how these out-of-distribution neighbours contribute to unstable explanations. Furthermore, LIME weights neighbours based on user-defined hyperparameters which are problem-dependent and hard to tune. We show how unsuitable hyperparameters can impact the stability of explanations. We propose a two-fold approach to address these issues. First, a generative model is employed to approximate the distribution of the training data set, from which within-distribution samples and thus meaningful neighbours can be created for LIME. Second, an adaptive weighting method is designed in which the hyperparameters are easier to tune than those of the traditional method. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing more stable explanations using the LIME framework. In addition, in-depth discussions are provided on the reasons behind these results.},

Secondly, they excessively consider irrelevant entities, thereby reducing extraction efficiency and precision. To address these issues, we propose a novel Two-phase Graph Inference Network (TGIN) approach for extracting document-level events. In the first phase, TGIN constructs a heterogeneous document-level graph to capture complex interactions among nodes of different granularity, enabling the acquisition of document-aware features. Subsequently, a dedicated module is developed to extract relevant entity pairs within the same event record. This module utilizes a key information aggregator with an attention mechanism to explicitly aggregate key sentences for entity pairs. In the second phase, the entity links predicted in the first phase serve as prior information to construct the entity-level graph, which focuses on modeling interactions between entity pairs that potentially share the same event link, effectively reducing error propagation. Experimental results on the publicly available document-level event extraction dataset ChFinAnn demonstrate the superiority of our framework over most existing models.},

RL agents can make decisions at variable time scales in the form of temporal abstractions, also known as options. The issue of discovering options has seen a considerable research effort. Most notably, the Interest Option Critic (IOC) algorithm first extends the initial set to the interest function, providing a method for learning options specialized to certain state space regions. This approach offers a specific attention mechanism for action selection. Unfortunately, this method still suffers from the classic issues of poor data efficiency and lack of flexibility in RL when learning options end-to-end through backpropagation. This paper proposes a new approach called Salience Interest Option Critic (SIOC), which chooses subsets of existing initiation sets for RL. Specifically, these subsets are not learned by backpropagation, which is slow and tends to overfit, but through particle filters. This approach enables the rapid and flexible identification of critical subsets using only reward feedback. We conducted experiments in discrete and continuous domains, and our proposed method demonstrate higher efficiency and flexibility than other methods. The generated options are more valuable within a single task and exhibited greater interpretability and reusability in multi-task learning scenarios.},

However, the complex laws of the physical world pose significant challenges to the learning based simulations, such as the varying spatial dependencies between interacting particles and varying temporal dependencies between particle system states in different time stamps, which dominate particles’ interacting behavior and the physical systems’ evolution patterns. Existing learning based methods fail to fully account for the complexities, making them unable to yield satisfactory simulations. To better comprehend the complex physical laws, we propose a novel model – Graph Networks with Spatial–Temporal neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNSTODE) – that characterizes the varying spatial and temporal dependencies in particle systems using a united end-to-end framework. Through training with real-world particle–particle interaction observations, GNSTODE can simulate any possible particle systems with high precisions. We empirically evaluate GNSTODE’s simulation performance on two real-world particle systems, Gravity and Coulomb, with varying levels of spatial and temporal dependencies. The results show that GNSTODE yields better simulations than state-of-the-art methods, showing that GNSTODE can serve as an effective tool for particle simulation in real-world applications.

However, the high inference computation cost poses a new challenge. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem, mainly by slimming patches. In the inference stage, these methods classify patches into two classes, one to keep and the other to discard in multiple layers. This approach results in additional computation at every layer where patches are discarded, which hinders inference acceleration. In this study, we tackle the patch slimming problem from a different perspective by proposing a life regression module that determines the lifespan of each image patch in one go. During inference, the patch is discarded once the current layer index exceeds its life. Our proposed method avoids additional computation and parameters in multiple layers to enhance inference speed while maintaining competitive performance.

  abstract     = {Malaria is a significant health concern worldwide, particularly in Africa where its prevalence is still alarmingly high. Using artificial intelligence algorithms to diagnose cells with malaria provides great convenience for clinicians. In this paper, a densely connected convolutional dynamic learning network (DCDLN) is proposed for the diagnosis of malaria disease. Specifically, after data processing and partitioning of the dataset, the densely connected block is trained as a feature extractor. To classify the features extracted by the feature extractor, a classifier based on a dynamic learning network is proposed in this paper. Based on experimental results, the proposed DCDLN method demonstrates a diagnostic accuracy rate of 97.23%, surpassing the diagnostic performance than existing advanced methods on an open malaria cell dataset. This accurate diagnostic effect provides convincing evidence for clinicians to make a correct diagnosis. In addition, to validate the superiority and generalization capability of the DCDLN algorithm, we also applied the algorithm to the skin cancer and garbage classification datasets. DCDLN achieved good results on these datasets as well, demonstrating that the DCDLN algorithm possesses superiority and strong generalization performance.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems play a significant role in facilitating how individuals with neurological impairments effectively interact with their environment. In real world applications of BCI system for clinical assistance and rehabilitation training, the EEG classifier often needs to learn on sequentially arriving subjects in an online manner. As patterns of EEG signals can be significantly different for different subjects, the EEG classifier can easily erase knowledge of learnt subjects after learning on later ones as it performs decoding in online streaming scenario, namely catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we tackle this problem with a memory-based approach, which considers the following conditions: (1) subjects arrive sequentially in an online manner, with no large scale dataset available for joint training beforehand, (2) data volume from the different subjects could be imbalanced, (3) decoding difficulty of the sequential streaming signal vary, (4) continual classification for a long time is required. This online sequential EEG decoding problem is more challenging than classic cross subject EEG decoding as there is no large-scale training data from the different subjects available beforehand. The proposed model keeps a small balanced memory buffer during sequential learning, with memory data dynamically selected based on joint consideration of data volume and informativeness. Furthermore, for the more general scenarios where subject identity is unknown to the EEG decoder, aka. subject agnostic scenario, we propose a kernel based subject shift detection method that identifies underlying subject changes on the fly in a computationally efficient manner. We develop challenging benchmarks of streaming EEG data from sequentially arriving subjects with both balanced and imbalanced data volumes, and performed extensive experiments with a detailed ablation study on the proposed model. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, enabling the decoder to maintain performance on all previously seen subjects over a long period of sequential decoding. The model demonstrates the potential for real-world applications.},

On the one hand, to deal with the uncertainty of interval-valued information, the LU-optimality condition of IVOPs is established through a deterministic form. On the other hand, according to the penalty method and adaptive controller, the interval partial order constraint and set constraint are punished by one adaptive parameter, which is a key enabler for the feasibility of states while having a lower solution space dimension and avoiding estimating exact penalty parameters. Through nonsmooth analysis and Lyapunov theory, the proposed adaptive penalty-based neurodynamic approach (APNA) is proven to converge to an LU-solution of the considered IVOPs.

  abstract     = {Estimating long-term causal effects based on short-term surrogates is a significant but challenging problem in many real-world applications such as marketing and medicine. Most existing methods estimate causal effects in an idealistic and simplistic manner — disregarding unobserved surrogates and treating all short-term outcomes as surrogates. However, such methods are not well-suited to real-world scenarios where the partially observed surrogates are mixed with the proxies of unobserved surrogates among short-term outcomes. To address this issue, we develop our flexible method called LASER to estimate long-term causal effects in a more realistic situation where the surrogates are either observed or have observed proxies. In LASER, we employ an identifiable variational autoencoder to learn the latent surrogate representation by using all the surrogate candidates without the need to distinguish observed surrogates or proxies of unobserved surrogates. With the learned representation, we further devise a theoretically guaranteed and unbiased estimation of long-term causal effects. Extensive experimental results on the real-world and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Providing a model that achieves a strong predictive performance and is simultaneously interpretable by humans is one of the most difficult challenges in machine learning research due to the conflicting nature of these two objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a modification of the radial basis function neural network model by equipping its Gaussian kernel with a learnable precision matrix. We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability. We conducted numerical experiments for regression, classification, and feature selection tasks, comparing our model against popular machine learning models, the state-of-the-art deep learning-based embedding feature selection techniques, and a transformer model for tabular data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model does not only yield an attractive prediction performance compared to the competitors but also provides meaningful and interpretable results that potentially could assist the decision-making process in real-world applications.

JTFT combines time and frequency domain representations to make predictions. The frequency domain representation efficiently extracts multi-scale dependencies while maintaining sparsity by utilizing a small number of learnable frequencies. Simultaneously, the time domain (TD) representation is derived from a fixed number of the most recent data points, strengthening the modeling of local relationships and mitigating the effects of non-stationarity. Importantly, the length of the representation remains independent of the input sequence length, enabling JTFT to achieve linear computational complexity. Furthermore, a low-rank attention layer is proposed to efficiently capture cross-dimensional dependencies, thus preventing performance degradation resulting from the entanglement of temporal and channel-wise modeling. Experimental results on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that JTFT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive performance.},

Existing attacks focus on increasing the frequency of ID switching, which greatly damages tracking stability, but is not enough to make the tracker completely ineffective. To fully explore the potential of adversarial attacks, we propose Blind-Blur Attack (BBA), a novel attack method based on spatio-temporal motion information to fool multi-object trackers. Specifically, a simple but efficient perturbation generator is trained with the blind-blur loss, simultaneously making the target invisible to the tracker and letting the background be regarded as moving targets.

They have the potential to serve as low-power alternatives to artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their sparse and event-driven nature. However, existing SNN-based models for pixel-level semantic segmentation tasks suffer from poor performance and high memory overhead, failing to fully exploit the computational effectiveness and efficiency of SNNs. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-scale and full spike segmentation network (MFS-Seg), which is based on the deep direct trained SNN and represents the first attempt to train a deep SNN with surrogate gradients for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we design an efficient fully-spike residual block (EFS-Res) to alleviate representation issues caused by spiking noise on different channels. EFS-Res utilizes depthwise separable convolution to improve the distributions of spiking feature maps. The visualization shows that our model can effectively extract the edge features of segmented objects. Furthermore, it can significantly reduce the memory overhead and energy consumption of the network. In addition, we theoretically analyze and prove that EFS-Res can avoid the degradation problem based on block dynamical isometry theory. Experimental results on the Camvid dataset, the DDD17 dataset, and the DSEC-Semantic dataset show that our model achieves comparable performance to the mainstream UNet network with up to 31 × × fewer parameters, while significantly reducing power consumption by over 13 × × . Overall, our MFS-Seg model demonstrates promising results in terms of performance, memory efficiency, and energy consumption, showcasing the potential of deep SNNs for semantic segmentation tasks.

Many graph analytic applications can be formulated as NCPs with different measure functions, which often pose a significant challenge due to their NP-hard nature. As a result, traditional greedy algorithms, which select the vertex with the highest reward at each step, may not effectively find the optimal solution. In addition, existing learning-based algorithms do not have the ability to model the sequence of actions taken during the decision-making process, making it difficult to capture the combinatorial effect of selected vertices on the final solution. This limits the performance of learning-based approaches in non-submodular NCPs. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework called DT-NC, which adapts the D ecision T ransformer to the N etwork C ollapse problems. DT-NC takes into account the historical actions taken during the decision-making process and effectively captures the combinatorial effect of selected vertices. The ability of DT-NC to model the dependency among selected vertices allows it to address the difficulties caused by the non-submodular property of measure functions in some NCPs effectively. Through extensive experiments on various NCPs and graphs of different sizes, we demonstrate that DT-NC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits excellent transferability and generalizability.},

In span extraction, we convert sequential labels into a global boundary matrix that enables the span extractor to acquire precise boundary information irrespective of label dependency. In event classification, we align event types with an outside knowledge base like FrameNet and construct an enhanced support set, which injects more trigger information into the prototypical network of event prototypes.

The representativeness of the support data is insufficient to cover the entire class, and the support features may contain shared information that confuses the classifier, leading to biased classification. In response to this difficulty, we present a task-level feature rectification and separation (TFRS) method that effectively resolves the sample bias issue. Our main idea is to leverage prior information from base classes to rectify the support samples while removing the commonality of task-level features. This enhances the distinguishability and separability of features in space. Furthermore, TFRS offers a straightforward yet versatile solution that can be seamlessly integrated into various established FS-VAR frameworks. Our design yields significant performance enhancements across various existing works by implementing TFRS, resulting in competitive outcomes on datasets such as UCF101, Kinetics, SSv2, and HMDB51.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, distributed stochastic algorithms have become increasingly useful in the field of machine learning. However, similar to traditional stochastic algorithms, they face a challenge where achieving high fitness on the training set does not necessarily result in good performance on the test set. To address this issue, we propose to use of a distributed network topology to improve the generalization ability of the algorithms. We specifically focus on the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithm, which relies on perturbation weights to find the maximum point with better generalization ability. In this paper, we present the decentralized stochastic sharpness-aware minimization (D-SSAM) algorithm, which incorporates the distributed network topology. We also provide sublinear convergence results for non-convex targets, which is comparable to consequence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD). Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these results in deep networks and discuss their relationship to the generalization behavior of SAM.},

  abstract     = {Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to recognize both seen and unseen classes, while only samples from seen classes are available for training. The mainstream methods mitigate the lack of unseen training data by simulating the visual unseen samples. However, the sample generator is actually learned with just seen-class samples, and semantic descriptions of unseen classes are just provided to the pre-trained sample generator for unseen data generation, therefore, the generator would have bias towards seen categories, and the unseen generation quality, including both precision and diversity, is still the main learning challenge. To this end, we propose a Prototype-Guided Generation for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (PGZSL), in order to guide the sample generation with unseen knowledge. First, unseen data generation is guided and rectified in PGZSL by contrastive prototypical anchors with both class semantic consistency and feature discriminability. Second, PGZSL introduces Certainty-Driven Mixup for generator to enrich the diversity of generated unseen samples, while suppress the generation of uncertain boundary samples as well. Empirical results over five benchmark datasets show that PGZSL significantly outperforms the SOTA methods in both ZSL and GZSL tasks.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of long document classification (LDC), previous research has predominantly focused on modeling unimodal texts, overlooking the potential of multi-modal documents incorporating images. To address this gap, we introduce an innovative approach for multi-modal long document classification based on the Hierarchical Prompt and Multi-modal Transformer (HPMT). The proposed HPMT method facilitates multi-modal interactions at both the section and sentence levels, enabling a comprehensive capture of hierarchical structural features and complex multi-modal associations of long documents. Specifically, a Multi-scale Multi-modal Transformer (MsMMT) is tailored to capture the multi-granularity correlations between sentences and images. This is achieved through the incorporation of multi-scale convolutional kernels on sentence features, enhancing the model’s ability to discern intricate patterns. Furthermore, to facilitate cross-level information interaction and promote learning of specific features at different levels, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt (HierPrompt) block. This block incorporates section-level prompts and sentence-level prompts, both derived from a global prompt via distinct projection networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on four challenging multi-modal long document datasets. The results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, showcasing its performance advantages over existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Recent temporal action detection models have focused on end-to-end trainable approaches to utilize the representational power of backbone networks. Despite the advantages of end-to-end trainable methods, these models still employ a small spatial resolution (e.g., 96 × 96) due to the inefficient trade-off between computational cost and spatial resolution. In this study, we argue that a simple pooling method (e.g., adaptive average pooling) acts as a bottleneck at the spatial aggregation part, restricting representational power. To address this issue, we propose a temporal-wise spatial attentive pooling (TSAP), which alleviates the bottleneck between the backbone and the detection head using a temporal-wise attention mechanism. Our approach mitigates the inefficient trade-off between spatial resolution and computational cost, thereby enhancing spatial scalability in temporal action detection. Moreover, TSAP is adaptable to previous end-to-end approaches by simply replacing the spatial pooling part. Our experiments demonstrated the essential role of spatial aggregation, and consistent improvements are observed by incorporating TSAP into previous end-to-end methods.},

We assume that P P is restricted to lie in a bounded region and we are interested in developing a solver for obtaining all real solutions exactly (a notion that is defined in the paper) for any parameter values within the bounded region. The starting point of the proposed approach is that we assume that a numerical methods has allowed us to determine the real solutions (but not necessarily all of them) for a very limited number of fixed P P called the initial solution set . Starting from this set we show that we can create multiple pairs (parameters, solution) and that these pairs may be structured into coherent learning sets that will be used to train multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). The training process is specific: although it still uses a decrease of a loss function its main objective is to maximize the success rate i.e. the number of occurrences, expressed in percentage of number of samples of the training set, for which the Newton scheme, initialized with the MLP prediction, converges toward the expected solution. We then show that for a sufficiently large number of MLPs we may obtain a 100% success rate for all learning sets. The solver is obtained by running a set of local solvers each of which is based on a specific MLP whose prediction may lead to an exact solution of the system. This solver is tested on verification sets i.e. set of samples constituted of parameter values (all different from the samples in the learning set) and all the solutions of the corresponding system. We show that these sets may be automatically generated and that they may also be used in a self-learning process for improving the performance of the solver established from the initial solution set. This approach is illustrated on two engineering problems in robotics and chemistry and it is shown that the solver provides all solutions for any instance of P P with a high probability although we cannot guarantee it. The time required to design the final solver is large but the solving time is extremely low so that this approach should be used when the system has to be solved for a sufficient number of occurrences of the P P . Furthermore we will show that the computation time required for establishing the solver may be drastically reduced by using a distributed implementation.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Unsupervised algorithms has achieved remarkable performance in image dehazing. However, the CycleGAN framework can lead to confusion in generator learning due to inconsistent data distributions, and the DisentGAN framework lacks effective constraints on generated images, resulting in the loss of image content details and color distortion. Moreover, Squeeze and Excitation channel attention employs only fully connected layers to capture global information, lacking interaction with local information, resulting in inaccurate feature weight allocation for image dehazing. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose an Unsupervised Bidirectional Contrastive Reconstruction and Adaptive Fine-Grained Channel Attention Networks (UBRFC-Net). Specifically, an Unsupervised Bidirectional Contrastive Reconstruction Framework (BCRF) is proposed, aiming to establish bidirectional contrastive reconstruction constraints, not only to avoid the generator learning confusion in CycleGAN but also to enhance the constraint capability for clear images and the reconstruction ability of the unsupervised dehazing network. Furthermore, an Adaptive Fine-Grained Channel Attention (FCA) is developed to utilize the correlation matrix to capture the correlation between global and local information at various granularities promotes interaction between them, achieving more efficient feature weight assignment. Experimental results on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our UBRFC-Net over state-of-the-art unsupervised image dehazing methods. This study successfully introduces an enhanced unsupervised image dehazing approach, addressing limitations of existing methods and achieving superior dehazing results.

  abstract     = {Goal-directed manipulation of internal representations is a key element of human flexible behaviour, while consciousness is commonly associated with higher-order cognition and human flexibility. Current perspectives have only partially linked these processes, thus preventing a clear understanding of how they jointly generate flexible cognition and behaviour. Moreover, these limitations prevent an effective exploitation of this knowledge for technological scopes. We propose a new theoretical perspective that extends our ‘three-component theory of flexible cognition’ toward higher-order cognition and consciousness, based on the systematic integration of key concepts from Cognitive Neuroscience and AI/Robotics. The theory proposes that the function of conscious processes is to support the alignment of representations with multi-level goals. This higher alignment leads to more flexible and effective behaviours. We analyse here our previous model of goal-directed flexible cognition (validated with more than 20 human populations) as a starting GARIM-inspired model. By bridging the main theories of consciousness and goal-directed behaviour, the theory has relevant implications for scientific and technological fields. In particular, it contributes to developing new experimental tasks and interpreting clinical evidence. Finally, it indicates directions for improving machine learning and robotics systems and for informing real-world applications (e.g., in digital-twin healthcare and roboethics).},

In addition, to effectively model the F0 subband so as to improve the performance of FSD, the spatial reconstructed local attention Res2Net (SR-LA Res2Net) is proposed. Specifically, Res2Net is used as a backbone network to obtain multiscale information, and enhanced with a spatial reconstruction mechanism to avoid losing important information when the channel group is constantly superimposed. In addition, local attention is designed to make the model focus on the local information of the F0 subband. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset show that our proposed method obtains an equal error rate (EER) of 0.47% and a minimum tandem detection cost function (min t-DCF) of 0.0159, achieving the state-of-the-art performance among all of the single systems.},

Datasets comprise 24 931 IED (from 484 patients) and 166 094 non-IED 4-second video-EEG segments. The video data is processed by the proposed patient detection method, with frame difference and Simple Keypoints (SKPS) capturing patients’ movements. EEG data is processed with EfficientNetV2. The video and EEG features are fused via a multilayer perceptron. We developed a comparative model, termed nEpiNet, to test the effectiveness of the video feature in vEpiNet. The 10-fold cross-validation was used for testing. The 10-fold cross-validation showed high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in both models, with a slightly superior AUROC (0.9902) in vEpiNet compared to nEpiNet (0.9878). Moreover, to test the model performance in real-world scenarios, we set a prospective test dataset, containing 215 h of raw video-EEG data from 50 patients. The result shows that the vEpiNet achieves an area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.8623, surpassing nEpiNet’s 0.8316. Incorporating video data raises precision from 70% (95% CI, 69.8%–70.2%) to 76.6% (95% CI, 74.9%–78.2%) at 80% sensitivity and reduces false positives by nearly a third, with vEpiNet processing one-hour video-EEG data in 5.7 min on average. Our findings indicate that video data can significantly improve the performance and precision of IED detection, especially in prospective real clinic testing. It suggests that vEpiNet is a clinically viable and effective tool for IED analysis in real-world applications.},

This decision requires not only identifying the object but also choosing an action based on your decision confidence. In this circumstance, confidence is making a bridge between seeing and believing. Our study unveils how the brain processes visual information to make such decisions with an assessment of confidence, using a model inspired by the visual cortex. To computationally model the process, this study uses a spiking neural network inspired by the hierarchy of the visual cortex in mammals to investigate the dynamics of feedforward object recognition and decision-making in the brain. The model consists of two modules: a temporal dynamic object representation module and an attractor neural network-based decision-making module. Unlike traditional models, ours captures the evolution of evidence within the visual cortex, mimicking how confidence forms in the brain. This offers a more biologically plausible approach to decision-making when encountering real-world stimuli. We conducted experiments using natural stimuli and measured accuracy, reaction time, and confidence. The model&#39;s estimated confidence aligns remarkably well with human-reported confidence. Furthermore, the model can simulate the human change-of-mind phenomenon, reflecting the ongoing evaluation of evidence in the brain. Also, this finding offers decision-making and confidence encoding share the same neural circuit.},

Due to the utilization of the idea of RMTL, the related information included in multiple tasks is mined by setting different penalty parameters before task-common and task-specific regularization terms. However, the proposed MTKSVCR is time-consuming since it employs all samples in each optimization problem. Therefore, a multi-parameter safe acceleration rule termed SA is further presented to reduce the time consumption. It identifies and deletes most of the superfluous samples corresponding to 0 elements in the dual optimal solution before solving. Then, only a reduced dual problem is to be solved and the computational efficiency is improved accordingly. The biggest advantage of the proposed SA lies in safety. Namely, it derives an identical optimal solution to the primal problem without SA. In addition, our method remains effective when multiple parameters change simultaneously. Experiments on different artificial datasets and benchmark datasets verify the validity of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) is nowadays the mainstay of Unsupervised Sentence Representation Learning (USRL). However, PLMs are sensitive to the frequency information of words from their pre-training corpora, resulting in anisotropic embedding space, where the embeddings of high-frequency words are clustered but those of low-frequency words disperse sparsely. This anisotropic phenomenon results in two problems of similarity bias and information bias, lowering the quality of sentence embeddings. To solve the problems, we fine-tune PLMs by leveraging the frequency information of words and propose a novel USRL framework, namely Sentence Representation Learning with Frequency-induced Adversarial tuning and Incomplete sentence filtering (S lt-fai ). We calculate the word frequencies over the pre-training corpora of PLMs and assign words thresholding frequency labels. With them, (1) we incorporate a similarity discriminator used to distinguish the embeddings of high-frequency and low-frequency words, and adversarially tune the PLM with it, enabling to achieve uniformly frequency-invariant embedding space; and (2) we propose a novel incomplete sentence detection task, where we incorporate an information discriminator to distinguish the embeddings of original sentences and incomplete sentences by randomly masking several low-frequency words, enabling to emphasize the more informative low-frequency words. Our S lt-fai is a flexible and plug-and-play framework, and it can be integrated with existing USRL techniques. We evaluate S lt-fai with various backbones on benchmark datasets. Empirical results indicate that S lt-fai can be superior to the existing USRL baselines.},

Therefore, we designed corresponding experimental paradigms and proposed a multi-band task related components matching (MTRCM) method to improve the rapid cognitive decoding of both small and similar objects. We compared the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between MTRCM and other 9 methods under different numbers of training sample using RSVP-ERP data from 50 subjects. The results showed that MTRCM maintained an overall superiority and achieved the highest average AUC (0.6562 ± 0.0091). We also optimized the frequency band and the time parameters of the method. The verification on public data sets further showed the necessity of designing MTRCM method. The MTRCM method provides a new approach for neural decoding of both small and similar RSVP objects, which is conducive to promote the further development of RSVP-BCI.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a significant advancement in memristor-based neural networks, positioning them as a pivotal processing-in-memory deployment architecture for a wide array of deep learning applications. Within this realm of progress, the emerging parallel analog memristive platforms are prominent for their ability to generate multiple feature maps in a single processing cycle. However, a notable limitation is that they are specifically tailored for neural networks with fixed structures. As an orthogonal direction, recent research reveals that neural architecture should be specialized for tasks and deployment platforms. Building upon this, the neural architecture search (NAS) methods effectively explore promising architectures in a large design space. However, these NAS-based architectures are generally heterogeneous and diversified, making it challenging for deployment on current single-prototype, customized, parallel analog memristive hardware circuits. Therefore, investigating memristive analog deployment that overrides the full search space is a promising and challenging problem. Inspired by this, and beginning with the DARTS search space, we study the memristive hardware design of primitive operations and propose the memristive all-inclusive hypernetwork that covers 2 × 1 0 25 network architectures. Our computational simulation results on 3 representative architectures ( DARTS-V1 , DARTS-V2 , PDARTS ) show that our memristive all-inclusive hypernetwork achieves promising results on the CIFAR10 dataset (89.2 % of PDARTS with 8-bit quantization precision), and is compatible with all architectures in the DARTS full-space. The hardware performance simulation indicates that the memristive all-inclusive hypernetwork costs slightly more resource consumption (nearly the same in power, 22 % ∼ 25 % increase in Latency , 1 . 5 × in Area ) relative to the individual deployment, which is reasonable and may reach a tolerable trade-off deployment scheme for industrial scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Thermal infrared detectors have a vast array of potential applications in pedestrian detection and autonomous driving, and their safety performance is of great concern. Recent works use bulb plate, “QR” suit, and infrared patches as physical perturbations to perform white-box attacks on thermal infrared detectors, which are effective but not practical for real-world scenarios. Some researchers have tried to utilize hot and cold blocks as physical perturbations for black-box attacks on thermal infrared detectors. However, this attempts has not yielded robust and multi-view physical attacks, indicating limitations in the approach. To overcome the limitations of existing approaches, we introduce a novel black-box physical attack method, called adversarial infrared blocks ( AdvIB ). By optimizing the physical parameters of the infrared blocks and deploying them to pedestrians from multiple views, including the front, side, and back, AdvIB can execute robust and multi-view attacks on thermal infrared detectors. Our physical tests show that the proposed method achieves a success rate of over 80% under most distance and view conditions, validating its effectiveness. For stealthiness, our method involves attaching the adversarial infrared block to the inside of clothing, enhancing its stealthiness. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments and compare the experimental results with baseline to verify the robustness of our method. In summary, AdvIB allows for potent multi-view black-box attacks, profoundly influencing ethical considerations in today’s society. Potential consequences, including disasters from technology misuse and attackers’ legal liability, highlight crucial ethical and security issues associated with AdvIB. Considering these concerns, we urge heightened attention to the proposed AdvIB. Our code can be accessed from the following link: https://github.com/ChengYinHu/AdvIB.git .},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised temporal action localization aims to locate the temporal boundaries of action instances in untrimmed videos using video-level labels and assign them the corresponding action category. Generally, it is solved by a pipeline called “localization-by-classification”, which finds the action instances by classifying video snippets. However, since this approach optimizes the video-level classification objective, the generated activation sequences often suffer interference from class-related scenes, resulting in a large number of false positives in the prediction results. Many existing works treat background as an independent category, forcing models to learn to distinguish background snippets. However, under weakly supervised conditions, the background information is fuzzy and uncertain, making this method extremely difficult. To alleviate the impact of false positives, we propose a new actionness-guided false positive suppression framework. Our method seeks to suppress false positive backgrounds without introducing the background category. Firstly, we propose a self-training actionness branch to learn class-agnostic actionness, which can minimize the interference of class-related scene information by ignoring the video labels. Secondly, we propose a false positive suppression module to mine false positive snippets and suppress them. Finally, we introduce the foreground enhancement module, which guides the model to learn the foreground with the help of the attention mechanism as well as class-agnostic actionness. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmarks (THUMOS14, ActivityNet1.2, and ActivityNet1.3). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in suppressing false positives and it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code: https://github.com/lizhilin-ustc/AFPS .},

Most existing results assume real-valued inputs and parameters as well as exact operations during the evaluation of neural networks. However, neural networks are typically executed on computers that can only represent a tiny subset of the reals and apply inexact operations, i.e., most existing results do not apply to neural networks used in practice. In this work, we analyze the expressive power of neural networks under a more realistic setup: when we use floating-point numbers and operations as in practice. Our first set of results assumes floating-point operations where the significand of a float is represented by finite bits but its exponent can take any integer value. Under this setup, we show that neural networks using a binary threshold unit or ReLU ReLU can memorize any finite input/output pairs and can approximate any continuous function within an arbitrary error. In particular, the number of parameters in our constructions for universal approximation and memorization coincides with that in classical results assuming exact mathematical operations. We also show similar results on memorization and universal approximation when floating-point operations use finite bits for both significand and exponent; these results are applicable to many popular floating-point formats such as those defined in the IEEE 754 standard (e.g., 32-bit single-precision format) and bfloat16.},

Previous DL-based approaches focused on local shapes and textures in brain sMRI that may be significant only within a particular domain. The learned representations are likely to contain spurious information and have poor generalization ability in other diseases and datasets. To facilitate capturing meaningful and robust features, it is necessary to first comprehensively understand the intrinsic pattern of the brain that is not restricted within a single data/task domain. Considering that the brain is a complex connectome of interlinked neurons, the connectional properties in the brain have strong biological significance, which is shared across multiple domains and covers most pathological information. In this work, we propose a connectional style contextual representation learning model (CS-CRL) to capture the intrinsic pattern of the brain, used for multiple brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, it has a vision transformer (ViT) encoder and leverages mask reconstruction as the proxy task and Gram matrices to guide the representation of connectional information. It facilitates the capture of global context and the aggregation of features with biological plausibility. The results indicate that CS-CRL achieves superior accuracy in multiple brain disease diagnosis tasks across six datasets and three diseases and outperforms state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CS-CRL captures more brain-network-like properties, and better aggregates features, is easier to optimize, and is more robust to noise, which explains its superiority in theory.},

To address this issue, a novel MUFS method named Self-paced Regularized Adaptive Multi-view Unsupervised Feature Selection (SPAMUFS) is proposed. Specifically, the proposed approach firstly trains the MUFS model with simple samples, and gradually learns complex samples by using self-paced regularizer. l 2 , p l2,p -norm ( 0 &lt; p ≤ 1 0&amp;lt;p≤1 ) is employed to measure the learning error and as the sparse regularization to accommodate various sparsity requirements across different datasets. Moreover, hypergraph Laplacian matrices are constructed for each view to better preserve the local manifold structure and encode high-order relationships within the data space. They are adaptively assigned weights to learn the underlying correlated and diverse information among different views. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve SPAMUFS and the convergence and computational complexity are also analyzed. The effectiveness of SPAMUFS is substantiated by comparing with eight state-of-the-art algorithms on nine public multi-view datasets.},

Current deep-learning (DL) methods usually segment the pancreas or tumor independently using mixed image features, which are disrupted by surrounding complex and low-contrast background tissues. Here, we proposed a deep causal learning framework named CausegNet for pancreas and tumor co-segmentation in 3D CT sequences. Specifically, a causality-aware module and a counterfactual loss are employed to enhance the DL network&#39;s comprehension of the anatomical causal relationship between the foreground elements (pancreas and tumor) and the background. By integrating causality into CausegNet, the network focuses solely on extracting intrinsic foreground causal features while effectively learning the potential causality between the pancreas and the tumor. Then based on the extracted causal features, CausegNet applies a counterfactual inference to significantly reduce the background interference and sequentially search for pancreas and tumor from the foreground. Consequently, our approach can handle deformable pancreas and obscure tumors, resulting in superior co-segmentation performance in both public and real clinical datasets, achieving the highest pancreas/tumor Dice coefficients of 86.67%/84.28%. The visualized features and anti-noise experiments further demonstrate the causal interpretability and stability of our method. Furthermore, our approach improves the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream pancreatic cancer risk assessment task by 12.50% and 50.00%, respectively, compared to experienced clinicians, indicating promising clinical applications.},

To achieve improved results, adaptive estimation of the degradation kernel is necessary. We explore the synergy of joint global and local degradation modeling for spatially adaptive blind SISR. Our model, named spatially adaptive network for blind super-resolution (SASR), employs a simple encoder to estimate global degradation representations and a decoder to extract local degradation. These two representations are fused with a cross-attention mechanism and applied using spatially adaptive filtering to enhance the local image detail. Specifically, SASR contains two novel features: (1) a non-local degradation modeling with contrastive learning to learn global and local degradation representations, and (2) a non-local spatially adaptive filtering module (SAFM) that incorporates the global degradation and spatial-detail factors to preserve and enhance local details. We demonstrate that SASR can efficiently estimate degradation representations and handle multiple types of degradation. The local representations avoid the detrimental effect of estimating the entire super-resolved image with only one kernel through locally adaptive adjustments. Extensive experiments are performed to quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that SASR not only performs favorably for degradation estimation but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SISR performance when compared to alternative approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a distributed constrained optimization problem over a multi-agent network in the non-Euclidean sense. The gossip protocol is adopted to relieve the communication burden, which also adapts to the constantly changing topology of the network. Based on this idea, a gossip-based distributed stochastic mirror descent (GB-DSMD) algorithm is proposed to handle the problem under consideration. The performances of GB-DSMD algorithms with constant and diminishing step sizes are analyzed, respectively. When the step size is constant, the error bound between the optimal function value and the expected function value corresponding to the average iteration output of the algorithm is derived. While for the case of the diminishing step size, it is proved that the output of the algorithm uniformly approaches to the optimal value with probability 1. Finally, as a numerical example, the distributed logistic regression is reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the GB-DSMD algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Tensor network (TN) has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the compact representation of high-order data. In contrast to the TN methods with pre-determined structures, the recently introduced tensor network structure search (TNSS) methods automatically learn a compact TN structure from the data, gaining increasing attention. Nonetheless, TNSS requires time-consuming manual adjustments of the penalty parameters that control the model complexity to achieve better performance, especially in the presence of missing or noisy data. To provide an effective solution to this problem, in this paper, we propose a parameters tuning-free TNSS algorithm based on Bayesian modeling, aiming at conducting TNSS in a fully data-driven manner. Specifically, the uncertainty in the data corruption is well-incorporated in the prior setting of the probabilistic model. For TN structure determination, we reframe it as a rank learning problem of the fully-connected tensor network (FCTN), integrating the generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) distribution for low-rank promotion. To eliminate the need for hyperparameter tuning, we adopt a fully Bayesian approach and propose an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for posterior distribution sampling. Compared with the previous TNSS method, experiment results demonstrate the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently find the latent TN structures of the data under various missing and noise conditions and achieves the best recovery results. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior performance in tensor completion with real-world data compared to other state-of-the-art tensor-decomposition-based completion methods.},

We propose a Mutual Correlation Network (MCNet) to explore global consensus among the correlation map by using the self-attention mechanism which has a global receptive field. Our MCNet contains two core modules: (1) a multi-level embedding module that generates multi-level embeddings for an image pair which capture hierarchical semantics, and (2) a mutual correlation module that refines correlation map of two embeddings and generates more robust relational embeddings. Extensive experiments show that our MCNet achieves competitive results on four widely-used few-shot classification benchmarks miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and CIFAR-FS.

  abstract     = {Machine learning-based algorithms demonstrate impressive performance across numerous fields; however, they continue to suffer from certain limitations. Even sophisticated and precise algorithms often make erroneous predictions when implemented with datasets having different distributions compared to the training set. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which distinguishes data with different distributions from that of the training set, is a critical research area necessary to overcome these limitations and create more reliable algorithms. The OOD issue, particularly concerning image data, has been extensively studied. However, recently developed OOD methods do not fulfill the expectation that OOD performance will increase as the accuracy of in-distribution classification improves. Our research presents a comprehensive study on OOD detection performance across multiple models and training methodologies to verify this phenomenon. Specifically, we explore various pre-trained models popular in the computer vision field with both old and new OOD detection methods. The experimental results highlight the performance disparity in existing OOD methods. Based on these observations, we introduce Trimmed Rank with Inverse softMax probability (TRIM), a remarkably simple yet effective method for model weights with newly developed training methods. The proposed method could serve as a potential tool for enhancing OOD detection performance owing to its promising results. The OOD performance of TRIM is highly compatible with the in-distribution accuracy model and may bridge the efforts on improving in-distribution accuracy to the ability to distinguish OOD data.},

To this end, we propose S tructural deep M ulti- V iew C lustering with integrated abstraction and detail (SMVC). Specifically, multi-layer perceptrons are used to extract features from specific views, which are then concatenated to form the global features. Besides, a global target distribution is constructed and guides the soft cluster assignments of specific views. In addition to the exploitation of the top-level abstraction, we also design the mining of the underlying details. We construct instance-level contrastive learning using high-order adjacency matrices, which has an equivalent effect to graph attention network and reduces feature redundancy. By integrating the top-level abstraction and underlying detail into a unified framework, our model can jointly optimize the cluster assignments and feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed SMVC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for their versatile interpolation capabilities in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their potential, the training can be computationally demanding, especially for intricate functions like wavefields. This is primarily due to the neural-based (learned) basis functions, biased toward low frequencies, as they are dominated by polynomial calculations, which are not inherently wavefield-friendly. In response, we propose an approach to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural network wavefield solutions by modeling them as linear combinations of Gabor basis functions that satisfy the wave equation. Specifically, for the Helmholtz equation, we augment the fully connected neural network model with an adaptable Gabor layer constituting the final hidden layer, employing a weighted summation of these Gabor neurons to compute the predictions (output). These weights/coefficients of the Gabor functions are learned from the previous hidden layers that include nonlinear activation functions. To ensure the Gabor layer’s utilization across the model space, we incorporate a smaller auxiliary network to forecast the center of each Gabor function based on input coordinates. Realistic assessments showcase the efficacy of this novel implementation compared to the vanilla PINN, particularly in scenarios involving high-frequencies and realistic models that are often challenging for PINNs.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently grown in popularity for disease prediction. Existing GNN-based methods primarily build the graph topological structure around a single modality and combine it with other modalities to acquire feature representations of acquisitions. The complicated relationship in each modality, however, may not be well highlighted due to its specificity. Further, relatively shallow networks restrict adequate extraction of high-level features, affecting disease prediction performance. Accordingly, this paper develops a new interactive deep cascade spectral graph convolutional network with multi-relational graphs (IDCGN) for disease prediction tasks. Its crucial points lie in constructing multiple relational graphs and dual cascade spectral graph convolution branches with interaction (DCSGBI). Specifically, the former designs a pairwise imaging-based edge generator and a pairwise non-imaging-based edge generator from different modalities by devising two learnable networks, which adaptively capture graph structures and provide various views of the same acquisition to aid in disease diagnosis. Again, DCSGBI is established to enrich high-level semantic information and low-level details of disease data. It devises a cascade spectral graph convolution operator for each branch and incorporates the interaction strategy between different branches into the network, successfully forming a deep model and capturing complementary information from diverse branches. In this manner, more favorable and sufficient features are learned for a reliable diagnosis. Experiments on several disease datasets reveal that IDCGN exceeds state-of-the-art models and achieves promising results.},

However, it is a difficult task because of two reasons: (1) the diversity of the anomalous lesions and (2) the ambiguity of the boundary between anomalous lesions and their normal surroundings. Unlike existing single-modality AOD models based on deterministic mapping, we constructed a probabilistic and deterministic AOD model. Specifically, we designed an uncertainty-aware prototype learning framework, which considers the diversity and ambiguity of anomalous lesions. A prototypical learning transformer (Pformer) is established to extract and store the prototype features of different anomalous lesions. Moreover, Bayesian neural uncertainty quantizer, a probabilistic model, is designed to model the distributions over the outputs of the model to measure the uncertainty of the model’s detection results for each pixel. Essentially, the uncertainty of the model’s anomaly detection result for a pixel can reflect the anomalous ambiguity of this pixel. Furthermore, an uncertainty-guided reasoning transformer (Uformer) is devised to employ the anomalous ambiguity, encouraging the proposed model to focus on pixels with high uncertainty. Notably, prototypical representations stored in Pformer are also utilized in anomaly reasoning that enables the model to perceive diversities of the anomalous objects. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. The source code will be available in github.com/umchaohuang/UPformer.},

The difficulty of ECPE lies in distinguishing valid emotion-cause pairs from many irrelevant ones. Most previous methods have primarily focused on utilizing multi-task learning to extract semantic information solely from documents without explicitly encoding the relations between clauses. We propose a new approach that incorporates textual entailment paradigm aiming to infer the entailment relationship between the original document as the premise and the clauses or pairs described as the hypothesis. Our approach designs label-view hypothesis templates to improve ECPE by filtering out irrelevant emotion and cause clauses. Furthermore, we formulate candidate emotion-cause pairs as hypothesis statements, and define explicit multi-view symmetric templates to capture the emotion-cause relation semantics. The text entailment recognition for ECPE is finally implemented by fusing multi-view semantic information using a simplified capsule network. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ECPE compared to previous baselines. More importantly, this work demonstrates a novel effective way of applying the textual entailment paradigm to ECPE or clause-level causal discovery by designing multi-view hypothesis inference and information fusion.},

In order to address this issue, we propose a method called Generalized Latent Multi-View Clustering with Tensorized Bipartite Graph (GLMC-TBG). Specifically, in this paper we introduce neural networks to learn highly nonlinear mappings that encode nonlinear structures in graphs into latent representations. In addition, multiple views share the same latent consensus through nonlinear interactions. In this way, a more comprehensive common representation from multiple views can be achieved. An Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier with Alternating Direction Minimization (ALM-ADM) framework is designed to optimize the model.

  abstract     = {Due to distribution shift, deep learning based methods for image dehazing suffer from performance degradation when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, this study considers a dehazing framework based on conditional diffusion models for improved generalization to real haze. First, our work finds that optimizing the training objective of diffusion models, i.e., Gaussian noise vectors, is non-trivial. The spectral bias of deep networks hinders the higher frequency modes in Gaussian vectors from being learned and hence impairs the reconstruction of image details. To tackle this issue, this study designs a network unit, named Frequency Compensation block (FCB), with a bank of filters that jointly emphasize the mid-to-high frequencies of an input signal. Our work demonstrates that diffusion models with FCB achieve significant gains in both perceptual and distortion metrics. Second, to further boost the generalization performance, this study proposed a novel data synthesis pipeline, HazeAug , to augment haze in terms of degree and diversity . Within the framework, a solid baseline for blind dehazing is set up where models are trained on synthetic hazy-clean pairs, and directly generalize to real data. Extensive evaluations on real dehazing datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed dehazing diffusion model in distortion metrics. Compared to recent methods pre-trained on large-scale, high-quality image datasets, our model achieves a significant PSNR improvement of over 1 dB on challenging databases such as Dense-Haze and Nh-Haze.},

However, these methods suffer from (1) insufficient sensing field and insufficient depth; (2) computational nonlinearity and redundancy of channel features; and (3) ignoring the interrelationships among feature channels. These problems lead to poor network segmentation performance and weak generalization ability. Therefore, first of all, we propose an effective replacement scheme of UNet base block, Double residual depthwise atrous convolution (DRDAC) block, to effectively improve the deficiency of receptive field and depth. Secondly, a new linear module, the Multi-scale frequency domain filter (MFDF), is designed to capture global information from the frequency domain. The high order multi-scale relationship is extracted by combining the depthwise atrous separable convolution with the frequency domain filter. Finally, a channel attention called Axial selection channel attention (ASCA) is redesigned to enhance the network’s ability to model feature channel interrelationships. Further, we design a novel frequency domain medical image segmentation baseline method FDFUNet based on the above modules. We conduct extensive experiments on five publicly available medical image datasets and demonstrate that the present method has stronger segmentation performance as well as generalization ability compared to other state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {In the field of deep learning, large quantities of data are typically required to effectively train models. This challenge has given rise to techniques like zero-shot learning (ZSL), which trains models on a set of “seen” classes and evaluates them on a set of “unseen” classes. Although ZSL has shown considerable potential, particularly with the employment of generative methods, its generalizability to real-world scenarios remains uncertain. The hypothesis of this work is that the performance of ZSL models is systematically influenced by the chosen “splits”; in particular, the statistical properties of the classes and attributes used in training. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by introducing the concepts of generalizability and robustness in attribute-based ZSL and carry out a variety of experiments to stress-test ZSL models against different splits. Our aim is to lay the groundwork for future research on ZSL models’ generalizability, robustness, and practical applications. We evaluate the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets and identify consistent trends in generalizability and robustness. We analyze how these properties vary based on the dataset type, differentiating between coarse- and fine-grained datasets, and our findings indicate significant room for improvement in both generalizability and robustness. Furthermore, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques in improving the performance of state-of-the-art models in fine-grained datasets.},

  abstract     = {Answering complex First-Order Logic (FOL) query plays a vital role in multi-hop knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. Geometric methods have emerged as a promising category of approaches in this context. However, existing best-performing geometric query embedding (QE) model is still up against three-fold potential problems: (i) underutilization of embedding space, (ii) overreliance on angle information, (iii) uncaptured hierarchy structure. To bridge the gap, we propose a lollipop-like bi-centered query embedding method named LollipopE. To fully utilize embedding space, LollipopE employs learnable centroid positions to represent multiple entities distributed along the same axis. To address the potential overreliance on angular metrics, we design an angular-based and centroid-based metric. This involves calculating both an angular distance and a centroid-based geodesic distance, which empowers the model to make more informed selections of relevant answers from a wider perspective. To effectively capture the hierarchical relationships among entities within the KG, we incorporate dynamic moduli, which allows for the representation of the hierarchical structure among entities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LollipopE surpasses the state-of-the-art geometric methods. Especially, on more hierarchical datasets, LollipopE achieves the most significant improvement.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained widespread usage and achieved remarkable success in various real-world applications. Nevertheless, recent studies reveal the vulnerability of GNNs to graph adversarial attacks that fool them by modifying graph structure. This vulnerability undermines the robustness of GNNs and poses significant security and privacy risks across various applications. Hence, it is crucial to develop robust GNN models that can effectively defend against such attacks. One simple approach is to remodel the graph. However, most existing methods cannot fully preserve the similarity relationship among the original nodes while learning the node representation required for reweighting the edges. Furthermore, they lack supervision information regarding adversarial perturbations, hampering their ability to recognize adversarial edges. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Dual Robust Graph Neural Network (DualRGNN) against graph adversarial attacks. DualRGNN first incorporates a node-similarity-preserving graph refining (SPGR) module to prune and refine the graph based on the learned node representations, which contain the original nodes’ similarity relationships, weakening the poisoning of graph adversarial attacks on graph data. DualRGNN then employs an adversarial-supervised graph attention (ASGAT) network to enhance the model’s capability in identifying adversarial edges by treating these edges as supervised signals. Through extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets, DualRGNN has demonstrated remarkable robustness against various graph adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) seeks to protect face recognition systems from spoofing attacks, which is applied extensively in scenarios such as access control, electronic payment, and security surveillance systems. Face anti-spoofing requires the integration of local details and global semantic information. Existing CNN-based methods rely on small stride or image patch-based feature extraction structures, which struggle to capture spatial and cross-layer feature correlations effectively. Meanwhile, Transformer-based methods have limitations in extracting discriminative detailed features. To address the aforementioned issues, we introduce a multi-stage CNN-Transformer-based framework, which extracts local features through the convolutional layer and long-distance feature relationships via self-attention. Based on this, we proposed a cross-attention multi-stage feature fusion, employing semantically high-stage features to query task-relevant features in low-stage features for further cross-stage feature fusion. To enhance the discrimination of local features for subtle differences, we design pixel-wise material classification supervision and add a auxiliary branch in the intermediate layers of the model. Moreover, to address the limitations of a single acquisition environment and scarcity of acquisition devices in the existing Near-Infrared dataset, we create a large-scale Near-Infrared Face Anti-Spoofing dataset with 380k pictures of 1040 identities. The proposed method could achieve the state-of-the-art in OULU-NPU and our proposed Near-Infrared dataset at just 1.3GFlops and 3.2M parameter numbers, which demonstrate the effective of the proposed method.},

Second, two practical algorithms are designed to guarantee the convergence with accelerated learning. In one algorithm, an adjustable acceleration phase is added to the iteration process of Q-learning, which can be adaptively terminated with convergence guarantee. In another algorithm, a novel acceleration function is developed, which can adjust the relaxation factor to ensure the convergence.

  abstract     = {The transformer-based model can simultaneously learn the representation for both images and text, providing excellent performance for multimodal applications. Practically, the large scale of parameters may hinder its deployment in resource-constrained devices, creating a need for model compression. To accomplish this goal, recent studies suggest using knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a larger trained teacher model to a small student model without any performance sacrifice. However, this only works with trained parameters of the student model by using the last layer of the teacher, which makes the student model easily overfit in the distillation procedure. Furthermore, the mutual interference between modalities causes more difficulties for distillation. To address these issues, the study proposed a layerwised multimodal knowledge distillation for a vision-language pretrained model. In addition to the last layer, the intermediate layers of the teacher were also used for knowledge transfer. To avoid interference between modalities, we split the multimodality into separate modalities and added them as extra inputs. Then, two auxiliary losses were implemented to encourage each modality to distill more effectively. Comparative experiments on four different multimodal tasks show that the proposed layerwised multimodality distillation achieves better performance than other KD methods for vision-language pretrained models.},

  abstract     = {Recent successes suggest that an image can be manipulated by a text prompt, e.g., a landscape scene on a sunny day is manipulated into the same scene on a rainy day driven by a text input “raining”. These approaches often utilize a StyleCLIP-based image generator, which leverages multi-modal (text and image) embedding space. However, we observe that such text inputs are often bottlenecked in providing and synthesizing rich semantic cues, e.g., differentiating heavy rain from rain with thunderstorms. To address this issue, we advocate leveraging an additional modality, sound, which has notable advantages in image manipulation as it can convey more diverse semantic cues (vivid emotions or dynamic expressions of the natural world) than texts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that first extends the image–text joint embedding space with sound and applies a direct latent optimization method to manipulate a given image based on audio input, e.g., the sound of rain. Our extensive experiments show that our sound-guided image manipulation approach produces semantically and visually more plausible manipulation results than the state-of-the-art text and sound-guided image manipulation methods, which are further confirmed by our human evaluations. Our downstream task evaluations also show that our learned image–text-sound joint embedding space effectively encodes sound inputs.

As a consequence, biased information in training data can easily affect vanilla GNNs, causing biased results toward particular demographic groups (divided by sensitive attributes, such as race and age). There have been efforts to address the fairness issue. However, existing fair techniques generally divide the demographic groups by raw sensitive attributes and assume that are fixed. The biased information correlated with raw sensitive attributes will run through the training process regardless of the implemented fair techniques. It is urgent to resolve this problem for training fair GNNs. To tackle this problem, we propose a brand new framework, FairMigration, which is able to migrate the demographic groups dynamically, instead of keeping that fixed with raw sensitive attributes. FairMigration is composed of two training stages. In the first stage, the GNNs are initially optimized by personalized self-supervised learning, and the demographic groups are adjusted dynamically. In the second stage, the new demographic groups are frozen and supervised learning is carried out under the constraints of new demographic groups and adversarial training.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can be applied directly to data from unstructured finite element meshes or control volume grids. CNNs have been hugely influential in the areas of image classification and image compression, both of which typically deal with data on structured grids. Unstructured meshes are frequently used to solve partial differential equations and are particularly suitable for problems that require the mesh to conform to complex geometries or for problems that require variable mesh resolution. Central to our approach are space-filling curves, which traverse the nodes or cells of a mesh tracing out a path that is as short as possible (in terms of numbers of edges) and that visits each node or cell exactly once. The space-filling curves (SFCs) are used to find an ordering of the nodes or cells that can transform multi-dimensional solutions on unstructured meshes into a one-dimensional (1D) representation, to which 1D convolutional layers can then be applied. Although developed in two dimensions, the approach is applicable to higher dimensional problems. To demonstrate the approach, the network we choose is a convolutional autoencoder (CAE), although other types of CNN could be used. The approach is tested by applying CAEs to data sets that have been reordered with a space-filling curve. Sparse layers are used at the input and output of the autoencoder, and the use of multiple SFCs is explored. We compare the accuracy of the SFC-based CAE with that of a classical CAE applied to two idealised problems on structured meshes, and then apply the approach to solutions of flow past a cylinder obtained using the finite-element method and an unstructured mesh.},

  abstract     = {A Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is a sequence of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attached with time information, in which each KG contains the facts that co-occur at the same timestamp. Temporal knowledge prediction (TKP) aims to predict future events given observed historical KGs in TKGs, which is essential for many applications to provide intelligent analysis services. However, most existing TKP methods focus on entity and relation prediction tasks but ignore the importance of time prediction tasks. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in time prediction, and it is difficult for prediction models to model it completely. In this work, we propose a collaboration framework with B ayesian H ypernetwork and T ime- D ifference E volutional N etwork (BH-TDEN) to address these problems. First, we begin with the time prediction task, and we present a Bayesian hypernetwork to model the uncertainty of events time. For the input of Bayesian hypernetwork, we design a novel time-difference evolutional network to obtain the entities and relations embedding. Specifically, we propose an auto-regressive time gate parameterized by the time difference of adjacent KGs in entity and relation encoder to learn the time-sensitive TKG embedding, which not only learns the relationship between the given time information and TKG embedding but also provides more expressive TKG embedding for Bayesian hypernetwork to accurately predict the time of future events. Furthermore, we also present a novel relation updating mechanism that employs the neighbor relations of the subject corresponding to the current relation to learn more adaptive relation embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method obtains considerable time prediction and link prediction performance on four TKG benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Episodic memory, as a type of long-term memory (LTM), is used to learn and store the unique personal experience. Based on the episodic memory biological mechanism, this paper proposes a bionic episodic memory memristive neural network circuit. The proposed memristive neural network circuit includes a neocortical module, a parahippocampal module and a hippocampus module. The neocortical module with the two paths structure is used to receive the sensory signal, and is also used to separate and transmit the spatial information and the non-spatial information involved in the sensory signal. The parahippocampal module is composed of the parahippocampal cortex-MEA and the perirhinal cortex-LEA, which receives the two types of information from the neocortical module respectively. As the last module, the hippocampus module receives and integrates the output information of the parahippocampal module as well as generates the corresponding episodic memory. Meanwhile, the specific scenario information with the certain temporal signal from the generated episodic memory is also extracted by the hippocampus module. The simulation results in PSPICE show that the proposed memristive neural network circuit can generate the various episodic memories and extract the specific scenario information successfully. By configuring the memristor parameters, the proposed bionic episodic memory memristive neural network circuit can be applied to the hurricane category prediction, which verifies the feasibility of this work.},

In this work, a novel cosine convolutional neural network (CosCNN), which replaces traditional kernels with the robust cosine kernel modulated by only two learnable factors, is presented, and its effectiveness is validated on the tasks of seizure detection. Meanwhile, based on the cosine lookup table and KL-divergence, an effective post-training quantization algorithm is proposed for CosCNN hardware implementation. With quantization, CosCNN can achieve a nearly 75% reduction in the memory cost with almost no accuracy loss. Moreover, we design a configurable cosine convolution accelerator on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and deploy the quantized CosCNN on Zedboard, proving the proposed seizure detection system can operate in real-time and low-power scenarios. Extensive experiments and comparisons were conducted using two publicly available epileptic EEG databases, the Bonn database and the CHB-MIT database. The results highlight the performance superiority of the CosCNN over traditional CNNs as well as other seizure detection methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph Transformers (GTs) have achieved impressive results on various graph-related tasks. However, the huge computational cost of GTs hinders their deployment and application, especially in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of sparsifying GTs, a significant yet under-explored topic. We first discuss the redundancy of GTs based on the characteristics of existing GT models, and then propose a comprehensive G raph T ransformer SP arsification (GTSP) framework that helps to reduce the computational complexity of GTs from four dimensions: the input graph data, attention heads, model layers, and model weights. Specifically, GTSP designs differentiable masks for each individual compressible component, enabling effective end-to-end pruning. We examine our GTSP through extensive experiments on prominent GTs, including GraphTrans, Graphormer, and GraphGPS. The experimental results demonstrate that GTSP effectively reduces computational costs, with only marginal decreases in accuracy or, in some instances, even improvements. For example, GTSP results in a 30% reduction in Floating Point Operations while contributing to a 1.8% increase in Area Under the Curve accuracy on the OGBG-HIV dataset. Furthermore, we provide several insights on the characteristics of attention heads and the behavior of attention mechanisms, all of which have immense potential to inspire future research endeavors in this domain.

  abstract     = {Channel Pruning is one of the most widespread techniques used to compress deep neural networks while maintaining their performances. Currently, a typical pruning algorithm leverages neural architecture search to directly find networks with a configurable width, the key step of which is to identify representative subnet for various pruning ratios by training a supernet. However, current methods mainly follow a serial training strategy to optimize supernet, which is very time-consuming. In this work, we introduce PSE-Net, a novel parallel-subnets estimator for efficient channel pruning. Specifically, we propose a parallel-subnets training algorithm that simulate the forward–backward pass of multiple subnets by droping extraneous features on batch dimension, thus various subnets could be trained in one round. Our proposed algorithm facilitates the efficiency of supernet training and equips the network with the ability to interpolate the accuracy of unsampled subnets, enabling PSE-Net to effectively evaluate and rank the subnets. Over the trained supernet, we develop a prior-distributed-based sampling algorithm to boost the performance of classical evolutionary search. Such algorithm utilizes the prior information of supernet training phase to assist in the search of optimal subnets while tackling the challenge of discovering samples that satisfy resource constraints due to the long-tail distribution of network configuration. Extensive experiments demonstrate PSE-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art channel pruning methods on the ImageNet dataset while retaining superior supernet training efficiency. For example, under 300M FLOPs constraint, our pruned MobileNetV2 achieves 75.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset, exceeding the original MobileNetV2 by 2.6 units while only cost 30%/16% times than BCNet/AutoAlim.},

  abstract     = {In machine learning it is often necessary to assume or know the distribution of the data, however it is difficult to do so in practical applications. Aiming to this problem, this work, we propose a novel distribution-free Bayesian regularized learning framework for semi-supervised learning, which is called Hessian regularized twin minimax probability extreme learning machine (HRTMPELM). In this framework, we attempt to construct two non-parallel hyperplanes by introducing the high separation probability assumption, such that each hyperplane separates samples from one class with maximum probability while moving away from samples from the other class. Subsidiently, the framework can be utilized to construct reasonable semi-supervised classifiers by using the information of the inherent geometric distribution of the samples through the Hessian regularization term. Additionally, the proposed framework controls the misclassification error of samples by minimizing the upper limit of the worst-case misclassification probability, and improves the generalization performance of the model by introducing the idea of regularization to avoid the occurrence of ill-posedness and overfitting problems. More importantly, the framework has no hyperparameters, making the learning process very simplified and efficient. Finally, a simple and reliable algorithm with globally optimal solutions via multivariate Chebyshev inequalities is designed for solving the proposed learning framework. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed learning framework compared to other methods. Especially, we applied the framework to Ningxia wolfberry quality detection, which greatly enriches and facilitates the application of machine learning algorithms in the agricultural field.},

A proposed event-triggered control method based on periodic sampling data is presented for second-order multi-agent systems that include external disturbances. In contrast to the real-time monitoring of system state information used in the previous event-triggered mechanism, this approach collects system state information through periodic sampling. This ensures that the interval between two consecutive triggering moments is at least one sampling cycle, thereby preventing the controller from triggering infinitely within a finite time frame. A finite-time controller based on the sampled-data event-triggered mechanism is designed, and sufficient conditions to ensure the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system at a specified attenuation level are established using theoretical methods such as matrix analysis. For the given sampled-data event-triggered control protocol with a finite-time controller, a quadratic guarantee-cost function is introduced, and by designing control inputs and determining the parameters such as the finite-time upper bound T ∗ T∗ and the H ∞ H∞ performance index γ γ , the exact value of the upper bound of the system’s guarantee-cost function under the action of the designed controller is derived.

  abstract     = {Expert demonstrations in imitation learning often contain different behavioral modes, e.g., driving modes such as driving on the left, keeping the lane, and driving on the right in the driving tasks. Although most existing multi-modal imitation learning methods allow learning from demonstrations of multiple modes, they have strict constraints on the data of each mode, generally requiring a near data ratio of all modes. Otherwise, it tends to fall into a mode collapse or only learn the data distribution of the mode that has the largest data volume. To address the problem, an algorithm that balances real-fake loss and classification loss by modifying the output of the discriminator, referred to as BAlanced Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (BAGAIL), is proposed. With this modification, the generator is only rewarded for generating real trajectories with correct modes. BAGAIL is therefore able to deal with imbalanced expert demonstrations and carry out efficient learning for each mode. The learning process of BAGAIL is divided into a pre-training stage and an imitation learning stage. During the pre-training stage, BAGAIL initializes the generator parameters by means of conditional Behavioral Cloning, laying the foundation for the direction of parameter optimization. During the imitation learning stage, BAGAIL optimizes the parameters by using the adversary between the generator and the modified discriminator so that the finally obtained policy can successfully learn the distribution of imbalanced expert data. The experiments showed that BAGAIL accurately distinguished different behavioral modes with imbalanced demonstrations. What is more, the learning result of each mode is close to the expert standard and more stable than other multi-modal imitation learning methods.},

This paper proposes an enhanced deep unrolling neural network, called EDUNet, to tackle this problem. The EDUNet is constructed via the deep unrolling of a proximal gradient descent algorithm and introduces two innovative modules for gradient-driven update and proximal mapping reflectivity. The gradient-driven update module leverages a memory-assistant descent approach inspired by momentum-based acceleration techniques, for enhancing the unrolled reconstruction process and improving convergence. The proximal mapping is modeled by a sub-network with a cross-stage spectral self-attention, which effectively exploits the inherent self-similarities present in hyperspectral images along the spectral axis. It also enhances feature flow throughout the network, contributing to reconstruction performance gain. Furthermore, we introduce a spectral geometry consistency loss, encouraging EDUNet to prioritize the geometric layouts of spectral curves, leading to a more precise capture of spectral information in hyperspectral images. Experiments are conducted using three benchmark datasets including KAIST, ICVL, and Harvard, along with some real data, comprising a total of 73 samples. The experimental results demonstrate that EDUNet outperforms 15 competing models across four metrics including PSNR, SSIM, SAM, and ERGAS.},

This approach effectively reduces the impact of frequent mode switching on network synchronization, and the synchronization time can be flexibly adjusted within any physically allowable range to accommodate different application requirements.

  abstract     = {The agent learns to organize decision behavior to achieve a behavioral goal, such as reward maximization, and reinforcement learning is often used for this optimization. Learning an optimal behavioral strategy is difficult under the uncertainty that events necessary for learning are only partially observable, called as Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). However, the real-world environment also gives many events irrelevant to reward delivery and an optimal behavioral strategy. The conventional methods in POMDP, which attempt to infer transition rules among the entire observations, including irrelevant states, are ineffective in such an environment. Supposing Redundantly Observable Markov Decision Process (ROMDP), here we propose a method for goal-oriented reinforcement learning to efficiently learn state transition rules among reward-related “core states” from redundant observations. Starting with a small number of initial core states, our model gradually adds new core states to the transition diagram until it achieves an optimal behavioral strategy consistent with the Bellman equation. We demonstrate that the resultant inference model outperforms the conventional method for POMDP. We emphasize that our model only containing the core states has high explainability. Furthermore, the proposed method suits online learning as it suppresses memory consumption and improves learning speed.},

In this paper, we adopt a bilinear logistic regression model in which the parameters are trained in a data-driven fashion on a real-world dataset of power grid failure data. The bilinear white-box model – grounded on a specific neural architecture – has been proven effective in classifying faulty states with a performance comparable to several classifiers in technical literature. Additionally, the low computational complexity of the bilinear model, in terms of the number of free parameters, allows gaining insights into the fault phenomenon correlating the events that impact the power grid (exogenous causes) with its constitutive characteristics, thence eliciting the relational information hidden in the data. The proposed model is also able to estimate a vulnerability vector that can be associated, as a suitable characteristic “label”, to power grid components, opening the way, as will be deeply demonstrated in the following, not only to predictive maintenance programs or condition monitoring tasks but also to risk assessment and scenario analyses in line with the explainable AI paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have become one of the most prominent next-generation computational models owing to their biological plausibility, low power consumption, and the potential for neuromorphic hardware implementation. Among the various methods for obtaining available SNNs, converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) into SNNs is the most cost-effective approach. The early challenges in ANN-to-SNN conversion work revolved around the susceptibility of converted SNNs to conversion errors. Some recent endeavors have attempted to mitigate these conversion errors by altering the original ANNs. Despite their ability to enhance the accuracy of SNNs, these methods lack generality and cannot be directly applied to convert the majority of existing ANNs. In this paper, we present a framework named DNISNM for converting ANN to SNN, with the aim of addressing conversion errors arising from differences in the discreteness and asynchrony of network transmission between ANN and SNN. The DNISNM consists of two mechanisms, Data-based Neuronal Initialization (DNI) and Signed Neuron with Memory (SNM), designed to respectively address errors stemming from discreteness and asynchrony disparities. This framework requires no additional modifications to the original ANN and can result in SNNs with improved accuracy performance, simultaneously ensuring universality, high precision, and low inference latency. We verify it experimentally on challenging object recognition datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-1k. Experimental results show that the SNN converted by our framework has very high accuracy even at extremely low latency.},

  abstract     = {Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) aim to generate diverse trajectories from a distribution in which the final states of the trajectories are proportional to the reward, serving as a powerful alternative to reinforcement learning for exploratory control tasks. However, the individual-flow matching constraint in GFlowNets limits their applications for multi-agent systems, especially continuous joint-control problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent generative Continuous Flow Networks (MACFN) method to enable multiple agents to perform cooperative exploration for various compositional continuous objects. Technically, MACFN trains decentralized individual-flow-based policies in a centralized global-flow-based matching fashion. During centralized training, MACFN introduces a continuous flow decomposition network to deduce the flow contributions of each agent in the presence of only global rewards. Then agents can deliver actions solely based on their assigned local flow in a decentralized way, forming a joint policy distribution proportional to the rewards. To guarantee the expressiveness of continuous flow decomposition, we theoretically derive a consistency condition on the decomposition network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts and better exploration capability.

  abstract     = {Remarkable achievements have been made in the field of remote sensing cross-scene classification in recent years. However, most methods directly align the entire image features for cross-scene knowledge transfer. They usually ignore the high background complexity and low category consistency of remote sensing images, which can significantly impair the performance of distribution alignment. Besides, shortcomings of the adversarial training paradigm and the inability to guarantee the prediction discriminability and diversity can also hinder cross-scene classification performance. To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel cross-scene classification framework in a discriminator-free adversarial paradigm, called Adversarial Pair-wise Distribution Matching (APDM), to avoid irrelevant knowledge transfer and enable effective cross-domain modeling. Specifically, we propose the pair-wise cosine discrepancy for both inter-domain and intra-domain prediction measurements to fully leverage the prediction information, which can suppress negative semantic features and implicitly align the cross-scene distributions. Nuclear-norm maximization and minimization are introduced to enhance the target prediction quality and increase the applicability of the source knowledge, respectively. As a general cross-scene framework, APDM can be easily embedded with existing methods to boost the performance. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that APDM can achieve competitive and effective performance on cross-scene classification tasks.},

To alleviate these challenges, this paper proposes a contrastive mechanism for temporal representation learning on dynamic networks, inspired by the success of contrastive learning in visual and static network representation learning. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Network Contrastive representation Learning (DNCL) model. Specifically, contrast objective functions are constructed using intra-snapshot and inter-snapshot contrasts to capture the network topology, node feature information, and network evolution information, respectively. Rather than estimating or generating ground-truth network features, the proposed approach maximizes mutual information between nodes from different time steps and views generated. The experimental results of link prediction, node classification, and clustering on several real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the superiority of DNCL over state-of-the-art methods, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for dynamic network representation learning.},

  abstract     = {Object pose estimation and camera localization are critical in various applications. However, achieving algorithm universality, which refers to category-level pose estimation and scene-independent camera localization, presents challenges for both techniques. Although the two tasks keep close relationships due to spatial geometry constraints, different tasks require distinct feature extractions. This paper pays attention to a unified RGB-D based framework that simultaneously performs category-level object pose estimation and scene-independent camera localization. The framework consists of a pose estimation branch called SLO-ObjNet, a localization branch called SLO-LocNet, a pose confidence calculation process and object-level optimization. At the start, we obtain the initial camera and object results from SLO-LocNet and SLO-ObjNet. In these two networks, we design there-level feature fusion modules as well as the loss function to achieve feature sharing between two tasks. Then the proposed approach involves a confidence calculation process to determine the accuracy of object poses obtained. Additionally, an object-level Bundle Adjustment (BA) optimization algorithm is further used to improve the precision of these techniques. The BA algorithm establishes relationships among feature points, objects, and cameras with the usage of camera-point, camera-object, and object-point metrics. To evaluate the performance of this approach, experiments are conducted on localization and pose estimation datasets including REAL275, CAMERA25, LineMOD, YCB-Video, 7 Scenes, ScanNet and TUM RGB-D. The results show that this approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both estimation and localization accuracy. Additionally, SLO-LocNet and SLO-ObjNet are trained on ScanNet data and tested on 7 Scenes and TUM RGB-D datasets to demonstrate its universality performance. Finally, we also highlight the positive effects of fusion modules, loss function, confidence process and BA for improving overall performance.},

  abstract     = {Although 3D human pose estimation has recently made strides, it is still difficult to precisely recreate a 3D human posture from a single image without the aid of 3D annotation for the following reasons. Firstly, the process of reconstruction inherently suffers from ambiguity, as multiple 3D poses can be projected onto the same 2D pose. Secondly, accurately measuring camera rotation without laborious camera calibration is a difficult task. While some approaches attempt to address these issues using traditional computer vision algorithms, they are not differentiable and cannot be optimized through training. This paper introduces two modules that explicitly leverage geometry to overcome these challenges, without requiring any 3D ground-truth or camera parameters. The first module, known as the relative depth estimation module, effectively mitigates depth ambiguity by narrowing down the possible depths for each joint to only two candidates. The second module, referred to as the differentiable pose alignment module, calculates camera rotation by aligning poses from different views. The use of these geometrically interpretable modules reduces the complexity of training and yields superior performance. By adopting our proposed method, we achieve state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark datasets, surpassing other self-supervised methods and even outperforming several fully-supervised approaches that heavily rely on 3D annotations.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved promising performance in image recognition and gradually serves as a powerful backbone in various vision tasks. To satisfy the sequential input of Transformer, the tail of ViT first splits each image into a sequence of visual tokens with a fixed length. Then, the following self-attention layers construct the global relationship between tokens to produce useful representation for the downstream tasks. Empirically, representing the image with more tokens leads to better performance, yet the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention layer to the number of tokens could seriously influence the efficiency of ViT’s inference. For computational reduction, a few pruning methods progressively prune uninformative tokens in the Transformer encoder, while leaving the number of tokens before the Transformer untouched. In fact, fewer tokens as the input for the Transformer encoder can directly reduce the following computational cost. In this spirit, we propose a Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer (MT-ViT) in the paper. MT-ViT adopts multiple tails to produce visual sequences of different lengths for the following Transformer encoder. A tail predictor is introduced to decide which tail is the most efficient for the image to produce accurate prediction. Both modules are optimized in an end-to-end fashion, with the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that MT-ViT can achieve a significant reduction on FLOPs with no degradation of the accuracy and outperform compared methods in both accuracy and FLOPs.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate chaotic time series prediction is a challenging task, especially when multiple variables are predicted simultaneously. For multiple related prediction tasks typically require multiple models, however, multiple models are difficult to keep synchronization, making immediate communication between predicted values challenging. Although multi-task learning can be applied to this problem, the principles of allocation and layout options between shared and specific representations are ambiguous. To address this issue, a novel simplified multi-task learning method was proposed for the precise implementation of simultaneous multiple chaotic time series prediction tasks. The scheme proposed consists of a cross-convolution operator designed to capture variable correlations and sequence correlations, and an attention module proposed to capture the information embedded in the sequence structure. In the attention module, a non-linear transformation was implemented with convolution, and its local receptive field and the global dependency of the attention mechanism achieve complementarity. In addition, an attention weight calculation was devised that takes into account not only the synergy of time and frequency domain features, but also the fusion of series and channel information.

  abstract     = {Regional wind speed prediction is an important spatiotemporal prediction problem which is crucial for optimizing wind power utilization. Nevertheless, the complex dynamics of wind speed pose a formidable challenge to prediction tasks. The evolving dynamics of wind could be governed by underlying physical principles that can be described by partial differential equations (PDE). This study proposes a novel approach called PDE-assisted network (PaNet) for regional wind speed prediction. In PaNet, a new architecture is devised, incorporating both PDE-based dynamics (PDE dynamics) and unknown dynamics. Specifically, this architecture establishes interactions between the two dynamics, regulated by an inter-dynamics communication unit that controls interactions through attention gates. Additionally, recognizing the significance of the initial state for PDE dynamics, an adaptive frequency-gated unit is introduced to generate a suitable initial state for the PDE dynamics by selecting essential frequency components. To evaluate the predictive performance of PaNet, this study conducts comprehensive experiments on two real-world wind speed datasets. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method is superior to other baseline methods.},

It aims to obtain the contours of objects of interest, facilitating subsequent engineering tasks such as measurement and feature selection. However, existing segmentation methods still lack precision in class edge, particularly in multi-class mixed region. To this end, we present the Feature Enhancement Network (FE-Net), a novel approach that leverages edge label and pixel-wise weights to enhance segmentation performance in complex backgrounds. Firstly, we propose a Smart Edge Head (SE-Head) to process shallow-level information from the backbone network. It is combined with the FCN-Head and SepASPP-Head, located at deeper layers, to form a transitional structure where the loss weights gradually transition from edge labels to semantic labels and a mixed loss is also designed to support this structure. Additionally, we propose a pixel-wise weight evaluation method, a pixel-wise weight block, and a feature enhancement loss to improve training effectiveness in multi-class regions. FE-Net achieves significant performance improvements over baselines on publicly datasets Pascal VOC2012, SBD, and ATR, with best mIoU enhancements of 15.19%, 1.42% and 3.51%, respectively. Furthermore, experiments conducted on Pole&amp;Hole match dataset from our laboratory environment demonstrate the superior effectiveness of FE-Net in segmenting defined key pixels.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative representation-based (CR) methods have become prevalent for pattern classification tasks, achieving formidable performance. Theoretically, we expect the learned class-specific representation of the correct class to be discriminative against others, with the representation of the correct class contributing dominantly in CR. However, most existing CR methods focus on improving discrimination while having a limited impact on enhancing the representation contribution of the correct category. In this work, we propose a novel CR approach for image classification called the elastic competitive and discriminative collaborative representation-based classifier (ECDCRC) to simultaneously strengthen representation contribution and discrimination of the correct class. The ECDCRC objective function penalizes two key terms by fully incorporating label information. The competitive term integrates the nearest subspace representation with corresponding elastic factors into the model, allowing each class to have varying competition intensities based on similarity with the query sample. This enhances the representation contribution of the correct class in CR. To further improve discrimination, the discriminative term introduces an elastic factor as a weight in the model to represent the gap between the query sample and the representation of each class. Moreover, instead of focusing on representation coefficients, the designed ECDCRC weights associated with representation components directly relate to the representation of each class, enabling more direct and precise discrimination improvement. Concurrently, sparsity is also enhanced through the two terms, further boosting model performance. Additionally, we propose a robust ECDCRC (R-ECDCRC) to handle image classification with noise. Extensive experiments on seven public databases demonstrate the proposed method’s superior performance over related state-of-the-art CR methods.},

Existing UDA approaches highly depend on the accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical scenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and computation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge transfer from a pre-trained source model to the unlabeled target domain with source data inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great significance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature review of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e. , white-box SFUDA and black-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on different learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of methods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box and black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and summarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models learned without using source data. We finally discuss several promising future directions in this field.},

However, existing methods require direct sampling over the entire transformation set, notably computationally taxing for large groups like the affine group. In this study, we propose a more efficient approach by addressing the invariances of the subgroups within a larger group. For tackling affine invariance, we split it into the Euclidean group E ( n ) E(n) and uni-axial scaling group U S ( n ) US(n) , handling invariance individually. We employ an E ( n ) E(n) -invariant model for E ( n ) E(n) -invariance and average model outputs over data augmented from a U S ( n ) US(n) distribution for U S ( n ) US(n) -invariance. Our method maintains a favorable computational complexity of O ( N 2 ) O(N2) in 2D and O ( N 4 ) O(N4) in 3D scenarios, in contrast to the O ( N 6 ) O(N6) (2D) and O ( N 12 ) O(N12) (3D) complexities of averaged models. Crucially, the scale range for augmentation adapts during training to avoid excessive scale invariance. This is the first time nearly exact affine invariance is incorporated into neural networks without directly sampling the entire group. Extensive experiments unequivocally confirm its superiority, achieving new state-of-the-art results in affNIST and SIM2MNIST classifications while consuming less than 15% of inference time and fewer computational resources and model parameters compared to averaged models.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated great potential in achieving outstanding performance in various graph-related tasks, e.g., graph classification and link prediction. However, most of them suffer from the following issue: shallow networks capture very limited knowledge. Prior works design deep GNNs with more layers to solve the issue, which however introduces a new challenge, i.e., the infamous over-smoothness. Graph representation over emphasizes node features but only considers the static graph structure with a uniform weight are the key reasons for the over-smoothness issue. To alleviate the issue, this paper proposes a D ynamic W eighting S trategy (DWS) for addressing over-smoothness. We first employ Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) to cluster all nodes into several groups and get each node’s fuzzy assignment, based on which a novel metric function is devised for dynamically adjusting the aggregation weights. This dynamic weighting strategy not only enables the intra-cluster interactions, but also inter-cluster aggregations, which well addresses undifferentiated aggregation caused by uniform weights. Based on DWS, we further design a S tructure A ugmentation (SA) step for addressing the issue of underutilizing the graph structure, where some potentially meaningful connections (i.e., edges) are added to the original graph structure via a parallelable KNN algorithm. In general, the optimized D ynamic W eighting S trategy with S tructure A ugmentation (DWSSA) alleviates over-smoothness by reducing noisy aggregations and utilizing topological knowledge. Extensive experiments on eleven homophilous or heterophilous graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method DWSSA in alleviating over-smoothness and enhancing deep GNNs performance.},

However, most ZSL methods fail to properly measure the relationships between classes, or do not consider the differences and similarities between classes at all. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Relation-Aware Network (ARAN), a novel ZSL approach that incorporates the improved triplet loss from deep metric learning into a VAE-based generative model, which helps to model inter-class and intra-class relationships for different classes in ZSL datasets and generate an arbitrary amount of high-quality visual features containing more discriminative information. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness and superior performance of our ARAN through experimental evaluations under ZSL and more practical GZSL settings on three popular datasets AWA2, CUB, and SUN.},

Despite the remarkable progress made in deep learning theory, most studies on CNNs, especially in regression tasks, tend to heavily rely on the least squares loss function. However, there are situations where such learning algorithms may not suffice, particularly in the presence of heavy-tailed noises or outliers. This predicament emphasizes the necessity of exploring alternative loss functions that can handle such scenarios more effectively, thereby unleashing the true potential of CNNs. In this paper, we investigate the generalization error of deep CNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function for robust regression problems within an information-theoretic learning framework. Our study demonstrates that when the regression function exhibits an additive ridge structure and the noise possesses a finite p p th moment, the empirical risk minimization scheme, generated by the maximum correntropy criterion and deep CNNs, achieves fast convergence rates. Notably, these rates align with the mini-max optimal convergence rates attained by fully connected neural network model with the Huber loss function up to a logarithmic factor. Additionally, we further establish the convergence rates of deep CNNs under the maximum correntropy criterion when the regression function resides in a Sobolev space on the sphere.},

This process is supervised by the node semantic information, which is extracted from the node homophily evaluated by attributes. Eventually, we employ a one-layer simplifying graph convolutional network with the learned multi-order adjacency matrix, which is equivalent to the cross-hop node information propagation with multi-layer graph neural networks.

  abstract     = {Adversarial training has become the mainstream method to boost adversarial robustness of deep models. However, it often suffers from the trade-off dilemma, where the use of adversarial examples hurts the standard generalization of models on natural data. To study this phenomenon, we investigate it from the perspective of spatial attention. In brief, standard training typically encourages a model to conduct a comprehensive check to input space. But adversarial training often causes a model to overly concentrate on sparse spatial regions. This reduced tendency is beneficial to avoid adversarial accumulation but easily makes the model ignore abundant discriminative information, thereby resulting in weak generalization. To address this issue, this paper introduces an Attention-Enhanced Learning Framework (AELF) for robustness training. The main idea is to enable the model to inherit the attention pattern of standard pre-trained model through an embedding-level regularization. To be specific, given a teacher model built on natural examples, the embedding distribution of teacher model is used as a static constraint to regulate the embedding outputs of the objective model. This design is mainly supported with that the embedding feature of standard model is usually recognized as a rich semantic integration of input. For implementation, we present a simplified AELFs that can achieve the regularization with single cross entropy loss via the parameter initialization and parameter update strategy. This avoids the extra consistency comparison operation between embedding vectors. Experimental observations verify the rationality of our argument, and experimental results demonstrate that it can achieve remarkable improvements in generalization under the high-level robustness.},

Existing methods often use the one-hop neighbors of the entity to enhance its embedding and match the query instance and support set at the instance level.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Mu lti- L evel A ttention-enhanced matching N etwork ( MuLAN ) for few-shot knowledge graph completion. In MuLAN , a multi-head self-attention neighbor encoder is designed to capture the inter-neighbor interaction and learn the entity embeddings. Then, entity-level attention and instance-level attention are responsible for matching the query instance and support set from the local and global perspectives, respectively, while feature-level attention is utilized to calculate the weights of the feature dimensions. Furthermore, we design a consistency constraint to ensure the support instance embeddings are close to each other. Extensive experiments based on two well-known datasets (i.e., NELL-One and Wiki-One) demonstrate significant advantages of MuLAN over 11 state-of-the-art competitors.

  abstract     = {Multi-view graph pooling utilizes information from multiple perspectives to generate a coarsened graph, exhibiting superior performance in graph-level tasks. However, existing methods mainly focus on the types of multi-view information to improve graph pooling operations, lacking explicit control over the pooling process and theoretical analysis of the relationships between views. In this paper, we rethink the current paradigm of multi-view graph pooling from an information theory perspective, subsequently introducing GDMGP, an innovative method for multi-view graph pooling derived from the principles of graph disentanglement. This approach effectively simplifies the original graph into a more structured, disentangled coarsened graph, enhancing the clarity and utility of the graph representation. Our approach begins with the design of a novel view mapper that dynamically integrates the node and topology information of the original graph. This integration enhances its information sufficiency. Next, we introduce a view fusion mechanism based on conditional entropy to accurately regulate the task-relevant information in the views, aiming to minimize information loss in the pooling process. Finally, to further enhance the expressiveness of the coarsened graph, we disentangle the fused view into task-relevant and task-irrelevant subgraphs through mutual information minimization, retaining the task-relevant subgraph for downstream tasks. We theoretically demonstrate that the performance of the coarsened graph generated by our GDMGP is superior to that of any single input view. The effectiveness of GDMGP is further validated by experimental results on seven public datasets.},

  abstract     = {Structured pruning is a representative model compression technology for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), aiming to prune some less important filters or channels of CNNs. Most recent structured pruning methods have established some criteria to measure the importance of filters, which are mainly based on the magnitude of weights or other parameters in CNNs. However, these judgment criteria lack explainability, and it is insufficient to simply rely on the numerical values of the network parameters to assess the relationship between the channel and the model performance. Moreover, directly utilizing these pruning criteria for global pruning may lead to suboptimal solutions, therefore, it is necessary to complement search algorithms to determine the pruning ratio for each layer. To address these issues, we propose ARPruning (Attention-map-based Ranking Pruning), which reconstructs a new pruning criterion as the importance of the intra-layer channels and further develops a new local neighborhood search algorithm for determining the optimal inter-layer pruning ratio. To measure the relationship between the channel to be pruned and the model performance, we construct an intra-layer channel importance criterion by considering the attention map for each layer. Then, we propose an automatic pruning strategy searching method that can search for the optimal solution effectively and efficiently. By integrating the well-designed pruning criteria and search strategy, our ARPruning can not only maintain a high compression rate but also achieve outstanding accuracy. In our work, it is also experimentally concluded that compared with state-of-the-art pruning methods, our ARPruning method is capable of achieving better compression results.

  abstract     = {Extrapolating future events based on historical information in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) holds significant research value and practical applications. In this field, the methods currently utilized can be classified as either embedding-based or logical rule-based. Embedding-based methods depend on learned entity and relation embeddings for prediction, but they suffer from the lack of interpretability due to the opaque reasoning process. On the other hand, logical rule-based methods face scalability challenges as they heavily rely on predefined logical rules. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid model that combines embedding-based and logical rule-based methods to capture deep causal logic. Our model, called the Inductive Reasoning Model based on Interpretable Logical Rule (ILR-IR), aims to provide interpretable insights while effectively predicting future events in TKGs. ILR-IR delves into historical information, extracting valuable insights from logical rules embedded within relations and interaction preferences between entities. By considering both logical rules and interaction preferences, ILR-IR offers a comprehensive perspective for predicting future events. In addition, we propose the incorporation of a one-class augmented matching loss during optimization, which serves to enhance performance of the model during training. We evaluate ILR-IR on multiple datasets, including ICEWS14, ICEWS0515, and ICEWS18. Experimental results demonstrate that ILR-IR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its superior performance in TKG extrapolation reasoning. Moreover, ILR-IR demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities, even when applied to related datasets that share a common relation vocabulary. This suggests that our proposed model exhibits robust zero-shot reasoning abilities. For interested parties, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/mxadorable/ILR-IR .},

  abstract     = {In image watermark removal, popular methods depend on given reference non-watermark images in a supervised way to remove watermarks. However, reference non-watermark images are difficult to be obtained in the real world. At the same time, they often suffer from the influence of noise when captured by digital devices. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we present a self-supervised network for image denoising and watermark removal (SSNet). SSNet uses a parallel network in a self-supervised learning way to remove noise and watermarks. Specifically, each sub-network contains two sub-blocks. The upper sub-network uses the first sub-block to remove noise, according to noise-to-noise. Then, the second sub-block in the upper sub-network is used to remove watermarks, according to the distributions of watermarks. To prevent the loss of important information, the lower sub-network is used to simultaneously learn noise and watermarks in a self-supervised learning way. Moreover, two sub-networks interact via attention to extract more complementary salient information. The proposed method does not depend on paired images to learn a blind denoising and watermark removal model, which is very meaningful for real applications. Also, it is more effective than the popular image watermark removal methods in public datasets. Codes can be found at https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/SSNet .},

In this paper, we introduce two metrics from the intra-class distribution of correct-predicted and incorrect-predicted samples to provide a new perspective on the overfitting issue. Based on it, we propose a knowledge distillation approach without pretraining a teacher model in advance named Tolerant Self-Distillation (TSD) for alleviating the overfitting issue. It introduces an online updating memory and selectively stores the class predictions of the samples from the past iterations, making it possible to distill knowledge across the iterations. Specifically, the class predictions stored in the memory bank serve as the soft labels for supervising the samples from the same class for the current iteration in a reverse way, i.e. the correct-predicted samples are supervised with the incorrect predictions while the incorrect-predicted samples are supervised with the correct predictions. Consequently, the premature convergence issue caused by the over-confident samples would be mitigated, which helps the model to converge to a better local optimum. Extensive experimental results on several image classification benchmarks, including small-scale, large-scale, and fine-grained datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TSD.},

To conquer such challenge, we propose communication-efficient second-order distributed optimization algorithms in the parameter-server framework, by incorporating cubic Newton methods with compressed lazy Hessian. Specifically, our algorithms require each worker communicate compressed Hessians with the server only at some particular iterations, which can save both communication bits and communication rounds. For non-convex problems, we theoretically prove that our algorithms can reduce the communication cost comparing to the state-of-the-art second-order algorithms, while maintaining the same iteration complexity order O ( ϵ − 3 / 2 ) O(ϵ−3/2) as the centralized cubic Newton methods. By further using gradient regularization technique, our algorithms can achieve global convergence for convex problems. Moreover, for strongly convex problems, our algorithms can achieve local superlinear convergence rate without any requirement on initial conditions. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to show the high efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

However, constructing similarity relationship among samples in cross-modal unsupervised hashing is challenging because of the lack of manual annotation. Most existing unsupervised methods directly use the representations extracted from the backbone of their respective modality to construct instance similarity matrices, leading to inaccurate similarity matrices and resulting in suboptimal hash codes. To address this issue, a novel unsupervised hashing model, named Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing for Unsupervised Cross-modal Retrieval (SACH), is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we concurrently employ both high-dimensional representations and discriminative representations learned by the network to construct a more informative semantic correlative matrix across modalities. Moreover, we design a multimodal structure-aware alignment network to minimize heterogeneous gap in the high-order semantic space of each modality, effectively reducing disparities within heterogeneous data sources and enhancing the consistency of semantic information across modalities.

Although neural network watermarking techniques are widely used to safeguard the IP of DNNs, they can only achieve passive protection and cannot actively prevent unauthorized users from illicit use or embezzlement of the trained DNN models. Therefore, the development of proactive protection techniques to prevent IP infringement is imperative. To this end, we propose SecureNet, a key-based access license framework for DNN models. The proposed approach involves injecting license keys into the model through backdoor learning, enabling correct model functionality only when the appropriate license key is included in the input. To ensure the reusability of DNN models, we also propose a license key replacement algorithm. In addition, based on SecureNet, we designed defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a fine-grained authorization method that enables flexible granting of model permissions to different users. We have designed four license-key schemes with different privileges, tailored to various scenarios. We evaluated SecureNet on five benchmark datasets including MNIST, Cifar10, Cifar100, FaceScrub, and CelebA, and assessed its performance on six classic DNN models: LeNet-5, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet101, NFNet-F5, and MobileNetV3. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model parameter encryption methods by at least 95% in terms of computational efficiency.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-level alignment framework, which hierarchically learns the semantic correlation between multiple levels by leveraging well-designed alignment training tasks. In addition, we devise an attention-based fusion mechanism (AFM) to infuse semantic information from high levels.

Moreover, we fully take advantage of transformer-style networks in RAM for multi-level attentions in classifying social relations. To our best knowledge, GRIT is the first for inferring social relations with multi-level conditional attention. GRIT is end-to-end trainable and significantly outperforms existing methods on two benchmark datasets, e.g. , with performance improvement of 7.8% on PIPA and 9.6% on PISC.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a large class of relational models for graph processing. Recent theoretical studies on the expressive power of GNNs have focused on two issues. On the one hand, it has been proven that GNNs are as powerful as the Weisfeiler–Lehman test (1-WL) in their ability to distinguish graphs. Moreover, it has been shown that the equivalence enforced by 1-WL equals unfolding equivalence. On the other hand, GNNs turned out to be universal approximators on graphs modulo the constraints enforced by 1-WL/unfolding equivalence. However, these results only apply to Static Attributed Undirected Homogeneous Graphs (SAUHG) with node attributes. In contrast, real-life applications often involve a much larger variety of graph types. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the expressive power of GNNs for two other graph domains that are particularly interesting in practical applications, namely dynamic graphs and SAUGHs with edge attributes. Dynamic graphs are widely used in modern applications; hence, the study of the expressive capability of GNNs in this domain is essential for practical reasons and, in addition, it requires a new analyzing approach due to the difference in the architecture of dynamic GNNs compared to static ones. On the other hand, the examination of SAUHGs is of particular relevance since they act as a standard form for all graph types: it has been shown that all graph types can be transformed without loss of information to SAUHGs with both attributes on nodes and edges. This paper considers generic GNN models and appropriate 1-WL tests for those domains. Then, the known results on the expressive power of GNNs are extended to the mentioned domains: it is proven that GNNs have the same capability as the 1-WL test, the 1-WL equivalence equals unfolding equivalence and that GNNs are universal approximators modulo 1-WL/unfolding equivalence. Moreover, the proof of the approximation capability is mostly constructive and allows us to deduce hints on the architecture of GNNs that can achieve the desired approximation.},

  abstract     = {Modern industrial processes are characterized by extensive, multiple operation units, and strong coupled correlation of subsystems. Fault detection of large-scale processes is still a challenging problem, especially for tandem plant-wide processes in multiple fields such as water treatment process. In this paper, a novel distributed graph attention network-bidirectional long short-term memory (D-GATBLSTM) fault detection model is proposed for large-scale industrial processes. Firstly, a multi-node knowledge graph (MNKG) is constructed using a joint data and knowledge driven strategy. Secondly, for large-scale industrial process, a global feature extractor of graph attention networks (GATs) is constructed, on the basis of which, sub-blocks are decomposed based on MNKG. Then, local feature extractors of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) for each sub-block are constructed, in which correlations among multiple sub-blocks are considered. Finally, a multi-subblock fusion collaborative prediction model is constructed and the comprehensive fault detection results are given by the grid search method. The effectiveness of our D-GATBLSTM is exemplified in a secure water treatment process case, where it outperforms baseline models compared, with 27% improvement in precision, 15% increase in recall, and overall F F -score enhancement of 0.22.},

The proposed ROAIL network does not require extensive iterative computations. Instead, it can achieve the desired results with a single step of computation, allowing for the efficient acquisition of network weights. By extending the Gegenbauer polynomials to a multi-variate version, and integrating the ℓ 2 ℓ2 regularization and Welsch loss function into the orthogonal activated inverse-learning framework, two forms of ROAIL are obtained, i.e., ℓ 2 ℓ2 norm ROAIL ( ℓ 2 ℓ2 -ROAIL) and Welsch-ROAIL (W-ROAIL). ℓ 2 ℓ2 -ROAIL neural network is proposed to minimize the empirical and structural risk simultaneously since taking the structural risk as a part of loss function can effectively reduce the complexity of the model and thus improve the generalization ability. W-ROAIL neural network further improves the robustness of the ℓ 2 ℓ2 -ROAIL neural network by replacing the original two-norm in loss function with Welsch function. The Welsch function can determine the weights of each sample according to its output error, and influence of outliers could be weakened since the weights of outliers would be reduced. Both regression and classification experiments show that W-ROAIL neural network has strong ability to suppress the influence of outliers.},

Classic graph embedding methods follow the basic idea that the embedding vectors of interconnected nodes in the graph can still maintain a relatively close distance, thereby preserving the structural information between the nodes in the graph. However, this is sub-optimal due to: (i) traditional methods have limited model capacity which limits the learning performance; (ii) existing techniques typically rely on unsupervised learning strategies and fail to couple with the latest learning paradigms; (iii) representation learning and downstream tasks are dependent on each other which should be jointly enhanced. With the remarkable success of deep learning, deep graph representation learning has shown great potential and advantages over shallow (traditional) methods, there exist a large number of deep graph representation learning techniques have been proposed in the past decade, especially graph neural networks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive survey on current deep graph representation learning algorithms by proposing a new taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we systematically summarize the essential components of graph representation learning and categorize existing approaches by the ways of graph neural network architectures and the most recent advanced learning paradigms. Moreover, this survey also provides the practical and promising applications of deep graph representation learning. Last but not least, we state new perspectives and suggest challenging directions which deserve further investigations in the future.},

  abstract     = {As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty estimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the quality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared by evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a prediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the fraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction intervals. Intuitively, both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate through both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating the quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both approaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the predictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the estimates of these components. Specifically, the quality of a confidence interval cannot reliably be tested by estimating the performance of a prediction interval. Secondly, the loglikelihood does not allow a comparison between methods that output a prediction interval directly and methods that output a density. A better loglikelihood also does not necessarily guarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used for in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals directly has additional flaws. We show why testing a prediction or confidence interval on a single test set is fundamentally flawed. At best, marginal coverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident predictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring the correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical examples that these effects can result in favouring a method, based on the predictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or prediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach that addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between different methods. This approach can be used for the development of new uncertainty quantification methods.},

Due to its exceptional approximation capabilities, RNN is being extensively used in various fields. While the RNN concept has shown great promise, its performance can be unpredictable in imperfect conditions, such as weight noises and outliers. Thus, there is a need to develop more reliable and robust RNN algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new objective function that addresses the combined effect of weight noise and training data outliers for RVFL networks. Based on the half-quadratic optimization method, we then propose a novel algorithm, named noise-aware RNN (NARNN), to optimize the proposed objective function. The convergence of the NARNN is also theoretically validated. We also discuss the way to use the NARNN for ensemble deep RVFL (edRVFL) networks. Finally, we present an extension of the NARNN to concurrently address weight noise, stuck-at-fault, and outliers. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a number of state-of-the-art robust RNN algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Spatial prediction tasks are challenging when observed samples are sparse and prediction samples are abundant. Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly used in spatial prediction tasks and have the advantage of measuring the uncertainty of the interpolation result. However, as the sample size increases, GPs suffer from significant overhead. Standard neural networks (NNs) provide a powerful and scalable solution for modeling spatial data, but they often overfit small sample data. Based on conditional neural processes (CNPs), which combine the advantages of GPs and NNs, we propose a new framework called Spatial Multi-Attention Conditional Neural Processes (SMACNPs) for spatial small sample prediction tasks. SMACNPs are a modular model that can predict targets by employing different attention mechanisms to extract relevant information from different forms of sample data. The task representation is inferred by measuring the spatial correlation contained in different sample points and the relationship contained in attribute variables, respectively. The distribution of the target variable is predicted by GPs parameterized by NNs. SMACNPs allow us to obtain accurate predictions of the target value while quantifying the prediction uncertainty. Experiments on spatial prediction tasks on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that this framework flexibly incorporates spatial context and correlation into the model, achieving state-of-the-art results in spatial small sample prediction tasks in terms of both predictive performance and reliability. For example, on the California housing dataset, our method reduces MAE by 8% and MSE by 7% compared to the second-best method. In addition, a spatiotemporal prediction task to forecast traffic speed further confirms the effectiveness and generality of our method.},

  abstract     = {As a promising field, Multi-Query Image Retrieval (MQIR) aims at searching for the semantically relevant image given multiple region-specific text queries. Existing works mainly focus on a single-level similarity between image regions and text queries, which neglect the hierarchical guidance of multi-level similarities and result in incomplete alignments. Besides, the high-level semantic correlations that intrinsically connect different region–query pairs are rarely considered. To address above limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Matching and Reasoning Network (HMRN) for MQIR. It disentangles MQIR into three hierarchical semantic representations, which is responsible to capture fine-grained local details, contextual global scopes, and high-level inherent correlations. HMRN consists of two modules: Scalar-based Matching (SM) module and Vector-based Reasoning (VR) module. Specifically, the SM module characterizes the multi-level alignment similarity, which consists of a fine-grained local-level similarity and a context-aware global-level similarity. Afterwards, the VR module is developed to excavate the potential semantic correlations among multiple region–query pairs, which further explores the high-level reasoning similarity. Finally, these three-level similarities are aggregated into a joint similarity space to form the ultimate similarity. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our HMRN substantially surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods. For instance, compared with the existing best method Drill-down, the metric R@1 in the last round is improved by 23.4%. Our source codes will be released at https://github.com/LZH-053/HMRN .},

  abstract     = {Recently, clustering data collected from various sources has become a hot topic in real-world applications. The most common methods for multi-view clustering can be divided into several categories: Spectral clustering algorithms, subspace multi-view clustering algorithms, matrix factorization approaches, and kernel methods. Despite the high performance of these methods, they directly fuse all similarity matrices of all views and separate the affinity learning process from the multiview clustering process. The performance of these algorithms can be affected by noisy affinity matrices. To overcome this drawback, this paper presents a novel method called One Step Multi-view Clustering via Consensus Graph Learning and Nonnegative Embedding (OSMGNE). Instead of directly merging the similarity matrices of different views, which may contain noise, a step of learning a consensus similarity matrix is performed. This step forces the similarity matrices of different views to be too similar, which eliminates the problem of noisy data. Moreover, the use of the nonnegative embedding matrix (soft cluster assignment matrix makes it possible to directly obtain the final clustering result without any extra step. The proposed method can solve five subtasks simultaneously. It jointly estimates the similarity matrix of all views, the similarity matrix of each view, the corresponding spectral projection matrix, the unified clustering indicator matrix, and automatically gives the weight of each view without the use of hyper-parameters. In addition, another version of our method is also studied in this paper. This method differs from the first one by using a consensus spectral projection matrix and a consensus Laplacian matrix over all views. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem of these two methods. The two proposed methods are tested on several real datasets, which prove their superiority.},

  abstract     = {Although time series prediction models based on Transformer architecture have achieved significant advances, concerns have arisen regarding their performance with non-stationary real-world data. Traditional methods often use stabilization techniques to boost predictability, but this often results in the loss of non-stationarity, notably underperforming when tackling major events in practical applications. To address this challenge, this research introduces an innovative method named TCDformer (Trend and Change-point Detection Transformer). TCDformer employs a unique strategy, initially encoding abrupt changes in non-stationary time series using the local linear scaling approximation (LLSA) module. The reconstructed contextual time series is then decomposed into trend and seasonal components. The final prediction results are derived from the additive combination of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for predicting trend components and wavelet attention mechanisms for seasonal components. Comprehensive experimental results show that on standard time series prediction datasets, TCDformer significantly surpasses existing benchmark models in terms of performance, reducing MSE by 47.36% and MAE by 31.12%. This approach offers an effective framework for managing non-stationary time series, achieving a balance between performance and interpretability, making it especially suitable for addressing non-stationarity challenges in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In black-box scenarios, most transfer-based attacks usually improve the transferability of adversarial examples by optimizing the gradient calculation of the input image. Unfortunately, since the gradient information is only calculated and optimized for each pixel point in the image individually, the generated adversarial examples tend to overfit the local model and have poor transferability to the target model. To tackle the issue, we propose a resize-invariant method (RIM) and a logical ensemble transformation method (LETM) to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples. Specifically, RIM is inspired by the resize-invariant property of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The range of resizable pixel is first divided into multiple intervals, and then the input image is randomly resized and padded within each interval. Finally, LETM performs logical ensemble of multiple images after RIM transformation to calculate the final gradient update direction. The proposed method adequately considers the information of each pixel in the image and the surrounding pixels. The probability of duplication of image transformations is minimized and the overfitting effect of adversarial examples is effectively mitigated. Numerous experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that our approach outperforms other advanced methods and is capable of generating more transferable adversarial examples.},

  abstract     = {It is demonstrated that higher-order patterns beyond pairwise relations can significantly enhance the learning capability of existing graph-based models, and simplex is one of the primary form for graphically representing higher-order patterns. Predicting unknown (disappeared) simplices in real-world complex networks can provide us with deeper insights, thereby assisting us in making better decisions. Nevertheless, previous efforts to predict simplices suffer from two issues: (i) they mainly focus on 2- or 3-simplices, and there are few models available for predicting simplices of arbitrary orders, and (ii) they lack the ability to analyze and learn the features of simplices from the perspective of dynamics. In this paper, we present a Higher-order Neurodynamical Equation for Simplex Prediction of arbitrary order (HNESP), which is a framework that combines neural networks and neurodynamics. Specifically, HNESP simulates the dynamical coupling process of nodes in simplicial complexes through different relations (i.e., strong pairwise relation, weak pairwise relation, and simplex) to learn node-level representations, while explaining the learning mechanism of neural networks from neurodynamics. To enrich the higher-order information contained in simplices, we exploit the entropy and normalized multivariate mutual information of different sub-structures of simplices to acquire simplex-level representations. Furthermore, simplex-level representations and multi-layer perceptron are used to quantify the existence probability of simplices. The effectiveness of HNESP is demonstrated by extensive simulations on seven higher-order benchmarks. Experimental results show that HNESP improves the AUC values of the state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 8.32%. Our implementations will be publicly available at: https://github.com/jianruichen/HNESP .},

Additionally, we introduce the Residual Feature Refinement Module (RFRM) to improve both the accuracy and generalization ability of the model, thereby elevating the quality of colorization results. The Feature Adaptation Module (FAM) is employed to mitigate sub-region information loss during downsampling. Furthermore, we introduce the Trinity Attention Module (TAM) to accurately capture the spatial and channel-wise interaction features of local semantic information. Extensive experimentation on the KAIST dataset and the FLIR dataset demonstrates the superiority of our proposed FRAGAN methodology, surpassing both the performance metrics and visual quality of current state-of-the-art methods.

Previous studies have predominantly delved into traditional ensemble methods for detection, we introduce a novel approach by leveraging a metaheuristic-based ensemble framework. In this research, we present an innovative CGO-Ensemble framework designed to elevate the accuracy of detecting Mpox infection in patients. Initially, we employ five transfer learning base models that integrate feature integration layers and residual blocks. These components play a crucial role in capturing significant features from the skin images, thereby enhancing the models&#39; efficacy. In the next step, we employ a weighted averaging scheme to consolidate predictions generated by distinct models. To achieve the optimal allocation of weights for each base model in the ensemble process, we leverage the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm. This strategic weight assignment enhances classification outcomes considerably, surpassing the performance of randomly assigned weights. Implementing this approach yields notably enhanced prediction accuracy compared to using individual models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on two widely recognized benchmark datasets: the Mpox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD) and the Mpox Skin Image Dataset (MSID). To gain insights into the decision-making process of the base models, we have performed Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) analysis. The experimental results showcase the outstanding performance of the CGO-ensemble, achieving an impressive accuracy of 100% on MSLD and 94.16% on MSID. Our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, traditional ensemble methods, and existing techniques in the context of Mpox detection on these datasets. These findings underscore the effectiveness and superiority of the CGO-Ensemble in accurately identifying Mpox cases, highlighting its potential in disease detection and classification.},

  abstract     = {Radiology images of the chest, such as computer tomography scans and X-rays, have been prominently used in computer-aided COVID-19 analysis. Learning-based radiology image retrieval has attracted increasing attention recently, which generally involves image feature extraction and finding matches in extensive image databases based on query images. Many deep hashing methods have been developed for chest radiology image search due to the high efficiency of retrieval using hash codes. However, they often overlook the complex triple associations between images; that is, images belonging to the same category tend to share similar characteristics and vice versa. To this end, we develop a triplet-constrained deep hashing (TCDH) framework for chest radiology image retrieval to facilitate automated analysis of COVID-19. The TCDH consists of two phases, including (a) feature extraction and (b) image retrieval . For feature extraction, we have introduced a triplet constraint and an image reconstruction task to enhance discriminative ability of learned features, and these features are then converted into binary hash codes to capture semantic information. Specifically, the triplet constraint is designed to pull closer samples within the same category and push apart samples from different categories. Additionally, an auxiliary image reconstruction task is employed during feature extraction to help effectively capture anatomical structures of images. For image retrieval, we utilize learned hash codes to conduct searches for medical images. Extensive experiments on 30,386 chest X-ray images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art approaches in automated image search. The code is now available online.},

All continuous functions that vanish at infinity can be uniformly approximated by neural networks with one hidden layer, for all activation functions φ φ that are continuous, nonpolynomial, and asymptotically polynomial at ± ∞ ±∞ . When φ φ is moreover bounded, we exactly determine which functions can be uniformly approximated by neural networks, with the following unexpected results. Let N φ l ( R n ) ¯ Nφl(Rn)¯ denote the vector space of functions that are uniformly approximable by neural networks with l l hidden layers and n n inputs. For all n n and all l ≥ 2 l≥2 , N φ l ( R n ) ¯ Nφl(Rn)¯ turns out to be an algebra under the pointwise product. If the left limit of φ φ differs from its right limit (for instance, when φ φ is sigmoidal) the algebra N φ l ( R n ) ¯ Nφl(Rn)¯ ( l ≥ 2 l≥2 ) is independent of φ φ and l l , and equals the closed span of products of sigmoids composed with one-dimensional projections. If the left limit of φ φ equals its right limit, N φ l ( R n ) ¯ Nφl(Rn)¯ ( l ≥ 1 l≥1 ) equals the (real part of the) commutative resolvent algebra, a C*-algebra which is used in mathematical approaches to quantum theory. In the latter case, the algebra is independent of l ≥ 1 l≥1 , whereas in the former case N φ 2 ( R n ) ¯ Nφ2(Rn)¯ is strictly bigger than N φ 1 ( R n ) ¯ Nφ1(Rn)¯ .},

Here, we introduce weakly coupled residual recurrent networks (WCRNNs) in which residual connections result in well-defined Lyapunov exponents and allow for studying properties of fading memory. We investigate how the residual connections of WCRNNs influence their performance, network dynamics, and memory properties on a set of benchmark tasks. We show that several distinct forms of residual connections yield effective inductive biases that result in increased network expressivity. In particular, those are residual connections that (i) result in network dynamics at the proximity of the edge of chaos, (ii) allow networks to capitalize on characteristic spectral properties of the data, and (iii) result in heterogeneous memory properties. In addition, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to non-linear residuals and introduce a weakly coupled residual initialization scheme that can be used for Elman RNNs.},

However, most existing approaches do not mine hidden information in the knowledge graph as much as possible. This paper suggests SCMEA, a novel cross-lingual entity alignment framework based on multi-aspect information fusion and bidirectional contrastive learning. SCMEA initially adopts diverse representation learning models to embed multi-aspect information of entities and integrates them into a unified embedding space with an adaptive weighted mechanism to overcome the missing information and the problem of different-aspect information are not uniform. Then, we propose a stacked relation-entity co-enhanced model to further improve the representations of entities, wherein relation representation is modeled using an Entity Collector with Global Entity Attention. Finally, a combined loss function based on improved bidirectional contrastive learning is introduced to optimize model parameters and entity representation, effectively mitigating the hubness problem and accelerating model convergence. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the alignment performance of SCMEA. The overall experimental results, ablation studies, and analysis performed on five cross-lingual datasets demonstrate that our model achieves varying degrees of performance improvement and verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the model.},

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator has received attention for providing a potentially global linearization representation of the nonlinear dynamical system. To estimate or control the original system, the invertibility problem is introduced into the data-driven modeling, i.e., the observables are required to be reconstructed the original system’s states. Existing methods cannot solve this problem perfectly. Only linear or nonlinear but lossy reconstruction can be achieved. This paper proposed a novel data-driven modeling approach, denoted as the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Invertible Dictionary Learning (EDMD-IDL) to address this issue, which can be interpreted as a further extension of the classical Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). The Invertible Neural Network (INN) is introduced in the proposed method, where its inverse process provides the explicit inverse on the dictionary functions, thus allowing the nonlinear and lossless reconstruction. An iterative algorithm is designed to solve the extended optimization problem defined by the Koopman operator and INN by combining the optimization algorithm based on the gradient descent and the classical EDMD method, making the method successfully obtain the finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. The method is tested on various canonical nonlinear dynamical systems and is shown that the predictions obtained in a linear fashion and the ground truth match well over the long-term, where only the initial status is provided. Comparison experiments highlight the superiority of the proposed method over the other EDMD-based methods. Notably, a typical example in fluid dynamics, cylinder wake, illustrates the potential of the method to be further extended to the high-dimensional system with tens of thousands of states. By combining the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition technique, nontrivial Kármán vortex sheet phenomenon is perfectly reconstructed. Our proposed method provides a new paradigm for solving the finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator and applying it to data-driven modeling.},

However, recent studies have found that an elaborate perturbation may cause a network to misclassify, which is known as an adversarial attack. Based on current research, it is suggested that adversarial examples cannot be eliminated completely. Consequently, it is always possible to determine an attack that is effective against a defense model. We render existing adversarial examples invalid by altering the classification boundaries. Meanwhile, for valid adversarial examples generated against the defense model, the adversarial perturbations are increased so that they can be distinguished by the human eye. This paper proposes a method for implementing the abovementioned concepts through color space transformation. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Mini-ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our defense method.

  abstract     = {As dynamic graphs have become indispensable in numerous fields due to their capacity to represent evolving relationships over time, there has been a concomitant increase in the development of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs). When training TGNNs for dynamic graph link prediction, the commonly used negative sampling method often produces starkly contrasting samples, which can lead the model to overfit these pronounced differences and compromise its ability to generalize effectively to new data. To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative negative sampling approach named Enhanced Negative Sampling (ENS). This strategy takes into account two pervasive traits observed in dynamic graphs: (1) Historical dependence, indicating that nodes frequently reestablish connections they held in the past, and (2) Temporal proximity preference, which posits that nodes are more inclined to connect with those they have recently interacted with. Specifically, our technique employs a designed scheduling function to strategically control the progression of difficulty of the negative samples throughout the training. This ensures that the training progresses in a balanced manner, becoming incrementally challenging, and thereby enhancing TGNNs’ proficiency in predicting links within dynamic graphs. In our empirical evaluation across multiple datasets, we discerned that our ENS, when integrated as a modular component, notably augments the performance of four SOTA baselines. Additionally, we further investigated the applicability of ENS in handling dynamic graphs of varied attributes. Our code is available at https://github.com/qqaazxddrr/ENS .},

  abstract     = {The dreaming Hopfield model constitutes a generalization of the Hebbian paradigm for neural networks, that is able to perform on-line learning when “awake” and also to account for off-line “sleeping” mechanisms. The latter have been shown to enhance storing in such a way that, in the long sleep-time limit, this model can reach the maximal storage capacity achievable by networks equipped with symmetric pairwise interactions. In this paper, we inspect the minimal amount of information that must be supplied to such a network to guarantee a successful generalization, and we test it both on random synthetic and on standard structured datasets ( i . e . i.e. , MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Olivetti). By comparing these minimal thresholds of information with those required by the standard ( i . e . i.e. , always “awake”) Hopfield model, we prove that the present network can save up to ∼ 90 % ∼90% of the dataset size, yet preserving the same performance of the standard counterpart. This suggests that sleep may play a pivotal role in explaining the gap between the large volumes of data required to train artificial neural networks and the relatively small volumes needed by their biological counterparts. Further, we prove that the model Cost function (typically used in statistical mechanics) admits a representation in terms of a standard Loss function (typically used in machine learning) and this allows us to analyze its emergent computational skills both theoretically and computationally: a quantitative picture of its capabilities as a function of its control parameters is achieved and consistency between the two approaches is highlighted. The resulting network is an associative memory for pattern recognition tasks that learns from examples on-line, generalizes correctly (in suitable regions of its control parameters) and optimizes its storage capacity by off-line sleeping: such a reduction of the training cost can be inspiring toward sustainable AI and in situations where data are relatively sparse.},

  abstract     = {The excellent generalization, contextual learning, and emergence abilities in the pre-trained large models (PLMs) handle specific tasks without direct training data, making them the better foundation models in the adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) methods to transfer knowledge learned from the source domain to target domains. However, existing ADA methods fail to account for the confounder properly, which is the root cause of the source data distribution that differs from the target domains. This study proposes a confounder balancing method in adversarial domain adaptation for PLMs fine-tuning (CadaFT), which includes a PLM as the foundation model for a feature extractor, a domain classifier and a confounder classifier, and they are jointly trained with an adversarial loss. This loss is designed to improve the domain-invariant representation learning by diluting the discrimination in the domain classifier. At the same time, the adversarial loss also balances the confounder distribution among source and unmeasured domains in training. Compared to newest ADA methods, CadaFT can correctly identify confounders in domain-invariant features, thereby eliminating the confounder biases in the extracted features from PLMs. The confounder classifier in CadaFT is designed as a plug-and-play and can be applied in the confounder measurable, unmeasurable, or partially measurable environments. Empirical results on natural language processing and computer vision downstream tasks show that CadaFT outperforms the newest GPT-4, LLaMA2, ViT and ADA methods.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are brain-inspired models that utilize discrete and sparse spikes to transmit information, thus having the property of energy efficiency. Recent advances in learning algorithms have greatly improved SNN performance due to the automation of feature engineering. While the choice of neural architecture plays a significant role in deep learning, the current SNN architectures are mainly designed manually, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural architecture search (NAS) method that can automatically find efficient SNNs. To tackle the challenge of long search time faced by SNNs when utilizing NAS, the proposed NAS encodes candidate architectures in a branchless spiking supernet which significantly reduces the computation requirements in the search process. Considering that real-world tasks prefer efficient networks with optimal accuracy under a limited computational budget, we propose a Synaptic Operation (SynOps)-aware optimization to automatically find the computationally efficient subspace of the supernet. Experimental results show that, in less search time, our proposed NAS can find SNNs with higher accuracy and lower computational cost than state-of-the-art SNNs. We also conduct experiments to validate the search process and the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Owing to its ability to handle negative data and promising clustering performance, concept factorization (CF), an improved version of non-negative matrix factorization, has been incorporated into multi-view clustering recently. Nevertheless, existing CF-based multi-view clustering methods still have the following issues: (1) they directly conduct factorization in the original data space, which means its efficiency is sensitive to the feature dimension; (2) they ignore the high degree of factorization freedom of standard CF, which may lead to non-uniqueness factorization thereby causing reduced effectiveness; (3) traditional robust norms they used are unable to handle complex noises, significantly challenging their robustness. To address these issues, we establish a fast multi-view clustering via correntropy-based orthogonal concept factorization (FMVCCF). Specifically, FMVCCF executes factorization on a learned consensus anchor graph rather than directly decomposing the original data, lessening the dimensionality sensitivity. Then, a lightweight graph regularization term is incorporated to refine the factorization process with a low computational burden. Moreover, an improved multi-view correntropy-based orthogonal CF model is developed, which can enhance the effectiveness and robustness under the orthogonal constraint and correntropy criterion, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMVCCF can achieve promising effectiveness and robustness on various real-world datasets with high efficiency.},

Existing methods based on bipartite graphs for ranking recommendation mainly focus on homogeneous graphs and usually treat user and item nodes as the same kind of nodes, however, the user–item bipartite graph is always heterogeneous. Additionally, various types of nodes have varying effects on recommendations, and a good node representation can be learned by successfully differentiating the same type of nodes. In this paper, we develop a node-personalized multi-graph convolutional network (NP-MGCN) for ranking recommendation. It consists of a node importance awareness block, a graph construction module, and a node information propagation and aggregation framework. Specifically, a node importance awareness block is proposed to encode nodes using node degree information to highlight the differences between nodes. Subsequently, the Jaccard similarity and co-occurrence matrix fusion graph construction module is devised to acquire user–user and item–item graphs, enriching correlation information between users and between items. Finally, a composite hop node information propagation and aggregation framework, including single-hop and double-hop branches, is designed. The high-order connectivity is used to aggregate heterogeneous information for the single-hop branch, while the multi-hop dependency is utilized to aggregate homogeneous information for the double-hop branch. It makes user and item node embedding more discriminative and integrates the different nodes’ heterogeneity into the model. Experiments on several datasets manifest that NP-MGCN achieves outstanding recommendation performance than existing methods.},

In this paper, we introduce a new one-step Bayesian formulation to train Neural Networks and solve the above limitation for binary cases with one-step Learning Machines, avoiding the drawbacks that unknown analytical forms of the example-dependent costs create. The formulation is based on defining an artificial likelihood ratio by using the available training classification costs in its definition, and proposes a test that does not require the values of the costs for unseen samples. Furthermore, it also includes Bayesian rebalancing mechanisms to combat the negative effects of class imbalance.

  abstract     = {Recently, due to the difficulty of collecting condition data covering all mechanical fault types in industrial scenarios, the fault diagnosis problem under incomplete data is receiving increasing attention where no target prior information can be available. The existing open-set or universal domain adaptation (DA) diagnosis methods typically treat private fault samples in the target as a generalized “unknown” fault class, neglecting their inherent structure. This oversight can lead to confusion in latent feature space representations and difficulties in separating unknown samples. Therefore, a universal DA method with unsupervised clustering is developed to explore the intrinsic structure of the target samples for mechanical fault diagnosis, where multi-source information on different working conditions is considered to transfer complementary knowledge. First, a composite clustering metric combining single-domain and cross-domain evaluation is constructed to recognize shared and unknown health classes on source–target domains. Second, to alleviate the intra-class shift while enlarging the inter-class gap, a class-wise DA algorithm is suggested which operates on the basis of maximum mean discrepancy. Finally, an entropy regularization criterion is utilized to facilitate clustering of different health classes. The efficacy of the presented approach in the fault diagnosis issues when monitoring data is inadequate has been verified through extensive experiments on three rotating machinery datasets.},

  abstract     = {The limited transparency of the inner decision-making mechanism in deep neural networks (DNN) and other machine learning (ML) models has hindered their application in several domains. In order to tackle this issue, feature attribution methods have been developed to identify the crucial features that heavily influence decisions made by these black box models. However, many feature attribution methods have inherent downsides. For example, one category of feature attribution methods suffers from the artifacts problem, which feeds out-of-distribution masked inputs directly through the classifier that was originally trained on natural data points. Another category of feature attribution method finds explanations by using jointly trained feature selectors and predictors. While avoiding the artifacts problem, this new category suffers from the Encoding Prediction in the Explanation (EPITE) problem, in which the predictor’s decisions rely not on the features, but on the masks that selects those features. As a result, the credibility of attribution results is undermined by these downsides. In this research, we introduce the Double-sided Remove and Reconstruct (DoRaR) feature attribution method based on several improvement methods that addresses these issues. By conducting thorough testing on MNIST, CIFAR10 and our own synthetic dataset, we demonstrate that the DoRaR feature attribution method can effectively bypass the above issues and can aid in training a feature selector that outperforms other state-of-the-art feature attribution methods.

  abstract     = {Single image dehazing is a challenging computer vision task for other high-level applications, e . g . , e.g., object detection, navigation, and positioning systems. Recently, most existing dehazing methods have followed a “black box” recovery paradigm that obtains the haze-free image from its corresponding hazy input by network learning. Unfortunately, these algorithms ignore the effective utilization of relevant image priors and non-uniform haze distribution problems, causing insufficient or excessive dehazing performance. In addition, they pay little attention to image detail preservation during the dehazing process, thus inevitably producing blurry results. To address the above problems, we propose a novel priors-assisted dehazing network (called PADNet), which fully explores relevant image priors from two new perspectives: attention supervision and detail preservation. For one thing, we leverage the dark channel prior to constrain the attention map generation that denotes the haze pixel position information, thereby better extracting non-uniform feature distributions from hazy images. For another, we find that the residual channel prior of the hazy images contains rich structural information, so it is natural to incorporate it into our dehazing architecture to preserve more structural detail information. Furthermore, since the attention map and dehazed image are simultaneously predicted during the convergence of our model, a self-paced semi-curriculum learning strategy is utilized to alleviate the learning ambiguity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PADNet can perform favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {An accurate data-based prediction of the long-term evolution of Hamiltonian systems requires a network that preserves the appropriate structure under each time step. Every Hamiltonian system contains two essential ingredients: the Poisson bracket and the Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian systems with symmetries, whose paradigm examples are the Lie–Poisson systems, have been shown to describe a broad category of physical phenomena , from satellite motion to underwater vehicles, fluids, geophysical applications, complex fluids, and plasma physics. The Poisson bracket in these systems comes from the symmetries, while the Hamiltonian comes from the underlying physics. We view the symmetry of the system as primary, hence the Lie–Poisson bracket is known exactly, whereas the Hamiltonian is regarded as coming from physics and is considered not known, or known approximately. Using this approach, we develop a network based on transformations that exactly preserve the Poisson bracket and the special functions of the Lie–Poisson systems (Casimirs) to machine precision. We present two flavors of such systems: one, where the parameters of transformations are computed from data using a dense neural network (LPNets), and another, where the composition of transformations is used as building blocks (G-LPNets).

Firstly, a mathematics model of VFCDNs with short memory is established under multi-weighted networks and mismatched parameters, which is more diverse and practical. Secondly, under the framework of variable-order fractional derivative , a novel fractional differential inequality has been proposed to handle the issue of quasi-synchronization with hybrid delay-dependent impulses. Additionally, the quasi-synchronization criterion for VFCDNs is developed using differential inclusion theory and Lyapunov method . Finally, the practicality and feasibility of this theoretical analysis are demonstrated through numerical examples .},

Notably, despite the extensive inquiry into the efficacy of softmax regression representation learning , the intricate underpinnings governing the knowledge transfer mechanism remain inadequately elucidated. This study introduces the ‘Ideal Joint Classifier Knowledge Distillation’ (IJCKD) framework, an overarching paradigm that not only furnishes a lucid and exhaustive comprehension of prevailing knowledge distillation techniques but also establishes a theoretical underpinning for prospective investigations.

  abstract     = {In recent years, human physical activity recognition has increasingly attracted attention from different research fields such as healthcare, computer-human interaction, lifestyle monitoring, and athletics. Deep learning models have been extensively employed in developing physical activity recognition systems. To improve these models, their hyperparameters need to be initialized with optimal values. However, tuning these hyperparameters manually is time-consuming and may lead to inaccurate results. Moreover, the application of these models to different data resources and the integration of their results into the overall data processing pipeline are challenging issues in physical activity recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method for physical activity recognition based on a deep transformer-based time-series classification model that uses heart rate, speed, and distance time-series data to recognize physical activities. In particular, we develop a modified arithmetic optimization algorithm to automatically adjust the optimal values of the classification models’ hyperparameters. Moreover, a reinforcement learning-based ensemble approach is proposed to optimally integrate the results of the classification models obtained using heart rate, speed, and distance time-series data and, subsequently, recognize the physical activities. Experiments performed on a real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed method achieves promising efficiency in comparison to other state-of-the-art models. More specifically, the proposed method increases the performance compared to the second-best performer by around 3.44 %, 9.45 %, 5.43 %, 2.54 %, and 7.53 % based on accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score evaluation metrics, respectively.},

The ideal keypoints should be an ordered and well-aligned set of points that effectively reflect the shape and structure of the object. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised 3D point cloud keypoints generation network with the consideration of the probability distribution of keypoints and spatial distribution among keypoints. The network downsamples and groups the 3D point cloud, obtaining local features of the point cloud. The local features are leveraged to explicitly learn the mixture probability distribution of keypoint position. A composite loss function that comprehensively considers shape similarity, point importance, and geometric constraint is proposed to guide the network in generating keypoints with semantic consistency and regular spatial distribution. The experimental results and quantitative comparisons on the ShapeNet and KeypointNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves ordered, well-aligned, and robust keypoints generation for 3D point clouds.

Numerous techniques have been proposed to address CIP, including, but not limited to, Oversampling, Undersampling, and cost-sensitive approaches. Due to its ability to generate synthetic data , oversampling techniques such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) are the most widely used methodology by researchers. However, one of SMOTE’s potential disadvantages is that newly created minor samples overlap with major samples. Therefore, the probability of ML models’ biased performance toward major classes increases. Generative adversarial network (GAN) has recently garnered much attention due to their ability to create real samples. However, GAN is hard to train even though it has much potential. Considering these opportunities, this work proposes two novel techniques: GAN-based Oversampling (GBO) and Support Vector Machine-SMOTE-GAN (SSG) to overcome the limitations of the existing approaches. The preliminary results show that SSG and GBO performed better on the nine imbalanced benchmark datasets than several existing SMOTE-based approaches. Additionally, it can be observed that the proposed SSG and GBO methods can accurately classify the minor class with more than 90% accuracy when tested with 20%, 30%, and 40% of the test data . The study also revealed that the minor sample generated by SSG demonstrates Gaussian distributions , which is often difficult to achieve using original SMOTE and SVM-SMOTE.},

Inspired by the concept of few-shot learning, we propose a novel task called few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) that aims to accomplish MOD using only a few annotated data from each category. Specifically, we first design a cross-modality interaction (CMI) module, which leverages different attention mechanisms to interact with the information from visible and thermal modalities during backbone feature extraction. With the guidance of interaction process, the detector is able to extract modality-specific backbone features with better discrimination. To improve the few-shot learning ability of the detector, we also design a semantic prototype metric (SPM) loss that integrates semantic knowledge, i.e., word embeddings, into the optimization process of embedding space. Semantic knowledge provides stable category representation when visual information is insufficient. Extensive experiments on the customized FSMOD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks have become the primary graph representation learning paradigm, in which nodes update their embeddings by aggregating messages from their neighbors iteratively. However, current message passing based GNNs exploit the higher-order subgraph information other than 1st-order neighbors insufficiently. In contrast, the long-standing graph research has investigated various subgraphs such as motif, clique , core, and truss that contain important structural information to downstream tasks like node classification , which deserve to be preserved by GNNs. In this work, we propose to use the pre-mined subgraphs as priori knowledge to extend the receptive field of GNNs and enhance their expressive power to go beyond the 1st-order Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test. For that, we introduce a general framework called PSA-GNN (Priori Subgraph Augmented Graph Neural Network), which augments each GNN layer by a pair of parallel convolution layers based on a bipartite graph between nodes and priori subgraphs. PSA-GNN intrinsically builds a hybrid receptive field by incorporating priori subgraphs as neighbors, while the embeddings and weights of subgraphs are trainable. Moreover, PSA-GNN can purify the noisy subgraphs both heuristically before training and deterministically during training based on a novel metric called homogeneity. Experimental results show that PSA-GNN achieves an improved performance compared with state-of-the-art message passing based GNN models .},

The DTSN is particularly well suited to chaotic dynamical systems as it minimizes noise in the network output which is crucial for such sensitive systems. For our test cases we consider discrete approximations of the Lorenz-63 system and the Chua circuit. For the network architectures we use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Transformer. The performance of the DTSN is compared with the standard MSE loss for both architectures, as well as with the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) loss for the LSTM.

  abstract     = {Accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) is crucial for maintaining reliable and efficient operations within power systems . With the continuous increase in volume and variety of energy data provided by renewables, electric vehicles and other sources, long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as an attractive approach for STLF due to its superiorities in extracting the dynamic temporal information. However, traditional LSTM training methods rely on stochastic gradient methods that have several limitations. This paper presents an innovative LSTM optimization framework via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for STLF, dubbed ADMM-LSTM. Explicitly, we train the LSTM network distributedly by the ADMM algorithm. More specifically, we introduce a novel approach to update the parameters in the ADMM-LSTM framework, using a backward-forward order, significantly reducing computational time . Additionally, within the proposed framework, the solution to each subproblem is achieved by utilizing either the proximal point algorithm or local linear approximation , preventing the need for supplementary numerical solvers. This approach confers several advantages, including avoiding issues associated with exploding or vanishing gradients, thanks to the inherent gradient-free characteristics of ADMM-LSTM. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis that elucidates the convergence properties inherent to the ADMM-LSTM framework. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the algorithm’s convergence behavior . Lastly, the efficacy of our method is substantiated through a series of experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets.

The development of deep learning models is enabled by the availability of large-scale datasets. Despite unprecedented success, large-scale datasets considerably increase the storage and transmission costs, resulting in a cumbersome model training process. Moreover, using raw data for training raises privacy and copyright concerns. To address these issues, a new task named dataset distillation has been introduced, aiming to synthesize a compact dataset that retains the essential information from the large original dataset. State-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset distillation methods have been proposed by matching gradients or network parameters obtained during training on real and synthetic datasets . The contribution of different network parameters to the distillation process varies, and uniformly treating them leads to degraded distillation performance. Based on this observation, we propose an importance-aware adaptive dataset distillation (IADD) method that can improve distillation performance by automatically assigning importance weights to different network parameters during distillation, thereby synthesizing more robust distilled datasets. IADD demonstrates superior performance over other SOTA dataset distillation methods based on parameter matching on multiple benchmark datasets and outperforms them in terms of cross-architecture generalization. In addition, the analysis of self-adaptive weights demonstrates the effectiveness of IADD. Furthermore, the effectiveness of IADD is validated in a real-world medical application such as COVID-19 detection.},

  abstract     = {Human motion prediction is the key technology for many real-life applications, e.g., self-driving and human–robot interaction. The recent approaches adopt the unrestricted full-connection graph representation to capture the relationships inside the human skeleton. However, there are two issues to be solved: (i) these unrestricted full-connection graph representation methods neglect the inherent dependencies across the joints of the human body; (ii) these methods represent human motions using the features extracted from a single level and thus can neither fully exploit the various connection relationships among the human body nor guarantee the human motion prediction results to be reasonable. To tackle the above issues, we propose an adaptive multi-level hypergraph convolution network (AMHGCN), which uses the adaptive multi-level hypergraph representation to capture various dependencies among the human body. Our method has four different levels of hypergraph representations, including (i) the joint-level hypergraph representation to capture inherent kinetic dependencies in the human body, (ii) the part-level hypergraph representation to exploit the kinetic characteristics at a higher level (in comparison to the joint-level) by viewing some part of the human body as an entirety, (iii) the component-level hypergraph representation to model the semantic information, and (iv) the global-level hypergraph representation to extract long-distance dependencies in the human body. In addition, to take full advantage of the knowledge carried in the training data , we propose a reverse loss ( i.e., adopting the future human poses to predict the historical poses reversely) to realize data augmentation . Extensive experiments show that our proposed AMHGCN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, i.e., Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.},

However, most existing works on TIG either (a) rely on discretely updated node embeddings merely when an interaction occurs that fail to capture the continuous evolution of embedding trajectories of nodes, or (b) overlook the rich temporal patterns hidden in the ever-changing graph data that presumably lead to sub-optimal models. In this paper, we propose a two-module framework named ConTIG, a novel representation learning method on TIG that captures the continuous dynamic evolution of node embedding trajectories. With two essential modules, our model exploits three-fold factors in dynamic networks including latest interaction , neighbor features , and inherent characteristics . In the first update module, we employ a continuous inference block to learn the nodes’ state trajectories from time-adjacent interaction patterns using ordinary differential equations . In the second transform module, we introduce a self-attention mechanism to predict future node embeddings by aggregating historical temporal interaction information. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of ConTIG on temporal link prediction, temporal node recommendation, and dynamic node classification tasks of four datasets compared with a range of state-of-the-art baselines, especially for long-interval interaction prediction.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a novel exploration method for centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is introduced. The method uses the concept of strangeness, which is determined by evaluating (1) the level of the unfamiliarity of the observations an agent encounters and (2) the level of the unfamiliarity of the entire state the agents visit. An exploration bonus, which is derived from the concept of strangeness, is combined with the extrinsic reward obtained from the environment to form a mixed reward, which is then used for training CTDE-based MARL algorithms. Additionally, a separate action-value function is also proposed to prevent the high exploration bonus from overwhelming the sensitivity to extrinsic rewards during MARL training. This separate function is used to design the behavioral policy for generating transitions. The proposed method is not much affected by stochastic transitions commonly observed in MARL tasks and improves the stability of CTDE-based MARL algorithms when used with an exploration method. By providing didactic examples and demonstrating the substantial performance improvement of our proposed exploration method in CTDE-based MARL algorithms, we illustrate the advantages of our approach. These evaluations highlight how our method outperforms state-of-the-art MARL baselines on challenging tasks within the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark, underscoring its effectiveness in improving MARL.},

  abstract     = {Decoding emotional neural representations from the electroencephalographic (EEG)-based functional connectivity network (FCN) is of great scientific importance for uncovering emotional cognition mechanisms and developing harmonious human–computer interactions. However, existing methods mainly rely on phase-based FCN measures (e.g., phase locking value [PLV]) to capture dynamic interactions between brain oscillations in emotional states , which fail to reflect the energy fluctuation of cortical oscillations over time. In this study, we initially examined the efficacy of amplitude-based functional networks (e.g., amplitude envelope correlation [AEC]) in representing emotional states . Subsequently, we proposed an efficient phase–amplitude fusion framework (PAF) to fuse PLV and AEC and used common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract fused spatial topological features from PAF for multi-class emotion recognition. We conducted extensive experiments on the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets. The results showed that: (1) AEC-derived discriminative spatial network topological features possess the ability to characterize emotional states, and the differential network patterns of AEC reflect dynamic interactions in brain regions associated with emotional cognition. (2) The proposed fusion features outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy for both datasets. Moreover, the spatial filter learned from PAF is separable and interpretable, enabling a description of affective activation patterns from both phase and amplitude perspectives.},

  abstract     = {There is a recent trend to leverage the power of graph neural networks (GNNs) for brain-network based psychiatric diagnosis, which, in turn, also motivates an urgent need for psychiatrists to fully understand the decision behavior of the used GNNs. However, most of the existing GNN explainers are either post-hoc in which another interpretive model needs to be created to explain a well-trained GNN, or do not consider the causal relationship between the extracted explanation and the decision, such that the explanation itself contains spurious correlations and suffers from weak faithfulness. In this work, we propose a granger causality-inspired graph neural network (CI-GNN), a built-in interpretable model that is able to identify the most influential subgraph (i.e., functional connectivity within brain regions) that is causally related to the decision (e.g., major depressive disorder patients or healthy controls), without the training of an auxillary interpretive network. CI-GNN learns disentangled subgraph-level representations α α and β β that encode, respectively, the causal and non-causal aspects of original graph under a graph variational autoencoder framework, regularized by a conditional mutual information (CMI) constraint. We theoretically justify the validity of the CMI regulation in capturing the causal relationship . We also empirically evaluate the performance of CI-GNN against three baseline GNNs and four state-of-the-art GNN explainers on synthetic data and three large-scale brain disease datasets. We observe that CI-GNN achieves the best performance in a wide range of metrics and provides more reliable and concise explanations which have clinical evidence.

  abstract     = {Active noise control (ANC) is a typical signal-processing technique that has recently been utilized extensively to combat the urban noise problem. Although numerous advanced adaptive algorithms have been devised to enhance noise reduction performance, few of them have been implemented in actual ANC products due to their high computational complexity and slow convergence. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, Meta-learning-based initialization appears to become an efficient and cost-effective method for accelerating the convergence of adaptive algorithms. However, few dedicated Meta-learning algorithms exist for adaptive signal processing applications , particularly multichannel active noise control (MCANC). Hence, we proposed a modified Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) initialization for the MCANC system . 1 Additional theatrical research reveals that the nature of MAML, when applied to signal processing, is the expectation of a weight-sum gradient. Based on this discovery, we devised the Monte-Carlo Gradient Meta-learning (MCGM) algorithm, which employed a more straightforward procedure to accomplish the same performance as the Modified MAML algorithm. Furthermore, the numerical simulation of ANC using raw noise samples on measured paths validates the efficacy of the proposed methods in accelerating the convergence of the multichannel-filtered reference least mean square algorithm (McFxLMS).},

However, the relationships or attributes between entities often possess temporal characteristics as well. Neglecting these temporal characteristics can frequently lead to alignment errors. Compared to studying entity alignment in temporal knowledge graphs, there are relatively few efforts on entity alignment in cross-lingual temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, in this paper, we put forward an entity alignment method for cross-lingual temporal knowledge graphs, namely CTEA. Based on GCN and TransE, CTEA combines entity embeddings, relation embeddings and attribute embeddings to design a joint embedding model, which is more conducive to generating transferable entity embedding. In the meantime, the distance calculation between elements and the similarity calculation of entity pairs are combined to enhance the reliability of cross-lingual entity alignment. Experiments shows that the proposed CTEA model improves Hits@ m and MRR by about 0.8∼2.4 percentage points compared with the latest methods.},

But inaccurate pseudo-labels are always unavoidable to degrade the performance of the target model among these methods. Therefore, we propose a promising SFUDA method, namely Generation, Division and Training (GDT) which aims to promote the reliability of pseudo-labels for self-supervised learning and encourage similar features to have closer predictions than dissimilar ones by contrastive learning . Specifically in our GDT method, we first refine pseudo-labels with deep clustering for target samples and then split them into reliable samples and unreliable samples. After that, we adopt self-supervised learning and information maximization for reliable samples training . And for unreliable samples, we conduct contrastive learning via the perspective of similarity and disparity to attract similar samples and repulse dissimilar samples, which helps pull the similar features closed and push the dissimilar features away, leading to efficient feature clustering . Thorough experimentation on three benchmark datasets substantiates the excellence of our proposed approach.},

To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel multiscale dilated convolution neural network termed as MSDCNN is proposed for multi-view fine-grained 3D shape classification. Firstly, a sequence of views are rendered from 12-viewpoints around the input 3D shape by the sequential view capturing module. Then, the first 22 convolution layers of ResNeXt50 is employed to extract the semantic features of each view, and a global mixed feature map is obtained through the element-wise maximum operation of the 12 output feature maps . Furthermore, attention dilated module (ADM), which combines four concatenated attention dilated block (ADB), is designed to extract larger receptive field features from global mixed feature map to enhance context information among the views. Specifically, each ADB is consisted by an attention mechanism module and a dilated convolution with different dilation rates. In addition, prediction module with label smoothing is proposed to classify features, which contains 3 × 3 convolution and adaptive average pooling . The performance of our method is validated experimentally on the ModelNet10, ModelNet40 and FG3D datasets.

In this paper, a cross-modality integration framework (CIForAD) is proposed for anomaly detection, which combines both textual and visual modalities for prediction, perception and discrimination. Firstly, a feature fusion prediction (FUP) module is designed to predict the target regions by fusing the visual features and textual features for prompting, which can amplify the discriminative distance. Then an image-text semantic perception (ISP) module is developed to judge semantic consistency by associating the fine-grained visual features with textual features, where a strategy of local training and global inference is introduced to perceive local details and global semantic correlation. Finally, a self-supervised time attention discrimination (TAD) module is built to explore the inter-frame relation and further distinguish abnormal sequences from normal sequences. Extensive experiments on the three challenging benchmarks indicate that our CIForAD obtains state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) methods have been widely studied in recent years, which aims to improve the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) when the training dataset contains incorrectly annotated labels. Popular existing LNL methods rely on semantic features extracted by the DNN to detect and mitigate label noise. However, these extracted features are often spurious and contain unstable correlations with the label across different environments (domains), which can occasionally lead to incorrect prediction and compromise the efficacy of LNL methods. To mitigate this insufficiency, we propose I nvariant F eature based L abel C orrection (IFLC), which reduces spurious features and accurately utilizes the learned invariant features that contain stable correlation to correct label noise. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mitigate the issue of spurious features for LNL methods. IFLC consists of two critical processes: The L abel D isturbing (LD) process and the R epresentation D ecorrelation (RD) process. The LD process aims to encourage DNN to attain stable performance across different environments, thus reducing the captured spurious features. The RD process strengthens independence between each dimension of the representation vector , thus enabling accurate utilization of the learned invariant features for label correction. We then utilize robust linear regression for the feature representation to conduct label correction. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method and compared it with state-of-the-art (sota) LNL methods on four benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Animal-10N, and Clothing1M.

  abstract     = {Interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) as large intermittent electrophysiological events are associated with various severe brain disorders. Automated IED detection has long been a challenging task, and mainstream methods largely focus on singling out IEDs from backgrounds from the perspective of waveform, leaving normal sharp transients/artifacts with similar waveforms almost unattended. An open issue still remains to accurately detect IED events that directly reflect the abnormalities in brain electrophysiological activities, minimizing the interference from irrelevant sharp transients with similar waveforms only. This study then proposes a dual-view learning framework (namely V2IED) to detect IED events from multi-channel EEG via aggregating features from the two phases: (1) Morphological Feature Learning : directly treating the EEG as a sequence with multiple channels , a 1D-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is applied to explicitly learning the deep morphological features; and (2) Spatial Feature Learning: viewing the EEG as a 3D tensor embedding channel topology, a CNN captures the spatial features at each sampling point followed by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memories) to learn the evolution of these features. Experimental results from a public EEG dataset against the state-of-the-art counterparts indicate that: (1) compared with the existing optimal models , V2IED achieves a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in detecting IEDs from normal sharp transients with a 5.25% improvement in accuracy; (2) the introduction of spatial features improves performance by 2.4% in accuracy; and (3) V2IED also performs excellently in distinguishing IEDs from background signals especially benign variants.},

In this paper, we investigate the privacy-preserving pre-training based neural network inference in a two-server framework based on additive secret sharing technique. Our protocol allows a resource-restrained client to request two powerful servers to cooperatively process the natural processing tasks without revealing any useful information about its data. We first design a series of secure sub-protocols for non-linear functions used in BERT model. These sub-protocols are expected to have broad applications and of independent interest. Based on the building sub-protocols, we propose SecBERT, a privacy-preserving pre-training based neural network inference protocol. SecBERT is the first cryptographically secure privacy-preserving pre-training based neural network inference protocol.

  abstract     = {Natural data typically exhibits a long-tailed distribution, presenting great challenges for recognition tasks. Due to the extreme scarcity of training instances, tail classes often show inferior performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem within the trendy visual-language (VL) framework and find that the performance bottleneck mainly arises from the recognition confusion between tail classes and their highly correlated head classes . Building upon this observation, unlike previous research primarily emphasizing class frequency in addressing long-tailed issues, we take a novel perspective by incorporating a crucial additional factor namely class correlation. Specifically, we model the representation learning procedure for each sample as two parts, i.e. , a special part that learns the unique properties of its own class and a common part that learns shared characteristics among classes. By analysis, we discover that the learning process of common representation is easily biased toward head classes. Because of the bias, the network may lean towards the biased common representation as classification criteria, rather than prioritizing the crucial information encapsulated within the specific representation, ultimately leading to recognition confusion. To solve the problem, based on the VL framework, we introduce the rectification contrastive term (ReCT) to rectify the representation bias, according to semantic hints and training status. Extensive experiments on three widely-used long-tailed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReCT. On iNaturalist2018, it achieves an overall accuracy of 75.4%, surpassing the baseline by 3.6 points in a ResNet-50 visual backbone.},

  abstract     = {Vision Transformer (ViT) has performed remarkably in various computer vision tasks . Nonetheless, affected by the massive amount of parameters, ViT usually suffers from serious overfitting problems with a relatively limited number of training samples . In addition, ViT generally demands heavy computing resources, which limit its deployment on resource-constrained devices. As a type of model-compression method, model binarization is potentially a good choice to solve the above problems. Compared with the full-precision one, the model with the binarization method replaces complex tensor multiplication with simple bit-wise binary operations and represents full-precision model parameters and activations with only 1-bit ones, which potentially solves the problem of model size and computational complexity , respectively. In this paper, we investigate a binarized ViT model. Empirically, we observe that the existing binarization technology designed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) cannot migrate well to a ViT’s binarization task. We also find that the decline of the accuracy of the binary ViT model is mainly due to the information loss of the Attention module and the Value vector. Therefore, we propose a novel model binarization technique, called G roup S uperposition B inarization ( GSB ), to deal with these issues. Furthermore, in order to further improve the performance of the binarization model, we have investigated the gradient calculation procedure in the binarization process and derived more proper gradient calculation equations for GSB to reduce the influence of gradient mismatch. Then, the knowledge distillation technique is introduced to alleviate the performance degradation caused by model binarization. Analytically, model binarization can limit the parameter’s search space during parameter updates while training a model. Therefore, the binarization process can actually play an implicit regularization role and help solve the problem of overfitting in the case of insufficient training data . Experiments on three datasets with limited numbers of training samples demonstrate that the proposed GSB model achieves state-of-the-art performance among the binary quantization schemes and exceeds its full-precision counterpart on some indicators.

  abstract     = {In the last two decades, remarkable progress has been done in singular learning machine theories on the basis of algebraic geometry . These theories reveal that we need to find resolution maps of singularities for analyzing asymptotic behavior of state probability functions when the number of data increases. In particular, it is essential to construct normal crossing divisors of average log loss functions. However, there are few examples for obtaining these for singular models. In this paper, we determine the resolution map and normal crossing divisors for multiple-layered neural networks with linear units. Moreover, we have the exact values for the learning efficiency, which is so called learning coefficients. Multiple-layered neural networks with linear units are simple, however, very important models because these models give the essential information from data of input–output pairs. Moreover, these models are very close to multiple-layered neural networks with rectified linear units (ReLU). We show the learning coefficients of multiple-layered neural networks with linear units are bounded even though the number of layers goes to infinity, which means that the main term of asymptotic expansion of the free energy and generalization error of singular models are much smaller than the dimension of its parameter space.},

Dense trivial features of individual targets are frequently susceptible to interference from complex background features, which makes it difficult to obtain satisfactory predictions for individual targets. Aiming at this issue, a Fourier feature decorrelation based sample attention is proposed for dense crowd localization. The correlation between features are decoupled in the Fourier transform domain, which induces the model to focus more on the true correlation between individual target features and labels. From the perspective of Fourier feature correlation between samples, independence test statistic optimization with cross-covariance operator is developed for feature decorrelation within the sample attention framework. The sample attention with global weight learning is iteratively optimized through matching the prediction loss, which can induce model partial out the spurious correlation between target-irrelevant features and labels. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper outperforms the current advanced crowd location methods on public dense crowd datasets.},

Nevertheless, they suffer from gender inference from gender-related attributes and fail to support the recovery of the original image. In this paper, we propose a novel gender privacy protection scheme that aims to enhance gender privacy while supporting reversibility . Firstly, our scheme utilizes continuously optimized adversarial perturbations to prevent gender recognition from unauthorized classifiers . Meanwhile, gender-related attributes are concealed for classifiers, which prevents the inference of gender from these attributes, thereby enhancing gender privacy. Moreover, an identity preservation constraint is added to maintain identity preservation. Secondly, reversibility is supported by a reversible image transformation, allowing the perturbations to be securely removed to losslessly recover the original face when required. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in gender privacy protection, identity preservation, and reversibility.},

First, a continuous-time neurodynamic approach with variables in matrix form is developed by combining the optimal rank r r projection and the gradient. Then, the optimality of the proposed neurodynamic approach is rigorously analyzed by demonstrating that the objective function satisfies the functional property which is called as ( 2 r , 4 r ) (2r,4r) -restricted strong convexity and smoothness ( ( 2 r , 4 r ) (2r,4r) -RSCS). Furthermore, the convergence and stability analysis of the proposed neurodynamic approach is rigorously conducted by establishing appropriate Lyapunov functions and considering the relevant restricted isometry property (RIP) condition associated with the affine transformation. Finally, through experiments involving low-rank matrix recovery under affine transformations and the completion of low-rank real image , the effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated, along with its superiority compared to the vector-based approach.},

The current state-of-the-art methods employ various methods based on feature interaction to predict advertisement Click-Through Rate (CTR); however, the feature interaction based on potential new feature mining is rarely considered, which can provide effective assistance for feature interaction. This motivates us to investigate methods that combine potential new features and feature interactions. Thus, we propose a potential feature excitation learning network ( PeNet ), which is a neural network model based on feature combination and feature interaction. In PeNet , we treat the row compression and column compression of the original feature matrix as potential new features, and proposed the excitation learning mechanism that is a weighted mechanism based on residual principle. Through this excitation learning mechanism, the original embedded features and potential new features are subjected to weighted interaction based on the residual principle. Moreover, a deep neural network is exploited to iteratively learn and iteratively combine features. The excitation learning structure of PeNet neural network is well demonstrated in this paper, that is, the control flow of embedding, compression, excitation and output, which further strengthens the correlated features and weakens the uncorrelated features by compressing and expanding the features. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets indicate the PeNet as a general-purpose plug-in has more superior performance and better efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods.},

However, these approaches often overlook the scale information of the exemplar objects, leading to lower counting accuracy for objects with multi-scale characteristics. Additionally, convolution operations are local linear matching processes that may result in a loss of semantic information, which can limit the performance of the counting algorithm. To address these issues, we devise a new scale-aware transformer-based feature fusion module that integrates visual and scale information of exemplar objects and models similarity between samples and queries using cross-attention. Finally, we propose an object counting algorithm based on a feature extraction backbone, a feature fusion module and a density map regression head, called SATCount.

Most existing GCL approaches maximize mutual information between two views derived from the original graph, either randomly or heuristically. However, the generalization ability of GCL and its theoretical principles are still less studied. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric GCL-GE, to quantify the generalization gap between predefined pretext and agnostic downstream tasks. Given the inherent intractability of GCL-GE, we leverage concepts from information theory to derive a mutual information upper bound that is independent of the downstream tasks, thus enabling the metric’s optimization despite the variability in downstream tasks. Based on the theoretical insight, we propose InfoAdv, a GCL framework to directly enhance generalization by jointly optimizing GCL-GE and InfoMax. Extensive experiments validate the capability of InfoAdv to enhance performance across a wide variety of downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the generalizability of GCL.},

Robust models that are able to handle and mitigate the effect of these noisy labels are thus essential. In this work, we explore the open challenges of neural network memorization and uncertainty in creating robust learning algorithms with noisy labels. To overcome them, we propose a novel framework called “Bayesian DivideMix++” with two critical components: (i) DivideMix++, to enhance the robustness against memorization and (ii) Monte-Carlo MixMatch, which focuses on improving the effectiveness towards label uncertainty. DivideMix++ improves the pipeline by integrating the warm-up and augmentation pipeline with self-supervised pre-training and dedicated different data augmentations for loss analysis and backpropagation . Monte-Carlo MixMatch leverages uncertainty measurements to mitigate the influence of uncertain samples by reducing their weight in the data augmentation MixMatch step. We validate our proposed pipeline using four datasets encompassing various synthetic and real-world noise settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed pipeline using extensive experiments. Bayesian DivideMix++ outperforms the state-of-the-art models by considerable differences in all experiments. Our findings underscore the potential of leveraging these modifications to enhance the performance and generalization of deep neural networks in practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been considered a potential competitor to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their high biological plausibility and energy efficiency. However, the architecture design of SNN has not been well studied. Previous studies either use ANN architectures or directly search for SNN architectures under a highly constrained search space . In this paper, we aim to introduce much more complex connection topologies to SNNs to further exploit the potential of SNN architectures. To this end, we propose the topology-aware search space , which is the first search space that enables a more diverse and flexible design for both the spatial and temporal topology of the SNN architecture. Then, to efficiently obtain architecture from our search space, we propose the spatio-temporal topology sampling (STTS) algorithm. By leveraging the benefits of random sampling, STTS can yield powerful architecture without the need for an exhaustive search process, making it significantly more efficient than alternative search strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, we obtain 70.79% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with only 4 time steps, 1.79% higher than the second best model. Our code is available under https://github.com/stiger1000/Random-Sampling-SNN .},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional data such as natural images or speech signals exhibit some form of regularity, preventing their dimensions from varying independently. This suggests that there exists a lower dimensional latent representation from which the high-dimensional observed data were generated. Uncovering the hidden explanatory features of complex data is the goal of representation learning , and deep latent variable generative models have emerged as promising unsupervised approaches. In particular, the variational autoencoder (VAE) which is equipped with both a generative and an inference model allows for the analysis, transformation, and generation of various types of data. Over the past few years, the VAE has been extended to deal with data that are either multimodal or dynamical (i.e., sequential). In this paper, we present a multimodal and dynamical VAE (MDVAE) applied to unsupervised audiovisual speech representation learning . The latent space is structured to dissociate the latent dynamical factors that are shared between the modalities from those that are specific to each modality. A static latent variable is also introduced to encode the information that is constant over time within an audiovisual speech sequence. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on an audiovisual emotional speech dataset, in two stages. In the first stage, a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) is learned independently for each modality, without temporal modeling . The second stage consists in learning the MDVAE model on the intermediate representation of the VQ-VAEs before quantization. The disentanglement between static versus dynamical and modality-specific versus modality-common information occurs during this second training stage. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate how audiovisual speech latent factors are encoded in the latent space of MDVAE. These experiments include manipulating audiovisual speech, audiovisual facial image denoising, and audiovisual speech emotion recognition . The results show that MDVAE effectively combines the audio and visual information in its latent space. They also show that the learned static representation of audiovisual speech can be used for emotion recognition with few labeled data, and with better accuracy compared with unimodal baselines and a state-of-the-art supervised model based on an audiovisual transformer architecture.},

  abstract     = {To decrease the interference in the process of epileptic feature extraction caused by insufficient detection capability in partial channels of focal epilepsy , this paper proposes a novel epilepsy detection method based on dynamic electroencephalogram (EEG) channel screening. This method not only extracts more effective epilepsy features but also finds common features among different epilepsy subjects, providing an effective approach and theoretical support for across-subject epilepsy detection in clinical scenarios. Firstly, we use the Refine Composite Multiscale Dispersion Entropy (RCMDE) to measure the complexity of EEG signals between normal and seizure states and realize the dynamic EEG channel screening among different subjects, which can enhance the capability of feature extraction and the robustness of epilepsy detection. Subsequently, we discover common epilepsy features in 3–15 Hz among different subjects by the screened EEG channels. By this finding, we construct the Residual Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ResCon-LSTM) neural network to accomplish across-subject epilepsy detection. The experiment results on the CHB-MIT dataset indicate that the highest accuracy of epilepsy detection in the single-subject experiment is 98.523 %, improved by 5.298 % compared with non-channel screening. In the across-subject experiment, the average accuracy is 96.596 %. Therefore, this method could be effectively applied to different subjects by dynamically screening optimal channels and keep a good detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Whilst adversarial training has been proven to be one most effective defending method against adversarial attacks for deep neural networks , it suffers from over-fitting on training adversarial data and thus may not guarantee the robust generalization. This may result from the fact that the conventional adversarial training methods generate adversarial perturbations usually in a supervised way so that the resulting adversarial examples are highly biased towards the decision boundary, leading to an inhomogeneous data distribution . To mitigate this limitation, we propose to generate adversarial examples from a perturbation diversity perspective. Specifically, the generated perturbed samples are not only adversarial but also diverse so as to certify robust generalization and significant robustness improvement through a homogeneous data distribution. We provide theoretical and empirical analysis, establishing a foundation to support the proposed method. As a major contribution, we prove that promoting perturbations diversity can lead to a better robust generalization bound. To verify our methods’ effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments over different datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN) with different adversarial attacks (e.g., PGD, CW).

The dissemination of fake information can lead to social harm and damage the credibility of information. To address this issue, deep learning has emerged as a promising approach, especially with the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study introduces a novel approach called Graph Global Attention Network with Memory (GANM) for detecting fake news. This approach leverages NLP techniques to encode nodes with news context and user content. It employs three graph convolutional networks to extract informative features from the news propagation network and aggregates endogenous and exogenous user information. This methodology aims to address the challenge of identifying fake news within the context of social media. Innovatively, the GANM combines two strategies. First, a novel global attention mechanism with memory is employed in the GANM to learn the structural homogeneity of news propagation networks, which is the attention mechanism of a single graph with a history of all graphs. Second, we design a module for partial key information learning aggregation to emphasize the acquisition of partial key information in the graph and merge node-level embeddings with graph-level embeddings into fine-grained joint information. Our proposed method provides a new direction in news detection research with a combination of global and partial information and achieves promising performance on real-world datasets.},

This task is done by incorporating LogRelu activation, a Logarithmic Cost Function , and unique logarithmic learning method. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches are evaluated by using various datasets and SGD/Adam optimizers.

This problem becomes increasingly severe in situations where labels are scarce. To tackle this issue of sparse and noisy labels, we propose a novel approach Contrastive Robust Graph Neural Network (CR-GNN), Firstly, considering label sparsity and noise, we employ unsupervised contrastive loss and further incorporate homophily in the graph structure, thus introducing neighbor contrastive loss. Moreover, data augmentation is typically used to construct positive and negative samples in contrastive learning , which may result in inconsistent prediction outcomes. Based on this, we propose a dynamic cross-entropy loss, which selects the nodes with consistent predictions as reliable nodes for cross-entropy loss and benefits to mitigate the overfitting to labeling noise. Finally, we propose cross-space consistency to narrow the semantic gap between the contrast and classification spaces.

This paper presents a novel method that utilizes mutual information to protect this domain-specific information, ensuring that the latent features of the unlabeled data not only remain domain-invariant but also reflect the unique statistics of the unlabeled domain. We show that simultaneous maximization of mutual information and reduction of domain divergence can effectively preserve domain-private information. We further illustrate that a neural estimator can aptly estimate the mutual information between the unlabeled input space and its latent feature space . Both theoretical analysis and empirical results validate the significance of preserving such unique information of the unlabeled domain for cross-domain generalization.

  abstract     = {Multi-modal signals have become essential data for emotion recognition since they can represent emotions more comprehensively. However, in real-world environments, it is often impossible to acquire complete data on multi-modal signals, and the problem of missing modalities causes severe performance degradation in emotion recognition. Therefore, this paper represents the first attempt to use a transformer-based architecture, aiming to fill the modality-incomplete data from partially observed data for multi-modal emotion recognition (MER). Concretely, this paper proposes a novel unified model called transformer autoencoder (TAE), comprising a modality-specific hybrid transformer encoder, an inter-modality transformer encoder, and a convolutional decoder. The modality-specific hybrid transformer encoder bridges a convolutional encoder and a transformer encoder, allowing the encoder to learn local and global context information within each particular modality. The inter-modality transformer encoder builds and aligns global cross-modal correlations and models long-range contextual information with different modalities. The convolutional decoder decodes the encoding features to produce more precise recognition. Besides, a regularization term is introduced into the convolutional decoder to force the decoder to fully leverage the complete and incomplete data for emotional recognition of missing data. 96.33%, 95.64%, and 92.69% accuracies are attained on the available data of the DEAP and SEED-IV datasets, and 93.25%, 92.23%, and 81.76% accuracies are obtained on the missing data. Particularly, the model acquires a 5.61% advantage with 70% missing data, demonstrating that the model outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in incomplete multi-modal learning.},

  abstract     = {The tracking methods based on Transformer have shown great potential in visual tracking and achieved significant tracking performance. The traditional transformer based feature fusion network divides a whole feature map into multiple image patches as its inputs, and then directly processes them in parallel, which will occupy a lot of computing resources and affect the computing efficiency of multi-head attention. In this paper, we design a novel feature fusion network with optimized multi-head attention in encoder and decoder architecture based on Transformer. The designed feature fusion network preprocess the input features and change the calculations of multi-head attention by using both the efficient multi-head self-attention module and efficient multi-head spatial reduction attention module. The two modules can reduce the influence of irrelevant background information, enhance the representation ability of template features and search region features, and greatly reduce the computational complexity. We propose a novel Transformer tracking method (named EMAT) based on the designed feature fusion network. The proposed EMAT is evaluated on seven challenging tracking benchmarks to demonstrate its superiority, including LaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet, UAV123, VOT2018, NfS and VOT-RGBT2019. The proposed tracker achieves well tracking performance, and obtains precision score of 89.0% on UAV123, AUC score of 64.6% on LaSOT, EAO score of 34.8% on VOT-RGBT2019, which outperforms most advanced trackers. EMAT runs at a real-time speed of about 35 FPS during tracking.},

  abstract     = {Human pose estimation has numerous applications in motion recognition, virtual reality, human–computer interaction, and other related fields. However, multi-person pose estimation in crowded and occluded scenes is challenging. One major issue about the current top-down human pose estimation approaches is that they are limited to predicting the pose of a single person, even when the bounding box contains multiple individuals. To address this problem, we propose a novel Crowd and Occlusion-aware Network (CONet) using a divide-and-conquer strategy. Our approach includes a Crowd and Occlusion-aware Head (COHead) which estimates the pose of both the occluder and the occluded person using two separate branches. We also use the attention mechanism to guide the branches for differentiated learning, aiming to improve feature representation. Additionally, we propose a novel interference point loss to enhance the model’s anti-interference ability. Our CONet is simple yet effective, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art model by +1.6 AP, achieving 71.6 AP on CrowdPose. Our proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art results on the CrowdPose dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the accuracy of human pose estimation in crowded and occluded scenes. This achievement highlights the potential of our model in many real-world applications where accurate human pose estimation is crucial, such as surveillance, sports analysis, and human–computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {Advances in deep learning have shown great promise towards the application of performing high-accuracy Electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification in a variety of tasks. However, many EEG-based datasets are often plagued by the issue of high inter-subject signal variability. Robust deep learning models are notoriously difficult to train under such scenarios, often leading to subpar or widely varying performance across subjects under the leave-one-subject-out paradigm. Recently, the model agnostic meta-learning framework was introduced as a way to increase the model’s ability to generalize towards new tasks. While the original framework focused on task-based meta-learning, this research aims to show that the meta-learning methodology can be modified towards subject-based signal classification while maintaining the same task objectives and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Namely, we propose the novel implementation of a few/zero-shot subject-independent meta-learning framework towards multi-class inner speech and binary class motor imagery classification. Compared to current subject-adaptive methods which utilize large number of labels from the target, the proposed framework shows its effectiveness in training zero-calibration and few-shot models for subject-independent EEG classification. The proposed few/zero-shot subject-independent meta-learning mechanism performs well on both small and large datasets and achieves robust, generalized performance across subjects. The results obtained shows a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art, with the binary class motor imagery achieving 88.70% and the accuracy of multi-class inner speech achieving an average of 31.15%.

Recently, disentangled representation learning has made excellent progress in various vision tasks. However, existing networks for low-level vision tasks lack efficient feature interaction and delivery mechanisms in the disentanglement process or an evaluation mechanism for the degree of decoupling in the reconstruction process, rendering direct application to image dehazing challenging. We propose a self-guided disentangled representation learning (SGDRL) algorithm with a self-guided disentangled network to realize multi-level progressive feature decoupling through sharing and interaction. The self-guided disentangled (SGD) network extracts image features using the multi-layer backbone network , and attribute features are weighted using the self-guided attention mechanism for the backbone features. In addition, we introduce a disentanglement-guided (DG) module to evaluate the degree of feature decomposition and guide the feature fusion process in the reconstruction stage . Accordingly, we develop SGDRL-based unsupervised and semi-supervised single image dehazing networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for real-world image dehazing. The source code is available at https://github.com/dehazing/SGDRL .},

In addition, using the composite learning algorithm and neural networks to construct the identifier, a simplified identifier-actor-critic-based reinforcement learning strategy is proposed to obtain the approximate optimal controller under the framework of backstepping. Meanwhile, with the aid of the nonlinear dynamic surface control technique, the issue of “explosion of complexity” in backstepping is removed, and the requirements for filter parameters are loosened. Based on Lyapunov stability theory , it is demonstrated that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In light of these concerns, this study proposes an optimization strategy for residual networks that leverages an enhanced Particle swarm optimization algorithm. Primarily, low-complexity residual architecture block is employed as the foundational unit for architecture exploration, facilitating a more diverse investigation into network architectures while minimizing parameters. Additionally, we employ a depth initialization strategy to confine the search space within a reasonable range, thereby mitigating unnecessary particle exploration. Lastly, we present a novel approach for computing particle differences and updating velocity mechanisms to enhance the exploration of updated trajectories. This method significantly contributes to the improved utilization of the search space and the augmentation of particle diversity. Moreover, we constructed a crime-dataset comprising 13 classes to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can design lightweight networks with superior classification performance on both benchmark datasets and the crime-dataset.},

Using anchor points also reduces the computation complexity. Next, the bipartite graph is built by fusing these representation matrices , and a Laplacian rank constraint is enforced on the bipartite graph .

Current algorithms are criticized for failing either to balance data restoration and clustering or to capture the consistency of the representation of various views. To address these problems, a novel M ulti-level R epresentation L earning C ontrastive and A dversarial L earning (aka MRL_CAL) for incomplete multi-view clustering is proposed, in which data restoration, consistent representation, and clustering are jointly learned by exploiting features in various subspaces. Specifically, MRL_CAL employs v v auto-encoder to obtain a low-level specific-view representation of instances, which restores data by estimating the distribution of the original incomplete data with adversarial learning. Then, MRL_CAL extracts a high-level representation of instances, in which the consistency of various views and labels of clusters is incorporated with contrastive learning . In this case, MRL_CAL simultaneously learns multi-level features of instances in various subspaces, which not only overcomes the confliction of representations but also improves the quality of features. Finally, MRL_CAL transforms incomplete multi-view clustering into an overall objective, where features are learned under the guidance of clustering. Extensive experimental results indicate that MRL_CAL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of various measurements, implying that the proposed method is promising for incomplete multi-view clustering.},

  abstract     = {The Centralized Training and Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm, where a centralized critic is allowed to access global information during the training phase while maintaining the learned policies executed with only local information in a decentralized way, has achieved great progress in recent years. Despite the progress, CTDE may suffer from the issue of Centralized–Decentralized Mismatch (CDM): the suboptimality of one agent’s policy can exacerbate policy learning of other agents through the centralized joint critic. In contrast to centralized learning, the cooperative model that most closely resembles the way humans cooperate in nature is fully decentralized, i.e. Independent Learning (IL). However, there are still two issues that need to be addressed before agents coordinate through IL: (1) how agents are aware of the presence of other agents, and (2) how to coordinate with other agents to improve joint policy under IL. In this paper, we propose an inference-based coordinated MARL method: Deep Motor System (DMS). DMS first presents the idea of individual intention inference where agents are allowed to disentangle other agents from their environment. Secondly, causal inference was introduced to enhance coordination by reasoning each agent’s effect on others’ behavior . The proposed model was extensively experimented on a series of Multi-Agent MuJoCo and StarCraftII tasks. Results show that the proposed method outperforms independent learning algorithms and the coordination behavior among agents can be learned even without the CTDE paradigm compared to the state-of-the-art baselines including IPPO and HAPPO .},

  abstract     = {Insufficient data is a long-standing challenge for Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) to build a high-performance deep learning model . Though numerous research groups and institutes collect a multitude of EEG datasets for the same BCI task, sharing EEG data from multiple sites is still challenging due to the heterogeneity of devices. The significance of this challenge cannot be overstated, given the critical role of data diversity in fostering model robustness. However, existing works rarely discuss this issue, predominantly centering their attention on model training within a single dataset, often in the context of inter-subject or inter-session settings. In this work, we propose a hierarchical personalized Federated Learning EEG decoding ( FLEEG ) framework to surmount this challenge. This innovative framework heralds a new learning paradigm for BCI, enabling datasets with disparate data formats to collaborate in the model training process. Each client is assigned a specific dataset and trains a hierarchical personalized model to manage diverse data formats and facilitate information exchange. Meanwhile, the server coordinates the training procedure to harness knowledge gleaned from all datasets, thus elevating overall performance. The framework has been evaluated in Motor Imagery (MI) classification with nine EEG datasets collected by different devices but implementing the same MI task. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework can boost classification performance up to 8.4% by enabling knowledge sharing between multiple datasets, especially for smaller datasets. Visualization results also indicate that the proposed framework can empower the local models to put a stable focus on task-related areas, yielding better performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end solution to address this important challenge.},

  abstract     = {Domain generalization-based fault diagnosis (DGFD) presents significant prospects for recognizing faults without the accessibility of the target domain. Previous DGFD methods have achieved significant progress; however, there are some limitations. First, most DGFG methods statistically model the dependence between time-series data and labels, and they are superficial descriptions to the actual data-generating process. Second, most of the existing DGFD methods are only verified on vibrational time-series datasets, which is insufficient to show the potential of domain generalization in the fault diagnosis area. In response to the above issues, this paper first proposes a DGFD method named Causal Disentanglement Domain Generalization (CDDG), which can reestablish the data-generating process by disentangling time-series data into the causal factors (fault-related representation) and no-casual factors (domain-related representation) with a structural causal model . Specifically, in CDDG, causal aggregation loss is designed to separate the unobservable causal and non-causal factors. Meanwhile, the reconstruction loss is proposed to ensure the information completeness of the disentangled factors. We also introduce a redundancy reduction loss to learn efficient features. The proposed CDDG is verified on five cross-machine vibrational fault diagnosis cases and three cross-environment acoustical anomaly detection cases by comparing it with eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) DGFD methods. We publicize the open-source time-series DGFD Benchmark containing CDDG and the eight SOTA methods . The code repository will be available at https://github.com/ShaneSpace/DGFDBenchmark .},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often viewed as black boxes due to their lack of transparency, which hinders their application in critical fields. Many explanation methods have been proposed to address the interpretability issue of GNNs. These explanation methods reveal explanatory information about graphs from different perspectives. However, the explanatory information may also pose an attack risk to GNN models . In this work, we will explore this problem from the explanatory subgraph perspective. To this end, we utilize a powerful GNN explanation method called SubgraphX and deploy it locally to obtain explanatory subgraphs from given graphs. Then we propose methods for conducting evasion attacks and backdoor attacks based on the local explainer. In evasion attacks, the attacker gets explanatory subgraphs of test graphs from the local explainer and replace their explanatory subgraphs with an explanatory subgraph of other labels, making the target model misclassify test graphs as wrong labels. In backdoor attacks, the attacker employs the local explainer to select an explanatory trigger and locate suitable injection locations. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks on state-of-art GNN models and different datasets. The results also demonstrate that our proposed backdoor attack is more efficient, adaptable, and concealed than previous backdoor attacks.},

In recent years, diffusion models have proven very effective in image generation and have been used widely in computer vision . This paper presents a new feature map denoising module (FMD) based on the diffusion model for feature refinement, which is plug-and-play, allowing flexible integration into popular used segmentation networks for seamless end-to-end training. We evaluate the performance of the FMD module on four models, UNet, UNeXt, TransUNet, and IB-TransUNet, by conducting experiments on four datasets. The experimental data analysis shows that adding the FMD module significantly positively impacts the model performance. Furthermore, especially for small lesion areas and minor organs, adding the FMD module allows users to obtain more accurate segmentation results than the original model.},

The prevailing unit-based interpretation is a statistical observation of stimulus–response data, which fails to show a detailed internal process of inherent mechanisms of neural networks . In this work, we analyze a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in the classification task and present an algorithm to extract the diffusion pathways of individual pixels to identify the locations of pixels in an input image associated with object classes. The pathways allow us to test the causal components which are important for classification and the pathway-based representations are clearly distinguishable between categories. We find that the few largest pathways of an individual pixel from an image tend to cross the feature maps in each layer that is important for classification. And the large pathways of images of the same category are more consistent in their trends than those of different categories. We also apply the pathways to understanding adversarial attacks , object completion, and movement perception. Further, the total number of pathways on feature maps in all layers can clearly discriminate the original, deformed, and target samples.},

  abstract     = {Although great success has been achieved in various computer vision tasks , deep neural networks (DNNs) suffer dramatic performance degradation when evaluated on out-of-distribution data. Domain generalization (DG) is proposed to handle this problem by learning domain-agnostic information from multiple source domains to generalize well on unseen target domains. Several methods resort to Fourier transform due to its simplicity and efficiency. They argue that amplitude spectra imply domain-specific information, which should be suppressed, while phase counterparts imply domain-agnostic information, which should be preserved. However, these methods only suppress the domain-specific information in source domains and neglect the relationship with target domains, leading to the persistence of the domain gap. Besides, these methods preserve domain-agnostic information by keeping phase components unchanged, causing them to be underutilized. In this paper, we propose Dual Branch Augmentation Module (DBAM) by leveraging Fourier transform and taking advantage of both amplitude and phase spectra. For the amplitude branch, we propose Inner-domain Amplitude Distribution Rectification (IADR) and Cross-domain Amplitude Dirichlet Mixup (CADM) to stabilize the training process and explore more feature space . In addition, we propose Test-time Amplitude Prototype Calibration (TAPC) to construct the connection between source and target domains during evaluation to further mitigate the domain gap. For the phase branch, we propose Random Symmetric Phase Perturbation (RSPP) to enhance the robustness for recognizing domain-agnostic information. With the combined contributions of the two branches, DBAM significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and further analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of DBAM.},

  abstract     = {Traffic Prediction based on graph structures is a challenging task given that road networks are typically complex structures and the data to be analyzed contains variable temporal features. Further, the quality of the spatial feature extraction is highly dependent on the weight settings of the graph structures. In the transportation field, the weights of these graph structures are currently calculated based on factors like the distance between roads. However, these methods do not take into account the characteristics of the road itself or the correlations between different traffic flows. Existing approaches usually pay more attention to local spatial dependencies extraction while global spatial dependencies are ignored. Another major problem is how to extract sufficient information at limited depth of graph structures. To address these challenges, we propose a Random Graph Diffusion Attention Network (RGDAN) for traffic prediction. RGDAN comprises a graph diffusion attention module and a temporal attention module. The graph diffusion attention module can adjust its weights by learning from data like a CNN to capture more realistic spatial dependencies. The temporal attention module captures the temporal correlations. Experiments on three large-scale public datasets demonstrate that RGDAN produces predictions with 2%–5% more precision than state-of-the-art methods.},

Our findings suggest that transformer-based models generally outperform convolution-based models in robustness across multiple metrics. However, we contend that these metrics may not wholly represent true model robustness, such as the mean of corruption error. To better understand the underpinnings of this robustness advantage, we analyze models through the lens of Fourier transform and game interaction. From our insights, we propose a calibrated evaluation metric for robustness against real-world data, and a blur-based method to enhance robustness performance.

Ever since the cyber-attacks have been proposed, the resilient control problem for multiagent systems has been intensively explored in light of the communication network growth. However, most of the consequences only focused on denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or deception attacks independently. Distinguished from the existing resilient control mechanisms, the current investigation represents the first attempt at designing an adaptive resilient controller for multiagent systems according to the sampled-based adaptive event-triggered manner, where denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and deception attacks are both considered. First, the hybrid cyber-attacks model and its impact on the closed-loop system are addressed. And then, an adaptive event-triggered strategy is proposed to reduce network resource consumption and ease the communication burden, where the designed adaptive law can automatically adjust the triggering threshold. Finally, the consensus state of multiagent systems is capable of achieving via a series of reasonable control rules formulated through Lyapunov functional approach despite suffering hybrid cyber-attacks.

Our approach divides the neural network into two real-valued systems and then combines the framework of the Lyapunov method to give criteria for FDTS. Applying synchronization to image protection, the image will be encrypted with a drive system sequence and decrypted with a response system sequence. The quality of image encryption and decryption depends on the synchronization error. Meanwhile, the depth image of the object is encrypted and then the 3D point cloud is reconstructed based on the decrypted depth image. This means that the 3D point cloud information is protected.

In this paper, we propose a new defense method to improve the adversarial robustness of DNNs based on stochastic neural networks (SNNs), termed as Margin-SNN. The proposed Margin-SNN mainly includes two modules, i.e., feature uncertainty learning module and label embedding module. The first module introduces uncertainty to the latent feature space by giving each sample a distributional representation rather than a fixed point representation, and leverages the advantages of variational information bottleneck method in achieving good intra-class compactness in latent space. The second module develops a label embedding mechanism to take advantage of the semantic information underlying the labels, which maps the labels into the same latent space with the features, in order to capture the similarity between sample and its class centroid , where a penalty term is equipped to elegantly enlarge the margin between different classes for better inter-class separability. Since no adversarial information is introduced, the proposed model can be learned in standard training to improve adversarial robustness, which is much more efficient than adversarial training . Extensive experiments on data sets MNIST, FASHION MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN demonstrate superior defensive ability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Dynamic graph embedding has emerged as a very effective technique for addressing diverse temporal graph analytic tasks (i.e., link prediction, node classification , recommender systems , anomaly detection , and graph generation) in various applications. Such temporal graphs exhibit heterogeneous transient dynamics, varying time intervals , and highly evolving node features throughout their evolution. Hence, incorporating long-range dependencies from the historical graph context plays a crucial role in accurately learning their temporal dynamics. In this paper, we develop a graph embedding model with uncertainty quantification , TransformerG2G, by exploiting the advanced transformer encoder to first learn intermediate node representations from its current state ( t t ) and previous context (over timestamps [ t − 1 , t − l t−1,t−l ], l l is the length of context). Moreover, we employ two projection layers to generate lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions as each node’s latent embedding at timestamp t t . We consider diverse benchmarks with varying levels of “novelty” as measured by the TEA (Temporal Edge Appearance) plots. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed TransformerG2G model outperforms conventional multi-step methods and our prior work (DynG2G) in terms of both link prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for high degree of novelty. Furthermore, the learned time-dependent attention weights across multiple graph snapshots reveal the development of an automatic adaptive time stepping enabled by the transformer. Importantly, by examining the attention weights, we can uncover temporal dependencies, identify influential elements, and gain insights into the complex interactions within the graph structure. For example, we identified a strong correlation between attention weights and node degree at the various stages of the graph topology evolution.},

However, existing models often prioritize model accuracy over stability and rationality. The increasingly complicated model structure may lead to an imbalance between the data and the model, resulting in issues such as overfitting and reduced model applicability and interpretability . In this context, this study proposes a novel modeling framework to predict the rutting performance of asphalt mixture by utilizing autoencoder for feature selection and feedforward neural network for rut depth prediction. Notably, physics information of the selected variables is implemented into the neural network to achieve the appropriate balance of model accuracy, stability, and rationality. The results demonstrate that while maintaining high model accuracy, the implementation of physics information significantly enhances the model’s stability and rationality.

  abstract     = {Most of the existing object detection algorithms are trained on medical datasets and then used for prediction. When the features of an object are not obvious in an image, these models are prone to mislocalize and misclassify it. In this paper, we propose a medical Object Detection algorithm jointly driven by Knowledge and Data (ODKD). It enables medical semantic knowledge provided by specialized physicians to be effective and helpful when traditional models have difficulty in correctly detecting objects relying on features alone. Our model consists of a base object detector together with a fusion module: the base object detector is trained based on medical datasets to obtain data-driven results; then we use a graph to represent external semantic knowledge and map the data-driven results to the nodes embedding of this graph structure. In the fusion module, a graph convolution network is used to fuse the data-driven results with the external semantic knowledge to output category adjustment coefficients. Finally, the adjustment coefficients are used to adjust the data-driven results to obtain results jointly driven by knowledge and data. Experiments show that professional medical semantic knowledge can effectively correct the erroneous results of the base detector, and the effect of our model outperforms Faster Rcnn, YOLOv5 , YOLOv7, etc. on three medical datasets, Camus, Synapse , and AMOS.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization between neural networks (NNs) has been intensively investigated to analyze stability, convergence properties , neuronal behaviors and response to various inputs. However, synchronization techniques of NNs with gated recurrent units (GRUs) have not been provided until now due to their complicated nonlinearity . In this paper, we address the sampled-data synchronization problems of GRUs for the first time, and propose controller design methods using discretely sampled control inputs to synchronize master and slave GRUs. The master and slave GRUs are mathematically modeled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system in which the parameter of the slave GRUs is constructed independently of the master GRUs. This distinctive modeling feature provides flexibility to extend the existing master and slave NNs into a more general structure. Indeed, the sampled-data synchronization can be achieved by formulating the design condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The novel sampled-data synchronization criteria are devised by combining the H ∞ H∞ controller design with the looped-functional approach. The synthesized synchronization controllers guarantee not only asymptotic stability of the synchronization error system with aperiodic sampling, but also provides a satisfactory H ∞ H∞ control performance. Moreover, the communication efficiency is improved by using the proposed method in which the sampled-data synchronization controller is combined with the event-triggered mechanism. Finally, the numerical example validates the proposed theoretical contributions via simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies in affective computing often use a fixed emotional label to train an emotion classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) from individuals experiencing an affective stimulus. However, EEGs encode emotional dynamics that include varying intensities within a given emotional category. To investigate these variations in emotional intensity, we propose a framework that obtains momentary affective labels for fine-grained segments of EEGs with human feedback. We then model these labeled segments using a novel spatiotemporal emotional intensity regression network (STEIR-Net). It integrates temporal EEG patterns from nine predefined cortical regions to provide a continuous estimation of emotional intensity. We demonstrate that the STEIR-Net outperforms classical regression models by reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by an average of 4∼9 % and 2∼4 % for the SEED and SEED-IV databases, respectively. We find that the frontal and temporal cortical regions contribute significantly to the affective intensity&#39;s variation. Higher absolute values of the Spearman correlation coefficient between the model estimation and momentary affective labels under happiness (0.2114) and fear (0.2072) compared to neutral (0.1694) and sad (0.1895) emotions were observed. Besides, increasing the input length of the EEG segments from 4 to 20 s further reduces the RMSE from 1.3548 to 1.3188.},

  abstract     = {The SSVEP-based paradigm serves as a prevalent approach in the realm of brain–computer interface (BCI). However, the processing of multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data introduces challenges due to its non-Euclidean characteristic, necessitating methodologies that account for inter-channel topological relations. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Decomposition Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DDGCNN) designed for the classification of SSVEP EEG signals. Our approach incorporates layerwise dynamic graphs to address the oversmoothing issue in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), employing a dense connection mechanism to mitigate the gradient vanishing problem. Furthermore, we enhance the traditional linear transformation inherent in GCNs with graph dynamic fusion, thereby elevating feature extraction and adaptive aggregation capabilities . Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach in learning and extracting features from EEG topological structure . The results shown that DDGCNN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms reported on two datasets (Dataset 1: 54 subjects, 4 targets, 2 sessions; Dataset 2: 35 subjects, 40 targets). Additionally, we showcase the implementation of DDGCNN in the context of synchronized BCI robotic fish control. This work represents a significant advancement in the field of EEG signal processing for SSVEP-based BCIs. Our proposed method processes SSVEP time domain signals directly as an end-to-end system, making it easy to deploy. The code is available at https://github.com/zshubin/DDGCNN .},

  abstract     = {Despite the widespread success of deep learning in various applications, neural network theory has been lagging behind. The choice of the activation function plays a critical role in the expressivity of a neural network but for reasons that are not yet fully understood. While the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is currently one of the most popular activation functions, ReLU squared has only recently been empirically shown to be pivotal in producing consistently superior results for state-of-the-art deep learning tasks (So et al., 2021). To analyze the expressivity of neural networks with ReLU powers, we employ the novel framework of Gribonval et al. (2022) based on the classical concept of approximation spaces. We consider the class of functions for which the approximation error decays at a sufficiently fast rate as network complexity , measured by the number of weights, increases. We show that when approximating sufficiently smooth functions that cannot be represented by sufficiently low-degree polynomials, networks with ReLU powers need less depth than those with ReLU. Moreover, if they have the same depth, networks with ReLU powers can have potentially faster approximation rates . Lastly, our computational experiments on approximating the Rastrigin and Ackley functions with deep neural networks showed that ReLU squared and ReLU cubed networks consistently outperform ReLU networks.},

With the Hessian matrix , we provide an analytic explanation of why modular structures in a sparse DNN can better maintain performance, especially at an extreme high pruning ratio. In CRESPR, each modular unit contains mostly internal connections, which clearly shows how subgroups of input features are processed through a DNN and eventually contribute to classification decisions. Such process-level revealing of internal working mechanisms undoubtedly leads to better interpretability of a black-box DNN model. Extensive experiments were conducted with multiple DNN architectures and datasets, and CRESPR achieves higher pruning performance than current state-of-the-art methods at high and extremely high pruning ratios.

  abstract     = {Online monitoring of social networks offers exciting features for platforms, enabling both technical and behavioral analysis. Numerous studies have explored the adaptation of traditional quality control methods for detecting change points within social networks. However, the current research studies face limitations such as an overreliance on case-based attributes, high computational costs, poor scalability with large networks, and low sensitivity in fast change point detection. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for social network monitoring using One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVMs) to address these limitations. Additionally, using both nodal and network-level attributes makes it versatile for diverse social network applications and effectively detecting network disturbances. The algorithm utilizes a well-defined training data dictionary with an updating procedure for evolutionary networks, enhancing memory and time efficiency by reducing the processing of input data . Extensive numerical experiments are conducted using an EpiCNet model to simulate interactions in an online social network , covering six change scenarios to evaluate the proposed methodology. The results show lower Average Run Length (ARL) and Expected Delay Detection (EDD), demonstrating the superior accuracy and effectiveness of the OC-SVM algorithm compared to alternative methods. Applying OC-SVM to the Enron Email network indicates its capability to identify change points, reflecting the tumultuous timeline that led to Enron&#39;s downfall. This further validates the substantial advancement of OC-SVM in social network monitoring and opens doors to broader real-world applications.},

The CG-MLP marked the width-axis, height-axis, and channel-axis, which can result in a better segmentation effect while reducing computational complexity . SiAM improves global semantic information exchange by increasing the connections between different channels, while PiAM changes the extraction of local key information features by enhancing information exchange at the pixel level . CFM fuses low-level positional information and high-level channel information of the target through coding to improve network stability and target feature utilization.

MHRL is composed of three modules, i.e., destination evaluation, policy switch, and motion network, which are designed exactly according to the three phases of solving the original navigation problem . First, the destination evaluation module rates all destinations and selects the one with the lowest cost. Subsequently, the policy switch module decides which motion network to be used according to the selected destination and the obstacle state. Finally, the selected motion network outputs the robot action. Owing to the complementary strengths of a variety of motion networks and the cooperation of modules in each layer, MHRL is able to deal with hybrid crowds effectively.

Although many deep learning methods have recently been developed for modeling DNA sequences, they still suffer from two major issues: 1) most existing methods can handle only short DNA fragments and fail to capture long-range information; 2) current methods always require massive supervised labels, which are hard to obtain in practice. We propose a new method to address both issues. Our neural network employs circular dilated convolutions as building blocks in the backbone. As a result, our network can take long DNA sequences as input without any condensation. We also incorporate the neural network into a self-supervised learning framework to capture inherent information in DNA without expensive supervised labeling. We have tested our model in two DNA inference tasks, the human variant effect and the open chromatin region of plants, where the experimental results show that our method outperforms five other deep learning models .

This paper develops a new monotonic neural network named Deep Isotonic Embedding Network (DIEN), which uses different modules to deal with monotonic and non-monotonic features respectively, and then combine outputs of these modules linearly to obtain the prediction result. A new embedding tool called Isotonic Embedding Unit is developed to process monotonic features and turn each one into an isotonic embedding vector. By converting non-monotonic features into a series of non-negative weight vectors and then combining them with isotonic embedding vectors that have special properties , we enable DIEN to guarantee monotonicity. Besides, we also introduce a module named Monotonic Feature Learning Network to capture complex dependencies between monotonic features. This module is a monotonic feedforward neural network with non-negative weights and can handle scenarios where there are few non-monotonic features or only monotonic features. In comparison to existing methods, DIEN does not require intricate structures like lattices or the use of additional verification techniques to ensure monotonicity. Additionally, the relationship between DIEN’s inputs and outputs is obvious and intuitive. Results from experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate DIEN’s superiority over existing methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Perception or imagination requires top-down signals from high-level cortex to primary visual cortex (V1) to reconstruct or simulate the representations bottom-up stimulated by the seen images. Interestingly, top-down signals in V1 have lower spatial resolution than bottom-up representations. It is unclear why the brain uses low-resolution signals to reconstruct or simulate high-resolution representations. By modeling the top-down pathway of the visual system using the decoder of a variational auto-encoder (VAE), we reveal that low-resolution top-down signals can better reconstruct or simulate the information contained in the sparse activities of V1 simple cells, which facilitates perception and imagination. This advantage of low-resolution generation is related to facilitating high-level cortex to form geometry-respecting representations observed in experiments. Furthermore, we present two findings regarding this phenomenon in the context of AI-generated sketches, a style of drawings made of lines. First, we found that the quality of the generated sketches critically depends on the thickness of the lines in the sketches: thin-line sketches are harder to generate than thick-line sketches. Second, we propose a technique to generate high-quality thin-line sketches: instead of directly using original thin-line sketches, we use blurred sketches to train VAE or GAN (generative adversarial network), and then infer the thin-line sketches from the VAE- or GAN-generated blurred sketches.

  abstract     = {Image restoration aims to reconstruct a latent high-quality image from a degraded observation. Recently, the usage of Transformer has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art performance of various image restoration tasks due to its powerful ability to model long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention hinders practical applications. Moreover, sufficiently leveraging the huge spectral disparity between clean and degraded image pairs can also be conducive to image restoration. In this paper, we develop a dual-domain strip attention mechanism for image restoration by enhancing representation learning , which consists of spatial and frequency strip attention units. Specifically, the spatial strip attention unit harvests the contextual information for each pixel from its adjacent locations in the same row or column under the guidance of the learned weights via a simple convolutional branch. In addition, the frequency strip attention unit refines features in the spectral domain via frequency separation and modulation, which is implemented by simple pooling techniques. Furthermore, we apply different strip sizes for enhancing multi-scale learning, which is beneficial for handling degradations of various sizes. By employing the dual-domain attention units in different directions, each pixel can implicitly perceive information from an expanded region. Taken together, the proposed dual-domain strip attention network (DSANet) achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 different datasets for four image restoration tasks, including image dehazing , image desnowing, image denoising , and image defocus deblurring.

  abstract     = {Transformer-based models, exemplified by GPT-3, ChatGPT , and GPT-4, have recently garnered considerable attention in both academia and industry due to their promising performance in general language tasks. Nevertheless, these models typically involve computationally encoding processes, and in some cases, decoding processes as well, both of which are fundamentally large-scale matrix multiplication. These operations bring the inevitable challenges of massive computation resources and huge memory footprint , usually requiring at least 1 0 23 1023 FLOPs and hundreds of gigabytes, respectively. A common method to address this issue is to reduce the computational and memory requirements by applying layerwise quantization to the transformer, replacing the usual fp32 data type with a low-bit equivalent. Unfortunately, this method often leads to decreased model accuracy and necessitates time-consuming retraining. Such retraining not only requires fine-tuning skills but also substantial computational resources , posing challenges for users. To specifically tackle these issues, we propose BCT , a framework of blockwise compression for transformers without retraining, aiming to facilitate model deployment . Unlike layerwise compression methods , BCT achieves finer compression of the entire transformer by operating blockwise. This method mitigates data distribution deviation caused by quantization, eliminating the requirement for retraining. BCT effectively compresses all components of the model, including but not limited to the embedding, matrix multiplication, GELU , Softmax, layer normalization, and intermediate results. In a case study , an efficient model is compressed by BCT achieving up to 7.988x compression. Subsequently, we also evaluate it on several General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) datasets. Experimental results on the majority of GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, as BCT achieves less than a 0.9% degradation in accuracy compared to the more than a 1% degradation seen with other methods providing similar or inferior compression ratios.},

However, most of existing methods for SOD neglects the critical complementarity between multiple modalities images, which is beneficial to further improve the detection accuracy. Therefore, this work introduces the MSEDNet RGB-T SOD method. We utilize an encoder to extract multi-level modalities features from both visible light images and thermal infrared images, which are subsequently categorized into high, medium, and low level. Additionally, we propose three separate feature fusion modules to comprehensively extract complementary information between different modalities during the fusion process. These modules are applied to specific feature levels: the Edge Dilation Sharpening module for low-level features, the Spatial and Channel-Aware module for mid-level features, and the Cross-Residual Fusion module for high-level features. Finally, we introduce an edge fusion loss function for supervised learning, which effectively extracts edge information from different modalities and suppresses background noise. Comparative demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MSEDNet over other state-of-the-art methods. The code and results can be found at the following link: https://github.com/Zhou-wy/MSEDNet .},

In this paper, we further enhance this attack to enable efficient data reconstruction while maintaining acceptable performance on the main task. Another significant advantage of our attack framework lies in its ability to fool the state-of-the-art attack detection mechanism, thus minimizing the risk of attacker exposure and making sustainable attacks possible. Moreover, we adaptively refine and adjust the attack strategy, extending the data reconstruction attack for the first time to the more challenging scenario of vertically partitioned data in split learning. In addition, we introduce three training modes for the attack framework, allowing the attacker to choose according to their requirements freely. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and evaluate the attack performance of attack frameworks in different scenarios, parameter settings, and defense mechanisms. The results demonstrate our attack framework’s effectiveness, invisibility, and generality.

  abstract     = {Deep generative models have advantages in modeling complex time series and are widely used in anomaly detection . Nevertheless, the existing deep generative approaches mainly concentrate on the investigation of models’ reconstruction capability rather than customizing a model suitable for anomaly detection . Meanwhile, VAE-based models suffer from posterior collapse, which can lead to a series of undesirable consequences, such as high false positive rate etc. Based on these considerations, in this paper, we propose a novel self-adversarial variational auto-encoder combined with contrast learning, short for ACVAE, to address these challenges. ACVAE consist of three parts 〈 T , E , G 〉 〈T,E,G〉 , wherein the transformation network T T is employed to generate abnormal latent representations similar to those normal latent representations encoded by the encoder E E , and the decoder G G is used to distinguish the two representations. In the framework of this model, the normal reconstructions are considered as positive samples and abnormal reconstructions as negative samples, and the contrast learning is executed on the part E E to measure the similarities between inputs and positive samples, dissimilarities between inputs and negative samples. Thus, an improved objective function is proposed by integrating two novel regularizers, one refers to adversarial mechanism and the other involves contrast learning, in which the encoder E E and decoder G G hold the capability to distinguish, and decoder G G is constrained to mitigate the posterior collapse. We perform several experiments on five datasets, whose results show ACVAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Some previous works adopted loss re-weighting, sample re-weighting, or data-dependent regularization to mitigate the influence of these training biases. But these methods usually pay more attention to class imbalance problem when both the class imbalance and label noise exist in training set simultaneously. These methods may overfit noisy labels, which leads to a great degradation in performance. In this paper, we propose a gradient-aware learning method for the combination of the two biases. During the training process, we update only a part of crucial parameters regularly and rectify the update direction of the rest redundant parameters. This update rule is conducted both in the encoder and classifier of the deep network to decouple label noise and class imbalance implicitly. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic and real-world data biases.},

However, there are still many challenges in representation learning of heterogeneous networks . Existing graph neural network models are partly based on homogeneous graphs, which do not take into account the rich semantic information of nodes and edges due to their different types; And partly based on heterogeneous graphs, which require predefined meta-structures (include meta-paths and meta-graphs) and do not take into account the different effects of different meta-structures on node representation. In this paper, we propose the MS-GAN model, which consists of four parts: graph structure learner, graph structure expander, graph structure filter and graph structure parser. The graph structure learner automatically generates a graph structure consisting of useful meta-paths by selecting and combining the sub-adjacent matrices in the original graph using a 1 × 1 convolution . The graph structure expander further generates a graph structure containing meta-graphs by Hadamard product based on the previous step. The graph structure filterer filters out graph structures that are more effective for downstream classification tasks based on diversity. The graph structure parser assigns different weights to graph structures consisting of different meta-structures by a semantic hierarchical attention. Finally, through experiments on four datasets and meta-structure visualization analysis, it is shown that MS-GAN can automatically generate useful meta-structures and assign different weights to different meta-structures.},

  abstract     = {The 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) robotic grasping is a fundamental task in robot manipulation, aimed at detecting graspable points and corresponding parameters in a 3D space, i.e affordance learning, and then a robot executes grasp actions with the detected affordances. Existing research works on affordance learning predominantly focus on learning local features directly for each grid in a voxel scene or each point in a point cloud scene, subsequently filtering the most promising candidate for execution. Contrarily, cognitive models of grasping highlight the significance of global descriptors, such as size, shape, and orientation, in grasping. These global descriptors indicate a grasp path closely tied to actions. Inspired by this, we propose a novel bio-inspired neural network that explicitly incorporates global feature encoding. In particular, our method utilizes a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) as input, and employs the recently proposed Transformer model to encode the global features of a scene directly. With the effective global representation, we then use deconvolution modules to decode multiple local features to generate graspable candidates. In addition, to integrate global and local features, we propose using a skip-connection module to merge lower-layer global features with higher-layer local features. Our approach, when tested on a recently proposed pile and packed grasping dataset for a decluttering task, surpassed state-of-the-art local feature learning methods by approximately 5% in terms of success and declutter rates. We also evaluated its running time and generalization ability , further demonstrating its superiority. We deployed our model on a Franka Panda robot arm, with real-world results aligning well with simulation data. This underscores our approach’s effectiveness for generalization and real-world applications.},

Existing domain generalization methods concern all visual features, including irrelevant ones with the same priority, which easily results in poor generalization performance of the trained model. In contrast, human beings have strong generalization capabilities to distinguish images from different domains by focusing on important features while suppressing irrelevant features with respect to labels. Motivated by this observation, we propose a channel-wise and spatial-wise hybrid domain attention mechanism to force the model to focus on more important features associated with labels in this work. In addition, models with higher robustness with respect to small perturbations of inputs are expected to have higher generalization capability, which is preferable in domain generalization. Therefore, we propose to reduce the localized maximum sensitivity of the small perturbations of inputs in order to improve the network’s robustness and generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS, and Office-Home datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To address this issue, we adopt a novel strategy by injecting both fake nodes and links to attack dynamic graphs. Based on that, we present the first study on attacking dynamic graphs via adversarial topology perturbations in a restricted black-box setting, in which downstream graph learning tasks are unknown. Specifically, we first divide dynamic graph structure perturbations into three sub-tasks and transform them as a sequential decision making process. Then, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning based black-box attack (HRBBA) framework to model three sub-tasks as attack policies. In addition, an imperceptible perturbation constraint to guarantee the concealment of attacks is incorporated into HRBBA. Finally, HRBBA is optimized based on the actor-critic process. Extensive experiments on four real-world dynamic graphs show that the performance of diverse dynamic graph learning methods (victim methods) on tasks like link prediction, node classification and network clustering can be substantially degraded under HRBBA attack.},

  abstract     = {When handling real-world data modeled by a complex network dynamical system , the number of the parameters is often much more than the size of the data. Therefore, in many cases, it is impossible to estimate these parameters and the exact value of each parameter is frequently less interesting than the distribution of the parameters. In this paper, we aim to estimate the distribution of the parameters in the mesoscopic neuronal network model from the macroscopic experimental data , for example, the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal. Herein, we assume that the parameters of the neurons and synapses are inhomogeneous but independently and identically distributed from certain distributions with unknown hyperparameters. Thus, we estimate these hyperparameters of the distributions of the parameters, instead of estimating the parameters themselves. We formulate this problem under the framework of data assimilation and hierarchical Bayesian method and present an efficient method named Hierarchical Data Assimilation (HDA) to conduct the statistical inference on the neuronal network model with the BOLD signal data simulated by the hemodynamic model. We consider the Leaky Integral-Fire (LIF) neuronal networks with four synapses and show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the BOLD signals and the hyperparameters with high preciseness. In addition, we discuss the influence on the performance of the algorithm configuration and the LIF network model setup.},

  abstract     = {To explore the rich information contained in multi-modal data and take into account efficiency, deep cross-modal hash retrieval (DCMHR) is a wise solution. But currently, most DCMHR methods have two key limitations, one is that the recommended classification of DCMHR models is conditioned only on the objects in different regions, respectively. Another flaw is that these methods either do not learn the unified hash codes in training or cannot design an efficient training process. To solve these two problems, this paper designs Large-Scale Cross-Modal Hashing with Unified Learning and Multi-Object Regional Correlation Reasoning (HUMOR). For the proposed related labels classified by ImgNet, HUMOR uses Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to reason the correlation of these labels. When regional correlation reasoning is low, these labels will be through “reduce-add” to rectification from max-to-min (global precedence) or min-to-max (regional precedence). Then, HUMOR conducts unified learning on hash loss and classification loss, adopts the four-step iterative algorithm to optimize the unified hash codes, and reduces bias in the model. Experiments on two baseline datasets show that the average performance of this method is higher than most of the DCMHR methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and innovation of our method.},

The transformer framework captures global feature dependencies and is customized for different task types, thereby improving the performance of sequential tasks. The competition and cooperation mechanisms enable the network to obtain additional supervisory information at different training stages. Specifically, the competition mechanism is implemented early in training to achieve iterative optimization of 6 DOF poses (rotation and translation information from the target image to the two reference images), the depth of target image, and optical flow (from the target image to the two reference images) estimation in a competitive manner. In contrast, the cooperation mechanism is implemented later in training to facilitate the transmission of results among the three networks and mutually optimize the estimation results. We conducted experiments on the KITTI dataset, and the results indicate that PDF-Former has significant potential to enhance the accuracy and robustness of sequential tasks in robot navigation.},

Numerous existing studies utilize inter-embedded fusion routes to extract the intrinsic patterns of traffic flow with a single temporal learning approach , which relies heavily on constructing graphs and has low training efficiency. Different from existing studies, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal ensemble network that aims to leverage the strengths of different sequential capturing approaches to obtain the intrinsic dependencies of traffic flow. Specifically, we propose a novel model named graph temporal convolutional long short-term memory network (GT-LSTM), which mainly consists of features splicing and patterns capturing. In features splicing, the spatial dependencies of traffic flow are captured by employing self-adaptive graph convolutional network (GCN), and a non-inter-embedded approach is designed to integrate the spatial and temporal states . Further, the aggregated spatio-temporal states are fed into patterns capturing, which can effectively exploit the advantages of temporal convolutional network (TCN) and bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) to extract the intrinsic patterns of traffic flow. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed network obtains excellent performance in both forecasting accuracy and training efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represent significant health challenges in an aging population. As the search for noninvasive, precise and accessible diagnostic methods continues, the efficacy of electroencephalography (EEG) combined with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in varied clinical settings remains unverified, particularly for pathologies underlying MCI such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Addressing this gap, our study evaluates the generalizability of a DCNN trained on EEG data from a single hospital (Hospital #1). For data from Hospital #1, the DCNN achieved a balanced accuracy (bACC) of 0.927 in classifying individuals as healthy ( n = 69) or as having AD, DLB, or iNPH ( n = 188). The model demonstrated robustness across institutions, maintaining bACCs of 0.805 for data from Hospital #2 ( n = 73) and 0.920 at Hospital #3 ( n = 139). Additionally, the model could differentiate AD, DLB, and iNPH cases with bACCs of 0.572 for data from Hospital #1 ( n = 188), 0.619 for Hospital #2 ( n = 70), and 0.508 for Hospital #3 ( n = 139). Notably, it also identified MCI pathologies with a bACC of 0.715 for Hospital #1 ( n = 83), despite being trained on overt dementia cases instead of MCI cases. These outcomes confirm the DCNN&#39;s adaptability and scalability, representing a significant stride toward its clinical application. Additionally, our findings suggest a potential for identifying shared EEG signatures between MCI and dementia, contributing to the field&#39;s understanding of their common pathophysiological mechanisms.},

However, one of the main challenges any scientist has to face using deep learning models is to establish the network’s architecture. Due to this difficulty, data scientists usually build over complex models and, as a result, most of them result computationally intensive and impose a large memory footprint , generating huge costs, contributing to climate change and hindering their use in computational-limited devices. In this paper, we propose a novel dense feed-forward neural network constructing method based on pruning and transfer learning . Its performance has been thoroughly assessed in classification and regression problems . Without any accuracy loss, our approach can compress the number of parameters by more than 70%. Even further, choosing the pruning parameter carefully, most of the refined models outperform original ones. Furthermore, we have verified that our method not only identifies a better network architecture but also facilitates knowledge transfer between the original and refined models. The results obtained show that our constructing method not only helps in the design of more efficient models but also more effective ones.},

  abstract     = {Loss function is a critical component of machine learning . Some robust loss functions are proposed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by noise. However, they still face many challenges. Firstly, there is currently a lack of unified frameworks for building robust loss functions in machine learning. Secondly, most of them only care about the occurring noise and pay little attention to those normal points. Thirdly, the resulting performance gain is limited. To this end, we put forward a general framework of robust loss functions for machine learning (RML) with rigorous theoretical analyses, which can smoothly and adaptively flatten any unbounded loss function and apply to various machine learning problems. In RML, an unbounded loss function serves as the target, with the aim of being flattened. A scale parameter is utilized to limit the maximum value of noise points, while a shape parameter is introduced to control both the compactness and the growth rate of the flattened loss function. Later, this framework is employed to flatten the Hinge loss function and the Square loss function. Based on this, we build two robust kernel classifiers called FHSVM and FLSSVM, which can distinguish different types of data. The stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) approach is used to optimize FHSVM and FLSSVM. Extensive experiments demonstrate their superiority, with both consistently occupying the top two positions among all evaluated methods, achieving an average accuracy of 81.07% (accompanied by an F-score of 73.25%) for FHSVM and 81.54% (with an F-score of 75.71%) for FLSSVM.},

Unlabeled source data is trained jointly with labeled one to significantly improve the performance. Nevertheless, different research adopts different settings, leading to unfair comparisons. Moreover, the initial annotation of unlabeled source data is random, causing unstable and unreliable training. To this end, we first specify the training paradigm, and then leverage active learning (AL) to handle the issues. We further develop a new task called Active Semi-supervised Domain Generalization (ASSDG), which consists of two parts, i.e., SSDG and AL. We delve deep into the commonalities of SSL and AL and propose a unified framework called Gradient-Similarity-based Sample Filtering and Sorting (GSSFS) to iteratively train the SSDG and AL parts. Gradient similarity is utilized to select reliable and informative unlabeled source samples for these two parts respectively.

However, previous research has mostly examined power in different frequency bands. The practical objective of this study was to comprehensively test whether other types of time-series analysis methods are better suited to characterize brain activity related to meditation. To achieve this, we compared &gt;7000 time-series features of the EEG signal to comprehensively characterize brain activity differences in meditators, using many measures that are novel in meditation research. Eyes-closed resting-state EEG data from 49 meditators and 46 non-meditators was decomposed into the top eight principal components (PCs). We extracted 7381 time-series features from each PC and each participant and used them to train classification algorithms to identify meditators. Highly differentiating individual features from successful classifiers were analysed in detail. Only the third PC (which had a central-parietal maximum) showed above-chance classification accuracy (67 %, p FDR = 0.007), for which 405 features significantly distinguished meditators (all p FDR  0.05). Our novel analysis approach suggests the key signatures of meditators’ brain activity are higher temporal stability and a distribution of time-series values suggestive of longer, larger, or more frequent non-outlying voltage deviations from the mean within the third PC of their EEG data. The higher temporal stability observed in this EEG component might underpin the higher attentional stability associated with meditation. The novel time-series properties identified here have considerable potential for future exploration in meditation research and the analysis of neural dynamics more broadly.},

  abstract     = {Nuclei detection is one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in histopathological image analysis, which can localize nuclei to provide effective computer-aided cancer diagnosis, treatment decision, and prognosis. The fully-supervised nuclei detector requires a large number of nuclei annotations on high-resolution digital images, which is time-consuming and needs human annotators with professional knowledge. In recent years, weakly-supervised learning has attracted significant attention in reducing the labeling burden. However, detecting dense nuclei of complex crowded distribution and diverse appearances remains a challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a novel point-supervised dense nuclei detection framework that introduces position-based anchor optimization to complete morphology-based pseudo-label supervision. Specifically, we first generate cellular-level pseudo labels (CPL) for the detection head via a morphology-based mechanism, which can help to build a baseline point-supervised detection network. Then, considering the crowded distribution of the dense nuclei, we propose a mechanism called Position-based Anchor-quality Estimation (PAE), which utilizes the positional deviation between an anchor and its corresponding point label to suppress low-quality detections far from each nucleus. Finally, to better handle the diverse appearances of nuclei, an Adaptive Anchor Selector (AAS) operation is proposed to automatically select positive and negative anchors according to morphological and positional statistical characteristics of nuclei. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, MO and Lizard, using ResNet50 and PVTv2 as backbones. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior capacity compared with other state-of-the-art methods. In particularly, in dense nuclei scenarios, our method can achieve 95.1% performance of the fully-supervised approach. The code is available at https://github.com/NucleiDet/DenseNucleiDet .},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in adversarial attacks on images, while adversarial video attacks have seldom been explored. In this paper, we propose a sparse adversarial attack strategy on videos (DeepSAVA). Our model aims to add a small human-imperceptible perturbation to the key frame of the input video to fool the classifiers . To carry out an effective attack that mirrors real-world scenarios, our algorithm integrates spatial transformation perturbations into the frame. Instead of using the l p lp norm to gauge the disparity between the perturbed frame and the original frame, we employ the structural similarity index (SSIM), which has been established as a more suitable metric for quantifying image alterations resulting from spatial perturbations. We employ a unified optimisation framework to combine spatial transformation with additive perturbation, thereby attaining a more potent attack. We design an effective and novel optimisation scheme that alternatively utilises Bayesian Optimisation (BO) to identify the most critical frame in a video and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimisation to produce both additive and spatial-transformed perturbations. Doing so enables DeepSAVA to perform a very sparse attack on videos for maintaining human imperceptibility while still achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of both attack success rate and adversarial transferability. Furthermore, built upon the strong perturbations produced by DeepSAVA, we design a novel adversarial training framework to improve the robustness of video classification models . Our intensive experiments on various types of deep neural networks and video datasets confirm the superiority of DeepSAVA in terms of attacking performance and efficiency. When compared to the baseline techniques, DeepSAVA exhibits the highest level of performance in generating adversarial videos for three distinct video classifiers. Remarkably, it achieves an impressive fooling rate ranging from 99.5% to 100% for the I3D model, with the perturbation of just a single frame. Additionally, DeepSAVA demonstrates favourable transferability across various time series models . The proposed adversarial training strategy is also empirically demonstrated with better performance on training robust video classifiers compared with the state-of-the-art adversarial training with projected gradient descent (PGD) adversary.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering has attracted growing attention owing to its powerful capacity of multi-source information integration . Although numerous advanced methods have been proposed in past decades , most of them generally fail to distinguish the unequal importance of multiple views to the clustering task and overlook the scale uniformity of learned latent representation among different views, resulting in blurry physical meaning and suboptimal model performance. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a joint learning framework, termed Adaptive-weighted deep Multi-view Clustering with Uniform scale representation (AMCU). Specifically, to achieve more reasonable multi-view fusion, we introduce an adaptive weighting strategy, which imposes simplex constraints on heterogeneous views for measuring their varying degrees of contribution to consensus prediction. Such a simple yet effective strategy shows its clear physical meaning for the multi-view clustering task. Furthermore, a novel regularizer is incorporated to learn multiple latent representations sharing approximately the same scale, so that the objective for calculating clustering loss cannot be sensitive to the views and thus the entire model training process can be guaranteed to be more stable as well. Through comprehensive experiments on eight popular real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposal performs better than several state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view competitors.},

  abstract     = {Network pruning has attracted increasing attention recently for its capability of transferring large-scale neural networks (e.g., CNNs) into resource-constrained devices. Such a transfer is typically achieved by removing redundant network parameters while retaining its generalization performance in a static or dynamic manner. Concretely, static pruning usually maintains a larger and fit-to-all (samples) compressed network by removing the same channels for all samples, which cannot maximally excavate redundancy in the given network. In contrast, dynamic pruning can adaptively remove (more) different channels for different samples and obtain state-of-the-art performance along with a higher compression ratio. However, since the system has to preserve the complete network information for sample-specific pruning, the dynamic pruning methods are usually not memory-efficient. In this paper, our interest is to explore a static alternative, dubbed GlobalPru , from a different perspective by respecting the differences among data. Specifically, a novel channel attention-based learn-to-rank framework is proposed to learn a global ranking of channels with respect to network redundancy. In this method, each sample-wise (local) channel attention is forced to reach an agreement on the global ranking among different data. Hence, all samples can empirically share the same ranking of channels and make the pruning statically in practice. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, SVHN, and CIFAR-10/100 demonstrate that the proposed GlobalPru achieves superior performance than state-of-the-art static and dynamic pruning methods by significant margins.},

  abstract     = {Fractional-order differentiation (FOD) can record information from the past, present, and future. Compared with integer-order systems, FOD systems have higher complexity and more accurate ability to describe the real world. In this paper, two types of fractional-order memristors are proposed and one type is proved to have extreme multistability , local activity, and non-volatility. By using memristors to simulate the autapse of a neuron and to describe the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction caused by electromagnetic radiation , we establish a new 5D FOD memristive HNN (FOMHNN). Through dynamic simulation, rich dynamic behaviors are found, such as hyperchaos, multiscroll, extreme multistability, and “overclocking” behavior caused by order reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such rich dynamic behaviors are found in FOMHNN simultaneously. Based on this FOMHNN, a very efficient and secure image encryption scheme is designed. Security analysis shows that the encrypted Lena image has extremely low adjacent pixel correlation and high randomness, with information entropy of 7.9995. Despite discarding diffusion and scrambling, it has excellent plaintext sensitivity, with NCPR = 99.6095% and UACI = 33.4671%. Finally, this paper implements the proposed FOMHNN and image encryption on field programmable gate array (FPGA). To our knowledge, the related work of fully hardware implementation of fractional-order neural networks and image encryption schemes based on this is rare.},

In addition, this paper presents a distributed deep reinforcement learning method based on soft actor–critic algorithm for solving multi-robot formation problem. At the same time, the formation evaluation assignment function is designed to adapt to distributed training. Compared with the original algorithm, the improved algorithm can get higher reward cumulative values. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can better maintain the desired formation in the moving process, and the rotation design in the reward function makes the multi-robot system have better flexibility in formation. The comparison of control signal curve shows that the proposed algorithm is more stable. At the end of the experiments, the universality of the proposed algorithm in formation maintenance and formation variations is demonstrated.},

By choosing a delay-product-type Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L–K) functional with a delay-dependent matrix and exploiting some matrix polynomial inequalities, bounded real lemmas (BRLs) are obtained on the existence of suitable adaptive event generator and filters. These BRLs are dependent not only on the delay bounds but also on the delay variation rate. Simulation results are given to show the validity of the proposed theoretical method.},

Here we propose sequential generative models with partial observation and mechanical constraints in a decentralized manner, which can model agents’ cognition and body dynamics, and predict biologically plausible behaviors. We formulate this as a decentralized multi-agent imitation-learning problem, leveraging binary partial observation and decentralized policy models based on hierarchical variational recurrent neural networks with physical and biomechanical penalties. Using real-world basketball and soccer datasets, we show the effectiveness of our method in terms of the constraint violations, long-term trajectory prediction, and partial observation.

However, large peer-to-peer communication overhead often becomes a practical challenge, especially in harsh environments such as for an underwater sensor network. In this paper, we aim to reduce communication overhead while achieving similar performance as the state-of-the-art algorithms. To achieve this, we use the concept of Minimum Connected Dominating Set from graph theory that is applied in ad hoc wireless networks to address communication overhead issues. Specifically, we propose a new decentralized deep learning algorithm called minimum connected Dominating Set Model Aggregation ( DSMA ). We investigate the efficacy of our method for different communication graph topologies with a small to large number of agents using varied neural network model architectures. Empirical results on benchmark data sets show a significant (up to 100X) reduction in communication time while preserving the accuracy or in some cases, increasing it compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The success of FL hinges on the efficiency of participating models and their ability to handle the unique challenges of distributed learning . While several variants of Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown great potential as alternatives to modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for centralized training, the unprecedented size and higher computational demands hinder their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, challenging their widespread application in FL. Since client devices in FL typically have limited computing resources and communication bandwidth , models intended for such devices must strike a balance between model size, computational efficiency, and the ability to adapt to the diverse and non-IID data distributions encountered in FL. To address these challenges, we propose OnDev-LCT : L ightweight C onvolutional T ransformers for On - Dev ice vision tasks with limited training data and resources. Our models incorporate image-specific inductive biases through the LCT tokenizer by leveraging efficient depthwise separable convolutions in residual linear bottleneck blocks to extract local features , while the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism in the LCT encoder implicitly facilitates capturing global representations of images. Extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets indicate that our models outperform existing lightweight vision models while having fewer parameters and lower computational demands, making them suitable for FL scenarios with data heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks.},

Nevertheless, most previous DCNN-based methods do not fully utilize the complementary strengths between feature maps, channels, and pixels. Therefore, it hinders the ability of DCNNs to represent abundant features. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we present a Cascaded Visual Attention Network for SISR called CVANet, which simulates the visual attention mechanism of the human eyes to focus on the reconstruction process of details. Specifically, we first designed a trainable feature attention module (FAM) for feature-level attention learning. Afterward, we introduce a channel attention module (CAM) to reinforce feature maps under channel-level attention learning. Meanwhile, we propose a pixel attention module (PAM) that adaptively selects representative features from the previous layers, which are utilized to generate a high-resolution image. Satisfactory, our CVANet can effectively improve the resolution of images by exploring the feature representation capabilities of different modules and the visual perception properties of the human eyes. Extensive experiments with different methods on four benchmarks demonstrate that our CVANet outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in subjective visual perception, PSNR, and SSIM.The code will be made available https://github.com/WilyZhao8/CVANet .},

  abstract     = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms based on trust regions (TR) have achieved significant success in numerous cooperative multi-agent tasks. These algorithms restrain the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence (i.e., TR constraint) between the current and new policies to avoid aggressive update steps and improve learning performance. However, the majority of existing TR-based MARL algorithms are on-policy, meaning that they require new data sampled by current policies for training and cannot utilize off-policy (or historical) data, leading to low sample efficiency . This study aims to enhance the data efficiency of TR-based learning methods. To achieve this, an approximation of the original objective function is designed. In addition, it is proven that as long as the update size of the policy (measured by the KL divergence) is restricted, optimizing the designed objective function using historical data can guarantee the monotonic improvement of the original target. Building on the designed objective, a practical off-policy multi-agent stochastic policy gradient algorithm is proposed within the framework of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Additionally, policy entropy is integrated into the reward to promote exploration, and consequently, improve stability. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a representative benchmark for multi-agent MuJoCo (MAMuJoCo), which offers a range of challenging tasks in cooperative continuous multi-agent control. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms all other existing algorithms by a significant margin.},

To achieve learning capability under constraints, transformation mapping is utilized to convert the original system with full-state constraints into a quasi-pure-feedback unconstrained system. Utilizing the system transformation technique, only a single neural network (NN) is required to identify the unknown dynamics within the transformed system . Combining the dynamic surface control design, a novel adaptive neural control scheme is developed to ensure that all closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded, and every system state remains within the predefined constraint range. In addition, the precise convergence of NN weights is further transformed into an exponential stability problem for a category of linear time-varying systems under persistent excitation conditions . Subsequently, the converged NN weights are efficiently stored and utilized to create a learning controller to achieve better control performance while abiding by the full-state constraints.

Modern deep learning tools have achieved great empirical success, but a framework for deep principal component analysis is still lacking. Here we develop a deep kernel PCA methodology (DKPCA) to extract multiple levels of the most informative components of the data. Our scheme can effectively identify new hierarchical variables, called deep principal components , capturing the main characteristics of high-dimensional data through a simple and interpretable numerical optimization . We couple the principal components of multiple KPCA levels, theoretically showing that DKPCA creates both forward and backward dependency across levels, which has not been explored in kernel methods and yet is crucial to extract more informative features. Various experimental evaluations on multiple data types show that DKPCA finds more efficient and disentangled representations with higher explained variance in fewer principal components, compared to the shallow KPCA. We demonstrate that our method allows for effective hierarchical data exploration, with the ability to separate the key generative factors of the input data both for large datasets and when few training samples are available. Overall, DKPCA can facilitate the extraction of useful patterns from high-dimensional data by learning more informative features organized in different levels, giving diversified aspects to explore the variation factors in the data, while maintaining a simple mathematical formulation.},

  abstract     = {Siamese tracking has witnessed tremendous progress in tracking paradigm. However, its default box estimation pipeline still faces a crucial inconsistency issue, namely, the bounding box decided by its classification score is not always best overlapped with the ground truth, thus harming performance. To this end, we explore a novel simple tracking paradigm based on the intersection over union (IoU) value prediction. To first bypass this inconsistency issue, we propose a concise target state predictor termed IoUformer, which instead of default box estimation pipeline directly predicts the IoU values related to tracking performance metrics. In detail, it extends the long-range dependency modeling ability of transformer to jointly grasp target-aware interactions between target template and search region, and search sub-region interactions, thus neatly unifying global semantic interaction and target state prediction. Thanks to this joint strength, IoUformer can predict reliable IoU values near-linear with the ground truth, which paves a safe way for our new IoU-based siamese tracking paradigm. Since it is non-trivial to explore this paradigm with pleased efficacy and portability, we offer the respective network components and two alternative localization ways. Experimental results show that our IoUformer-based tracker achieves promising results with less training data . For its applicability, it still serves as a refinement module to consistently boost existing advanced trackers.},

In this article, we propose a novel unsupervised framework called SVD-AE to conduct anomaly detection in multivariate time series. The core idea is to fuse the strengths of both SVD and autoencoder to fully capture complex normal patterns in multivariate time series. An asymmetric autoencoder architecture is proposed, where two encoders are used to capture features in time and variable dimensions and a shared decoder is used to generate reconstructions based on latent representations from both dimensions. A new regularization based on singular value decomposition theory is designed to force each encoder to learn features in the corresponding axis with mathematical supports delivered. A specific loss component is further proposed to align Fourier coefficients of inputs and reconstructions. It can preserve details of original inputs, leading to enhanced feature learning capability of the model. Extensive experiments on three real world datasets demonstrate the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection tasks under highly unbalanced scenarios compared with baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Image Salient Object Detection (SOD) is a fundamental research topic in the area of computer vision . Recently, the multimodal information in RGB , Depth (D), and Thermal (T) modalities has been proven to be beneficial to the SOD. However, existing methods are only designed for RGB-D or RGB-T SOD, which may limit the utilization in various modalities, or just finetuned on specific datasets, which may bring about extra computation overhead. These defects can hinder the practical deployment of SOD in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end U nified T riplet D ecoder Net work, dubbed UTDNet, for both RGB-T and RGB-D SOD tasks. The intractable challenges for the unified multimodal SOD are mainly two-fold, i.e., (1) accurately detecting and segmenting salient objects, and (2) preferably via a single network that fits both RGB-T and RGB-D SOD. First, to deal with the former challenge, we propose the multi-scale feature extraction unit to enrich the discriminative contextual information, and the efficient fusion module to explore cross-modality complementary information. Then, the multimodal features are fed to the triplet decoder, where the hierarchical deep supervision loss further enable the network to capture distinctive saliency cues. Second, as to the latter challenge, we propose a simple yet effective continual learning method to unify multimodal SOD. Concretely, we sequentially train multimodal SOD tasks by applying Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) regularization with the hierarchical loss function to avoid catastrophic forgetting without inducing more parameters. Critically, the triplet decoder separates task-specific and task-invariant information, making the network easily adaptable to multimodal SOD tasks. Extensive comparisons with 26 recently proposed RGB-T and RGB-D SOD methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UTDNet.},

  abstract     = {While existing reconstruction-based multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection methods demonstrate advanced performance on many challenging real-world datasets, they generally assume the data only consists of normal samples when training models. However, real-world MTS data may contain significant noise and even be contaminated by anomalies. As a result, most existing approaches easily capture the pattern of the contaminated data, making identifying anomalies more difficult. Although a few studies have aimed to mitigate the interference of the noise and anomalies by introducing various regularizations , they still employ the objective of fully reconstructing the input data , impeding the model from learning an accurate profile of the MTS’s normal pattern. Moreover, it is difficult for existing methods to apply the most appropriate normalization schemes for each dataset in various complex scenarios, particularly for mixed-feature MTS. This paper proposes a filter-augmented auto-encoder with learnable normalization (NormFAAE) for robust MTS anomaly detection . Firstly, NormFAAE designs a deep hybrid normalization module. It is trained with the backbone end-to-end in the current training task to perform the optimal normalization scheme. Meanwhile, it integrates two learnable normalization sub-modules to deal with the mixed-feature MTS effectively. Secondly, NormFAAE proposes a filter-augmented auto-encoder with a dual-phase task. It separates the noise and anomalies from the input data by a deep filter module, which facilitates the model to only reconstruct the normal data, achieving a more robust latent representation of MTS. Experimental results demonstrate that NormFAAE outperforms 17 typical baselines on five real-world industrial datasets from diverse fields.},

  abstract     = {The attention mechanism comes as a new entry point for improving the performance of medical image segmentation . How to reasonably assign weights is a key element of the attention mechanism, and the current popular schemes include the global squeezing and the non-local information interactions using self-attention (SA) operation. However, these approaches over-focus on external features and lack the exploitation of latent features. The global squeezing approach crudely represents the richness of contextual information by the global mean or maximum value, while non-local information interactions focus on the similarity of external features between different regions. Both ignore the fact that the contextual information is presented more in terms of the latent features like the frequency change within the data. To tackle above problems and make proper use of attention mechanisms in medical image segmentation , we propose an external-latent attention collaborative guided image segmentation network, named TransGuider. This network consists of three key components: 1) a latent attention module that uses an improved entropy quantification method to accurately explore and locate the distribution of latent contextual information. 2) an external self-attention module using sparse representation , which can preserve external global contextual information while reducing computational overhead by selecting representative feature description map for SA operation. 3) a multi-attention collaborative module to guide the network to continuously focus on the region of interest, refining the segmentation mask. Our experimental results on several benchmark medical image segmentation datasets show that TransGuider outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and extensive ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Current neural networks mainly concentrate on the capturing of correlation information through connection weight parameters supplemented by bias parameters. This paper introduces feature-wise scaling and shifting (FwSS) into neural networks for capturing independent information of features, and proposes a new neural network FwSSNet. In the network, a pair of scale and shift parameters is added before each input of each network layer, and bias is removed. The parameters are initialized as 1 and 0, respectively, and trained at separate learning rates , to guarantee the fully capturing of independence and correlation information. The learning rates of FwSS parameters depend on input data and the training speed ratios of adjacent FwSS and connection sublayers , meanwhile those of weight parameters remain unchanged as plain networks. Further, FwSS unifies the scaling and shifting operations in batch normalization (BN), and FwSSNet with BN is established through introducing a preprocessing layer. FwSS parameters except those in the last layer of the network can be simply trained at the same learning rate as weight parameters.

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation is fundamental for modern healthcare systems, especially for reducing the risk of surgery and treatment planning. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) has emerged as a recent focal point in laparoscopic research, representing a pivotal modality in the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of colon &amp; rectum cancers. Real-time instance segmentation of surgical imagery during TaTME procedures can serve as an invaluable tool in assisting surgeons, ultimately reducing surgical risks. The dynamic variations in size and shape of anatomical structures within intraoperative images pose a formidable challenge, rendering the precise instance segmentation of TaTME images a task of considerable complexity. Deep learning has exhibited its efficacy in Medical image segmentation . However, existing models have encountered challenges in concurrently achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy while maintaining manageable computational complexity in the context of TaTME data. To address this conundrum, we propose a lightweight dynamic convolution Network (LDCNet) that has the same superior segmentation performance as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation network while running at the speed of the lightweight convolutional neural network . Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of LDCNet, which consistently exceeds previous SOTA approaches. Codes are available at github.com/yinyiyang416/LDCNet .},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) methods leverage prior knowledge from the source domain to train models for the target domain and address the differences in their feature spaces . However, incorrect alignment of categories and distribution structure disruption may be caused by unlabeled target samples during the domain alignment process for most existing methods, resulting in negative transfer. Additionally, the previous works rarely focus on the robustness and interpretability of the model. To address these issues, we propose a novel G raph embedding-based H eterogeneous domain- I nvariant feature learning and D istributional order preserving framework (GHID). Specifically, a bidirectional robust cross-domain alignment graph embedding structure is proposed to globally align two domains, which learns the domain-invariant and discriminative features simultaneously. In addition, the interpretability of the proposed graph structures is demonstrated through two theoretical analyses, which can elucidate the correlation between important samples from a global perspective in heterogeneous domain alignment scenarios. Then, a heterogeneous discriminative distributional order preserving graph embedding structure is designed to preserve the original distribution relationship of each domain to prevent negative transfer. Moreover, the dynamic centroid strategy is incorporated into the graph structures to improve the robustness of the model. Comprehensive experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in effectiveness.},

Among them, one popular approach is pseudo-labeling which generates pseudo labels only for those unlabeled data with high-confidence predictions. As for the low-confidence ones, existing methods often simply discard them because these unreliable pseudo labels may mislead the model. Unlike existing methods, we highlight that these low-confidence data can be still beneficial to the training process. Specifically, although we cannot determine which class a low-confidence sample belongs to, we can assume that this sample should be very unlikely to belong to those classes with the lowest probabilities (often called complementary classes/labels). Inspired by this, we propose a novel Contrastive Complementary Labeling (CCL) method that constructs a large number of reliable negative pairs based on the complementary labels and adopts contrastive learning to make use of all the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCL significantly improves the performance on top of existing advanced methods and is particularly effective under the label-scarce settings. For example, CCL yields an improvement of 2.43% over FixMatch on CIFAR-10 only with 40 labeled data.},

The layer-specific modules of multi-layer networks are critical to understanding the structure and function of the system. However, existing methods fail to characterize and balance the connectivity and specificity of layer-specific modules in networks because of the complicated inter- and intra-coupling of various layers. To address the above issues, a joint learning graph clustering algorithm (DRDF) for detecting layer-specific modules in multi-layer networks is proposed, which simultaneously learns the deep representation and discriminative features. Specifically, DRDF learns the deep representation with deep nonnegative matrix factorization , where the high-order topology of the multi-layer network is gradually and precisely characterized. Moreover, it addresses the specificity of modules with discriminative feature learning, where the intra-class compactness and inter-class separation of pseudo-labels of clusters are explored as self-supervised information, thereby providing a more accurate method to explicitly model the specificity of the multi-layer network. Finally, DRDF balances the connectivity and specificity of layer-specific modules with joint learning, where the overall objective of the graph clustering algorithm and optimization rules are derived. The experiments on ten multi-layer networks showed that DRDF not only outperforms eight baselines on graph clustering but also enhances the robustness of algorithms.},

However, most existing methods do not pay enough attention to the uncertain areas of colonoscopy images and often provide unsatisfactory segmentation performance . In this paper, we propose a novel boundary uncertainty aware network (BUNet) for precise and robust colorectal polyp segmentation. Specifically, considering that polyps vary greatly in size and shape, we first adopt a pyramid vision transformer encoder to learn multi-scale feature representations. Then, a simple yet effective boundary exploration module (BEM) is proposed to explore boundary cues from the low-level features. To make the network focus on the ambiguous area where the prediction score is biased to neither the foreground nor the background, we further introduce a boundary uncertainty aware module (BUM) that explores error-prone regions from the high-level features with the assistance of boundary cues provided by the BEM. Through the top-down hybrid deep supervision, our BUNet implements coarse-to-fine polyp segmentation and finally localizes polyp regions precisely. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show that BUNet is superior to thirteen competing methods in terms of both effectiveness and generalization ability .},

  abstract     = {An essential aspect of human motor learning is the formation of inverse models , which map desired actions to motor commands. Inverse models can be learned by adjusting parameters in neural circuits to minimize errors in the performance of motor tasks through gradient descent . However, the theory of gradient descent establishes limits on the learning speed. Specifically, the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the error surface around a minimum determine the maximum speed of learning in a task. Here, we use this theoretical framework to analyze the speed of learning in different inverse model learning architectures in a set of isometric arm-reaching tasks. We show theoretically that, in these tasks, the error surface and, thus the speed of learning, are determined by the shapes of the force manipulability ellipsoid of the arm and the distribution of targets in the task. In particular, rounder manipulability ellipsoids generate a rounder error surface, allowing for faster learning of the inverse model. Rounder target distributions have a similar effect. We tested these predictions experimentally in a quasi-isometric reaching task with a visuomotor transformation. The experimental results were consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, our analysis accounts for the speed of learning in previous experiments with incompatible and compatible virtual surgery tasks, and with visuomotor rotation tasks with different numbers of targets. By identifying aspects of a task that influence the speed of learning, our results provide theoretical principles for the design of motor tasks that allow for faster learning.},

Only a few studies have reported successful visualization of mental imagery, and their visualizable images have been limited to specific domains such as human faces or alphabetical letters. Therefore, visualizing mental imagery for arbitrary natural images stands as a significant milestone. In this study, we achieved this by enhancing a previous method. Specifically, we demonstrated that the visual image reconstruction method proposed in the seminal study by Shen et al. (2019) heavily relied on low-level visual information decoded from the brain and could not efficiently utilize the semantic information that would be recruited during mental imagery. To address this limitation, we extended the previous method to a Bayesian estimation framework and introduced the assistance of semantic information into it. Our proposed framework successfully reconstructed both seen images (i.e., those observed by the human eye) and imagined images from brain activity . Quantitative evaluation showed that our framework could identify seen and imagined images highly accurately compared to the chance accuracy (seen: 90.7%, imagery: 75.6%, chance accuracy: 50.0%). In contrast, the previous method could only identify seen images (seen: 64.3%, imagery: 50.4%). These results suggest that our framework would provide a unique tool for directly investigating the subjective contents of the brain such as illusions, hallucinations , and dreams.},

The attention mechanism can relieve these issues by enhancing expression-relevant information and suppressing expression-irrelevant information. However, most methods utilize the same attention mechanism on feature tensors with varying spatial and channel sizes across different network layers, disregarding the dynamically changing sizes of these tensors. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical attention network with progressive feature fusion for FER. Specifically, first, to aggregate diverse complementary features, a diverse feature extraction module based on several feature aggregation blocks is designed to exploit both local context and global context features, both low-level and high-level features, as well as the gradient features that are robust to illumination variation . Second, to effectively fuse the above diverse features, a hierarchical attention module (HAM) is designed to progressively enhance discriminative features from key parts of the facial images and suppress task-irrelevant features from disturbing facial regions. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves the best performance among existing FER methods.},

However, the existing DL methods are difficult or very likely fail to detect discontinuous burst signals, not to mention the signals with wide, instantaneous, dynamic bandwidth , and multiple channels . To solve this problem, the present study proposes a scheme that combines the start–stop point signal features for wideband multi-signal detection, namely the Fast Spectrum-Size Self-Training network (FSSNet). Considering the horizontal rectangle form of a wideband signal in the time–frequency domain, we innovatively utilize the start–stop points of the two-dimensional (2D) Box to build the signal model. Specifically, We propose a fast Start–stop HeatMap where the proposed LPS-YXE simultaneously labels and divides the start–stop points positions in the X–Y axis of a single HeatMap. We attribute the method’s success in discontinuous signal detection to the multidimensional space transformation of HeatMap, which is used to locate the start–stop points and extract features separated from the signal regions of start–stop points. Furthermore, FSSNet can realize the 2D Box estimation of the wideband signal by regressing only a single variable , and thus with satisfactory detection speed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed start–stop based wideband signal detection scheme with practical received signals.

  abstract     = {The Transformer architecture has been widely applied in the field of image segmentation due to its powerful ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, its ability to capture local features is relatively weak and it requires a large amount of data for training. Medical image segmentation tasks , on the other hand, demand high requirements for local features and are often applied to small datasets. Therefore, existing Transformer networks show a significant decrease in performance when applied directly to this task. To address these issues, we have designed a new medical image segmentation architecture called CT-Net. It effectively extracts local and global representations using an asymmetric asynchronous branch parallel structure, while reducing unnecessary computational costs. In addition, we propose a high-density information fusion strategy that efficiently fuses the features of two branches using a fusion module of only 0.05M. This strategy ensures high portability and provides conditions for directly applying transfer learning to solve dataset dependency issues. Finally, we have designed a parameter-adjustable multi-perceptive loss function for this architecture to optimize the training process from both pixel-level and global perspectives. We have tested this network on 5 different tasks with 9 datasets, and compared to SwinUNet, CT-Net improves the IoU by 7.3% and 1.8% on Glas and MoNuSeg datasets respectively.

One promising avenue to address this challenge is the development of accurate performance prediction methods. However, existing methods reveal critical limitations. Operator-level methods, proficient at predicting the performance of individual operators, often neglect broader graph features, which results in inaccuracies in full network performance predictions. On the contrary, graph-level methods excel in overall network prediction by leveraging these graph features but lack the ability to predict the performance of individual operators. To bridge these gaps, we propose SLAPP, a novel subgraph-level performance prediction method. Central to SLAPP is an innovative variant of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that we developed, named the Edge Aware Graph Attention Network (EAGAT). This specially designed GNN enables superior encoding of both node and edge features. Through this approach, SLAPP effectively captures both graph and operator features, thereby providing precise performance predictions for individual operators and entire networks. Moreover, we introduce a mixed loss design with dynamic weight adjustment to reconcile the predictive accuracy between individual operators and entire networks. In our experimental evaluation, SLAPP consistently outperforms traditional approaches in prediction accuracy, including the ability to handle unseen models effectively. Moreover, when compared to existing research, our method demonstrates a superior predictive performance across multiple DL models.},

  abstract     = {Bounding box regression (BBR) is one of the core tasks in object detection, and the BBR loss function significantly impacts its performance. However, we have observed that existing IoU-based loss functions suffer from unreasonable penalty factors, leading to anchor boxes expanding during regression and significantly slowing down convergence. To address this issue, we intensively analyzed the reasons for anchor box enlargement. In response, we propose a Powerful-IoU (PIoU) loss function, which combines a target size-adaptive penalty factor and a gradient-adjusting function based on anchor box quality. The PIoU loss guides anchor boxes to regress along efficient paths, resulting in faster convergence than existing IoU-based losses. Additionally, we investigate the focusing mechanism and introduce a non-monotonic attention layer that was combined with PIoU to obtain a new loss function PIoU v2. PIoU v2 loss enhances the capability to focus on anchor boxes of medium quality. By incorporating PIoU v2 into popular object detectors such as YOLOv8 and DINO, we achieved an increase in average precision (AP) and improved performance compared to their original loss functions on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, thus validating the effectiveness of our proposed improvement strategies .},

To deal with the performance degradation issue when HGNNs become deep, researchers combine metapaths into HGNNs to associate nodes closely related in semantics but far apart in the graph. However, existing metapath-based models suffer from either information loss or high computation costs. To address these problems, we present a novel Metapath Context Convolution-based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (MECCH). MECCH leverages metapath contexts , a new kind of graph structure that facilitates lossless node information aggregation while avoiding any redundancy. Specifically, MECCH applies three novel components after feature preprocessing to extract comprehensive information from the input graph efficiently: (1) metapath context construction, (2) metapath context encoder, and (3) convolutional metapath fusion. Experiments on five real-world heterogeneous graph datasets for node classification and link prediction show that MECCH achieves superior prediction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art baselines with improved computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Multi-task learning is a promising paradigm to leverage task interrelations during the training of deep neural networks . A key challenge in the training of multi-task networks is to adequately balance the complementary supervisory signals of multiple tasks. In that regard, although several task-balancing approaches have been proposed, they are usually limited by the use of per-task weighting schemes and do not completely address the uneven contribution of the different tasks to the network training. In contrast to classical approaches, we propose a novel Multi-Adaptive Optimization (MAO) strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution of each task to the training of each individual parameter in the network. This automatically produces a balanced learning across tasks and across parameters, throughout the whole training and for any number of tasks. To validate our proposal, we perform comparative experiments on real-world datasets for computer vision , considering different experimental settings. These experiments allow us to analyze the performance obtained in several multi-task scenarios along with the learning balance across tasks, network layers and training steps. The results demonstrate that MAO outperforms previous task-balancing alternatives. Additionally, the performed analyses provide insights that allow us to comprehend the advantages of this novel approach for multi-task learning.},

However, these methods are limited to extracting the global contextual features through instance-level attention without considering the perspective of human–object interaction pairs, and the fusion enhancement of interaction pair features lacks further exploration. The human–object interaction pairs guiding global context extraction relative to instance guiding global context extraction more fully utilize the semantics between human–object pairs, which helps HOI recognition. To this end, we propose a two-stage G lobal Context and Pairwise-level F usion Features I ntegration N etwork (GFIN) for HOI detection. Specifically, the first stage employs an object detector for instance feature extraction. The second stage aims to capture the semantic-rich visual information through the proposed three modules, Global Contextual Feature Extraction Encoder (GCE), Pairwise Interaction Query Decoder (PID), and Human-Object Pairwise-level Attention Fusion Module (HOF). The GCE module intends to extract the global context memory by the proposed crossover-residual mechanism and then integrate it with the local instance memory from the DETR object detector. HOF utilizes the proposed pairwise-level attention mechanism to fuse and enhance the first stage’s multi-layer feature. PID outputs multi-label interaction recognition results with the input of the query sequence from HOF and the memory from GCE. Finally, comprehensive experiments conducted on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed GFIN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Fluorescence microscopes are indispensable tools for the life science research community. Nevertheless, the presence of optical component limitations, coupled with the maximum photon budget that the specimen can tolerate, inevitably leads to a decline in imaging quality and a lack of useful signals. Therefore, image restoration becomes essential for ensuring high-quality and accurate analyses. This paper presents the Wavelet-Enhanced Convolutional-Transformer (WECT), a novel deep learning technique developed specifically for the purpose of reducing noise in microscopy images and attaining super-resolution. Unlike traditional approaches, WECT integrates wavelet transform and inverse-transform for multi-resolution image decomposition and reconstruction, resulting in an expanded receptive field for the network without compromising information integrity. Subsequently, multiple consecutive parallel CNN-Transformer modules are utilized to collaboratively model local and global dependencies, thus facilitating the extraction of more comprehensive and diversified deep features. In addition, the incorporation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) into WECT enhances its capacity to generate high perceptual quality microscopic images . Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the WECT framework outperforms current state-of-the-art restoration methods on real fluorescence microscopy data under various imaging modalities and conditions, in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis.},

We verbalize the images using an off-the-shelf object detector, adding location tokens to every object label to represent their bounding boxes in textual form. Given the small size of VSR, we do not observe any improvement when using locations, but pretraining the LM over a synthetic dataset automatically derived by us improves results significantly when using location tokens. We thus show that locations allow LMs to ground spatial relations, with our text-only LMs outperforming Vision-and-Language Models and setting the new state-of-the-art for the VSR dataset. Our analysis show that our text-only LMs can generalize beyond the relations seen in the synthetic dataset to some extent, learning also more useful information than that encoded in the spatial rules we used to create the synthetic dataset itself.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the information transmission process in the brain, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained considerable attention due to their event-driven nature. However, as the network structure grows complex, managing the spiking behavior within the network becomes challenging. Networks with excessively dense or sparse spikes fail to transmit sufficient information, inhibiting SNNs from exhibiting superior performance. Current SNNs linearly sum presynaptic information in postsynaptic neurons , overlooking the adaptive adjustment effect of dendrites on information processing . In this study, we introduce the Dendritic Spatial Gating Module (DSGM), which scales and translates the input, reducing the loss incurred when transforming the continuous membrane potential into discrete spikes. Simultaneously, by implementing the Dendritic Temporal Adjust Module (DTAM), dendrites assign different importance to inputs of different time steps, facilitating the establishment of the temporal dependency of spiking neurons and effectively integrating multi-step time information. The fusion of these two modules results in a more balanced spike representation within the network, significantly enhancing the neural network’s performance. This approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on static image datasets, including CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, as well as event datasets like DVS-CIFAR10, DVS-Gesture, and N-Caltech101.

In this work, we propose a novel framework, Teacher–Student Complementary Sample Contrastive Distillation (TSCSCD), that alleviate these challenges. TSCSCD consists of three key components: Contrastive Sample Hardness (CSH), Supervision Signal Correction (SSC), and Student Self-Learning (SSL). Specifically, CSH evaluates the teacher’s supervision for each sample by comparing the predictions of two compact models, one distilled from the teacher and the other trained from scratch. SSC corrects weak supervision according to CSH, while SSL employs integrated learning among multi-classifiers to regularize overconfident predictions.

We establish the convergence analysis in both asymptotic and nonasymptotic senses. The MCSDCA is then applied to deep learning via PDEs (partial differential equations) regularization , where two realizations of MCSDCA are constructed, namely MCSDCA-odLD and MCSDCA-udLD, based on overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics , respectively.

However, the small size of the adrenal gland, which occupies less than 1% of the abdominal CT slice, poses a significant challenge to accurate segmentation. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-level context-aware network (MCNet) to segment adrenal glands in CT images. Our MCNet mainly consists of two components, i.e. , the multi-level context aggregation (MCA) module and multi-level context guidance (MCG) module. Specifically, the MCA module employs multi-branch dilated convolutional layers to capture geometric information , which enables handling of changes in complex scenarios such as variations in the size and shape of objects. The MCG module, on the other hand, gathers valuable features from the shallow layer and leverages the complete utilization of feature information at different resolutions in various codec stages. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the MCNet on two CT datasets, including our clinical dataset (Ad-Seg) and a publicly available dataset known as Distorted Golden Standards (DGS), from different perspectives. Compared to ten other state-of-the-art segmentation methods , our MCNet achieves 71.34% and 75.29% of the best Dice similarity coefficient on the two datasets, respectively, which is at least 2.46% and 1.19% higher than other segmentation methods .},

  abstract     = {The exponential stabilization of stochastic neural networks in mean square sense with saturated impulsive input is investigated in this paper. Firstly, the saturated term is handled by polyhedral representation method. When the impulsive sequence is determined by average impulsive interval, impulsive density and mode-dependent impulsive density, the sufficient conditions for stability are proposed, respectively. Then, the ellipsoid and the polyhedron are used to estimate the attractive domain, respectively. By transforming the estimation of the attractive domain into a convex optimization problem, a relatively optimum domain of attraction is obtained. Finally, a three-dimensional continuous time Hopfield neural network example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) provides autonomy and privacy by design to participating peers, who cooperatively build a machine learning (ML) model while keeping their private data in their devices. However, that same autonomy opens the door for malicious peers to poison the model by conducting either untargeted or targeted poisoning attacks. The label-flipping (LF) attack is a targeted poisoning attack where the attackers poison their training data by flipping the labels of some examples from one class (i.e., the source class) to another (i.e., the target class). Unfortunately, this attack is easy to perform and hard to detect, and it negatively impacts the performance of the global model. Existing defenses against LF are limited by assumptions on the distribution of the peers’ data and/or do not perform well with high-dimensional models. In this paper, we deeply investigate the LF attack behavior . We find that the contradicting objectives of attackers and honest peers on the source class examples are reflected on the parameter gradients corresponding to the neurons of the source and target classes in the output layer. This makes those gradients good discriminative features for the attack detection. Accordingly, we propose LFighter, a novel defense against the LF attack that first dynamically extracts those gradients from the peers’ local updates and then clusters the extracted gradients, analyzes the resulting clusters, and filters out potential bad updates before model aggregation. Extensive empirical analysis on three data sets shows the effectiveness of the proposed defense regardless of the data distribution or model dimensionality. Also, LFighter outperforms several state-of-the-art defenses by offering lower test error, higher overall accuracy, higher source class accuracy, lower attack success rate, and higher stability of the source class accuracy.

  abstract     = {Recent work has shown that machine learning (ML) models can skillfully forecast the dynamics of unknown chaotic systems. Short-term predictions of the state evolution and long-term predictions of the statistical patterns of the dynamics (“climate”) can be produced by employing a feedback loop, whereby the model is trained to predict forward only one time step, then the model output is used as input for multiple time steps. In the absence of mitigating techniques, however, this feedback can result in artificially rapid error growth (“instability”). One established mitigating technique is to add noise to the ML model training input. Based on this technique, we formulate a new penalty term in the loss function for ML models with memory of past inputs that deterministically approximates the effect of many small, independent noise realizations added to the model input during training. We refer to this penalty and the resulting regularization as Linearized Multi-Noise Training (LMNT). We systematically examine the effect of LMNT, input noise, and other established regularization techniques in a case study using reservoir computing , a machine learning method using recurrent neural networks , to predict the spatiotemporal chaotic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation. We find that reservoir computers trained with noise or with LMNT produce climate predictions that appear to be indefinitely stable and have a climate very similar to the true system, while the short-term forecasts are substantially more accurate than those trained with other regularization techniques. Finally, we show the deterministic aspect of our LMNT regularization facilitates fast reservoir computer regularization hyperparameter tuning.},

  abstract     = {The architecture of communication within the brain, represented by the human connectome, has gained a paramount role in the neuroscience community. Several features of this communication, e.g. , the frequency content, spatial topology, and temporal dynamics are currently well established. However, identifying generative models providing the underlying patterns of inhibition/excitation is very challenging. To address this issue, we present a novel generative model to estimate large-scale effective connectivity from MEG. The dynamic evolution of this model is determined by a recurrent Hopfield neural network with asymmetric connections, and thus denoted Recurrent Hopfield Mass Model (RHoMM). Since RHoMM must be applied to binary neurons, it is suitable for analyzing Band Limited Power (BLP) dynamics following a binarization process. We trained RHoMM to predict the MEG dynamics through a gradient descent minimization and we validated it in two steps. First, we showed a significant agreement between the similarity of the effective connectivity patterns and that of the interregional BLP correlation, demonstrating RHoMM’s ability to capture individual variability of BLP dynamics. Second, we showed that the simulated BLP correlation connectomes, obtained from RHoMM evolutions of BLP, preserved some important topological features , e.g , the centrality of the real data , assuring the reliability of RHoMM. Compared to other biophysical models, RHoMM is based on recurrent Hopfield neural networks, thus, it has the advantage of being data-driven, less demanding in terms of hyperparameters and scalable to encompass large-scale system interactions. These features are promising for investigating the dynamics of inhibition/excitation at different spatial scales .},

Such hypersurface can be computed for an arbitrary unit in the CNN , and we prove that this reconstructed hypersurface, when multiplied by the original input (through an inner product), will precisely replicate the output value of each unit. We show experimental results based on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets where the proposed approach achieves near 0 activation value reconstruction error.},

This area, called Subthalamic Nucleus (STN), is small and located deep within the brain. Therefore, the main challenge is the precise localization of the STN region, considering various measurement errors and artifacts. In this paper, we have designed and developed a computer-aided decision support system for neurosurgical DBS surgery. The implementation of this system provides a novel method for calculating the expected position of the stimulating electrode based on the recordings of the electrical activity of brain tissue . The artificial neural network with attention is used to classify the microelectrode recordings and determine the final position of the stimulating electrode within the STN area. Experiments have verified the utility and efficiency of our system. The tests were carried out on many recordings collected during DBS surgeries, giving encouraging results. The experimental results demonstrate that deep learning methods extended with self-attention blocks compete with the other solutions. They provide significant robustness to recording artifacts and improve the accuracy of the stimulating electrode placement.},

In this study, a new biometrics database containing silhouette, thermal face and skeletal data based on the distance between the joints was created to be used in behavioural and physical biometrics studies. The fact that many cameras were used in previous studies increases both the processing intensity and the material cost. This study aimed to both increase the recognition performance and reduce material costs by adding thermal face data in addition to soft and behavioural biometrics with the optimum camera.

Advantage estimators, the most common critics in the actor–critic framework, combine state values from bootstrapping value functions and sample returns. Different combinations balance the bias introduced by state values and the variance returned by samples to reduce estimation errors . The bias and variance constantly fluctuate throughout training, leading to different optimal combinations. However, existing advantage estimators usually use fixed combinations that fail to account for the trade-off between minimizing bias and variance to find the optimal estimate. Our previous work on adaptive advantage estimation (AAE) analyzed the sources of bias and variance and offered two indicators. This paper further explores the relationship between the indicators and their optimal combination through typical numerical experiments. These analyses develop a general form of adaptive combinations of state values and sample returns to achieve low estimation errors. Empirical results on simulated robotic locomotion tasks show that our proposed estimators achieve similar or superior performance compared to previous generalized advantage estimators (GAE).},

However, these methods are easily affected by noisy labels and feature variations caused by camera shifts, which will limit the optimization of pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose an Asymmetric Double Networks Mutual Teaching (ADNMT) architecture that uses two asymmetric networks to generate pseudo-labels for each other by clustering, and the pseudo-labels are updated and optimized by alternate training. Specifically, ADNMT contains two asymmetric networks. One network is a multiple granularity network, which extracts pedestrian features of multiple granularity that correspond to numerous classifiers, and the other network is a conventional backbone network, which extracts pedestrian features that correspond to a classifier. Furthermore, because the camera style changes seriously affect the generalization ability of the proposed model, this paper designs Similarity Compensation of Inter-Camera (SCIC) and Similarity Suppression of Intra-Camera (SSIC) according to the camera ID of the pedestrian images to optimize the similarity measure. Extensive experiments on multiple Re-ID benchmark datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared with the state‐of‐the‐art unsupervised person re-identification methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with non-fragile output-feedback control for time-delay neural networks with persistent dwell time (PDT) switching in a continuous-time setting. The main purpose is to design an output-feedback controller subject to gain fluctuations, guaranteeing both asymptotic stability and L 2 L2 -gain of the closed-loop control system . To achieve reduced conservatism, the controller is formulated to depend not only on the system mode but also on a time scheduler constructed based on the PDT switching rule and minimum time span. A criterion for the asymptotic stability and L 2 L2 -gain analysis is established through the application of the Gronwall–Bellman inequality and mathematical induction . Then, a numerically tractable design approach for the desired controller is proposed, utilizing a four-section piecewise time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and several nonlinearity decoupling techniques. For comparative purposes, a simple case , independent of the time scheduler, is also investigated, and the corresponding controller design approach is presented. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system mode and time scheduler dual-dependent controller design approach.},

  abstract     = {The remarkable performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has increased their use in real-time systems and devices with limited resources. Hence, compacting these networks while preserving accuracy has become necessary, leading to multiple compression methods . However, the majority require intensive iterative procedures and do not delve into the influence of the used data. To overcome these issues, this paper presents several contributions, framed in the context of e x plainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI): (a) two filter pruning methods for CNNs, which remove the less significant convolutional kernels; (b) a fine-tuning strategy to recover generalization; (c) a layer pruning approach for U-Net; and (d) an explanation of the relationship between performance and the used data. Filter and feature maps information are used in the pruning process: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is combined with a next-convolution influence-metric, while the latter and the mean standard deviation are used in an importance score distribution-based method. The developed strategies are generic, and therefore applicable to different models. Experiments demonstrating their effectiveness are conducted over distinct CNNs and datasets, focusing mainly on semantic segmentation (using U-Net, DeepLabv3+, SegNet, and VGG-16 as highly representative models). Pruned U-Net on agricultural benchmarks achieves 98.7% parameters and 97.5% FLOPs drop, with a 0.35% gain in accuracy. DeepLabv3+ and SegNet on CamVid reach 46.5% and 72.4% parameters reduction and a 51.9% and 83.6% FLOPs drop respectively, with almost no decrease in accuracy.

To address this issue, SAR colorization has emerged as a research direction to colorize gray scale SAR images while preserving the original spatial information and radiometric information. However, this research field is still in its early stages, and many limitations can be highlighted. In this paper, we propose a full research line for supervised learning-based approaches to SAR colorization. Our approach includes a protocol for generating synthetic color SAR images, several baselines, and an effective method based on the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) for SAR colorization. We also propose numerical assessment metrics for the problem at hand. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a research line for SAR colorization that includes a protocol, a benchmark, and a complete performance evaluation.

  abstract     = {With the growing exploration of marine resources, underwater image enhancement has gained significant attention. Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) have greatly impacted underwater image enhancement techniques. However, conventional CNN-based methods typically employ a single network structure, which may compromise robustness in challenging conditions . Additionally, commonly used UNet networks generally force fusion from low to high resolution for each layer, leading to inaccurate contextual information encoding. To address these issues, we propose a novel network called Cascaded Network with Multi-level Sub-networks (CNMS), which encompasses the following key components: (a) a cascade mechanism based on local modules and global networks for extracting feature representations with richer semantics and enhanced spatial precision, (b) information exchange between different resolution streams, and (c) a triple attention module for extracting attention-based features. CNMS selectively cascades multiple sub-networks through triple attention modules to extract distinct features from underwater images, bolstering the network’s robustness and improving generalization capabilities. Within the sub-network, we introduce a Multi-level Sub-network (MSN) that spans multiple resolution streams, combining contextual information from various scales while preserving the original underwater images’ high-resolution spatial details . Comprehensive experiments on multiple underwater datasets demonstrate that CNMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks.},

An automatic decision-making process is thus an essential need for cancer detection and diagnosis.

However, one challenge for deep learning-based models is appropriate and accurate representations of drugs and targets, especially the lack of effective exploration of target representations. Another challenge is how to comprehensively capture the interaction information between different instances, which is also important for predicting DTA. In this study, we propose AttentionMGT-DTA, a multi-modal attention-based model for DTA prediction.

Neurons described by nonlinear oscillators can exhibit complex electrical activities. Josephson junctions are excellent candidates for neuron-inspired components because of their physical properties with low energy costs and high efficiency. In this paper, we revisit a prior work on memristive Josephson junction (MJJ) to identify the dynamical mechanisms to mimic neuron-like excitability and spiking. The inductive memristive Josephson junction (L-MJJ) model is further developed by adding an inductor with internal resistor . It is found that the L-MJJ model can reproduce square-wave bursting of the classical neuronal model from the neurodynamics point of view. The coupling L-MJJ oscillators can achieve in-phase and antiphase bursting synchronization similar with nonlinear coupling neurons. From the framework of nonlinear dynamics theory, this work aspires to build effective bridge between superconducting physics and theoretical neuroscience .

Secondly, the computation of the criterion is performed locally, lacking the ability to measure the importance of features globally. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel feature ranking criterion called Maximum Margin and Global (MMG) criterion. This criterion utilizes the classification margin to determine the importance of features and computes it globally, enabling a more accurate assessment of feature importance. Moreover, we introduce an optimal feature subset evaluation algorithm that leverages the MMG criterion to determine the best subset of features. To enhance the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, we provide two alpha seeding strategies that significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining high accuracy. These strategies offer a practical means to expedite the feature selection process. Through extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform current state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the alpha seeding strategies yield significant speedups, further enhancing the efficiency of the feature selection process.},

  abstract     = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers a non-invasive approach to examining abnormal brain connectivity associated with brain disorders. Graph neural network (GNN) gains popularity in fMRI representation learning and brain disorder analysis with powerful graph representation capabilities. Training a general GNN often necessitates a large-scale dataset from multiple imaging centers/sites, but centralizing multi-site data generally faces inherent challenges related to data privacy, security, and storage burden. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralized multi-site fMRI data. Unfortunately, previous FL approaches for fMRI analysis often ignore site-specificity, including demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level. To this end, we propose a specificity-aware federated graph learning (SFGL) framework for rs-fMRI analysis and automated brain disorder identification, with a server and multiple clients/sites for federated model aggregation and prediction. At each client, our model consists of a shared and a personalized branch, where parameters of the shared branch are sent to the server while those of the personalized branch remain local. This can facilitate knowledge sharing among sites and also helps preserve site specificity. In the shared branch, we employ a spatio-temporal attention graph isomorphism network to learn dynamic fMRI representations. In the personalized branch, we integrate vectorized demographic information ( i.e. , age, gender, and education years) and functional connectivity networks to preserve site-specific characteristics. Representations generated by the two branches are then fused for classification. Experimental results on two fMRI datasets with a total of 1218 subjects suggest that SFGL outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.},

Therefore, there is growing interest in finding local alternatives to backpropagation . Recently proposed methods based on forward-mode automatic differentiation suffer from high variance in large deep neural networks , which affects convergence. In this paper, we propose the Forward Direct Feedback Alignment algorithm that combines Activity-Perturbed Forward Gradients with Direct Feedback Alignment and momentum. We provide both theoretical proofs and empirical evidence that our proposed method achieves lower variance than forward gradient techniques. In this way, our approach enables faster convergence and better performance when compared to other local alternatives to backpropagation and opens a new perspective for the development of online learning algorithms compatible with neuromorphic systems .},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance in computer vision tasks . Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically operate in the spatial domain with raw images, but in practice, images are usually stored and transmitted in their compressed representation where JPEG is one of the most widely used encoder. Also, these networks are computationally intensive and slow. This paper proposes performing the learning and inference processes in the compressed domain in order to reduce the computational complexity and improve the speed of popular CNNs. For this purpose, a novel graph-based frequency channel selection method is proposed to identify and select the most important frequency channels. The computational complexity is reduced by retaining the important frequency components and discarding the insignificant ones as well as eliminating the unnecessary layers of the network. Experimental results show that the modified ResNet-50 operating in the compressed domain is up to 70% faster than the spatial-based traditional ResNet-50 while resulting in similar classification accuracy . Moreover, this paper proposes a preprocessing step with partial encoding to improve the resilience to distortions caused by low-quality encoded images. Finally, we show that training a network with highly compressed data can achieve a good classification accuracy with up to 93% reduction in the storage requirements of the training data .},

Current personality prediction primarily focuses on discovering personality traits through user posts. Additionally, there are also methods that utilize psychological information to uncover certain underlying personality traits. Although significant progress has been made in personality prediction, we believe that current solutions still overlook the long-term sustainability of personality and are constrained by the challenge of capturing consistent personality-related clues across different views in a simple and efficient manner. To this end, we propose HG-PerCon, which utilizes user representations based on historical semantic information and psychological knowledge for cross-view contrastive learning . Specifically, we design a transformer-based module to obtain user representations with long-lasting personality-related information from their historical posts. We leverage a psychological knowledge graph which incorporates language styles to generate user representations guided by psychological knowledge. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning to capture the consistency of user personality-related clues across views.

Based on the constructed multi-stream architecture, rich and meaningful feature interference is introduced in the feature extraction stage to enhance the model’s ability to perceive noise. Next, a collaborative integration module similar to cascading cross-attention is proposed. By studying the intrinsic interaction patterns of regional and contextual features, it adaptively fuses features across streams and enhances the diverse and complete representation of internal information. The module is not only robust to complex occlusions, but also mitigates the feature interference problem due to similar appearances or scenes. Finally, a matching expansion module that enhances feature discriminability and completeness is proposed. Providing more stable and accurate features for recognition.

Integrating SAM with adaptive learning rate and momentum acceleration, dubbed AdaSAM, has already been explored empirically to train large-scale deep neural networks without theoretical guarantee due to the triple difficulties in analyzing the coupled perturbation step, adaptive learning rate and momentum step. In this paper, we try to analyze the convergence rate of AdaSAM in the stochastic non-convex setting. We theoretically show that AdaSAM admits a O ( 1 / b T ) O(1/bT) convergence rate, which achieves linear speedup property with respect to mini-batch size b b . Specifically, to decouple the stochastic gradient steps with the adaptive learning rate and perturbed gradient, we introduce the delayed second-order momentum term to decompose them to make them independent while taking an expectation during the analysis. Then we bound them by showing the adaptive learning rate has a limited range, which makes our analysis feasible. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide the non-trivial convergence rate of SAM with an adaptive learning rate and momentum acceleration. At last, we conduct several experiments on several NLP tasks and the synthetic task, which show that AdaSAM could achieve superior performance compared with SGD, AMSGrad, and SAM optimizers.},

Most of the existing GCN-based approaches are designed for single-view data. In numerous practical scenarios, data is expressed through multiple views, rather than a single view. The ability of GCN to model homogeneous graphs is indisputable, while it is insufficient in facing the heterophily property of multi-view data. In this paper, we revisit multi-view learning to propose an implicit heterogeneous graph convolutional network that efficiently captures the heterogeneity of multi-view data while exploiting the powerful feature aggregation capability of GCN. We automatically assign optimal importance to each view when constructing the meta-path graph. High-order cross-view meta-paths are explored based on the obtained graph, and a series of graph matrices are generated. Combining graph matrices with learnable global feature representation to obtain heterogeneous graph embeddings at various levels. Finally, in order to effectively utilize both local and global information, we introduce a graph-level attention mechanism at the meta-path level that allocates private information to each node individually.

Previous methods usually construct enterprise representations by credit-related indicators, such as liquidity and staff quality. However, indicators of many enterprises are not accessible, especially for the small- and medium-sized enterprises. To alleviate the indicator deficiency, graph learning based methods are proposed to enhance enterprise representation learning by the neighbor structure of enterprise graphs. However, existing methods usually only focus on pairwise relationships, and overlook the ubiquitous high-order relationships among enterprises, e.g., supply chain connecting multiple enterprises. To resolve this issue, we propose a Multi-Structure Cascaded Graph Neural Network framework (MS-CGNN) for ECR assessment. It enhances enterprise representation learning based on enterprise graph structures of different granularity , including knowledge graphs of pairwise relationships, homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs of high-order relationships. To distinguish influences of different types of hyperedges , MS-CGNN redefine new type-dependent hyperedge weight matrices for heterogeneous hypergraph convolutions .

  abstract     = {Few-shot relation extraction (few-shot RE) aims to recognize relations between the entity pair in a given text by utilizing very few annotated instances. As a simple yet efficient approach, prototype network-based methods often directly incorporate relation information to enhance prototype representation or leverage contrastive learning to mitigate prediction confusion. Despite achieving good results, the above methods are still susceptible to false judgments of outlier samples and confusion of similar classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel Sem antics- G uided L earning (SemGL) method that more effectively utilizes relation information to enhance both the representations of instances and prototypes for improving the performance of few-shot RE. First, SemGL employs the prompt encoder to encode various prompt templates of instances and relation information and obtains more accurate semantic representations of instances, instance prototypes, and concept prototypes via the prompt enhancement from large language models . Then, SemGL introduces a novel technique called relation graph learning, which leverages concept prototypes to cluster homogeneous instances together, emphasizing relation-specific features of concrete instances. Simultaneously, SemGL employs instance-level contrastive learning between instance prototypes and support instances to distinguish between intra-class instances and inter-class instances to promote shared features among intra-class instances. Additionally, prototype-level contrastive learning leverages concept prototypes to pull closer relation-specific features of the concept prototype and shared features of the instance prototype from the same relation. Finally, SemGL utilizes new relation prototypes that integrate interpretable features of concept prototypes and shared features of instance prototypes for prediction. Experimental results on two publicly available few-shot RE datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SemGL in introducing relation information, with particularly promising results for the domain adaptation challenge task.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that commonly occurs in older people. It is characterized by both cognitive and functional impairment. However, as AD has an unclear pathological cause, it can be hard to diagnose with confidence. This is even more so in the early stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). This paper proposes a U-Net based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) from magnetic resonance imaging - T1 weighted imaging (MRI-T1WI) for further usage in AD diagnosis including its early-stage MCI. The experiments have displayed promising results with Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) reaching 0.9714. Furthermore, three types of classifiers are developed, i.e., one Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier, two Graph Neural Network (GNN) based classifiers where one is for graph classification and the other is for node classification . 10-fold cross-validation has been conducted on all trials of experiments for classifier comparison. The performance of these three types of classifiers has been compared with the different input modalities setting and data fusion strategies. The results have shown that GNN based node classifier surpasses the other two types of classifiers, and has achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the best accuracy at 90.18% for 3-class classification, namely AD, MCI and normal control (NC) with the synthesized fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) features fused at the input level . Moreover, involving synthesized FDG-PET as part of the input with proper data fusion strategies has also proved to enhance all three types of classifiers’ performance. This work provides support for the notion that machine learning-derived image analysis may be a useful approach to improving the diagnosis of AD.},

While tensor decomposition (TD) provides promising tools for analyzing such data, there still remains several limitations. First, traditional TDs assume multi-linear structures of the latent embeddings, which greatly limits their expressive power . Second, TDs cannot be straightforwardly applied to datasets with massive samples. To address these issues, we propose a nonparametric TD with amortized inference networks. Specifically, we establish a non-linear extension of tensor ring decomposition, using neural networks , to model complex latent structures . To jointly model the cross-sample correlations and physical structures , a matrix Gaussian process (GP) prior is imposed over the core tensors. From learning perspective, we develop a VAE-like amortized inference network to infer the posterior of core tensors corresponding to new tensor data, which enables TDs to be applied to large datasets. Our model can be also viewed as a kind of decomposition of VAE, which can additionally capture hidden tensor structure and enhance the expressiveness power. Finally, we derive an evidence lower bound such that a scalable optimization algorithm is developed. The advantages of our method have been evaluated extensively by data imputation on the Healing MNIST dataset and four multi-variate time series data .},

These two learning mechanisms can, however, conflict with each other and representations can fail to embed information on the data modalities. This research studies the realistic scenario in which all modalities and class labels are available for model training, e.g. images or handwriting, but where some modalities and labels required for downstream tasks are missing, e.g. text or annotations. We show, in this scenario, that the variational lower bound limits mutual information between joint representations and missing modalities. We, to counteract these problems, introduce a novel conditional multi-modal discriminative model that uses an informative prior distribution and optimizes a likelihood-free objective function that maximizes mutual information between joint representations and missing modalities. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the benefits of our proposed model, empirical results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results in representative problems such as downstream classification, acoustic inversion, and image and annotation generation.},

  abstract     = {Most cropping-and-segmenting pattern parsers typically establish a single metric/scheme to reason diverse inner correlations, resulting in over-general and redundant representations . To make pattern parsing more streamlined and efficient, a fragile correlation pruner network (FCPN) with correlation-steered attention shifters (CSASs) and graph attention expectation-maximum routing agreement (GAEMRA) is proposed. CSASs prune fragile (weak and substitutable) part-to-whole correlations. They stipulate that only those primary entities (representing components) fulfilling the criteria of inter-part diversity and intra-object cohesiveness can update senior entities (representing the whole/intermediate composites). To further boost effects, GAEMRA is defined to shield the redundant voting signals of conventional routing agreement. With CSASs and GAEMRA, FCPN gradually parses objective semantic patterns by clustering highly associated secondary entities in a bottom-up &quot;part backtracking&quot; manner. Quantitative and ablation experiments surrounding face and human parsing demonstrate the superiority of FCPN over the state-of-the-arts, especially for the definition of fine-grained semantic boundaries.},

However, there is still lack of understanding about the generalization mechanism of action recognition models. In this paper, we suggest that action recognition models rely on the motion information less than expected, and thus they are robust to randomization of frame orders. Furthermore, we find that motion monotonicity remaining after randomization also contributes to such robustness. Based on this observation, we develop a novel defense method using temporal shuffling of input videos against adversarial attacks for action recognition models. Another observation enabling our defense method is that adversarial perturbations on videos are sensitive to temporal destruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a defense method without additional training for 3D CNN-based video action recognition models.},

Video action understanding is a challenging visual task because it generally necessitates not only the features of individual key frames but also the contextual understanding of the entire video and the relationships among key frames. Temporal relationships pose a challenge to video action understanding. However, existing 3D convolutional neural network approaches are limited, with a great deal of redundant spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we present a novel two-stream approach that incorporates Spatial Residual Attention and Temporal Markov (SRATM) to learn complementary features to achieve stronger video action understanding performance. Specifically, the proposed SRATM consists of spatial residual attention and temporal Markov. Firstly, the spatial residual attention network captures effective spatial feature representation. Further, the temporal Markov network enhances the model by learning the temporal relationships via conducting probabilistic logic calculation among frames in a video. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four video action datasets, namely, Something-Something-V1, Something-Something-V2, Diving48, and Mini-Kinetics, show that the proposed SRATM method achieves competitive results.},

As the basic building block of MFSN, the multi-scale feature selection block (MFSB) is presented to extract the rich multi-scale features from a coarse-to-fine receptive field level. For a better representation ability, a wide-activated residual unit is adopted in each branch of MFSB except the last one. In MFSB, the scale selection module (SSM) is designed to effectively fuse the features from two adjacent branches by adjusting receptive field sizes adaptively. Further, a comprehensive channel attention mechanism (CCAM) is integrated into SSM to learn the dynamic selection weight by considering the local and global inter-channel dependencies. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed MFSN is superior to other lightweight methods.},

  abstract     = {Balanced influence maximization aims to balance the influence maximization of multiple different entities in social networks and avoid the emergence of filter bubbles and echo chambers. Recently, an increasing number of studies have drawn attention to the study of balanced influence maximization in social networks and achieves success to some extent. However, most of them still have two major shortcomings. First, the previous works mainly focus on spreading the influence of multiple target entities to more users, ignoring the potential influence of the correlation between the target entities and other entities on information propagation in real social networks. Second, the existing methods require a large amount of diffusion sampling for influence estimation, making it difficult to apply to large social networks. To this end, we propose a Balanced Influence Maximization framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning named BIM-DRL, which consists of two core components: an entity correlation evaluation module and a balanced seed node selection module. Specifically, in the entity correlation evaluation module, an entity correlation evaluation model based on the users’ historical behavior sequences is proposed, which can accurately evaluate the impact of entity correlation on information propagation. In the balanced seed node selection module, a balanced influence maximization model based on deep reinforcement learning is designed to train the parameters in the objective function, and then a set of seed nodes that maximize the balanced influence is found. Extensive experiments on six real-life network datasets demonstrate the superiority of the BIM-DRL over state-of-the-art methods on the metrics of balanced influence spread and balanced propagation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Fine-tuning is an effective technique to enhance network performance in scenarios with limited labeled data . To achieve this, recent methods exploit the knowledge mined in the source model (e.g., feature maps) to construct an extra regularization signal (RS), collaboratively supervising the target model along with target labels. However, these RSs are generated independently from the target information or are generated from the rough assistance of the target information, resulting in biased supervision different from the target task. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Online Knowledge Transfer (COKT) framework that finely utilizes the target information to construct robust and target-related RS. Specifically, we train a target-dominant RS branch that online supervises the target model in a knowledge distillation manner. The target information dominates the RS branch from three aspects: sample-wise conditional attention, residual feature fusion , and target task loss. With such a target-oriented framework, we can effectively exploit target-related prior knowledge of the source model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COKT significantly outperforms the fine-tuning baselines, especially for dissimilar target tasks and small datasets. Moreover, different from most of the fine-tuning methods that are restricted to the vanilla fine-tuning scenario, COKT can be easily extended to cross-model and multi-model fine-tuning scenarios.},

Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) poses a significant challenge for deep neural networks to learn new tasks from just a few labeled samples without forgetting the previously learned ones. This setup can easily leads to catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems, severely affecting model performance. Studying FSCIL helps overcome deep learning model limitations on data volume and acquisition time , while improving practicality and adaptability of machine learning models. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on FSCIL. Unlike previous surveys, we aim to synthesize few-shot learning and incremental learning, focusing on introducing FSCIL from two perspectives, while reviewing over 30 theoretical research studies and more than 20 applied research studies. From the theoretical perspective, we provide a novel categorization approach that divides the field into five subcategories, including traditional machine learning methods , meta learning-based methods, feature and feature space-based methods, replay-based methods, and dynamic network structure-based methods. We also evaluate the performance of recent theoretical research on benchmark datasets of FSCIL. From the application perspective, FSCIL has achieved impressive achievements in various fields of computer vision such as image classification , object detection, and image segmentation , as well as in natural language processing and graph. We summarize the important applications. Finally, we point out potential future research directions, including applications, problem setups, and theory development.

Mixing self-information of nodes or modeling context based on pairwise dependencies between nodes are the core ideas of current advanced attention mechanisms. This paper aims to explore how to utilize both dependency context and self-context in an efficient way to facilitate attention to learn more effectively. We propose a heterogeneous context interaction (HCI) attention mechanism that infers the weights of nodes from the interactions of global dependency contexts and local self-contexts to enhance the effect of attention learning. To reduce computational complexity , global dependency contexts are modeled by aggregating number-compressed pairwise dependencies, and the interactions of heterogeneous contexts are restricted to a certain range. Based on this mechanism, we propose a heterogeneous context interaction network (HCI-Net), which uses channel heterogeneous context interaction module (CHCI) and spatial heterogeneous context interaction module (SHCI), and introduces a rigid partitioning strategy to extract important global and fine-grained features. In addition, we design a non-similarity constraint (NSC) that forces the HCI-Net to learn diverse subtle discriminative information. The experiment results on two large datasets, VeRi-776 and VehicleID, show that our proposed HCI-Net achieves the state-of-the-art performance. In particular, the mean average precision (mAP) reaches 83.8% on VeRi-776 dataset.},

However, most methods address spatiotemporal issues separately. They compromise on accuracy to reduce jitter, or require high-resolution images to deal with occlusion, preventing full consideration of temporal features. Unfortunately, these two issues are interrelated. For example, occlusion causes uncertainty between successive frames, leading to unsmoothed results. To address these issues, we propose the Masked Kinematic Continuity-aware Hierarchical Attention Network (M-HANet) as a novel framework that exploits masked kinematic keypoint features by extending our framework HANet framework. First, we randomly select and mask a keypoint to treat the masked keypoint as it is occluded, which allows us to make the network resilient to occlusion. We also use the velocity and acceleration of each individual keypoint to effectively capture temporal features. Second, the proposed hierarchical transformer encoder refines a 2D or 3D input pose derived from existing estimators by aggregating the masked continuity of the spatiotemporal dependencies of human motion . Finally, to facilitate collaborative optimization, we perform an online cross-supervision between the final pose from our decoder and the refined input pose produced by our encoder. We validate the effectiveness of our model demonstrating that our proposed approach improves PCK@0.05 by 14.1% and MPJPE by 8.7 mm compared to the existing method on a variety of tasks, including 2D and 3D pose estimation, body mesh recovery, and sparsely annotated multi-human pose estimation.},

  abstract     = {We analyze generalization performance of over-parameterized learning methods for classification, under VC-theoretical framework. Recently, practitioners in Deep Learning discovered ‘double descent’ phenomenon, when large networks can fit perfectly available training data , and at the same time, achieve good generalization for future (test) data. The current consensus view is that VC-theoretical results cannot account for good generalization performance of Deep Learning networks. In contrast, this paper shows that double descent can be explained by VC-theoretical concepts, such as VC-dimension and Structural Risk Minimization . We also present empirical results showing that double descent generalization curves can be accurately modeled using classical VC-generalization bounds. Proposed VC-theoretical analysis enables better understanding of generalization curves for data sets with different statistical characteristics, such as low vs high-dimensional data and noisy data . In addition, we analyze generalization performance of transfer learning using pre-trained Deep Learning networks.},

  abstract     = {Representation learning has been increasing its impact on the research and practice of machine learning , since it enables to learn representations that can apply to various downstream tasks efficiently. However, recent works pay little attention to the fact that real-world datasets used during the stage of representation learning are commonly contaminated by noise, which can degrade the quality of learned representations. This paper tackles the problem to learn robust representations against noise in a raw dataset. To this end, inspired by recent works on denoising and the success of the cosine-similarity-based objective functions in representation learning, we propose the denoising Cosine-Similarity (dCS) loss. The dCS loss is a modified cosine-similarity loss and incorporates a denoising property, which is supported by both our theoretical and empirical findings. To make the dCS loss implementable, we also construct the estimators of the dCS loss with statistical guarantees. Finally, we empirically show the efficiency of the dCS loss over the baseline objective functions in vision and speech domains.},

  abstract     = {Accentuation has been proposed as a general principle of perceptual organization. Here, we have developed a neurodynamic architecture to explain how accentuation affects boundary segmentation and shape perception. The model consists of bottom-up and top-down pathways. Bottom-up processing involves a set of feature maps that compute bottom-up salience of surfaces, boundaries, boundary completions, and junctions. Then, a feature-based winner-take-all network selects the most salient locations. Top-down processing includes an object-based attention stage that allows enhanced neural activity to propagate from the most salient locations to all connected locations, and a visual segmentation stage that employs inhibitory connections to segregate boundaries into distinct maps. The model was tested on a series of computer simulations showing how the position of the accent affects boundary segregation in the square-diamond and the pointing illusion. The model was also tested on a variety of texture segregation tasks, showing that its performance was comparable to that of human observers. The model suggests that there is an intermediate stage of visual processing between perceptual grouping and object recognition that helps the visual system choose between competing percepts of the ambiguous stimulus.},

The proposed DDR is based on a dual-net architecture that separates FS and dementia detection into two neural networks (namely, the operator and selector). The operator is trained on features obtained from the selector to reduce classification or regression loss. The selector is optimized to predict the operator’s performance based on automatic regularization . Results show that the approach significantly reduces feature dimensionality while identifying small feature subsets that achieve comparable or superior performance compared with the full, default feature set.

  abstract     = {Recent deterministic learning methods have achieved locally-accurate identification of unknown system dynamics . However, the locally-accurate identification means that the neural networks can only capture the local dynamics knowledge along the system trajectory . In order to capture a broader knowledge region, this article investigates the knowledge fusion problem of deterministic learning, that is, the integration of different knowledge regions along different individual trajectories. Specifically, two kinds of knowledge fusion schemes are systematically introduced: an online fusion scheme and an offline fusion scheme. The online scheme can be viewed as an extension of distributed cooperative learning control to cooperative neural identification for sampled-data systems. By designing an auxiliary information transmission strategy to enable the neural network to receive information learned from other tasks while learning its own task, it is proven that the weights of all localized RBF networks exponentially converge to their common true/ideal values. The offline scheme can be regarded as a knowledge distillation strategy, in which the fused network is obtained by offline training through the knowledge learned from all individual system trajectories via deterministic learning. A novel weight fusion algorithm with low computational complexity is proposed based on the least squares solution under subspace constraints. Simulation studies show that the proposed fusion schemes can successfully integrate the knowledge regions of different individual trajectories while maintaining the learning performance, thereby greatly expanding the knowledge region learned from deterministic learning.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Reverse Contrastive Learning (RCL), to address the problem of high-quality and diverse image generation under few-shot settings. The success of RCL benefits from a two-sided, powerful regularization . Our proposed regularization is designed based on the correlation between generated samples, which can effectively utilize the latent feature information between different levels of samples. It does not require any auxiliary information or augmentation techniques. A series of qualitative and quantitative results show that our proposed method is superior to the existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods under the few-shot setting and is still competitive under the low-shot setting, showcasing the effectiveness of RCL.

  abstract     = {The development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in recent years has resulted in an increase in the amount of data generated by connected devices, creating new opportunities to enhance the quality of service for machine learning in the IIoT through data sharing. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the most popular technique in machine learning at the moment because they can learn extremely precise node representations from graph-structured data. Due to privacy issues and legal restrictions of clients in industrial IoT , it is not permissible to directly concentrate vast real-world graph-structured datasets for training on GNNs. To resolve the aforementioned difficulties, this paper proposes a federal graph learning framework based on Bayesian inference (BI-FedGNN) that performs effectively in the presence of noisy graph structure information or missing strong relational edges. BI-FedGNN extends Bayesian Inference (BI) to the process of Federal Graph Learning (FGL), adding random samples with weights and biases to the client-side local model training process, improving the accuracy and generalization ability of FGL in the training process by rendering the graph structure data involved in GNNs training more similar to the graph structure data existing in the real world. Through extensive experimental tests, the results show that BI-FedGNN has about 0.5%–5.0% accuracy improvement over other baselines of federal graph learning. In order to expand the applicability of BI-FedGNN, experiments are carried out on heterogeneous graph datasets, and the results indicate that BI-FedGNN can also have at least 1.4% improvement in classification accuracy .},

Few-shot relation extraction is proposed as a new paradigm, which is designed to learn new relationships between entities with merely a small number of annotated instances, effectively mitigating the cost of large-scale annotation and long-tail problems. To generalize to novel classes not included in the training set, existing approaches mainly focus on tuning pre-trained language models with relation instructions and developing class prototypes based on metric learning to extract relations. However, the learned representations are extremely sensitive to discrepancies in intra-class and inter-class relationships and hard to adaptively classify the relations due to biased class features and spurious correlations , such as similar relation classes having closer inter-class prototype representation. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive class augmented prototype network with instance-level and representation-level augmented mechanisms to strengthen the representation space. Specifically, we design the adaptive class augmentation mechanism to expand the representation of classes in instance-level augmentation, and class augmented representation learning with Bernoulli perturbation context attention to enhance the representation of class features in representation-level augmentation and explore adaptive debiased contrastive learning to train the model. Experimental results have been demonstrated on FewRel and NYT-25 under various few-shot settings, and the proposed model has improved accuracy and generalization, especially for cross-domain and different hard tasks.},

However, the SR of different scales for the same image is usually regarded as independent tasks in the existing SR networks. Therefore, these networks are inflexible to effectively utilize feature learning experience and require much more computing time to recover HR images in higher resolutions. Recent arbitrary scale SR methods still cannot solve these problems. To efficiently and effectively recover HR images, this paper presents an efficient multi-scale learning method for image SR networks based on a novel self-generating (SG) mechanism. This method (briefly named SG-SR) utilizes the feature learning results of SR networks to generate upscale filters by using the novel SG upscale module, which is proposed to replace the traditional upscale module. For each scale factor, the SG upscale module provides the corresponding amount of the spatial weights to filter the LR tensor and then converts filtered tensors with the original tensor to corresponding HR images. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive experiments and compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on widely used benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our method has superior performance compared with SOTA methods, and the SG upscale module can improve the performance of existing SR networks effectively. What is more, our module has a much less calculation cost than the other upscale modules.},

We proposes a two-stage framework, Saliency Semantic Full Mining-Edge Semantic Mining (SSFM-ESM), which views WSSS from the perspective of comprehensive information mining. In the first stage, we rely on SSFM to address the insufficient saliency semantic mining. The network learns feature representations consistent with salient regions via the proposed pixel-level class-agnostic distance loss. Then, the full saliency semantic information is mined by explicitly receiving pixel-level feedback. The initial pseudo-label with complete saliency semantic information can be obtained after the first stage. In the second stage, we focus on the mining of edge semantic information through the proposed edge semantic mining module. Specifically, we guide the initial pseudo-label avoid learning about false semantic information and obtain high-confidence edge semantics. The self-correction ability of the segmentation network is also fully utilized to obtain more edge semantic information. Extensive experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets to verify the feasibility and superiority of this approach.},

  abstract     = {Vigorous research has been conducted to accumulate biological and theoretical knowledge about neurodevelopmental disorders, including molecular, neural, computational, and behavioral characteristics; however, these findings remain fragmentary and do not elucidate integrated mechanisms. An obstacle is the heterogeneity of developmental pathways causing clinical phenotypes. Additionally, in symptom formations, the primary causes and consequences of developmental learning processes are often indistinguishable. Herein, we review developmental neurorobotic experiments tackling problems related to the dynamic and complex properties of neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, we focus on neurorobotic models under predictive processing lens for the study of developmental disorders. By constructing neurorobotic models with predictive processing mechanisms of learning, perception, and action, we can simulate formations of integrated causal relationships among neurodynamical, computational, and behavioral characteristics in the robot agents while considering developmental learning processes. This framework has the potential to bind neurobiological hypotheses (excitation-inhibition imbalance and functional disconnection), computational accounts (unusual encoding of uncertainty), and clinical symptoms. Developmental neurorobotic approaches may serve as a complementary research framework for integrating fragmented knowledge and overcoming the heterogeneity of neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract     = {Complementary label learning (CLL) is an important problem that aims to reduce the cost of obtaining large-scale accurate datasets by only allowing each training sample to be equipped with labels the sample does not belong. Despite its promise, CLL remains a challenging task. Previous methods have proposed new loss functions or introduced deep learning-based models to CLL, but they mostly overlook the semantic information that may be implicit in the complementary labels. In this work, we propose a novel method, ComCo, which leverages a contrastive learning framework to assist CLL. Our method includes two key strategies: a positive selection strategy that identifies reliable positive samples and a negative selection strategy that skillfully integrates and leverages the information in the complementary labels to construct a negative set . These strategies bring ComCo closer to supervised contrastive learning. Empirically, ComCo significantly achieves better representation learning and outperforms the baseline models and the current state-of-the-art by up to 14.61% in CLL.},

  abstract     = {Currently, through proposing discontinuous control strategies with the signum function and discussing separately short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) of competitive artificial neural networks (ANNs), the fixed-time (FXT) synchronization of competitive ANNs has been explored. Note that the method of separate analysis usually leads to complicated theoretical derivation and synchronization conditions , and the signum function inevitably causes the chattering to reduce the performance of the control schemes. To try to solve these challenging problems, the FXT synchronization issue is concerned in this paper for competitive ANNs by establishing a theorem of FXT stability with switching type and developing continuous control schemes based on a kind of saturation functions. Firstly, different from the traditional method of studying separately STM and LTM of competitive ANNs, the models of STM and LTM are compressed into a high-dimensional system so as to reduce the complexity of theoretical analysis. Additionally, as an important theoretical preliminary, a FXT stability theorem with switching differential conditions is established and some high-precision estimates for the convergence time are explicitly presented by means of several special functions. To achieve FXT synchronization of the addressed competitive ANNs, a type of continuous pure power-law control scheme is developed via introducing the saturation function instead of the signum function, and some synchronization criteria are further derived by the established FXT stability theorem. These theoretical results are further illustrated lastly via a numerical example and are applied to image encryption .},

  abstract     = {The development of telecom technology not only facilitates social interactions but also inevitably provides the breeding ground for telecom fraud crimes. However, telecom fraud detection is a challenging task as fraudsters tend to commit co-fraud and disguise themselves within the mass of benign ones. Previous approaches work by unearthing differences in calling sequential patterns between independent fraudsters, but they may ignore synergic fraud patterns and oversimplify fraudulent behaviors . Fortunately, graph-like data formed by traceable telecom interaction provides opportunities for graph neural network (GNN)-based telecom fraud detection methods. Therefore, we develop a latent synergy graph (LSG) learning-based telecom fraud detector, named LSG-FD, to model both sequential and interactive fraudulent behaviors. Specifically, LSG-FD introduces (1) a multi-view LSG extractor to reconstruct synergy relationship-oriented graphs from the meta-interaction graph based on second-order proximity assumption; (2) an LSTM-based calling behavior encoder to capture the sequential patterns from the perspective of local individuals; (3) a dual-channel based graph learning module to alleviate the disassortativity issue (caused by the camouflages of fraudsters) by incorporating the dual-channel frequency filters and the learnable controller to adaptively aggregate high- and low-frequency information from their neighbors; (4) an imbalance-resistant model trainer to remedy the graph imbalance issue by developing a label-aware sampler. Experiment results on the telecom fraud dataset and another two widely used fraud datasets have verified the effectiveness of our model.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks are prone to being fooled by carefully perturbed inputs which cause an egregious misclassification . These adversarial attacks have been the focus of extensive research. Likewise, there has been an abundance of research in ways to detect and defend against them. We introduce a novel approach of detection and interpretation of adversarial attacks from a graph perspective. For an input image, we compute an associated sparse graph using the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm (Bach et al., 2015). Specifically, we only keep edges of the neural network with the highest relevance values. Three quantities are then computed from the graph which are then compared against those computed from the training set. The result of the comparison is a classification of the image as benign or adversarial. To make the comparison, two classification methods are introduced: (1) an explicit formula based on Wasserstein distance applied to the degree of node and (2) a logistic regression . Both classification methods produce strong results which lead us to believe that a graph-based interpretation of adversarial attacks is valuable.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a crucial deep learning framework for graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs suffer from the scalability limitation, which hinders their practical implementation in industrial settings. Many scalable GNNs have been proposed to address this limitation. However, they have been proven to act as low-pass graph filters, which discard the valuable middle- and high-frequency information. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network named Adaptive Filtering Graph Neural Networks (AFGNN), which can capture all frequency information on large-scale graphs. AFGNN consists of two stages. The first stage utilizes low-, middle-, and high-pass graph filters to extract comprehensive frequency information without introducing additional parameters. This computation is a one-time task and is pre-computed before training, ensuring its scalability. The second stage incorporates a node-level attention-based feature combination, enabling the generation of customized graph filters for each node, contrary to existing spectral GNNs that employ uniform graph filters for the entire graph. AFGNN is suitable for mini-batch training, and can enhance scalability and efficiently capture all frequency information from large-scale graphs. We evaluate AFGNN by comparing its ability to capture all frequency information with spectral GNNs, and its scalability with scalable GNNs. Experimental results illustrate that AFGNN surpasses both scalable GNNs and spectral GNNs, highlighting its superiority.},
