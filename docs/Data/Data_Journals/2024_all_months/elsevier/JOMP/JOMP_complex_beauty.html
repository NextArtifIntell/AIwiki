Some models assume that recognition responses are produced by a unitary process and other models assume they are a binary mixture of two qualitatively different types of responses. This note shows that despite their similar ROC predictions, the binary-mixture models make some striking predictions that the unitary models do not make. Specifically, in any experiment that includes conditions in which the mixture probability varies but the component distributions do not, the binary-mixture models predict that all response time probability density functions must intersect at the same time point (if they intersect at all). Similarly, they also all predict that if the ROC curves intersect, they must also all intersect at the same point.},

  abstract     = {In procedural knowledge space theory (PKST), a “problem space” is a formal representation of the knowledge that is needed for solving all of the problems of a certain type. The competence state of a real problem solver is a subset of the problem space which satisfies a specific condition, named the “sub-path assumption”. There could exist specific “symmetries” in a problem space that make certain parts of it “equivalent” up to those symmetries. Whenever an equivalence relation is introduced for elements in a problem space, the question almost naturally arises whether the collection of the induced equivalence classes forms, itself, a problem space. This is the main question addressed in the present article, which is restated as the problem of defining a homomorphism of one problem space into another problem space. Two types of homomorphisms are examined, which are named the “strong” and the “weak homomorphism”. The former corresponds to the usual notion of “operation preserving mapping”. The latter preserves operations in only one direction. Two algorithms are developed for testing the existence of homomorphisms between problem spaces. The notions and algorithms are illustrated in a series of three examples in which quite well-known neuro-psychological and cognitive tests are employed.},

In this work I further develop the mathematical formalization of the Inhibited Elements Model by casting it within the formalism proposed by Ghirlanda (2015, 2018). In doing so I will derive the conditions under which the Inhibited Elements Model reproduces Pearce’s model, showing that when all stimuli are assumed of the same “salience” these models coincide only when the application is restricted to compounds that either contain each other or have no common elements. Finally, the mathematical formalization developed here will be applied to the analytic comparison of the Inhibited Elements Model, Rescorla and Wagner’s model (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Wagner and Rescorla, 1972), and Pearce’s model in the context of several learning phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Self-control is core to human well-being. However, the lack of a well-specified, computationally tractable framework related to self-control makes it difficult to clarify underlying mechanisms, interpret relevant empirical phenomena, or develop interventions helpful in promoting self-control. To help address this gap, we invite consideration of the Comparison with Goal States Model (CGSM) for self-control. The CGSM amplifies activations related to available options whose representations are similar to representations of relevant goals and diminishes activations related to available options whose representations are dissimilar to representations of relevant goals. For example, influenced by healthy eating goals, the CGSM would amplify activations related to an apple and diminish activations related to a cookie, leading to an eventual preference for the apple, even though the cookie might be initially preferred. The CGSM successfully explicates observations related to reaction time in food choice, dynamics reflected in mouse-tracking trajectories, and showcases a mechanism by which hyperbolic discount curves in temporal discounting contexts might emerge. We use the CGSM to propose theoretical constraints on the nature of self-control and describe how multiple strategies have the potential to promote self-control.},

  abstract     = {Within an Ames room, the perceived size of objects, such as people, changes dynamically when the objects move about within the room. The shape of the Ames room is not actually rectangular but it is perceived to be rectangular. Unfortunately, the geometrical properties of the Ames room have often been misunderstood, and rooms that have different shapes are also referred to as “Ames rooms” in many articles. In this study, the geometrical properties of the original Ames rooms constructed by Adelbert Ames, Jr. were analyzed and the generalization of the Ames room was discussed. We found that these original Ames rooms are 3D-to-3D perspective transformations of rectangular illusory rooms. Based on this analysis, we also developed a computational model that can construct a generalized Ames room that has a hexahedral shape with some free parameters that quantitatively control (i) the size and aspect-ratio of a rectangular illusory room, (ii) the amount of distortion of the Ames room from a rectangular room, and (iii) the viewpoint of an observer. This model was implemented as a computational program so that an Ames room can be constructed in a VR space. Note that the transformations of the Ames rooms can be applied to an arbitrary 3D scene and that they can be regarded as members of a subset of 3D-to-3D perspective transformations. Any perspective transformation in this subset distorts the 3D scene in such a way that the retinal image of the distorted scene, when seen from a specific viewpoint, is identical to the retinal image of the initial scene, when seen from a specific viewpoint. These generalizations allow us to control the conditions of an Ames room systematically with more flexibility when we study this illusion.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new framework for measuring the dynamics of category learning using Coupled Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs). The key assumptions of the framework are that people maintain a latent assignment of every stimulus to a category, and that they can update the assignments for all stimuli whenever they encounter any stimulus. These assumptions contrast with many existing accounts of category learning, which either do not allow for what is learned about one stimulus to influence the category association of others, or allow only for indirect influence. The CHMM framework allows tailored models to be developed for specific category learning tasks, taking as input the stimulus sequence and category responses people make, and producing as output inferences about the underlying dynamics of category assignments and the mechanics of the response processes. We demonstrate the framework by applying it to a categorization task considered by Lee and Navarro (2002), showing how the model measures the change in participants’ latent category assignments as they learn the category structure. We conclude by discussing potential applications of the CHMM framework to category learning situations involving prior knowledge, changing category structures, and category learning tasks that involve the consideration of multiple stimuli at one time.},

The heuristic has shortcomings too, such as failing to account for individual differences and intricate choice patterns, and predicting less accurately than various model ensembles and neural networks in some environments. This note focuses on an important purported shortcoming of the heuristic, that it cannot produce valuations of gambles. I point out that the certainty equivalent of a gamble for the priority heuristic is known and suggest that this fact can be used to enhance the scope of the heuristic. Indeed, by making simple auxiliary assumptions and calculations, I demonstrate that the priority heuristic can explain the Saint Petersburg paradox and the equity premium puzzle, and to do so arguably more parsimoniously and plausibly than standard approaches.},

It is shown that the property is not an exclusive trait of Rasch type models but is also found in alternative latent trait models. It is distinguished between separability in the theoretical measurement model and empirical separability with empirical separability meaning that parameters can be estimated without reference to the other group of parameters. A new type of pairwise estimator with this property is proposed that can be used also in alternative models. Separability is considered in binary models as well as in polytomous models.},

  abstract     = {A sequence of visual or auditory events may be perceived as a single continuing sequence or as two or more separate sequences occurring in parallel. The latter percept occurs when the perceived distance between events is large, and the timing is fast, and is referred to as “streaming.” Several researchers have previously argued that streaming indicates a velocity constraint on the movement of attention. To test this hypothesis the present experiment measured tradeoffs between distance and timing for the onset or loss of streaming in a rectangular pattern of displayed lights. Two linear tradeoffs were found, one corresponding to the loss of streaming when the light pattern was slowed down, and one corresponding to the onset of streaming when the light pattern was sped up. The slopes of these linear relations are interpreted as integer multiples of the velocity of spatio-temporal attention waves. A process model postulates that participants adjust the wavelength of their spatio-temporal attentional traveling wave to match the height of the displayed rectangle. Streaming is assumed to occur when peaks in the attentional traveling wave coincide with the onsets of lights at the top and bottom of the displayed rectangle. Additional supporting evidence for temporal and spatial attention waves is reviewed. This model may be useful for understanding some forms of attentional deficits as well as expert attentional skills arising in musical performance, sports, meditation, and other tasks.},

In this article, we show how Nathoo et al.’s within-subject credible interval can be easily corrected by utilizing the theory of degrees of freedom. This correction obviates the necessity for estimates of subject-specific effects that offer shrinkage. Instead, it involves a straightforward adjustment in degrees of freedom in both the interaction mean squares and the t t -distribution used to compute the interval. Therefore, our proposed interval, being easily computable through a simple formula, eliminates the need for fully Bayesian approaches.

The most notable are Item Response Theory (IRT), Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment (CDA), and Knowledge Structure Theory (KST). In spite of their common goals, these frameworks have been developed largely independently, focusing on slightly different aspects. Yet various connections between them can be found in literature. In this contribution, Part I of a three-part work, a unified perspective is suggested that uses two primitives (structure and process) and two operations (factorization and reparametrization) to derive IRT, CDA, and KST models. A Taxonomy of models is built using a two-processes sequential approach that captures the similarities between the conditional probabilities featured in these models and separates them into a first process modeling the effects of individual ability on item mastering, and a second process representing the effects of pure chance on item solving.},

  abstract     = {Two intriguing papers of the late 1990’s and early 2000s by J. Tanaka and colleagues put forth the hypothesis that a repository of face memories can be viewed as a vector space where points in the space represent faces and each of these is surrounded by an attractor field. This hypothesis broadens the thesis of T. Valentine that face space is constituted of feature vectors in a finite dimensional vector space (e.g., Valentine, 2001). The attractor fields in the atypical part of face space are broader and stronger than those in typical face regions. This notion makes the substantiated prediction that a morphed midway face between a typical and atypical parent will be perceptually more similar to the atypical face. We propose an alternative interpretation that takes a more standard geometrical approach but also departs from the popular types of metrics assumed in almost all multidimensional scaling studies. Rather we propose a theoretical structure based on our earlier investigations of non-Euclidean and especially, Riemannian Face Manifolds (e.g., Townsend, Solomon, &amp; Spencer-Smith, 2001). We assert that this approach avoids some of the issues involved in the gradient theme by working directly with the type of metric inherently associated with the face space. Our approach emphasizes a shift towards a greater emphasis on non-Euclidean geometries, especially Riemannian manifolds, integrating these geometric concepts with processing-oriented modeling. We note that while fields like probability theory, stochastic process theory, and mathematical statistics are commonly studied in mathematical psychology, there is less focus on areas like topology, non-Euclidean geometry, and functional analysis. Therefore, both to elevate comprehension as well as to propagate the latter topics as critical for our present and future enterprises, our exposition moves forward in a highly tutorial fashion, and we embed the material in its proper historical context.},

  abstract     = {The human’s capacity to perceptually entrain to an auditory rhythm has been repeatedly modeled as a dynamical system consisting of one or more forced oscillators. However, a more recent perspective, closely related to the popular theory of Predictive Processing, treats auditory entrainment as an inference process in which the observer infers the phase, tempo, and/or metrical structure of an auditory stimulus based on event timing. Here, we propose a close relationship between these two perspectives. We show for the first time that a system performing variational Bayesian inference about the circular phase underlying a rhythmic stimulus takes the form of a forced, damped oscillator with a specific nonlinear phase response function corresponding to the internal metrical model of the underlying rhythm. This algorithm can be extended to simultaneous inference on both phase and tempo using one of two possible approximations that closely align with the two most prominent models of auditory entrainment: one yields a single oscillator with an adapting period, and the other yields a networked bank of oscillators. We conclude that an inference perspective on rhythm perception can offer similar descriptive power and flexibility to a dynamical systems perspective while also plugging into the fertile unifying framework of Bayesian Predictive Processing.},

It is also a testable implication of two models of stochastic discrete choice: the Elimination by Aspects model of Tversky (1972b) and the independent random utility model. We prove several results on the multiplicative inequality and its relationship to the regularity condition. One major result illustrates how little the MI constrains binary choice probabilities: it implies that every system of binary choice probabilities on a universe of choice objects can be extended to a complete system of choice probabilities satisfying the MI. In this sense, the MI is complementary to axioms for binary choice probabilities, of which many have been proposed. We also discuss choice environments where the multiplicative inequality is implausible.},

Multinomial processing tree models are models of categorical data in terms of a number of cognitive and guessing processes estimating the probabilities with which each process outcome occurs. The new method allows one to estimate completion times of each process along with outcome probability and thereby provides process-oriented accounts of accuracy and latency data in all domains in which multinomial processing tree models have been applied. Furthermore, the new models are implemented hierarchically so that individual differences are explicitly accounted for and do not bias the population-level estimates. The new approach overcomes a number of shortcomings of previous extensions of multinomial models to incorporate response times. We evaluate the new method’s performance via a recovery study and simulation-based calibration. The method allows one to test hypotheses about processing architecture, and it provides an extension of traditional diffusion model analyses where multinomial models have been proposed for the modeled paradigm. We illustrate these and other benefits of the new model class using five existing data sets from recognition memory.},

This derivation has some important consequences for research. First, it allows researchers who use discounting models in their studies to use the tools established within the broader time series literature to evaluate the applicability of their models. Second, it lays bare some of the implicit restrictions discounting models put on their parameters and, therefore, provides a foundation for empirical testing and validation of these models. One of these restrictions concerns the exponential shape of the discounting function that is often assumed in the affect dynamical literature. As an alternative, we briefly introduce the quasi-hyperbolic discounting function.},

  abstract     = {In classical psychophysics, the study of threshold and underlying representations is of theoretical interest, and the relevant issue of finding the stimulus intensity corresponding to a certain threshold level is an important topic. In the literature, researchers have developed various adaptive (also known as ‘up-down’) methods, including the fixed step-size and variable step-size methods, for the estimation of threshold. A common feature of this family of methods is that the stimulus to be assigned to the current trial depends upon the participant’s response in the previous trial(s), and very often a binary response format is adopted. A well-known earlier work of the variable step-size adaptive methods is the Robbins–Monro process (and its accelerated version). However, previous studies have paid little attention to other facets of response variables (in addition to the binary response variable) that could be jointly embedded into the process. This article concerns a generalization of the Robbins–Monro process by incorporating an additional response variable, such as the response time or the response confidence, into the process. We first prove the consistency of the estimator from the generalized method. We then conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to explore some finite-sample properties of the estimator from the generalized method with either the response time or the response confidence as the variable of interest, and compare its performance with the original method. The results show that the two methods (and their accelerated version) are comparable. The issue of relative efficiency is also discussed.},

The value of information matters to users of algorithms like recommender systems and prediction machines, which essentially provide information. I find that ambiguity aversion or a subjective cost of employing an algorithm will tend to decrease the value of algorithmic information, while repeated exposure to an algorithm might not always increase this value. The value of control matters to users who may delegate decision making to an algorithm.

In this tutorial, we introduce and analyze the SWIFT model (Engbert et al., 2002; Engbert et al., 2005), a dynamical modeling framework for eye-movement control in reading that was developed to explain all types of saccades observed in experiments from an activation-based approach. We provide an introduction to dynamical modeling, which explains the basic concepts of SWIFT and its statistical inference. We discuss the likelihood function of a simplified version of the SWIFT model as a key foundation for Bayesian parameter estimation (Rabe et al., 2021; Seelig et al., 2019). In posterior predictive checks, we demonstrate that the simplified model can reproduce interindividual differences via parameter variation. All computations in this tutorial are implemented in the R -Language for Statistical Computing and are made publicly available. We expect that the tutorial might be helpful for advancing dynamical models in other areas of cognitive science.},

  abstract     = {Computational cognitive modeling is an important tool for understanding the processes supporting human and animal decision-making. Choice data in decision-making tasks are inherently noisy, and separating noise from signal can improve the quality of computational modeling. Common approaches to model decision noise often assume constant levels of noise or exploration throughout learning (e.g., the ϵ ϵ -softmax policy). However, this assumption is not guaranteed to hold – for example, a subject might disengage and lapse into an inattentive phase for a series of trials in the middle of otherwise low-noise performance. Here, we introduce a new, computationally inexpensive method to dynamically estimate the levels of noise fluctuations in choice behavior, under a model assumption that the agent can transition between two discrete latent states (e.g., fully engaged and random). Using simulations, we show that modeling noise levels dynamically instead of statically can substantially improve model fit and parameter estimation, especially in the presence of long periods of noisy behavior, such as prolonged lapses of attention. We further demonstrate the empirical benefits of dynamic noise estimation at the individual and group levels by validating it on four published datasets featuring diverse populations, tasks, and models. Based on the theoretical and empirical evaluation of the method reported in the current work, we expect that dynamic noise estimation will improve modeling in many decision-making paradigms over the static noise estimation method currently used in the modeling literature, while keeping additional model complexity and assumptions minimal.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a context-dependent theory for choice under risk, called range utility theory. It builds on Parducci’s range principle from psychophysics and modifies expected utility by positing that risky prospects are evaluated relative to the range of consequences of all prospects in the decision context. When the context is fixed, choices typically exhibit the four-fold pattern of risk preferences, yet are fully consistent with expected utility (linear in probabilities) without invoking rank-principles. We illustrate this advantage in game theory contexts. As the same time, when the context varies, the relative value of an alternative also does, yielding different forms or preference reversals, some of which have been robustly documented.},
