  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new property of quantitative nonblockingness of an automaton with respect to a given cover on its set of marker states. This property quantifies the standard nonblocking property by capturing the practical requirement that every subset (i.e. cell) of marker states can be reached within a prescribed number of steps from any reachable state and following any trajectory of the system. Accordingly, we formulate a new problem of quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control, and characterize its solvability in terms of a new concept of quantitative language completability. It is proven that there exists the unique supremal quantitatively completable sublanguage of a given language, and we develop an effective algorithm to compute the supremal sublanguage. Finally, combining with the algorithm of computing the supremal controllable sublanguage, we design an algorithm to compute the maximally permissive solution to the formulated quantitatively nonblocking supervisory control problem.},

For these quantilized mean field games, we show existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium which reveals the price trajectory, as well as an approximate Nash property when the quantilized mean field game’s feedback control functions are applied to the large but finite game and the rate of convergence of the Nash deviation to zero as a function of the population size and the quantile is provided.

In contrast to previous studies, by introducing a quadratic performance index such that the regulated state can track a reference trajectory and minimize the effects of disturbances, mismatched disturbance rejection control is transformed into a linear quadratic tracking problem. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of this problem over a finite horizon and a disturbance rejection controller are derived by solving a forward–backward difference equation. In the case of an infinite horizon, a sufficient condition for the stabilization of the system is obtained under the detectable condition. Additionally, in combination with the generalized extended state observer, a controller design method is proposed, and the stability analysis of the system under this controller is presented. This paper details our novel approach to disturbance rejection. Finally, four examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Under a Bayesian framework, we formulate the top- m m selection into a stochastic dynamic program, and characterize the optimal sampling policy via Bellman equations. To determine sequential sampling decisions, we measure the expected marginal improvement from obtaining one additional simulation observation based on predictive distributions, and then develop two cheaply computational approximations to the improvement, thereby yielding two generic sampling procedures that are efficient in selecting top- m m alternative(s). The two procedures are proved to be consistent, in a sense that the best and top- m m alternatives can be correctly identified as the simulation budget goes to infinity. Numerical experiments on synthetic problems and a coronavirus transmission control application are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and generality of our procedures.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on state estimation for constant-time labeled automata in a dense time context, i.e., the time constraints of the automata can be given according to real numbers. Given a sequence of timed observations (i.e., pairs of logical observations with their time stamps) collected from a system within a finite time window, a state estimation method is proposed to find the set of states in which the system might reside by the end of the time window. By using both labeling and timing information as well as the structure of the system, we can express any finite time evolution from one state to another into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). This structural analysis is independent of all collected sequences of timed observations and can be achieved offline, although its cost is exponential with respect to the number of states in the system. Consequently, two algorithms are designed to perform state estimation under a single observation and no observation, respectively, by solving a finite number of CSPs generated according to the system’s structural information. Both algorithms can be jointly used in an iterative approach to perform state estimation for any sequence of timed observations. In such a case, the number of generated CSPs in the algorithms increases linearly with respect to the length of the observed sequence.},

This theorem completely removes the assumption in these references that the differential operator of the Lyapunov function must be strictly negative, and reveals a positive role of the stochastic noise in stochastic fixed-time stability.

When making decisions, each agent only has access to a noisy gradient of its own objective function in the previous time and can only communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying digraph. To handle this problem, an online distributed stochastic projection-free algorithm is proposed. Of particular interest is that the dynamic regrets are employed to measure the performance of the online algorithm. Existing works on online distributed algorithms involving stochastic gradients only provide the sublinearity results of regrets in expectation. Different from them, we study the high probability bounds of dynamic regrets, i.e., the sublinear bounds of dynamic regrets are characterized by the natural logarithm of the failure probability’s inverse. Under mild assumptions on the graph and objective functions, we prove that if the variations in both the objective function sequence and its gradient sequence grow within a certain rate, then the high probability bounds of the dynamic regrets grow sublinearly. Finally, a simulation example is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

This paper addresses the boundary stabilization problem for mixed traffic on freeways. The traffic dynamics are described by uncertain coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with Markov jumping parameters, which aim to address the distinctive driving strategies between AVs and HVs. Considering that the spacing policies of AVs vary in mixed traffic, the stochastic impact area of AVs is governed by a continuous Markov chain. The interactions between HVs and AVs such as overtaking or lane changing are mainly induced by impact areas. Using backstepping design, we develop a full-state feedback boundary control law to stabilize the deterministic system (nominal system). Applying Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate that the nominal backstepping control law is able to stabilize the traffic system with Markov jumping parameters, provided the nominal parameters are sufficiently close to the stochastic ones on average. The mean-square exponential stability conditions are derived, and the results are validated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores a displacement-based formation control problem in the presence of misaligned orientations among different body coordinate frames. When agents sense and adjust their relative positions, these misalignments suggest the attitudes of the agents in the absence of an agreement, thereby distorting collective behavior. To mitigate this distortion, an angular velocity control protocol is provided and embedded into a positively invariant set, aiming to establish a predefined attitude agreement. Based on this agreement, a formation control protocol is then to achieve the desired formation shape. Unlike the original alignment case, not only the dynamics of the agents among different coordinate frames are considered, but also the connectivity on the underlying topologies is relaxed. It should be pointed out that constructing a common Lyapunov function for these systems is challenging, since typical conditions for its existence and solvability, e.g., the double stochasticity condition or the non-trivial eigenvalue assignment, may not be satisfied. To address these challenges, a geometric analysis framework, derived as several polytopes and associated properties, is extended to handle these systems without the requirement for such conditions. By utilizing these properties, the control objectives of attitude and formation control are achieved, indicating that the desired formation shape is guaranteed through the implementation procedure of the attitude consensus. Finally, an example is conducted to verify the main results.},

It has been proven that a DT-LCSS is stabilizable if and only if it is stabilizable by a periodic switching signal. However, it still needs to be determined whether the period of a stabilizing switching signal can be confined within a bound. Moreover, the existing design method for stabilizing periodic switching signals requires the diagonal entries of system matrices of all subsystems to be strictly positive. In this study, we propose a novel approach to solve this problem completely. We construct a discrete-time Markov chain for a given DT-LCSS, termed the associated Markov chain, and prove the equivalence of stability and stabilizability between the DT-LCSS and the associated Markov chain. Based on this, verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and stabilizability are derived. Especially, the period of a stabilizing switching signal for an n -dimensional DT-LCSS can always be chosen within the bound n2−n+1 . We propose a state-independent stabilizing switching signal design method for general stabilizable DT-LCSSs. We also prove the equivalence between stabilizability by state-independent switching laws and stabilizability by state-dependent switching laws. A state-dependent global stabilizing switching signal design method is also proposed. Additionally, the proposed results are applied to the consensus analysis of discrete-time leader–follower multi-agent systems with switching communication digraphs. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated by examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with approximately solving the optimal predictor-feedback control problem of multiplicative-noise systems with input delay in infinite horizon. The optimal predictor-feedback control, provided by the analytical method, is determined by Riccati–ZXL equations and is hard to obtain in the case of unknown system dynamics. We aim to propose a policy iteration (PI) algorithm for solving the optimal solution by approximate dynamic programming. For convergence analysis of the algorithm, we first develop a necessary and sufficient stabilizing condition, in the form of several new Lyapunov-type equations, which parameterizes all predictor-feedback controllers and can be seen as an important addition to Lyapunov stability theory. We then propose an iterative scheme for the Riccati–ZXL equations computations, along with convergence analysis, based on the condition. Inspired by this scheme, a data-driven online PI algorithm, convergence implied in that of the iterative scheme, is proposed for the optimal predictor-feedback control problem without full system dynamics. Finally, a numerical example is used to evaluate the proposed PI algorithm.},

In doing so, they provide conclusive affirmative answers to many analysis and design questions in systems and control. When these methods fail to produce a feasible solution, however, they often remain inconclusive due to (a) the method being conservative or (b) the fact that there may be multiple causes for infeasibility, such as ill-conditioning, solver tolerances or true infeasibility. To overcome this, we develop linear-matrix-inequality-based theorems of alternatives based upon which we can guarantee, by computing a so-called certificate of nonexistence, that no poly-quadratic Lyapunov function exists for a given linear parameter-varying system. We extend these ideas to also certify the nonexistence of controllers and observers for which the corresponding closed-loop/error dynamics admit a poly-quadratic Lyapunov function.

  abstract     = {It poses technical difficulty to achieve distributed consensus tracking control with input quantizations and deception attacks for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to mismatched parametric uncertainties via backstepping design. The underlying problem becomes even more complicated because i ) the system contains mismatched uncertainties; ii ) the output becomes unavailable after attacks, making the conventional recursive control design strategy using traditional error surfaces unsuitable; iii ) since only the compromised output signal is available, the impacts of nonlinear items related to unknown attack weights become difficult to be explicitly addressed in the existing available output feedback control results. In this paper, we present a solution to circumvent these obstacles by constructing a set of new K-filters using compromised output only, which, together with a coordinate transformation involving the attacked output and filter variables, allow a new form of backstepping based distributed resilient adaptive control protocol to be developed. Meanwhile, an extra compensation term is incorporated into the real controller to handle the effect of quantization on the system stability. It is shown that, with proper choices of Lyapunov functions, the global uniform boundedness of all the closed-loop signals and the asymptotically output consensus tracking can be achieved.

For example, there are no general nonconservative identifiability results, nor provably correct data efficient methods. In this paper, we consider a special case of periodically missing output samples, where all but one output sample per period may be missing. The novel idea is to use a lifting operation that converts the original problem with missing data into an equivalent standard identification problem. The key step is the inverse transformation from the lifted to the original system, which requires computation of a matrix root. The well-posedness of the inverse transformation depends on the eigenvalues of the system. Under an assumption on the eigenvalues, which is not verifiable from the data, and a persistency of excitation-type assumption on the data, the method based on lifting recovers the data-generating system.},

This result thus characterizes sampled observability with arbitrary sampling times.

This has a relevant practical impact, since solvers for SOCP problems are quite efficient and allow solving large instances within tenths of a second. We performed many numerical tests, and in all of them the relaxation turned out to be exact.

By utilizing this NE estimator to formulate an intermediate control law, the NE seeking problem is then effectively transformed into a local reference-tracking problem. To deal with the non-differentiability issue caused by the NE estimator and ensure the exact tracking, the dynamic gain technique and novel scaling functions are employed to derive a prescribed-time tracking controller which completely compensates for the mismatched uncertainties while reducing the computational burden. The proposed control framework enables the actions of all agents to reach the NE within a prescribed time. In addition, the obtained results are further re-designed to exhibit the robustness by introducing an improved σ σ -modification scheme without sacrificing the convergence performance.

The main challenging issue is to design the effective extended state observer (ESO)/disturbance observer (DO) for KdVB equation respectively. As for ADRC strategy, the disturbance is rejected on the basis of an ESO. As for DOBC strategy, a DO is constructed to estimate the disturbance formulated by an exogenous system. Continuous-time and event-triggered anti-disturbance controllers are further presented for distributed stabilization of KdVB system. To significantly reduce the amount of control updates, an event-triggering mechanism is utilized and the Zeno behaviour is avoided. Sufficient stability conditions are established via Lyapunov functional method. The effectiveness of proposed approaches is verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Given a set of full-rank matrices A 1 , A 2 , … , A r ∈ R p × n A1,A2,…,Ar∈Rp×n , this brief paper proposes a method based on linear feasibility tests to determine whether a convex combination A ( α ) = ∑ i = 1 r α i A i A(α)=∑i=1rαiAi , with α = [ α 1 α 2 ⋯ α r ] T α=[α1α2⋯αr]T in the unit simplex Λ r Λr , may result in a rank-deficient matrix. The method is based on a sequence of linear programs with increasingly tightened constraints, and is guaranteed to reach an outcome after a finite number of iterations. Given a tolerance ɛ ɛ &gt; 0 ɛ&amp;gt;0 arbitrarily chosen by the user, the method will either (i) certify that ∄ α ∈ Λ r ∄α∈Λr such that A ( α ) A(α) is rank-deficient or (ii) yield α ∈ Λ r α∈Λr , v ≠ 0 v≠0 such that ɛ ‖ A ( α ) v ‖ / ‖ v ‖ &lt; ɛ ‖A(α)v‖/‖v‖&amp;lt;ɛ , which certifies that the smallest singular value of A ( α ) A(α) is less than ɛ ɛ ɛ . This method bridges a gap in the literature, as no other numerically verifiable test for generic p p , n n , r r has been proposed to reach the conclusion (ii). Three numerical examples are provided to showcase the advantages of the proposed method with respect to other tests reported in previous papers.

Then the lifting approach is successfully applied to the Friedkin–Johnsen model to deal with the influence of the negative weights while the path-dependence theory is used to the transition of two arbitrarily adjacent topics. Starting from the weight topology, the relationship between the weight topology and the augmented topology is established, and some sufficient conditions about achieving neutrality, bipartite consensus and convergence for the individuals’ opinions in a sequence of topics are obtained. Interestingly, a necessary and sufficient condition is given to ensure bipartite consensus for the individuals’ opinions under the premise that the weight topology is structurally unbalanced. Furthermore, the Friedkin–Johnsen model with dynamic stubbornness is also considered, and the concept of common topic subsequence is introduced. It is proved that all elements of the topic transfer matrix are positive for the common topic subsequence, and neutrality and bipartite consensus for the individuals’ opinions can be achieved for different types of weight topologies, respectively. Finally, numerical examples are given to support the correctness of the theoretical results.},

In addition, we present a unified framework for flooding, tailored to accommodate networks with arbitrarily limited communication bandwidth. By applying these methods to average local posteriors, we derive consensus-based and flooding-based distributed state estimators.

Moreover, a class of heterogeneous-to-homogeneous transformation methods is introduced, together with presenting feasible gain design conditions, for DLC. It is shown that with the designed DLC law, not only can the effect of the agents’ heterogeneous dynamics in performing DLC be well overcome, but also the BIBU stability and the robust cooperative output tracking of agents can be simultaneously accomplished.

In addition, conditions under which an interpolant retains the underlying port-Hamiltonian structure of the system generating the data are given by requiring a particular structure of the generalized observability matrix. Ipso facto a characterization of the reduced order model in terms of Dirac structure with the aim of relating the Dirac structure of the underlying port-Hamiltonian system with the Dirac structure of the constructed interpolant is given. This result, in turn, is used to solve the model reduction problem in the Loewner framework for network systems described by a weighted graph. The problem is first solved, for a given clustering, by giving conditions on the right- and left-tangential interpolation data that yield an interpolant possessing a network structure. Thereafter, for given tangential data obtained by sampling an underlying network system, we give conditions under which we can select a clustering and construct a reduced model preserving the network structure.

In addition, the decision of each player is restricted by private and coupling constraints. To address these concerns, a distributed generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking algorithm is proposed. Two features distinguish our methods from the existing GNE seeking algorithms. Firstly, an adaptive penalty method is introduced to drive each player’s action to enter the set of private constraints. The adaptive term ensures automatic adjustment of penalty parameter based on the degree of constraint violation excluding any prior calculation. Secondly, a distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed for each player to lessen communication energy. In comparison to the static event-triggered mechanism, the proposed dynamic mechanism possesses larger inter-execution time intervals. As the discontinuity of the event-triggered mechanism can impact the existence of a solution to the closed-loop system in the classical sense, we adapt a nonsmooth analysis technique, including differential inclusion and Filippov solution. Through nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis, the convergence result and the avoidance of Zeno behavior are established. Finally, two engineering examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.},

A novel robust model predictive mean-field control method is proposed to significantly improve the control performance and the algorithm scalability with the population size. To that end, a top-down control philosophy is first employed, under which the physical space is divided into finite disjoint bins and the actual density distribution (ADD) over these bins is taken as the macrostate. The system dynamics of ADD is then established by including a stochastic disturbance in the mean-field model, which describes the evolution process of each agent’s probability density distribution over the bins. Next, an optimization-based model predictive control method is developed to efficiently overcome the performance degradation raised by the disturbance term. Furthermore, the conditions ensuring the algorithm feasibility are strictly developed. We also prove that the actual swarm density converges to the target one in probability.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study distributed constrained online convex optimization (OCO) problem in a system consisting of a parameter server and n n clients. Each client is associated with a local constraint function and time-varying local loss functions, which are disclosed sequentially. The clients seek to minimize the accumulated total loss subject to the total constraint by choosing sequential decisions based on causal information of the loss functions. Existing distributed constrained OCO algorithms require clients to send their raw decisions to the server, leading to large communication overhead unaffordable in many applications. To reduce the communication cost, we devise an adaptive quantization method, where the center and the radius of the quantizer are adjusted in an adaptive manner as the OCO algorithm progresses. We first examine the scenario of full information feedback, where the complete information of the loss functions is revealed at each time. We propose a distributed online saddle point algorithm with adaptive quantization, which can reduce the communication overhead considerably. The performance of this algorithm is analyzed, and an O ( T ) O(T) regret bound and an O ( T 3 4 ) O(T34) constraint violation bound are established, which are the same as (in order sense) those for existing algorithm transmitting raw decisions without quantization. We further extend the adaptive quantization method to the scenario of bandit feedback, where only the values of the local loss functions at two points are revealed at each time. A bandit OCO algorithm with adaptive quantization is developed and is shown to possess the same (in order sense) regret and constraint violation bounds as in the full information feedback case. Finally, numerical results on distributed online rate control problem are presented to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, exponential stability of discrete-time Markov jump linear systems (MJLSs) with the Markov chain on a Borel space ( Θ , B ( Θ ) ) (Θ,B(Θ)) is studied, and bounded real lemmas (BRLs) are given. The work generalizes the results from the previous literature that considered only the Markov chain taking values in a countable set to the scenario of an uncountable set and provides unified approaches for describing exponential stability and H ∞ H∞ performance of MJLSs. This paper covers two kinds of exponential stabilities: one is exponential mean-square stability with conditioning (EMSSy-C), and the other is exponential mean-square stability (EMSSy). First, based on the infinite-dimensional operator theory, the equivalent conditions for determining these two kinds of stabilities are shown respectively by the exponentially stable evolutions generated by the corresponding bounded linear operators on different Banach spaces, which turn out to present the spectral criteria of EMSSy-C and EMSSy. Furthermore, the relationship between these two kinds of stabilities is discussed. Moreover, some easier-to-check criteria are established for EMSSy-C of MJLSs in terms of the existence of uniformly positive definite solutions of Lyapunov-type equations or inequalities. In addition, BRLs are given separately in terms of the existence of solutions of the Θ Θ -coupled difference Riccati equation for the finite horizon case and algebraic Riccati equation for the infinite horizon case, which facilitates the H ∞ H∞ analysis of MJLSs with the Markov chain on a Borel space.},

An identification method is proposed, which is a variation of the ”FORCEVIB” method. The method utilizes analytic signal representation and the properties of the Hilbert transform to obtain an analytic relationship between a system’s natural frequency and damping coefficient to its response and excitation signals. The proposed method is validated by comparing the identification results to the asymptotic solution of a simple system with response-dependent inertia and is then demonstrated, numerically and experimentally, for other more complicated nonlinear systems.},

We propose state feedback and switching control laws to deal with these restrictions. The main objectives of the work are twofold: (i) to design control laws that ensure stability and guaranteed cost bounds under constraints, and (ii) to determine an estimation of the domain of attraction (DOA), as large as possible, characterized by a polyhedral and an ellipsoidal invariant region contained in the space defined by the state constraints. We adopt a convex optimization procedure based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to address these objectives. An original approach employing Lyapunov sets is proposed to deal with control energy and state constraints, and positive system properties are used to estimate the DOA in only one orthant of state space. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Lyapunov-based approach, showing its ability to handle complex constraints and large networks.},

Linear time-invariant (LTI) or single-rate distributed output feedback schemes in which, the controllers are not allowed to exchange their states with the neighbours, may fail to achieve this objective, if a certain speed of consensus is needed. To remedy this, a 2-rate scheme is proposed in this paper. The lifting technique is used to transform the design of the proposed 2-rate distributed controller into the design of an equivalent LTI or single-rate centralized controller for an equivalent LTI plant, satisfying some complex gain margin (GM) criteria. It is shown that the inherent zero-placement capability of the proposed controller can make this equivalent LTI plant minimum phase under certain conditions, which helps one attain a desired speed of the consensus response while satisfying the GM criteria. An H ∞ H∞ /loop-transfer-recovery (LTR)-based approach is used to design the proposed controller. A suitable example is considered to show the efficacy of the proposed controller over its single-rate counterpart.},

Such systems are made of small subsystems with coupled dynamics. We treat the couplings as additional disturbances and use assume-guarantee (AG) contracts to characterize these disturbance sets. For each subsystem, we design and implement a robust controller locally, subject to its own constraints and contracts. The main contribution of this paper is a method to derive the contracts via a novel parameterization and a corresponding potential function that characterizes the distance to the correct composition of controllers and contracts, where all contracts are held. We show that the potential function is convex in the contract parameters. This enables the subsystems to negotiate the contracts with the gradient information from the dual of their local synthesis optimization problems in a distributed way, facilitating compositional control synthesis that scales to large systems. We present numerical examples, including a scalability study on a system with tens of thousands of dimensions, and a simple case study on applying our method to a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem in a power system.},

A Sliding Mode Control (SMC) scheme is designed for a multi-tilt tricopter to ensure stable hovering at a desired height. Then, a modified Subspace-based system identification algorithm is devised to identify a six-by-six NI model of the inner-loop-SMC-controlled tricopter in the continuous-time domain by exploiting the Laguerre filter. A two-loop formation control scheme has been developed for networked multi-tilt tricopters where the inner loop of each tricopter applies the SMC scheme, and the outer loop implements a distributed output feedback controller that satisfies the ‘mixed’ Strictly NI (SNI) + Strictly PR (SPR) system properties. Subsequently, we have established the robustness of the proposed scheme against NI/PR-type uncertainties and sudden loss of agents. The eigenvalue loci (also known as characteristic loci) technique is used instead of the Lyapunov-based approach to prove the asymptotic stability of the formation control scheme. An in-depth simulation case study was performed on a group of six inner-loop-SMC-controlled multi-tilt tricopters connected via a network to achieve a formation control mission, even in the presence of uncertainties.},

In particular, a methodology for the design of robust quantized sampled-data stabilizers updated via an event-triggered mechanism is provided for time-varying control-affine nonlinear systems affected by actuation disturbances and measurement noises. The notion of time-varying steepest descent feedback (TSDF), continuous or not, and the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) redesign methodology are used for the development of the proposed robust event-based digital controller. Under the assumption that the actuation disturbances and measurement noises are bounded with a-priori known bounds and that the amplitude of the measurement noises satisfies a certain condition related to the new added robustification term, the following result is proved: there exist a suitably fast sampling and an accurate quantization of the input/output channels such that the digital implementation of robustified TSDF controllers, updated through a proposed event-triggered mechanism, ensures semi-global practical stability of the related closed-loop system regardless of the above uncertainties. In the methodology here proposed, time-varying sampling periods and the non-uniform quantization of the input/output channels are allowed. Moreover, the theory here developed includes the analysis of the intersampling system behaviour. Possible discontinuities in the function describing the TSDF at hand are also managed. The provided results are validated through a numerical example.},

Second, we propose multi-hop communication-based resilient distributed state estimation strategies in the synchronous network and the asynchronous network with time delays, respectively. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topologies under which the regular agents can still asymptotically estimate the state vector of the system despite the existence of adversarial agents using the property of multiple-hop strong robustness.

Distributional identities for the posterior score function and information matrix of state are established. Using these identities, a fast convergent EM-gradient algorithm is proposed, extending the Lange (1995) algorithm for ML recursive state estimation. It revisits and provides an improvement to the EM-algorithm of Ramadan and Bitmead (2022). An explicit form of the information matrix is developed to provide empirical estimates of the standard errors. Sequential Monte Carlo method is used for the valuation of the score function, information and posterior covariance matrices. Some numerical examples are discussed to exemplify the main results.},

Since the assignment and guidance strategies share a unified optimization tenet in a cascaded manner, the proposed integrated cooperative method proves more efficient than the existing guidance-only methods.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the boundary control problem for a class of flexible riser control systems with input quantization and boundary position constraints is studied. Since quantization errors can adversely affect the performance of the control system, input quantization is an unavoidable issue for maintaining the high accuracy of the system. Partial differential equations are utilized to model the dynamics of the flexible riser system. Based on the partial differential equation model, a new auxiliary term is introduced to compensate for the effects of quantization, and a boundary controller is constructed using the barrier Lyapunov function, which guarantees the stability of the considered system. Moreover, the boundary position of the system satisfies its constraints. Furthermore, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an extended interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control technique to control the pressure dynamics in the fuel delivery subsystem of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The fuel cell stack is a distributed parameter model which can be modeled by partial differential equations. In this paper, the segmentation concept is used to approximate the partial differential equations model by ordinary differential equations model. Therefore, each segment is having multiple ordinary differential equations to obtain the lump-sum model of the segments. Subsequently, a generalized multi-input multi-output lumped parameters model is developed in port-Hamiltonian framework based on mass balance to minimize the modeling error. The modeling errors arise due to the difference between spatially distributed pressures in the segments, and also due to the difference between the actual stack pressure and the measured output pressure of the anode. The segments interconnection feasibility is ensured by maintaining passivity of each segment. With consideration of re-circulation and bleeding of the anode in the modeling, an extended energy-shaping and output tracking state-feedback controller is proposed to control the spatially distributed pressure dynamics in the anode. Furthermore, a sliding mode observer of high order is designed to estimate the unmeasurable pressures with known disturbances. Performance recovery of output feedback control is accomplished with explicit stability analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated by the simulation results.},

Existing work on RL has demonstrated the use of model predictive control (MPC) as a function approximator for the policy and value functions. The current paper is the first work to extend this idea to the multi-agent setting. We propose the use of a distributed MPC scheme as a function approximator, with a structure allowing for distributed learning and deployment. We then show that Q-learning updates can be performed distributively without introducing nonstationarity, by reconstructing a centralized learning update. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a numerical example.},

Different from existing work, the directions of the multiple time-varying control coefficients are subject to fault-induced sign-switching. To address this challenge, a series of high-order Lyapunov functions and differentiable functions are introduced to avoid non-integrable terms. Then, a novel contradiction statement and some Nussbaum functions are used to handle the summation of multiple unknown control coefficients with time-varying amplitudes and directions. Meanwhile, a novel distributed observer with quantized communication is introduced to track a reference trajectory with unknown dynamics. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded and the tracking errors converge to residual sets that can be made arbitrarily small.

In this work, we contribute to the development of such a theory by introducing an example water network structure with parallel pipes that is tractable for analytical treatment. We define the leak localization problem for this structure and show how many sensors and what conditions are needed for the well-posedness of the problem. We present a formula for the leak position as a function of measurements from these sensors. However, we also highlight the risk of finding false but plausible leak positions in the multiple pipes. We try to answer the questions of how and when the leaking pipe can be isolated. In particular, we show that nonlinearities in the pipes’ head loss functions are essential for the well-posedness of the isolation problem.

The vehicle does not have the capability to measure or track its position. The only information about the vehicle’s position relative to the source is given by measurements of the signal. We propose a feedback law that induces a uniform forward motion and an almost uniform rotational motion. This in turn leads to an almost circular motion of the unicycle; i.e., a motion along the boundary of a disk. An application of the divergence theorem reveals that the measurements of the signal along the boundary of the disk provide access to the gradient of an averaged signal, where the average is taken over the entire disk. Such a local average of the sensed signal can eliminate undesired local extrema, which in turn is beneficial for the goal of reaching a global extremum. We prove practical asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system with respect to extrema of the averaged signal. Our theoretical analysis takes L ∞ L∞ -measurement errors of the signal into account. We compare the performance of the proposed control law to another source seeking method in the presence of local extrema through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {To fit with a digital environment in networked control systems, sampled-data event-triggered control (ETC) has been proposed where the event-triggering mechanisms sense and process information only at discrete sampling instants (not necessarily periodically). One deficiency in the previous study on sampled-data ETC is the lack of analysis on transmission performance, which yields the potential occurrence of an undesirable phenomenon that the minimum inter-event time is always equal to the minimum inter-sampling interval, no matter how small the latter is. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose a novel sampled-data ETC scheme such that the lower bounds of inter-event times have sampling-independent positive guarantees. A linear networked control system is considered under observer-based controllers, external disturbances, and multiple communication channels. The improved transmission performance is due to the utilization of dynamic event-triggering conditions and some mean-rate error signals, which are the ratios between network-induced errors and some time-increasing functions. After modeling the closed-loop dynamics into a hybrid system, sufficient conditions on the upper bound of inter-sampling intervals and parameters in ETC are provided to ensure input-to-state stability (rather than its practical version) and sampling-independent positive guarantees simultaneously. Furthermore, a new tradeoff relationship between the sampling and transmission performance is revealed: a faster sampling frequency is conducive to improving inter-event times. Finally, a linearized model of an inverted pendulum is simulated to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the obtained results.},

Via theoretical analysis, we characterize the finite-time behavior and the equilibrium set of the model. In addition, we establish the equivalence among social balance, modulus consensus, convergence, and the non-vanishing appraisal condition. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions such that the current faction formation in social balance is changed by introducing additional opinion dimensions, i.e., by setting new agendas. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of such agenda-setting strategy and indicate that sufficiently extreme topics are required in order to successfully conduct such manipulation.},

Yet, a difficulty arises: the future scheduling parameter values are typically unavailable. In Morato et al.

In this communique , we investigate the convergence of such scheme by applying the analysis procedure originally proposed by Hespe and Werner (2021), w.r.t. the MPC from Cisneros et al.

Based on simulation results, we advocate that the Taylor-based qLPV MPC technique from Morato et al.

  abstract     = {This article studies a fundamental problem of security of cyber–physical systems (CPSs): that of detecting, almost surely, the presence of malicious components in the CPS. We assume that some of the actuators may be malicious while all sensors are honest . We introduce a novel idea of separability of state trajectories generated by CPSs in two situations: those under the nominal no-attack situation and those under the influence of an attacker. We establish its connection to the security of CPSs, particularly in detecting the presence of malicious actuators (if any) in them. As primary contributions, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the aforementioned detection in CPSs modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Moreover, we focus on the mechanism of perturbing the pre-determined control policies of the honest agents in CPSs modeled as stochastic linear systems, by injecting a certain class of random process called private excitation ; sufficient conditions for detectability and non-detectability of the presence of malicious actuators, assuming that the policies are randomized history-dependent and randomized Markovian, are established. Several technical aspects of our results are discussed extensively.},

  abstract     = {Available methods for identification of stochastic dynamical systems from input–output data generally impose restricting structural assumptions on either the noise structure in the data-generating system or the possible state probability distributions. In this paper, we introduce a novel identification method of such systems, which results in a dynamical model that is able to produce the time-varying output distribution accurately without taking restrictive assumptions on the data-generating process. The method is formulated by first deriving a novel and exact representation of a wide class of nonlinear stochastic systems in a so-called meta-state–space form, where the meta-state can be interpreted as a parameter vector of a state probability function space parameterization. As the resulting representation of the meta-state dynamics is deterministic, we can capture the stochastic system based on a deterministic model, which is highly attractive for identification. The meta-state–space representation often involves unknown and heavily nonlinear functions, hence, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based identification method capable of efficiently learning nonlinear meta-state–space models. We demonstrate that the proposed identification method can obtain models with a log-likelihood close to the theoretical limit even for highly nonlinear, highly stochastic systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the robustness of a PDE backstepping delay-compensated boundary controller for a reaction–diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) with respect to a nominal delay subject to stochastic error disturbance. The stabilization problem under consideration involves random perturbations modeled by a finite-state Markov process that further obstruct the actuation path at the controlled boundary of the infinite-dimension plant. This scenario is useful to describe several actuation failure modes in process control. Employing the recently introduced infinite-dimensional representation of the state of an actuator subject to stochastic input delay for ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations), we convert the stochastic input delay into r + 1 r+1 unidirectional advection PDEs, where r r corresponds to the number of jump states. Our stability analysis assumes full-state measurement of the spatially distributed plant’s state and relies on a hyperbolic–parabolic PDE-PDE cascade representation of the plant plus actuator dynamics. Integrating the plant and the nominal stabilizing boundary control action, all while considering probabilistic delay disturbances, we establish the proof of mean-square exponential stability as well as the well-posedness of the closed-loop system when random phenomena weaken the nominal actuator compensating effect. Our proof is based on the Lyapunov method, the theory of infinitesimal operator for stability, and C 0 C0 -semigroup theory for well-posedness. Our stability result refers to the L 2 L2 -norm of the plant state and the H 2 H2 -norm of the actuator state. Furthermore, our study presents a qualitative analysis of the maximum deviation of the stochastic disturbance relative to the nominal delay, which is expressed as a function of the severity of the plant instability, namely, the magnitude of the reactivity coefficient and the known upper bound of the transition rate of the underlying stochastic perturbations. Extensive simulation results illustrate the viability of the robustness study.},

  abstract     = {Structural symmetries of linear dynamical systems can be exploited for decoupling the dynamics and reducing the computational complexity of the controller implementation. However, in practical applications, inexact structural symmetries undermine the ability to decouple the system, resulting in the loss of any potential complexity reduction. To address this, we propose substituting an approximation with exact structural symmetries for the original system model, thereby introducing an approximation error. We focus on internal model controllers for cross-directional systems encountered in large-scale and high-speed control problems of synchrotrons or the process industry and characterise the stability, performance, and robustness properties of the resulting closed loop. While existing approaches replace the original system model with one that minimises the Frobenius norm of the approximation error, we show that this can lead to instability or poor performance. Instead, we propose approximations that are obtained from semidefinite programming problems. We show that our proposed approximations can yield stable systems even when the Frobenius norm approximation does not. The paper concludes with numerical examples and a case study of a synchrotron light source with inexact structural symmetries. Exploiting structural symmetries in large-scale and high-speed systems enables faster sampling times and the use of more advanced control techniques, even when the symmetries are approximate.},

We consider a scenario in which the sensors are maliciously attacked, rendering the traditional interval observer’s bounds ineffective for estimating the system states. By solving the linear programming problem, the maximum destructive attack sequences are generated. A distributed resilient interval observer composed of a resilient framer and a control protocol is designed, in which the construction of control protocol for each agent depends on the framer information of its own and its neighbors. It is demonstrated by the cooperativity theory and the Lyapunov stability theory that the distributed resilient interval observer can not only realize interval-valued state estimation for each agent but also drive the cooperative behavior of MASs. In addition, the observer gain matrix is selected and optimized by solving a semi-definite programming problem to provide tighter bounds for each agent. Meanwhile, the bounds of stealthy attacks are calculated. Finally, through a simulation example, the superiority of the distributed resilient interval observer and the effectiveness of the resilient interval observer-based consensus control algorithms are validated.},

We propose a cooperative strategy for the pursuers based on subgames for multiple pursuers against one evader and optimal task allocation. We introduce pursuit enclosure functions (PEFs) and propose a new enclosure region pursuit (ERP) winning approach that supports the forward analysis for the strategy synthesis in the subgames. We show that if a pursuit coalition is able to defend the region against an evader under the ERP winning, then no more than two pursuers in the coalition are necessarily needed. We also propose a steer-to-ERP approach to certify the ERP winning and synthesize the ERP winning strategy. To implement the strategy, we introduce a positional PEF and provide the necessary parameters, states, and strategies that ensure the ERP winning for both one pursuer and two pursuers against one evader. Additionally, we formulate a binary integer program using the subgame outcomes to maximize the captured evaders in the ERP winning for the pursuit task allocation. Finally, we propose a multiplayer receding-horizon strategy where the ERP winnings are checked in each horizon, the task is allocated, and the strategies of the pursuers are determined.

In this paper, we address a distributed feedback optimization framework in which agents implement a local (distributed) policy to reach a steady-state minimizing an aggregative cost function. We propose AGGREGATIVE TRACKING FEEDBACK, i.e., a novel distributed feedback optimization law in which each agent combines a closed-loop gradient flow with a consensus-based dynamic compensator reconstructing the missing global information. By using tools from system theory, we prove that AGGREGATIVE TRACKING FEEDBACK steers the network to a stationary point of an aggregative optimization problem with (possibly) nonconvex objective function.

  abstract     = {Hybrid integrator-gain systems (HIGS) are hybrid control elements used to overcome fundamental performance limitations of linear time-invariant feedback control, and have enjoyed recent successes in engineering applications such as high-precision motion systems. However, despite the relevance of digital implementations, the creation of sampled-data versions of HIGS and their formal analysis have not been addressed in the literature so far, and will form the topic of the present paper. Thereto, we present discrete-time HIGS elements, which preserve the main philosophy behind the operation of HIGS in continuous time. Moreover, stability criteria are presented that can be used to certify input-to-state stability of discrete-time and sampled-data HIGS-controlled systems based on both (i) (measured) frequency response data, and (ii) linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A comparison between these stability criteria is presented as well. A numerical case study is provided to illustrate the application of the main results.},

Roughly speaking, eventual conditional invariance encodes the property of solutions that, when they start from a given set of initial conditions, they reach a target set after a finite amount of time and remain in it for future time. The sufficient conditions for ECI presented in this paper are infinitesimal, in the sense that they need to be checked at points in the state space of the hybrid dynamical system under study, they involve its data and an appropriate choice of Lyapunov-like functions, and rely on solution properties of a continuous-time and a discrete-time scalar system. Rather than assuring finite-time attractivity plus forward invariance of the target set, as found in previous works, the proposed conditions allow the solutions to enter and leave the target set provided that they eventually settle in it after some time.

The proposed controller employs a Proportional Integral Observer (PIO) and a state predictor to accurately estimate the future state of the system with only partial state measurement. We develop sufficient conditions for system stability in tracking a reference model while only an estimation of the total delay is available. Numerical simulations and experiments on a multi-rotor platform validate the proposed controller’s effectiveness, demonstrating improved tracking performance and stability compared to existing methods. The proposed UDE-based controller, with a PIO and state predictor, is capable of handling various matched uncertainties and disturbances in MIMO systems with input constraints and partial state measurement.

Specifically, we consider an off-policy iterative RL algorithm for continuous-time systems, which uses input and state data to approximate the Nash-equilibrium of a zero-sum game. However, the data used by this algorithm are not consistent with one another, in that each of them originates from a slightly different time instant of the past, hence putting the convergence of the algorithm in question. We prove that, given that these timing inconsistencies remain below a certain threshold, the iterative off-policy RL algorithm will still converge epsilon-closely to the desired Nash policy. However, this result is conditional to a certain Lipschitz continuity and differentiability condition on the input-state data collected, which is indispensable in the presence of clock offsets. A similar result is also derived when quantization of the measured state is considered. Finally, unlike prior work, we provide a sufficiently rich data condition for the execution of the iterative RL algorithm, which can be verified a priori across all iteration indices. Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.},

Therein, the planned objective for the evader switches between pursuer escaping and target approaching. First, a distributed prescribed-time estimator is designed for the multiple pursuer ASVs to estimate the state of the evader ASV. A switching mechanism is afterwards designed between the evading and the escaping modes of the evader. Then, a prescribed-time evader-capturing control (PTECC) law is established according to the mutual dynamics of the evader and pursuers with the proposed estimator. To technically support the proposed PTECC law, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the prescribed-time capturing of the evader vessel. The theoretical challenge lies in the prescribe-time stability analysis of by the switching nature of the collective evader-capturing system. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the present PTECC law.},

Earlier works achieved the control objective for system with relative degree restricted to one or incorporated additional feasibility constraints in the optimal control problem. Here we resolve these limitations by introducing a modified stage cost function relying on a weighted sum of the tracking error derivatives. The weights need to be sufficiently large and we state explicit lower bounds. Under these assumptions we are able to prove initial and recursive feasibility of the novel funnel MPC scheme for systems with arbitrary relative degree — without requiring any terminal conditions, a sufficiently long prediction horizon or additional output constraints.},

We extend OSGA to a generic approximation function. We show that OSGA has a dynamic regret bound similar to the tightest bounds in online convex optimization with respect to the time horizon and the cumulative round optimum variation. For instances where no approximation exists or a computationally simpler implementation is desired, we design the online submodular projected gradient descent ( OSPGD ) by leveraging the Lovász extension. We obtain a regret bound that is akin to the conventional online gradient descent ( OGD ).

Two types of triggers are introduced, one for achieving intermittent communication between unmanned aerial vehicles and the other for acting on the electronic speed data transmission network of each unmanned aerial vehicle to address bandwidth limitations. Additionally, the design of all triggers takes into consideration the adverse effects of introducing the event-triggered mechanism on system performance, and all trigger mechanisms do not display Zeno phenomena. Then, to guarantee the robustness of the unmanned aerial vehicle systems, a novel performance index function that considers attack information is designed, and a distributed disturbance observer is also designed. Moreover, on account of finding the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman partial differential equation more efficiently, an intelligent learning control algorithm applying identifier-critic neural networks is proposed. Using the Lyapunov stability analysis method, the proposed disturbance-observer-based optimal cooperative control scheme can guarantee that all signals in the swarm systems are bounded and the consensus control objective is achieved.

In this work, we provide a layer-preview iterative learning controller to develop a novel learning-based control framework for layerwise processes. We utilize both the measurement data from previous layers and the gradient information from the model of the layer-to-layer process to develop the learning controller. This structure provides a hybrid approach where data and model information is efficiently used for improved controller performance. Simulation case studies on an additive manufacturing process with layerwise varying dynamics illustrate the utility of our approach under constrained inputs.},

Secondly, a class of state feedback protocols based on time-varying regulation equations are formulated to solve the cooperative output regulation problem. A key element in proving the main results is the establishment of a new stability criteria for a class of time-varying time-delay interconnected systems. The proposed protocols have several significant advantages, including the ability to achieve cooperative output regulation without requiring a prior global information of the time-varying network topology, and allowing for heterogeneous and arbitrarily large input and communication delays.

If a more general Entry Capture Problem is encountered, such control design will be rather complicated yet challenging where the performance constraints are satisfied some time after (rather than from the beginning of) system operation, rendering normally employed prescribed performance control invalid because they may be not defined in the initial interval. By introducing auxiliary functions, we develop a Self-adjustable Prescribed Performance (SPP) mechanism which can flexibly adjust the symmetric or asymmetric performance boundaries to accommodate different initial conditions, providing an effective solution for the underlying tracking problem. In this way, the resulted CEC can not only consume less communication resources but also regulate the tracking error under any initial condition into an allowable set before a given time in a bounded and customizable manner.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the multi-player stochastic differential pursuit-evasion game problem based on directed graphs. To solve the challenges posed by limited communication and ubiquitous noise, a novel Riccati equation is proposed based on the linear–quadratic exponential cost function under both complete and partial observations. The optimal strategies for pursuers and evaders are obtained based on the direct method of completing the square and Radon–Nikodym derivative, without the need to solve the complex Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation. The strategy presented in this paper is distributed and can be implemented without requiring any global information, under the constraints of a directed topology. Additionally, the proposed partial algorithm introduces an information filter to estimate partial observations. We also demonstrate that the proposed strategy constitutes a Nash equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of our strategy in both complete and partial observation scenarios.},

It is useful in applications wherein a single or multiple autonomous vehicles are to maneuver between any two points in a time bound manner. A feasible trajectory is constructed by the concatenation of two tangential circles. Additionally, we propose to also include L L LL and R R RR paths composed of internally tangent circles as a part of the feasible trajectories. In this framework, we show the existence of infinitely many such trajectories of varying lengths between any two given points. Further, the bounds on the lengths of such trajectories are discussed which illustrate the reachability of any desired length. Thereafter, we incorporate the notion of curvature boundedness into such trajectories and also determine the conditions necessary for the existence of trajectories of desired lengths. Finally, the results of this paper are illustrated using numerical simulations.},

Their goal is to maximize estimation errors without triggering anomaly detectors. Moving beyond conventional linear attacks, this study introduces a comprehensive attack model that embraces nonlinear mappings. The evaluation of stealthiness hinges on several factors: the whiteness of residuals, the detector’s detection rate, and the expectation of the detection index. Optimal attacks for both zero and nonzero detection rates are derived, incorporating various stealthiness constraints. As a general case, the optimal attack with any specified upper bound of detection rate can be designed, revealing that such attacks are predominantly nonlinear. Additionally, the paper explores the discontinuity of nonlinear mappings in these attacks, enhancing understanding of their complexity and implications.},

We consider a setting where bounded deviations of agents’ decisions from the equilibrium are possible, and uncertain constraints are inferred from data. Building upon recent advances in the so called scenario approach, we propose a randomised algorithm that returns a nominal equilibrium such that a pre-specified bound on the probability of violation for yet unseen constraints is satisfied for an entire region of admissible deviations surrounding it—thus supporting neighbourhoods of equilibria with probabilistic feasibility certificates. For the case in which the game admits a potential function, whose minimum coincides with the social welfare optimum of the population, the proposed algorithmic scheme opens the road to achieve a trade-off between the guaranteed feasibility levels of the region surrounding the nominal equilibrium, and its system-level efficiency. Detailed numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical results.},

The HiTL framework allows the human operator to regulate the MASs by broadcasting command signals to the tracking leader, with the leader’s input signal unavailable to all followers. In addition, all agents are subject to unknown inputs (UIs) in both actuator and sensor channels. To address UIs, an output transformation is introduced for each agent to decouple the system output from UIs without changing the system dimension. Then, an interval observer-based unknown input observer (UIO) is constructed to provide asymptotic state estimation and UI reconstruction. Moreover, to relieve the communication burden, static and dynamic ETC schemes are proposed to enable each agent to transmit information to its out-neighbors asynchronously only when the corresponding edge-based triggering condition is satisfied. Given the UIO and ETC strategies, the observer-based fully distributed TVF protocol is developed, fulfilling the desired TVF and excluding the Zeno behavior. Finally, the theoretical results are verified in multi-robot formation control.},

The nonlinear system is decomposed into two decoupled subsystems. By analyzing the boundedness of subsystems’ states under stealthy attacks, a sufficient condition for vulnerability is given. Furthermore, a stochastic attack is designed to destabilize the system with the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) adopted to describe the stealthiness. To ensure stealthiness, the attack’s parameters are carefully chosen such that the upper bound of the KLD is no larger than the threshold. A sufficient condition for the existence of such attack is given. Finally, a numerical example of the fixed-base inverted pendulum is illustrated to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Temporal networks are a class of time-varying networks whose topology evolves through a time-ordered sequence of static networks (known as subsystems), which find wide-ranging applications in modeling complex systems such as social networks, epidemic spreading, and brain dynamics. This paper investigates the reachability and controllability of temporal continuous-time linear networks from a generic viewpoint, where only the zero-nonzero patterns of subsystem matrices are known. It is demonstrated that the reachability and controllability of temporal networks on a single temporal sequence are generic properties with respect to the parameters of subsystem matrices and the time durations of subsystems. Explicit expressions are then given for the minimal subspace that contains the reachable set across all possible temporal sequences (called overall reachable set). It is found that verifying the structural reachability/controllability and structural overall reachability is at least as difficult as the structural target controllability verification problem of a single system, implying that finding verifiable conditions for them is hard. Graph-theoretic lower and upper bounds are provided for the generic dimensions of the reachable subspace on a single temporal sequence, and of the minimal subspace that contains the overall reachable set. These bounds extend classical concepts in structured system theory, including dynamic graph and cactus, to temporal networks, and can be calculated using graph-theoretic algorithms. Finally, applications of these results to the structural controllability of switched linear systems are discussed.},

The stochastic bias, characterized by a dynamical process with certain non-Gaussian noises, is incorporated into the system state equation. An amplify-and-forward relay is utilized in the sensor-to-filter network channel to enhance signal transmission performance. The transmission powers of the sensor and relay are governed by two sets of random variables. Particular attention is given to the design of a quadratic filter in the presence of the dynamical bias, the amplify-and-forward relay, and non-Gaussian noises. For this purpose, an augmented system is constructed by aggregating the augmented state (comprising the original state and the associated bias) and its second-order Kronecker power. Consequently, the addressed quadratic issue for the underlying non-Gaussian system is reformulated as a linear filtering problem for the augmented system. Using difference equations, the filtering error covariance is derived and subsequently minimized through the design of an appropriate gain matrix. Moreover, sufficient conditions are established to ascertain the existence of the lower and upper bounds on the filtering error covariance. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed quadratic filtering algorithm is demonstrated through a numerical example.},

Previous works provided exact solutions for rank-one SSV when the uncertainty contains repeated (real or complex) scalars and/or non-repeated complex full-block uncertainties. Our result with repeated complex full-blocks contains, as special cases, the previous results for repeated complex scalars and/or non-repeated complex full-block uncertainties. The repeated complex full-block uncertainty has recently gained attention in the context of incompressible fluid flows. Specifically, it has been used to analyze the effect of the convective nonlinearity in the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation (NSE). SSV analysis with repeated full-block uncertainty has led to an improved understanding of the underlying flow physics. We demonstrate our method on a turbulent channel flow model as an example.},

In the second phase, all agents execute a standard consensus algorithm. Rigorous analysis shows that each agent can converge to exact average consensus while protecting sensitive information of individuals against internal honest-but-curious nodes and external eavesdroppers.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a dual opinions co-evolution model based on the dual attitudes theory in social psychology, where every individual has dual opinions of an object: implicit and explicit opinions. The implicit opinions are individuals’ inner evaluations affected by the experience, while the explicit opinions are external expressions of the evaluations and are influenced by public opinion. We theoretically analyze the dynamics of coupled dual opinions in an adversarial discussion scenario, in which two opposing groups participate in the discussion. We rigorously give a method to grade the degree of individual bias. When individuals have a slight bias, dual opinions reach a consensus, showing the phenomenon of acceptance. When individuals are moderately or even extremely biased, they will exhibit the phenomenon of outward compliance, that is, their publicly explicit opinions conform to public opinion, while implicit opinions will reach a persistent disagreement and even polarization. Our investigation indicates that dual opinions may not be monotone initially but eventually converge monotonically. Besides, we analyze the influence of parameters on the co-evolutionary process and results. Numerical simulations of the dual opinions formation process produce inward and outward conformity phenomena, namely acceptance and compliance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a consistent non-Gaussian Bayesian filter for which the system state is a continuous function. The distributions of the true system states, and those of the system and observation noises, are only assumed Lebesgue integrable with no prior constraints on what function classes they fall within. This type of filter has significant merits in both theory and practice, in that it is able to ameliorate the curse of dimensionality present in the particle filter, a popular non-Gaussian Bayesian filter for which the system state is parameterized by discrete particles and corresponding weights. We first propose a new type of statistics, called the generalized logarithmic moments. Together with the power moments, they are used to form a density surrogate, parameterized as an analytic function, to approximate the true system state. The map from the parameters of the proposed density surrogate to both the power moments and the generalized logarithmic moments is proved to be a diffeomorphism, establishing the fact that there exists a unique density surrogate which satisfies both moment conditions. This diffeomorphism also allows us to use gradient methods to treat the convex optimization problem in determining the parameters. Last but not least, simulation results reveal the advantage of using both sets of moments for estimating mixtures of complicated types of functions. A robot localization simulation is also given, as an engineering application to validate the proposed filtering scheme.},

In traditional networked control system, a Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) is often used at the controller side to realize continuous feedback control. However, to use a ZOH usually decreases control accuracy since the state will be held invariably during each sampling period. In order to improve control accuracy, we introduce a model-based control strategy instead of ZOH-based one and propose two analysis frameworks for switched linear systems in network communication environment with periodic sampling mechanism (PSM) and event-triggered sampling mechanism (ETSM), respectively. A model-based dynamic switching controller is set up with certain robust performance. Asynchronous switching is taken into account since the switching time sequence of the controller is determined by the network transmission time sequence which cannot coincide with the controlled system. Under switching and control gain conditions, stability criteria of the closed-loop switched system in network communication environment are derived and verified through two simulation examples.},

Firstly, we design a nonlinear state dependent function (NSDF) which only relies on the restricted states to deal with the asymmetric state constraints. Furthermore, introducing a coordinate transformation and integrating it into each step of dynamic surface control (DSC) based backstepping method, we wholly evade the feasibility condition forced on the virtual control signals. As a result, a novel adaptive tracking control scheme is developed, which is capable of settling exogenous disturbances and deception attacks concurrently. Especially, the proposed control architecture can not only make sure that all the tracking errors converge into a pre-defined small region of the equilibrium point, but also guarantee that the total signals of the closed loop system conform to the corresponding state restrictions. Eventually, the benefits and superiority of the proposed control framework are theoretically authenticated and practically illustrated through a representative example.},

It is proved that the optimal convergence rate with one-tap memory is faster than that without memory. For the case of M-tap memory, an iterative algorithm is given to derive the control parameters to accelerate the convergence rate. Numerical examples further illustrate the theoretical results.},

Little research considers systematic methods for tuning nonlinear feedback controllers to guarantee the transient performance. This paper investigates how parameters of a backstepping controller can be determined to achieve the predefined settling time and overshoot, which are basic criteria for the transient performance. First, some modifications are made for the backstepping design method by introducing more parameters so that there are more degrees of freedom for parameter tuning. Second, the pole-placement method is used for the linear part of the closed-loop system corresponding to a backstepping controller. Third, an objective function is defined by summing the square of errors between the corresponding coefficients of the desired and real characteristic polynomials. Fourth, constraints are introduced to guarantee the negative semi-definiteness of the time derivative of the Lyapunov function. Fifth, the controller parameters can be found by minimizing the objective function. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that, compared with the existing method, the proposed method is more effective and efficient for fine tuning backstepping controllers.},

In the case of output feedback, we prove that the SGIDT property still holds for the same class of nonlinear systems if they are GAS by homogeneous output feedback.

Based on a time-varying projection, a weighted Quasi-Newton type projection (WQNP) algorithm is proposed. With some mild conditions on the weight coefficients, the algorithm is proved to be mean square and almost surely convergent, and the convergence rate can be the reciprocal of the number of observations, which is the same order as the optimal estimate under accurate measurements. Furthermore, inspired by the structure of the Cramér–Rao lower bound, an information-based identification (IBID) algorithm is constructed with an adaptive design about weight coefficients of the WQNP algorithm, where the weight coefficients are related to the parameter estimates which leads to the essential difficulty of algorithm analysis. Beyond the convergence properties, this paper demonstrates that the IBID algorithm tends asymptotically to the Cramér–Rao lower bound, and hence is asymptotically efficient. A numerical example is simulated to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

However, its success in real-world applications has been limited due to the lack of safety guarantees. To address this issue, the authors present a novel transfer learning framework that facilitates policy training in a non-dangerous environment, followed by transfer of the trained policy to the original dangerous environment. The transferred policy is theoretically proven to stabilize the original system while maintaining safety. Additionally, we propose an uncertainty learning algorithm incorporated in RL that overcomes natural data cascading and data evolution problems in RL to enhance learning accuracy. The transfer learning framework avoids trial-and-error in unsafe environments, ensuring not only after-learning safety but, more importantly, addressing the challenging problem of safe exploration during learning. Simulation results demonstrate the promise of the transfer learning framework for RL safety control on the task of vehicle lateral stability control with safety constraints.},

To further simplify the target system, the coupled PPDES is converted into its observer canonical form via a backstepping transformation. To estimate system states, an observer is constructed, which is expressed as a linear combination of three filters. To deal with unknown parameters, the swapping identifiers are given. Based on the observer and the swapping identifiers, a backstepping controller is designed to stabilize the target system.

To this end, we define new continuously differentiable variables, the so-called S-GRANE variables, that smoothly incorporate the sampled neighbor information within a sampling period. It is proven that the NE seeking problem can be restated as a regulation problem for the S-GRANE variables. Communication time-delays are also allowed with the new variables since the samples are processed after some fixed time has passed from their sampling time. Distributed control laws are then designed for the mobile robot multi-agent system dynamics based on the prescribed performance control (PPC) methodology that approximately solve the NE seeking problem by regulating the S-GRANE variables to a neighborhood of zero. Simulation results are shown that verify our theoretical analysis.},

In particular, we assume that the influence matrix varies over time, and its entries (that represent the appraisals that individuals have of the other individuals) update based on the comparison between their opinions and can take both positive and negative values. This leads to a system of two difference equations, where the first one corresponds to the standard FJ model, except that the influence matrix is no longer constant, and the second one models the dynamics of this matrix. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of this modified version of the classical FJ model is that the influence matrix becomes constant in a finite number of steps. Moreover, we provide the explicit expression for the agents’ asymptotic opinions in some special cases: the purely cooperative setting, the case of a structurally balanced network and the case of a single discussion topic. Finally, the case when the topics are correlated and the influence matrix depends on the average opinion vectors is investigated.},

The gradient-based ES in the case of single-variable and multi-variable nonlinear static maps are considered. Different from the recent literature, the time-delay method in this paper is applicable to a big family of nonlinear maps satisfying a couple of mild assumptions. By transforming the original ES system into a kind of time-delay system of neutral type, and further transforming the neutral delay differential equation into the perturbed ordinary differential equation (ODE), we provide simple inequalities that guarantee practical stability of the ES closed-loop system. With a prior knowledge about the upper bounds of the nonlinear map and its gradient and Hessian, the time-delay approach suggests a quantitative calculation on the lower bound of dither frequency and the ultimate upper bound of estimation error, which is difficult to achieve by the classical averaging method.},

In each iteration, each learner uploads its local control policy and the corresponding estimated normalized arrival time to the Cloud, which then computes the global optimum among the learners and broadcasts the optimal policy to the learners. Each learner then selects between its local control policy and that from the Cloud for next iteration. The proposed framework leverages on the derived zero-shot generalization guarantees on arrival time and safety.

In our proposal, the computation of the cost function in the Expectation–Maximization algorithm requires the computation of the joint distribution of the state and the output of the linear system given the output of the nonlinear block. These quantities are obtained from an approximation that leads to a novel Gaussian sum smoothing algorithm. Additionally, we show that our method also addresses the identification of state–space systems in which the output is produced by a known quantizer.

  abstract     = {Incipient fault detection (IFD) is important to the normal operation of modern complicated industrial systems, keeping people safe and preventing property damage. In recent years, multivariate statistical process monitoring has become one of the hottest research directions in process control and fault diagnosis. However, traditional fault detection indices in statistical process monitoring do not perform well for incipient faults, with a higher, unacceptable missed detection rate. In this work, the Bayesian inference is first utilized for probability transformation, that is, the detection statistic of one sample is converted to its probability value under faulty conditions. Here, without loss of generality, the Mahalanobis distance is employed to obtain the detection statistic, thus avoiding the subspace partition problem. Then, statistical features of obtained probability values are monitored to implement IFD. Rigorous theoretical analysis indicates that transformed probability values have a greater degree of separation than original detection statistics, so it is more efficient for IFD. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example, the continuous stirred tank reactor benchmark, and experimental tests on the Zhoushan thermal power plant process, compared with a variety of existing methods. Simulation results show that for all faults involved, the proposed strategy can not only achieve satisfying fault detection rates (nearly 100%), but also maintain the false alarm rate at a reasonable level (around 1%).},

In this setting, we first formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for when the forward optimal control problem is solvable. Next, we show that the corresponding IOC problem is identifiable. Using the conditions for existence of an optimum of the forward problem, we then formulate an estimator for the parameters in the objective function of the forward problem as the globally optimal solution to a convex optimization problem, and prove that the estimator is statistical consistent.

In this paper, we consider the case where the latter assumption does not hold, namely when distinct solutions may generate the same output, and thus be indistinguishable. The KKL transformation is no longer injective and its “left-inverse” is thus allowed to be set-valued, yielding a set-valued KKL observer. Assuming the transformation is full-rank and its preimage has constant cardinality, we show the existence of a globally defined set-valued left-inverse that is Lipschitz in the Hausdorff sense. Leveraging on recent results linking this left-inverse with the backward-indistinguishable sets , we show that the set-valued KKL observer converges in the Hausdorff sense to the backward-indistinguishable set of the system solution. When, additionally, a given output is generated by a specific number of solutions not converging to each other, we show that the designed observer asymptotically reconstructs each of those solutions.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for multiple dynamically-decoupled heterogeneous linear systems subject to both local state and input constraints and coupled non-convex constraints (e.g., collision avoidance constraints). To solve the resulting non-convex optimal control problem (OCP) at each time step, successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is a promising convexification approach. However, an algorithm that is fully distributed, computationally efficient, and recursively feasible for both local and coupled non-convex constraints remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an inner–outer layer framework that integrates three important modifications into the SCA scheme for solving each OCP. Specifically, (i) in the inner layer, we utilize a distributed dual fast gradient approach to enable the distributed execution, (ii) as for the outer layer, instead of requiring the optimal solution at each iteration by classical SCA scheme, we improve computational efficiency by relying solely on a suboptimal solution achieved through flexible termination, and (iii) an adaptive tightening strategy imposing on the convexified coupled constraints is developed which permits both the inner and outer layers to terminate in advance with the guarantee of the closed-loop non-convex coupled constraints satisfaction. Under some reasonable assumptions, convergence of the proposed inner–outer layer framework, recursive feasibility of the proposed DMPC algorithm and stability of the resulting whole closed-loop system are ensured. Simulation results on multi-agent control with non-convex coupled collision avoidance constraints and comparisons against some benchmark solutions using the centralized method are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed DMPC method.},

  abstract     = {In linear regulation theory, it is well-known that embedding in the control loop a suitable internal model of the exogenous disturbances and references permits to achieve perfect regulation of the desired variables robustly with respect to parametric uncertainties in the plant’s equations. However, it was recently proved that this principle does not extend, in general, to nonlinear systems or non-parametric perturbations. Indeed, there exist systems for which no smooth finite-dimensional regulator can exist that regulates the desired variables to zero in spite of unstructured uncertainties affecting the plant’s dynamics. This article complements such a negative result by proving that, in the canonical context of minimum-phase normal forms, a nonlinear regulator of the Luenberger type that guarantees robust asymptotic regulation with respect to unstructured uncertainties and possesses a star-shaped attractor necessarily behaves as a linear system on such an attractor. This result further strengthens the conjecture that robust regulation is essentially a linear property.},

  abstract     = {Refined instrumental variable methods have been broadly used for identification of continuous-time systems in both open and closed-loop settings. However, the theoretical properties of these methods are still yet to be fully understood when operating in closed-loop. In this paper, we address the consistency of the simplified refined instrumental variable method for continuous-time systems (SRIVC) and its closed-loop variant CLSRIVC when they are applied on data that is generated from a feedback loop. In particular, we consider feedback loops consisting of continuous-time controllers, as well as the discrete-time control case. This paper proves that the SRIVC and CLSRIVC estimators are not generically consistent when there is a continuous-time controller in the loop, and that generic consistency can be achieved when the controller is implemented in discrete-time. Numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.},

For an arbitrarily-given linear time-invariant (LTI) multiple time-delay plant, the stabilization problems of the PID controllers are solved in this paper. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of general single-input and single-output (SISO) systems and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with multiple time delays are presented by considering the argument transformation of closed-loop characteristic function and real and imaginary roots of related quasipolynomial in a sufficiently large frequency range. Based on such the conditions, analytical algorithms are then proposed to compute the complete stabilizing sets of low-order controllers. For the MIMO system with multiple time delays, firstly, MIMO systems are decomposed into several independent single loop subsystems with multiple time delays by the method of equivalent transfer function (ETF). Then, the stabilizing PID controllers for all independent single-loop subsystems are presented on the basic of the stabilizing result of the PID controller for SISO systems with multiple time delays, from which the stabilizing regions of the PID controllers for MIMO system with multiple time delays can be derived. More importantly, the results accomplished here provide a strong theoretical basic and technical guidance for the low-order controller design and tuning of the system with multiple time delays. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed algorithms.},

Based on a finite number of measurements, the proposed algorithm can be used for moving-horizon state estimation with guaranteed convergence. By using the proposed method, we show that the norm of the state estimation error is upper bounded by a sequence that converges to its steady-state in finite-time (i.e., using a finite number of measurements), provided that suitable parameters are selected. The unbiasedness properties and comparison results with the conventional (forward-in-time) moving horizon estimation are discussed.

We show that such switching signals can be generated by a deterministic Büchi automaton whose construction is given in the paper. Then, we present a methodology to design switched observers. These observers have an internal discrete state variable whose dynamics is given by the transition map of the Büchi automaton. We then present two approaches to design observer gains such that the observer is convergent for all switching signals whose occurrence rate of reconstructible sequences is higher than a tunable threshold. The first approach gives an explicit construction of the observer gains while the second one is based on linear matrix inequalities. For switched systems with invertible state matrices, we show that the proposed observer structure is universal in the sense that it is always possible to design an observer of the proposed form. We use a simple example to illustrate our methodology and then consider a case study in which we design an observer for a multicellular converter.},

  abstract     = {Set inversion and box contraction consist in finding guaranteed solutions to an equation where variables belong to bounded sets. These problems are classic in Euclidean spaces and can be solved using interval analysis. However, they quickly become complex when dealing with non-Euclidean manifolds. This paper investigates set inversion and box contraction problems when variables belong to generic Lie groups ( e.g. the set of rotation matrices SO ( 3 ) SO(3) ). The concept of Lie group boxes is introduced and discussed. The core idea is to treat Lie group subsets via interval analysis in the Euclidean space of the Lie algebra. The concept of inclusion function on a Lie group is defined as an extension of classic inclusion functions in Euclidean interval analysis. It is shown that set inversion problems on Lie groups can be solved via the Lie algebra using Euclidean interval analysis and that the solution set has a finite volume in the group. On the same principle, the box contraction problem is extended to Lie groups via a Euclidean contractor in the Lie algebra. Numerical simulations demonstrate the high interest of using Lie group boxes instead of classic Euclidean parametrization for nonlinear problems (such as the Euler angles for rotations) both in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. The proposed approach is of practical interest for state estimation and navigation in robotics since it makes it possible to solve highly nonlinear problems with a limited complexity and a high accuracy, in particular for attitude and pose estimation.},

In this paper we propose methods which use the scenario approach to solve robust optimisation problems for model based design where there is uncertainty in the model parameters. The methods draw samples (scenarios) of the uncertain model parameters and solve an optimisation problem only involving the drawn scenarios. Both a Bayesian system identification setting where the model parameters are stochastic, and a non-Bayesian system identification setting where the model parameters are treated as being deterministic are considered. The Bayesian and non-Bayesian settings require different treatment, and whereas standard scenario optimisation theory can be directly utilised in the Bayesian setting, this is not the case in the non-Bayesian setting. For that reason the model class is restricted to linear regression models with deterministic regressors in the non-Bayesian case. Algorithms are proposed for drawing samples of the parameters such that the uncertainties in the system identification models are reflected in the samples. Theoretical results are given bounding the probability that the found solution to the scenario optimisation problem will give a worse performance when applied to the true system than seen on the drawn scenarios. The methods are illustrated in simulation examples showing good performance.},

  abstract     = {Solutions to decentralized discrete-event systems problems are characterized by the way local decisions are fused to yield a global decision. A fusion rule is colloquially called an architecture . Current approaches do not provide a direct way to compare existing architectures. Determining whether an architecture is more permissive than another architecture had relied on producing examples ad hoc and on individual inspiration that puts the conditions for solvability in each architecture into some form that admits comparison. In response to these research efforts, a method based on morphisms between graphs has been extracted to yield a uniform approach to compare the permissiveness of the architectures.},

In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a feedback system to be robustly stable against various types of negative imaginary (NI) uncertainty. Uncertainty classes of marginally stable NI systems and stable strictly NI systems with restrictions on their static or instantaneous gains are considered It is shown that robust stability against the former class entails the strictly NI property, whereas the latter class entails the NI property. We also establish a non-existence result that no stable system can robustly stabilise all marginally stable NI uncertainty, thereby showing that the uncertainty class of NI systems is too large as far as robust feedback stability is concerned, thus justifying the consideration of subclasses of NI systems with constrained static or instantaneous gains.},

Our method not only handles correlated measurement noise but also can be easily extended to actuator selection or sensor-and-actuator (SaA) selection problems. Simulation shows that our sparsity-based approach performs similarly to the brute force optimal strategy while consuming significantly less computation time.

  abstract     = {Neurological disorders, such as spinal cord injuries, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, limit the functionality of neurons. A recent medical therapy, Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), aims to cure these conditions by restoring neuron functionality through axon growth for damaged neurons by manipulating the extracellular matrix (ECM), the network of macromolecules and minerals that surrounds neurons and controls their activity, thereby neurons produce tubulin proteins which elongate the axon. This process is modeled as a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which represents the behavior of the tubulin concentration along the axon, with a moving boundary governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) consisting of the dynamics of the axon length and tubulin concentration in the growth cone. This paper proposes nonlinear design methods for a state feedback control law, an observer, and an output feedback control law for a one-dimensional model of axonal elongation. First, we introduce a novel backstepping method to obtain the target system and the associated state feedback control law. Using a similar backstepping method, we design a nonlinear observer and prove the local exponential stability of the observer-error system in the spatial H 1 H1 -norm. The resulting output-feedback control law ensures the local exponential stability of the closed-loop system composed of the estimation error and the reference error states. The performance of the designed control and estimation methods is demonstrated in numerical simulation for neuron elongation by up to three orders of magnitude. Robustness to parameter changes up to 40% relative to the design/analysis model is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale dynamical systems are becoming pervasive today and the costs associated with maintenance and processing should be kept to the minimum. In multi-agent systems, whereas onboard capabilities often allow local communication, some agents need to be equipped with more expensive communication and computation devices that enable proper regulation and monitoring of the system. As such, there is an implicit combinatorial problem associated with deciding the smallest number of agents (or, more generically, state variables) that require simultaneous actuation and sensing. Due to the potential freedom or uncertainty of the weights in such a multi-agent system, we rely on structural systems theory and, in this paper, we address the problem of determining the minimum number of state variables that need to be simultaneously actuated and measured to ensure structural controllability and observability, respectively. We notice that a possible ‘separation principle’ to first find the solution to either problem and then putting them together does not necessarily hold an optimal solution. Remarkably, we show that despite the combinatorial nature of the problem, it is possible to design a solution with polynomial computational complexity, which contrasts with the non-structural version of the problem (i.e., a minimum number of a simultaneous actuator and sensor placement to guarantee controllability and observability, respectively) that it is NP-hard.},

  abstract     = {The paper considers multi-agreements that may exist in social networks that do not have connectivity across the network, and where each agent can decide on how an opinion from an influencing agent is accepted or not. The opinion dynamics considered in this paper are therefore nonlinear. Because of this nonlinearity, and because general directed graphs are considered, the first contribution is using a decomposition of the directed graph, which identifies the key influencers (with strong connectivity) and the pure followers in the graph, to partition the dynamics into two cascaded subsystems. Based on a LaSalle invariance principle and a max–min Lyapunov function, global asymptotic stability of “agreements” can then be established under very weak, nearly necessary conditions. The result generalizes a number of results for consensus networks with first-order multi-agent systems, as well as three important models, namely, stubborn extremists, stubborn positives, and stubborn neutrals. A Gaussian elimination based algorithm is introduced to simultaneously identify the key influencers and a particular basis of the left kernel space of the Laplacian matrix. To compute a special basis of the right kernel space of the Laplacian matrix, an effective algorithm is then proposed based on the Cramer’s rule. These algorithms are closely related to the prediction of final agreement values. Simulation studies complement the theoretical results, hinting toward agreement design.},

If the disturbances do not amplify along the vehicular string, then it is called string stable. However, it is usually difficult to achieve string stability with a distributed control setting, especially when a constant spacing policy is considered. This note considers the string unstable cases and studies disturbance propagation in a nonlinear vehicular platoon consisting of n + 1 n+1 vehicles where the (virtual) leading vehicle provides the reference for a constant spacing policy. Apart from the communications between consecutive vehicles, we also assume that each vehicle can receive information from r r neighbors ahead, that is, the vehicular platoon has communication range r r . Inspired by existing control protocols, a unified distributed nonlinear control law with a variable r r is proposed to facilitate the analysis. For the maximal overshoot of the inter-vehicular spacing errors, we explicitly show that the effect of disturbances, including the external disturbances acting on each vehicle and the acceleration of the leading vehicle, is scaled by O ( n r ) O(nr) for a fixed n n . This implies that disturbance propagation can be reduced by increasing communication range. Numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the main results.},

Inspired by the prescribed performance control (PPC) methodology, we propose a switching control strategy comprised of two operational units: a traditional PPC and a Safety Controller. The former enforces the output error to evolve strictly inside a user-defined performance envelope that incorporates all the desired performance characteristics. However, in the presence of input saturation this envelope can be easily violated, leading to PPC instability. On the other hand, the Safety Controller enables the safe escaping, thus avoiding the appearance of this internal instability phenomenon. We prove that the closed-loop system solution is complete and non-zeno. Furthermore, we show that the tracking error evolves inside a modified performance envelope, guaranteeing a prescribed minimum convergence rate and a controlled maximum steady-state error. Simulation studies clarify and verify the theoretical findings.},

Firstly, we equivalently transform the least squares (LS) problem of A X B = F AXB=F into two subproblems. We introduce a double-layered multi-agent network, in which each agent only has access to partial information of matrices A A , B B and F F , to solve these two subproblems in a distributed structure. Subsequently, we develop continuous-time and discrete-time distributed algorithms to obtain an LS solution of A X B = F AXB=F . In particular, the sufficient and necessary conditions about the step-sizes are established, under which the discrete-time algorithm can linearly converge to an LS solution. Compared with the previous results in which each agent needs to communicate multiple matrix variables with the neighbors, the proposed algorithms effectively reduce communication burden for each agent since only one matrix variable is communicated in the upper-layer network and the communication variables in the lower-layered network are vectors with lower dimensions than matrices. Finally, an application example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Passivity property gives a sense of energy balance. The classical definitions and theorems of passivity in dynamical systems require time invariance and locally Lipschitz functions. However, these conditions are not met in many systems. Characteristic examples are nonautonomous and discontinuous systems due to the presence of Coulomb friction. This paper presents an extended result for the negative feedback connection of two passive nonautonomous systems with set-valued right-hand side based on an invariance-like principle. Such extension is the base of a structural passivity-based control synthesis for underactuated mechanical systems with Coulomb friction. The first step consists of designing the control able to restore the passivity in the considered friction law, achieving stabilization of the system trajectories to a domain with zero velocities. Then, an integral action is included to improve the latter result and perform a tracking over a constant reference (regulation). Finally, the control is designed considering dynamics in the actuation. These control objectives are obtained using fewer control inputs than degrees of freedom, as a result of the underactuated nature of the plant. The presented control strategy is implemented in an earthquake prevention scenario, where a mature seismogenic fault represents the considered frictional underactuated mechanical system. Simulations are performed to show how the seismic energy can be slowly dissipated by tracking a slow reference, thanks to fluid injection far from the fault, accounting also for the slow dynamics of the fluid’s diffusion.},

A novel approach to measurement-based, dissipative feedback design is introduced, and extends the applicability of switching techniques with respect to previously proposed ones, as it does not need stringent invariance assumptions, while it still avoids undesired chattering or Zeno effects by modulating the control intensity. When the switching dynamics do leave the target invariant, on the other hand, we show that exponential convergence to the target can be enforced without modulation, and switching times that can be either fixed or stochastic with hysteresis to avoid chattering. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated via numerical simulations of simple yet paradigmatic examples, demonstrating how switching strategies converge faster than open-loop engineered dissipation.},

The proposed method does not require any prior knowledge of the high-frequency gain represented by k p kp , thereby completely eliminating the common design condition in the traditional discrete-time MRAC framework: the sign of k p kp is known, as well as an upper bound on | k p | |kp| . Specifically, an output feedback adaptive control law is developed, which incorporates a time-varying gain function to effectively address the singularity issue. The developed adaptive control law leads to the derivation of a linear estimation error equation for the closed-loop system. Consequently, a gradient algorithm based parameter update law is directly formulated by utilizing the estimation error and some other available signals without requiring any prior knowledge of k p kp . In comparison to the traditional MRAC and Nussbaum function-based methods, it does not necessitate any additional design conditions or involve any transient performance issues, while still ensuring closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking for any given bounded reference signal. The simulation study showcases the design procedure and evaluates the efficacy of the proposed control method.},

This problem is practically relevant for systems whose model cannot be identified reliably prior to diagnosing possible faults, for instance when operating conditions change over time, when a fault is already present before system identification is carried out, or when the system dynamics change due to the presence of the fault. A computationally attractive solution is proposed by solving the problem using unconstrained convex optimization, where the objective function consists of three terms of which two are non-differentiable.

In contrast to prior work on this problem, where the CAV “selfishly” only seeks to minimize its maneuver time, we seek to ensure that the fast-lane traffic flow is minimally disrupted (through a properly defined metric). Additionally, when performing lane-changing maneuvers, we optimally select the cooperating vehicles from a set of feasible neighboring vehicles and experimentally show that the highway throughput is improved compared to the baseline case of human-driven vehicles changing lanes with no cooperation. When feasible solutions do not exist for a given maximal allowable disruption, we include a time relaxation method trading off a longer maneuver time with reduced disruption. Our analysis is also extended to multiple sequential maneuvers. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our controllers in terms of safety guarantees and up to 16% and 90% average throughput and maneuver time improvement respectively when compared to maneuvers with no vehicle cooperation.},

Our novel idea lies in the design of multiple GQN updates, which only involves computing Hessian-vector products, to control the Hessian approximation error, and a simple mechanism to adjust stepsizes to ensure the objective function improvement per iterate. Then, we extend it to the master–worker framework and propose a distributed adaptive GQN method whose communication cost is comparable with that of first-order methods, yet it retains the superb convergence property of its centralized counterpart.

For certain types of parametric forcing, a geometric method is developed that overlays scaled versions of the stability maps for individual normal modes. A simple measure for the stabilizability of the system is proposed involving ratios of eigenvalues of the system, referred to as the scaling ratio. This method is applied to the analysis of vibrational stabilization of the multi-link linearized Kapitza pendulum, an inverted pendulum consisting of multiple links driven by vertical base motion. The use of the scaling ratio helps determine the range of parametric forcing parameters for which it can be vibrationally stabilized, as well as how the pendulum’s inertial and geometric parameters affect this range.},

By improving existing energy and observability estimates for parabolic equations, we obtain both upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate of the eigenvalues of the Gramian operator towards zero. Both bounds follow the same polynomial decay rate, up to a multiplicative constant, which ensures their optimality. This confirms the slow decay of the eigenvalues and limits the efficiency of model reduction. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical results.},

In this paper, the sample efficiency problem is tackled by formally incorporating the entropy regularization into the distributed MARL algorithm design. Firstly, a new entropy-regularized MARL problem is formulated under the model of networked multi-agent Markov decision processes with observation-based policies and homogeneous agents, where the policy parameter sharing among the agents provably preserves the optimality. Secondly, an on-policy distributed actor–critic algorithm is proposed, where each agent shares its parameters of both the critic and actor for consensus update. Then, the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided based on the stochastic approximation theory under the assumption of linear function approximation of the critic. Furthermore, a practical off-policy version of the proposed algorithm is developed which possesses scalability, data efficiency and learning stability. Finally, the proposed distributed algorithm is compared against the solid baselines including two classic centralized training algorithms in the multi-agent particle environment, whose learning performance is empirically demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a supervisory unit, called the stability governor (SG), that provides improved guarantees of stability for constrained linear systems under Model Predictive Control (MPC) without terminal constraints. At each time step, the SG alters the setpoint command supplied to the MPC problem so that the current state is guaranteed to be inside of the region of attraction for an auxiliary equilibrium point. The proposed strategy is shown to be recursively feasible and asymptotically stabilizing for all initial states sufficiently close to any equilibrium of the system. Thus, asymptotic stability of the target equilibrium can be guaranteed for a large set of initial states even when a short prediction horizon is used. A numerical example demonstrates that the stability governed MPC strategy can recover closed-loop stability in a scenario where a standard MPC implementation without terminal constraints leads to divergent trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Unlike ODEs, whose models involve system matrices and whose controllers involve vector or matrix gains, PDE models involve functions in those roles—functional coefficients, dependent on the spatial variables, and gain functions dependent on space as well. The designs of gains for controllers and observers for PDEs, such as PDE backstepping, are mappings of system model functions into gain functions. These infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators are given in an implicit form through PDEs, in spatial variables, which need to be solved to determine the gain function for each new functional coefficient of the PDE. The need for solving such PDEs can be eliminated by learning and approximating the design mapping in the form of a neural operator. Learning the neural operator requires a sufficient number of prior solutions for the design PDEs, offline, as well as the training of the operator. In recent work, we developed the neural operators for PDE backstepping designs for first-order hyperbolic PDEs. Here we extend this framework to the more complex class of parabolic PDEs. The key theoretical question is whether the controllers are still stabilizing, and whether the observers are still convergent, if they employ the approximate functional gains generated by the neural operator. We provide affirmative answers to these questions, namely, we prove stability in closed loop under gains produced by neural operators. We illustrate the theoretical results with numerical tests and publish our code on Github( https://github.com/lukebhan/NeuralOperatorsForAdvectionDiffusionControl ). The neural operators are three orders of magnitude faster in generating gain functions than PDE solvers for such gain functions. This opens up the opportunity for the use of this neural operator methodology in adaptive control and in gain scheduling control for nonlinear PDEs.},

This includes applications in motion control, networked control, resource-aware control, and event-based control. Some of these applications, like the ones where displacement is tracked using incremental encoders, are driven by signals that are only measured when their values cross fixed thresholds in the amplitude domain. This paper introduces a non-parametric estimator of the impulse response and transfer function of continuous-time systems based on such amplitude-equidistant sampling strategy, known as Lebesgue sampling. To this end, kernel methods are developed to formulate an algorithm that adequately takes into account the bounded output uncertainty between the event timestamps, which ultimately leads to more accurate models and more efficient output sampling compared to the equidistantly-sampled kernel-based approach. The efficacy of our proposed method is demonstrated through a mass–spring damper example with encoder measurements and extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies on system benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {We propose a data-driven robust iterative learning control (ILC) technique to multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) linear systems. Control of MIMO linear systems, particularly with strong cross-axis coupling, is challenging as modeling of a MIMO system can be complicated, time-consuming, and often requires a trade-off between robustness and performance. As such, limitations exist in current ILC techniques. The aim of this paper is to develop an efficient and easy-to-use data-driven ILC technique to output tracking of MIMO linear systems under random disturbance. Through the proposed technique, the complicated modeling process and the robustness-accuracy trade-off are avoided, and the up-to-now system dynamics is captured by constructing and updating the iteration gain using the input and output data in the last iteration. It is shown that monotonic convergence of the ILC algorithm is guaranteed, and an optimal gain can be obtained to maximize the convergence rate and minimize the residual tracking error. The proposed technique is illustrated through experiments on a three-input three-output piezoelectric actuator system, with comparison to the adaptive multi-axis inversion-based iterative control (A-MAIIC) technique. The experimental results show rapid convergence and improved formance of the proposed technique when the cross-axis coupling is strong.},

The communication graph of the agents is defined on a mesh-grid 2-D cylindrical surface. We model the agents’ collective dynamics by a complex- and a real-valued reaction–advection–diffusion 2-D partial differential equations (PDEs) whose states represent the 3-D position coordinates of the agents. The leader agents on the boundary suffer unknown actuator delay due to the cumulative computation and information transmission time. We design a delay-adaptive controller for the 2-D PDE by using PDE backstepping combined with a Lyapunov functional method, where the latter is employed to design an update law that generates real-time estimates of the unknown delay. Capitalizing on our recent result on the control of 1-D parabolic PDEs with unknown input delay, we use Fourier series expansion to bridge the control of 1-D PDEs to that of 2-D PDEs. To design the update law for the 2-D system, a new target system is defined to establish the closed-loop local boundedness of the system trajectories in H 2 H2 norm and the regulation of the states to zero assuming a measurement of the spatially distributed plant’s state.

In some applications, however, real-time information is critical for the purpose of system analysis. To this end, in this paper, we investigate the verification of detectability for timed DESs modeled by partially-observed timed automata. Three notions of detectability, strong detectability, weak detectability and delayed detectability, are studied in a dense-time setting, which characterizes detectability by time elapsing rather than event updating steps. We show that verifying strong detectability and delayed detectability for partially-observed timed automata is decidable by providing verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions. Furthermore, we show that weak detectability is undecidable in the timed setting by reducing the language universality problem for timed automata to the verification problem of weak detectability. Our results extend the detectability analysis of DESs from the untimed setting to a timed setting.},

Such systems are widely used to describe cyber–physical systems which arise by combining physical systems with digital components. In many real-world applications, the internal states cannot be observed directly. It is thus more realistic to conduct system analysis using the outputs of the system. Stability is one of the most frequent requirement for safety and robustness of cyber–physical systems. Existing methods for analyzing stability of switched linear systems often require the knowledge of the parameters and/or all the states of the underlying system. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for deciding stability of switched linear systems under arbitrary switching based purely on observed output data. The proposed algorithm essentially relies on an output-based Lyapunov stability framework and returns an estimate of the joint spectral radius (JSR). We also prove a probably approximately correct error bound on the quality of the estimate of the JSR from the perspective of statistical learning theory.},

Perhaps of independent interest, we formulate and analyze the stability of such data-driven models in the presence of noise. The Youla-Kučera approach requires a stable “parameter” for controller design. For the training of reinforcement learning agents, the set of all stable linear operators is given explicitly through a matrix factorization approach.

The importance of a subsystem refers to the quantitative impact of its information on the correctness or accuracy of decision-making for the entire system. Here, the importance of a subsystem is positively correlated with the power allocated to transmit local information. Additionally, it is assumed that the attacker has access to the transmission power of all subsystems. The optimal attack strategies are then investigated under different subsystem-importance weight functions and the error functions that are related to the packet arrival rate, and the closed-form solutions under some special cases are provided. Furthermore, potential defense strategies are investigated, leveraging the gap in the interpretation of the subsystem importance between the attacker and the defender, formulated as a Stackelberg game.

In this brief paper, we develop a new technique to achieve multiconsensus among agents described by second-order dynamics. To do this, we introduce a communication protocol where interactions between agents are directed and weighted. Our approach consists of two steps. First, the weights of the interaction network are assigned so that the network adjacency matrix has a given leading eigenvector. This allows the formation of clusters of nodes that have the same value of eigenvector centrality. Second, the gains of the communication protocols are selected to guarantee the stability of the error dynamics. We study both the cases of leaderless and leader–follower multiconsensus, providing analytical conditions for multiconsensus, and discuss a few numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Designing large-scale control systems to satisfy complex specifications is hard in practice, as most formal methods are limited to systems of modest size. Contract theory has been proposed as a modular alternative, in which specifications are defined by assumptions on the input to a component and guarantees on its output. However, current contract-based methods for control systems either prescribe guarantees on the state of the system, going against the spirit of contract theory, or are not supported by efficient computational tools. In this paper, we present a contract-based modular framework for discrete-time dynamical control systems. We extend the definition of contracts by allowing the assumption on the input at a time k k to depend on outputs up to time k − 1 k−1 , which is essential when considering feedback systems. We also define contract composition for arbitrary interconnection topologies, and prove that this notion supports modular design, analysis and verification. This is done using graph theory methods, and specifically using the notions of topological ordering and backward-reachable nodes. Lastly, we present an algorithm for verifying vertical contracts, which are claims of the form “the conjunction of given component-level contracts implies given contract on the integrated system”. These algorithms are based on linear programming, and scale linearly with the number of components in the interconnected network. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the scalability of the presented approach, as well as the modularity achieved by using it.},

  abstract     = {Linear time-invariant systems are very popular models in system theory and applications. A fundamental problem in system identification that remains rather unaddressed in extant literature is to leverage commonalities amongst related systems to estimate their transition matrices more accurately. To address this problem, we investigate methods for jointly estimating the transition matrices of multiple systems. It is assumed that the transition matrices are unknown linear functions of some unknown shared basis matrices. We establish finite-time estimation error rates that fully reflect the roles of trajectory lengths, dimension, and number of systems under consideration. The presented results are fairly general and show the significant gains that can be achieved by pooling data across systems, in comparison to learning each system individually. Further, they are shown to be robust against moderate model misspecifications. To obtain the results, we develop novel techniques that are of independent interest and are applicable to similar problems. They include tightly bounding estimation errors in terms of the eigen-structures of transition matrices, establishing sharp high probability bounds for singular values of dependent random matrices, and capturing effects of misspecified transition matrices as the systems evolve over time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal supervisory control for cyclic tasks in the context of discrete-event systems (DES). We consider the completion of each single task as the visit of a marked state, and overall control objective is to complete tasks cyclically in the sense that marked states are visited infinitely often . Following the standard optimal supervisory control framework, two types of costs, disable cost and occurrence cost, are considered. However, instead of considering the standard accumulated total cost or the average cost per event, we consider the measure for the control performance using the average cost per task . We show that such an optimality measure is more suitable for tasks that need to be completed cyclically. Our goal is to design a live and non-blocking supervisor such that the average cost per task in the worst-case is minimized. To solve the problem, we propose a game-theoretical approach by converting the optimal control problem as a two-player graph game. Structural properties of the converted game are discussed. In particular, we show that this game can be solved by a set of mean payoff decision problems, for which effective algorithms exist. Our problem can be considered as a special instance of the general ratio-game in the literature. However, by exploring new structural property for this problem, we achieve superior computational efficiency when compared to the conventional solution designed for more general problem formulations. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed algorithm.},

A novel impulsive control law is constructed, which is based on the discrete-time equivalent control design technique. The sliding-mode-based impulsive control law allows counteracting the disturbance effect using its previous step value. To adapt in real time to the variation in sampling periods, the sliding function is designed as a function of impulse interval. Piecewise Lyapunov functions based on the partition on the maximum impulse interval are introduced to deal with the time-varying structure of the sliding function. Sufficient conditions for exponential input-to-state stability (EISS) of the impulsively controlled systems are derived, in which the EISS gain characterizes the attenuation ability of the proposed impulsive control law on the disturbance estimation error. The disturbance attenuation performance of the proposed impulsive control strategy is demonstrated through the time-delay Chua’s circuit.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of active fault diagnosis (AFD) is investigated for a class of continuous-time stochastic systems subject to non-convex input constraints. The input is designed to minimize the probability of misdiagnosis. Since the misdiagnosis probability cannot be expressed in the closed form, its Chernoff upper bound likely tighter than its widely used Bhattacharyya upper bound is exploited as an alternative. The closed-form expression of the Chernoff distance under Gaussian distributions is correctly deduced. For calculation simplification and diagnosis performance enhancement purposes, a novel input design criterion is constructed for AFD based on the Chernoff distance. The optimization problem for AFD is formulated as a bilevel optimization, where the outer and inner layers optimize the Chernoff distance parameter and the input respectively. A convex relaxation is proposed to relax non-convex input constraints into convex ones, and the optimal solution to the relaxed inner input design problem is proven to be also optimal for the original inner problem whose objective function and input constraints are both non-convex under certain conditions, which is referred to as lossless relaxation. The relaxed inner input design problem under the constructed design criterion can be solved to global optimums, and the relaxed outer optimization is solved by a grid search method. Given the optimal input, faults are diagnosed based on the minimum misdiagnosis probability decision rule. The effectiveness of the proposed AFD approach is demonstrated by utilizing a planetary landing example.},

For such systems, which include a wide range of linear quantum optical devices and signals, we seek to find a near optimal equalizing filter which is itself a passive quantum system. The problem amounts to solving an optimization problem subject to constraints dictated by the requirement for the equalizer to be physically realizable. By formulating these constraints in the frequency domain, we show that the problem admits a convex H ∞ H∞ -like formulation. This allows us to derive a set of suboptimal coherent equalizers using J J -spectral factorization.

We show via novel stochastic Lyapunov arguments how the Lindbladian dynamics of the quantum decision maker can be controlled to converge to a specific decision asymptotically.

Edges within a community have identical weights different from edge weights between communities. We first derive an upper bound for the second moment of agent opinions. Using this result, we obtain upper bounds for probability that a large proportion of agents have opinions close to average opinions. The results imply a phase transition of transient behavior of the process: When edge weights within communities are larger than those between communities and those between regular and stubborn agents, most agents in the same community hold opinions close to the average opinion of that community with large probability, at an early stage of the process. However, if the difference between intra- and inter-community weights is small, most of the agents instead hold opinions close to everyone’s average opinion at the early stage. In contrast, when the influence of stubborn agents is large, agent opinions settle quickly to steady state. We then conduct numerical experiments to validate the theoretical results. Different from traditional asymptotic analysis in most opinion dynamics literature, the paper characterizes the influence of stubborn agents and community structure on the initial phase of the opinion evolution.},

The distinct features of the paper are three-fold. First, the dynamics of a thermodynamic system is studied by transferring the original state variable from the non-Euclidean and nonlinear manifold state space to a Lie group, and further to the dual space of a Lie algebra, which is endowed with vector space structures. Consequently, the resulting reduced dynamics significantly reduces the high nonlinearity appearing in the original non-Euclidean state space of a thermal process. Second, the obtained equations of motion interestingly indicate that thermodynamics can be naturally viewed as a generalization of rigid body motions, and this bridges control theory, thermodynamics, information theory, and rigid body dynamics. Third, the optimality conditions for the energy-minimum optimal control problem of probability densities are derived via geometric Pontryagin’s principle by regarding the reduced dynamics as dynamical constraints, and a unified control algorithm is developed. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to three different scenarios including two benchmark examples to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness. The purpose of the paper is to provide a deeper understanding of thermodynamics from a control perspective, and also to draw intrinsic connections between control theory, thermodynamics, information theory, and rigid body dynamics.},

The main objective is to design the Youla parameter of an IMC scheme, which has been cast as a Negative Imaginary (NI) controller synthesis problem. Two different methodologies have been proposed. A frequency-domain IMC design approach is first presented, which depends on solving a constrained, linear, least-square estimation problem. Then, an LMI-based methodology is developed, which can be solved by the commercially available SDP solver packages. An in-depth simulation case study on the vibration attenuation problem of a lightweight cantilever beam (a potential application of the NI theory) was carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the NI-based IMC design methodology. Finally, the simulation results were experimentally validated on a custom-made vibration suppressor to confirm the feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

In this paper, we approach this problem from a novel perspective: disturbances occur in all channels, yet few measured signals are required. In most cases, only the tracking error is utilized as the measured signal. This marks a significant advancement in the application of ADRC to PDEs. We primarily demonstrate this approach by addressing the output tracking problem for a multi-dimensional heat equation, considering general disturbances across all possible channels. Additionally, we briefly discuss some other one-dimensional problems studied in the literature, such as the one-dimensional wave equation.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a constructive method was suggested for finite-dimensional observer-based control of 1D linear heat equation, which is robust to input/output delays. In this paper, we aim to extend this method to the 2D case with general time-varying input/output delays or sawtooth delays (that correspond to network-based control). We use the modal decomposition approach and consider boundary or non-local sensing together with non-local actuation, or Neumann actuation with non-local sensing. To compensate the output delay that appears in the infinite-dimensional part of the closed-loop system, for the first time for delayed PDEs we suggest a vector Lyapunov functional combined with the recently introduced vector Halanay inequality. We provide linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for finding the observer dimension and upper bounds on delays that preserve the exponential stability. We prove that the LMIs are always feasible for large enough observer dimension and small enough upper bounds on delays. A numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of our method and shows that the employment of vector Halanay’s inequality allows for larger delays than the classical scalar Halanay inequality for comparatively large observer dimension.},

Different from the existing work on distributed optimization, the local cost function of each agent depends both on its local decision variable and on the sum of all functions formed by the decision variables of all agents. Inspired by the distributed dynamic average consensus protocol, heavy-ball strategy, and Nesterov gradient descent method, a momentum-based distributed gradient tracking algorithm with a fixed step size is proposed to solve such a problem. Further, it is shown that the proposed algorithm has a linear convergence rate if the global cost function is strongly convex with the Lipschitz-continuous gradient. The upper bounds of the fixed step size and the momentum parameter are restricted by a sufficiently small positive constant, respectively. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the findings.},

Moreover, we design a specific robust terminal set for the S/H local controller and obtain an upper bound of the sampling intervals for this controller. Then we give the necessary conditions for sampling intervals and the amount of DoS attack that system can tolerate to ensure state convergence under attack and attack-free scenarios. To mitigate the impact of such attack and maintain stability even under adverse conditions, we propose a resilient MPC algorithm with a suitable sampling update strategy, combined with an actuator buffer for storing feasible control inputs.

Generally speaking, the linearization method requires that the vector field of the original nonlinear system is continuously differentiable. Since the vector field of a switched system does not meet the differentiable condition (discontinuous at switching instants), the linearization method is seldom used in the context of switched systems. In the present paper, it is assumed that the vector field of each subsystem is continuously differentiable. With this assumption, two Lyapunov theorems are proposed to verify the exponential and asymptotic stabilities of the considered system. Applying these results and using the linearized system, a multiple homogeneous polynomial Lyapunov function (HPLF) is adapted to establish the exponential stability of switched nonlinear systems. Moreover, it is shown that the conservatism of the stability condition reduces as the degree of the HPLF increases.},

They are in one-to-one correspondence with positive definite maps called kernels. Stable RKHSs enjoy the additional property of containing only functions defined over the real line and absolutely integrable. Necessary and sufficient conditions for RKHS stability are known in the literature: the integral operator induced by the kernel must be bounded as map between ℒ ∞ ℒ∞ , the space of essentially bounded (test) functions, and ℒ 1 ℒ1 , the space of absolutely integrable functions. Considering all the Lebesgue measurable kernels in continuous-time and also the discrete-time class, we show that the stability test can be reduced to the study of the kernel operator over test functions which assume (almost everywhere) only the values ± 1 ±1 . They represent the same functions needed to investigate stability of any single element in the RKHS. In this way, the RKHS stability test becomes an elegant generalization of a straightforward result concerning Bounded-Input Bounded-Output (BIBO) stability of a single linear time-invariant system.},

The Lagrange multiplier theory shows that it is only possible to guarantee the existence of an approximate solution provided that in the dual problem we add a regularization term. We investigate the effect of regularization on the REMSE: increasing the power of regularization corresponds to increasing the ν ν -entropy of the estimated spectrum and, as a consequence, it is expected that the estimated model is more robust in the risk-averse sense.},

To save limited network resources, an event-based communication strategy is presented to arrange data scheduling, where the next triggering time of each node can be predicted, and thus continuous listening is avoided. By employing the robust regularized least-squares estimation approach, a local robust recursive algorithm is first developed by minimizing the given quadratic cost index. Then, a fully distributed information fusion scheme is implemented by exchanging information between adjacent nodes, where the local information spreads to the entire network after a finite-step iteration under the connected topology. Furthermore, by utilizing the matrix inequality technique and the mathematical induction approach, some sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the uniform boundedness of the weighting matrices. Finally, an illustrative example is given to validate the developed distributed robust filtering algorithm.},

By adding a constructed virtual observer error into the iterative learning equation, the proposed learning algorithm with the new iterative learning equation is immune to the observer error. In addition, the value iteration based learning equation is established without storing a series of past data, which could lead to a reduction of demands on the usage of memory storage. Besides, the proposed algorithm eliminates the requirement of repeated finite window integrals, which may reduce the computational load.

Although involving algebraic–trigonometric descriptions, the obtained dynamical model is the most concise formulation but difficult to use for control design. We develop a feedforward plus proportional–derivative feedback boundary control scheme for the nonlinear PDE system to regulate the planar shape of the continuum arm and then linearize the dynamical equations about the equilibrium to assess the control performance. Some interesting results are the closed-loop stability and the well-posedness analysis of the linearized model, which have not previously been noted.

The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by resolving a dissipative ordinary differential equation. The decay rates of the vibration for some special nonlinear feedback functions can be estimated by the dissipative ordinary differential equation provided that growth restrictions on these nonlinear feedbacks near the origin are required.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of population transfer optimal control for a quantum Lambda system where the control couples pairwise only the lowest two energy levels to the highest level. The cost to be minimized expresses a compromise between minimizing the energy of the control and the average population in the highest level (occupancy), which is the one mostly subject to decay. Such a problem admits a group of symmetries, that is, a Lie group acting on the state space, which leaves dynamics, cost and initial and final conditions unchanged. By identifying a splitting of the tangent bundle into a vertical (tangent to the orbits) and horizontal (complementary) subspace at every point (a connection ), we develop a symmetry reduction technique. In this setting, the problem reduces to a real problem on the sphere S 2 for which we derive several properties and provide a practical method for the solution. We also describe an explicit numerical example.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the stabilization problem of networked control systems (NCSs) with random packet dropouts caused by stochastic channels. To describe the effects of stochastic channels on the information transmission, the transmission times are assumed to be deterministic, whereas the packet transmission is assumed to be random. We first propose a stochastic scheduling protocol to model random packet dropouts, and address the properties of the proposed stochastic scheduling protocol. The proposed scheduling protocol provides a unified modelling framework for a general class of random packet dropouts due to different stochastic channels. Next, the proposed scheduling protocol is embedded into the closed-loop system, which leads to a stochastic hybrid model for NCSs with random packet dropouts. Based on this stochastic hybrid model, we follow the emulation approach to establish sufficient conditions to guarantee uniform global asymptotical stability in probability. In particular, an upper bound on the maximally allowable transmission interval is derived explicitly for all stochastic protocols satisfying Lyapunov conditions that guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability in probability. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the derived results.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a distributed algorithm to solve the RSE problem in the almost sure sense are characterized in term of the topology-associated robustly collective observability. Under these conditions, a distributed projected stochastic resilient filtering algorithm is proposed. Compared with the existing results where asymptotic or probabilistic finite-time analysis is established, the exponential convergence (in sense of mean square) of the proposed algorithm is proved.

Furthermore, we explore the utilization of a simplified filter as a viable alternative to full state estimator. While the effectiveness of this simplified filter was numerically examined in Cardona et al. (2020), our paper offers a comprehensive proof of its applicability in feedback stabilization.

This leads us to a classical decoupling into fast (intra-cluster) and slow (inter-cluster) dynamics. Our objective is to provide a computationally efficient method to design control strategies that guarantee a certain bound on the cost for each cluster. Basically, we design a composite synchronizing controller with two terms: one responsible for the intra-cluster synchronization and the other achieving the synchronization between clusters. The first one does not require much computational effort since an analytic expression describes it. The second term is designed through a satisfaction equilibrium approach. In other words, the internal (fast) and external (slow) controllers are independently designed, and they ensure a guaranteed satisfactory cost for each cluster. Moreover, we show that the internal control affects the cluster cost only for a short time period. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results.},

It is well known that the interior of the Apollonius Circle (AC) is the evader’s dominance region, however, it was unclear whether the evader could reach outside the initial AC without being captured. We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem, and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial AC. Therefore, a class of problems, including those where the payoff is determined solely based on the location of capture, are now trivial.},

The use of triggering mechanism discretizes measured states, which causes the issue of nondifferentiation for virtual control signals and hinders the design of adaptive estimation mechanism for unknown parameters in the traditional backstepping design. To conquer the difficulties, a group of adaptive chainlike filters are designed to generate necessarily smooth state estimates, with adaptive parameters online adjusted by the triggering state estimation errors. It is shown that the designed event-triggered mechanism allows the proposed adaptive backstepping control scheme to achieve asymptotic convergence even in the presence of state discretization.},

Aiming at achieving optimal control synthesis under the requirement of bumpless transfer control (BTC), the min–max MPC formulation is extended to the transition-dependent paradigm, such that the abrupt variation of mode-dependent gains can be mitigated via BTC performance optimization. To address the high computational complexity caused by the transition-dependent variables and constraints, the MPC algorithm is developed with an offline-to-online synthesis strategy, achieving comparable online computation cost to non-switching MPC. Meanwhile, a class of more general stochastic switching signals is considered, where the sojourn time may follow any form of distribution, and the recursive feasibility and mean-square stability are theoretically guaranteed. Compared with existing studies on switching MPC and the ones on BTC, this work avoids the assumption of the Markov property on mode switching and reduces conservatism by exploiting the statistical information of sojourn time. An illustrative example is provided to show the potential of the obtained results.},

It is shown that prescribed-time exact regulation can be achieved by a linear observer based controller in the presence of completely unknown interactions. Besides, without significantly modifying the original controller structure, we develop a singularity-free controller with bounded time-varying feedback to drive the system state to converge to a compact set within a preset time, and ultimately converge to zero. In both of these approaches, the controller and observer designs have a dual architecture, thereby obviating the need for the separation principle (which might not be valid for nonlinear systems with mismatched uncertainties). In addition, the relationship between the upper bound of the time-varying gain and the stability of the closed-loop system is thoroughly analyzed.},

Regarding observer-based controllers, when LTI controllers are considered for LTI plant systems, a method has been proposed to convert a priori designed unstructured LTI controllers to observer-based ones without altering control performance; however, the method has not been extended to the case of parametric plant systems. This note thus addresses the conversion problem of a priori designed unstructured controllers to observer-based ones for linear parametric plant systems. To this end, we first propose observer-structured controllers , which can be defined for linear parametric plant systems even if their nominal s.s. matrices are unspecified, as a structural extension of Luenberger observer-based controllers, and then show the parametrization of the s.s. matrices of the observer-structured controllers. Using the parametrization, a conversion method, which produces observer-structured controllers derived from the unstructured ones with minimal state estimation errors embedded, is proposed using state-transformation matrices obtained via parametrically dependent LMIs. A practical example (lateral-directional motion control around wing level flight of an airplane using a gain-scheduled controller) is included to demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of our propositions.},

Such systems contain rapidly-varying, piecewise continuous and almost periodic coefficients with small parameters (time-scales). Our method relies on a novel delay-free system transformation in conjunction with a new system presentation, where the rapidly-varying coefficients are scalars that have zero average. We employ time-varying Lyapunov functions for ISS-like analysis. The analysis yields LMI conditions, leading to explicit bounds on the small parameters, decay rate and ISS-like gains. The novel system presentation plays a crucial role in the ISS-like analysis by allowing to derive essentially less conservative upper bounds on terms containing the small parameters. The obtained LMIs are accompanied by suitable feasibility guarantees. We further extend our approach to rapidly-varying systems subject to either discrete (constant/fast-varying) or distributed delays, where our approach decouples the effects of the delay and small parameters on the stability of the system, and leads to LMI conditions for stability of systems with non-small delays. Extensive numerical examples show that, compared to the existing results, our approach essentially enlarges the small parameter and delay bounds for which the ISS-like/stability property of the original system is preserved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the stabilization problem of nonlinear time-delay systems in presence of known exogenous disturbances and by means of quantized sampled-data event-based controllers is investigated. In particular, nonlinear systems with state delays are studied. Known exogenous disturbances affecting the plant dynamics are considered in order to address, for instance, tracking control problems commonly studied by considering the stabilization problem of the corresponding tracking error system in which the chosen reference signal appears as a known exogenous signal. The stabilization in the sample-and-hold sense theory is used as a tool to provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a suitably fast sampling and of an accurate quantization of the input/output channels such that: the quantized sampled-data implementation of continuous-time controllers, updated through a proposed event-based mechanism, guarantees the semi-global practical stability property, with arbitrarily small final target ball of the origin, of the related closed-loop system. A spline approximation methodology is used in order to: (i) cope with the problem of the possible non-availability in the buffer of suitable past values of the system variables needed for the digital implementation of the controller; (ii) consider approximations related to the hardware implementation of the signal describing the known exogenous disturbance (e.g., the chosen reference signal). The provided results include the case of non-uniform quantization of the input/output channels and the case of aperiodic sampling. Applications are presented in order to validate the results, one of which concerning a single-link flexible joint robot arm with time delays.},

However, all the existing angle-constrained formation control methods are limited to undirected triangulated sensing graphs. In this paper, we propose an angle-constrained formation control approach under a Leader–First Follower sensing architecture, where the sensing graph is directed and non-triangulated . During the formation process, the control input of each agent is communication-free and based on relative positions from neighbors measured in the local reference frame. We show that the proposed distributed formation controller ensures global exponential stability of the desired formation. Furthermore, it is interesting to observe that the convergence rate of the whole formation is only determined by partial specific angles within the target formation. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is illustrated by carrying out experiments both in simulation environments and on real robotic platforms.},

The results apply when the system matrix of the system to be observed contains eigenvalues with positive real parts. They also can apply to situations where the communication networks are disconnected at every instant. We present sufficient conditions for the existence of distributed observers for general linear systems over periodic communication networks. Using an averaging approach, it is shown that the proposed distributed observer can provide exponentially converging state estimates of the state of the linear system when the network is uniformly connected on average. This average connectedness condition offers a more relaxed assumption that includes periodic switching, Markovian switching and Cox process switching as special cases. All the agents in the network share the estimated state with their neighbors through the network and cooperatively reconstruct the entire state locally. Furthermore, this study presents two exponential stability results for two classes of switched systems, providing valuable tools in related distributed state estimation approaches. A toy example and three practical applications are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

For them we introduce a new “linearizability” assumption that a mapping from overparameterized vector of parameters Θ θ Θθ to original one θ θ exists in terms of standard algebraic functions . Under such assumption and necessary and sufficient identifiability condition, on the basis of dynamic regressor extension and mixing technique we propose a procedure to reduce the nonlinear regression equation to the linear parameterization without application of singularity causing operations and the need to identify the overparameterized parameters vector. As a result, an estimation law with exponential convergence rate is derived, which, unlike known solutions, ( i ) does not require a strict P -monotonicity condition to be met and a priori information about θ θ to be known, ( ii ) ensures elementwise monotonicity for the parameter error vector.

Covariance matrices of model uncertainties are estimated by solving a well-posed inverse LQR problem. Identifiability of the considered inverse filtering models is established and least squares estimators are designed to be statistically consistent.

Our main technical contribution is the development of a lifting procedure for non-separable nonlinearly parameterized regressor equations to obtain separable ones, to which we can apply a recently reported estimation procedure. This is illustrated with a human musculoskeletal dynamics problem. The procedure does not assume that the parameters leave in known compact sets, that the nonlinearities satisfy some Lipschitzian properties, nor rely on injection of high-gain or the use of complex, computationally demanding methodologies. Instead, we propose to design a classical on-line estimator whose dynamics is described by an ordinary differential equation given in a compact precise form.},

Then, the introduction of slack variables allows for the constraint violation of different subtasks; i.e., the attraction from target-approaching constraints and the repulsion from time-varying collision-avoidance constraints, which results in the desired formation with arbitrary spatial ordering sequences. Rigorous analysis is provided to guarantee asymptotical convergence with challenging nonlinear couplings induced by time-varying collision-free constraints. Finally, 2D experiments using three autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and 3D simulations tackling changing environmental elements, such as different initial positions, some robots suddenly breakdown and static obstacles are presented to demonstrate the multi-dimensional adaptability, robustness and the ability of obstacle avoidance of the proposed method.},

However, the complexity of POMDPs poses various computational challenges, motivating the need for an efficient algorithm that rapidly finds a good enough suboptimal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel accelerated offline POMDP algorithm exploiting Anderson acceleration (AA) that is capable of efficiently solving fixed-point problems using previous solution estimates. Our algorithm is based on the Q-function approximation (QMDP) method to alleviate the scalability issue inherent in POMDPs. Inspired by the quasi-Newton interpretation of AA, we propose a maximum entropy variant of QMDP, which we call soft QMDP , to fully benefit from AA. We prove that the overall algorithm converges to the suboptimal solution obtained by soft QMDP. Our algorithm can also be implemented in a model-free manner using simulation data. Provable error bounds on the residual and the solution are provided to examine how the simulation errors are propagated through the proposed algorithm. Finally, the performance of our algorithm is tested on several benchmark problems. According to the results of our experiments, the proposed algorithm converges significantly faster without degrading the solution quality compared to its standard counterparts.},

In addition, the variance reduction (VR) and acceleration techniques are useful tools in the development of stochastic methods due to their simplicity and practicability in providing acceleration characteristics of various machine learning models. However, it remains unclear whether accelerated SVRG-ADMM algorithm (ASVRG-ADMM), which extends SVRG-ADMM by incorporating momentum techniques, exhibits a comparable acceleration characteristic or convergence rate in the nonconvex setting. To fill this gap, we consider a general nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem and study the convergence of ASVRG-ADMM. By utilizing a well-defined potential energy function, we establish its sublinear convergence rate O ( 1 / T ) O(1/T) , where T T denotes the iteration number . Furthermore, under the additional Kurdyka–Lojasiewicz (KL) property which is less stringent than the frequently used conditions for showcasing linear convergence rates, such as strong convexity, we show that the ASVRG-ADMM sequence almost surely has a finite length and converges to a stationary solution with a linear convergence rate. Several experiments on solving the graph-guided fused lasso problem and regularized logistic regression problem validate that the proposed ASVRG-ADMM performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Unlike finite time stability in probability, wherein the finite time almost sure convergence behavior of the dynamical system depends on the system initial conditions, fixed time stability in probability involves finite time stability in probability for which the stochastic settling-time is guaranteed to be independent of the system initial conditions. More specifically, we develop Lyapunov theorems for fixed time stability in probability for Itô-type stationary nonlinear stochastic difference equations including a Lyapunov theorem that involves a Lyapunov difference satisfying an exponential inequality of the Lyapunov function that gives rise to a minimum bound on the average stochastic settling-time characterized by the primary and secondary branches of the Lambert W function.},

By taking the specific network structures into consideration, some lower-dimensional conditions are derived, which reveal how the network topologies, sensor locations, node-system dynamics and output, as well as inner interactions altogether affect the discernibility. Furthermore, the output discernibility of topological changes for networked multi-agent systems is revisited, showing that some criterion reported in the literature does not hold. Consequently, a modified necessary and sufficient condition is established. The effectiveness of the results is demonstrated through several examples.},

To mitigate the curse of dimensionality in the action space, we propose a new approach that utilizes optimal policy characterizations to reduce the action space dimensionality without loss of optimality. For a general setting with preemptive/non-preemptive queuing, we establish the optimality of deadline differentiated threshold policies under arbitrary system dynamics. Integrating the established optimal policy characterizations into the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method, the proposed approach is scalable in M + N M+N . Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the classical PPO method and other priority rule based PPO approaches, in real-world applications including electric vehicle charging and live streaming scheduling.},

Unlike other least-squares based algorithms, the update law is driven only by the tracking error and, in this way, it does not require normalization or parameter projection to assure stability of the closed-loop system. Moreover, the algorithm has striking improved tracking error transient and superior parameter convergence properties when compared with a conventional MRAC. Also recently, a new design employing high-order parameter tuners has been proposed. In this design, the parameter derivatives are quite easily and systematically obtained. A key point of the procedure is the Lyapunov function used for the analysis that explicitly considers the derivatives of the parameter. The implementation of the algorithm requires finding a symmetric positive definite matrix such that a Schur complement is negative definite. This is a fundamental property to assure its stability. The solution to this problem leads to a novel simple proof for the equivalence between the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion and the Lyapunov’s method. In this work both design methodologies are combined, that is, the LS-MRAC algorithm is redesigned with high-order tuners.},

Motivated by these requirements, we present and analyze a novel distributed average consensus algorithm, which (i) operates exclusively on quantized values (in order to guarantee efficient communication and data storage), (ii) relies on event-driven updates (in order to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage), and (iii) allows each node to cease transmissions once the exact average of the initial quantized values has been reached (in order to preserve its stored energy). We characterize the properties of the proposed algorithm and show that its execution, on any time-invariant and strongly connected digraph, allows all nodes to reach in finite time a common consensus value that is equal to the exact average (represented as the ratio of two quantized values). Then, we present upper bounds on (i) the number of transmissions and computations each node has to perform during the execution of the algorithm, and (ii) the memory and energy requirements of each node in order for the algorithm to be executed. Finally, we provide examples that demonstrate the operation, performance, and potential advantages of our proposed algorithm.},

With the safety constraints, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimal control model is formulated to generate train regulation strategies. An efficient solution algorithm , based on spatial branch and bound combined with generalized Benders decomposition, is particularly designed to obtain exact solutions quickly for the embedded applications. The original complex problem can be converted into several smaller convex quadratic subproblems with reduced domains to be solved quickly. The effectiveness of our train control model and approaches are verified in numerical simulations. Computational results illustrate that the proposed control method effectively improves the operational efficiency and meanwhile reduces energy consumption during operations. Besides, the efficient embedded solution algorithm performs satisfactory computational efficiency, facilitating a real-time implementation.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of controlling Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) in conflict areas of a traffic network subject to hard safety constraints. It has been shown that such problems can be solved through a combination of tractable optimal control problem formulations and the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that guarantee the satisfaction of all constraints. These solutions can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) which are efficiently solved on-line over discrete time steps. However, the feasibility of each such QP cannot be guaranteed over every time step. To overcome this limitation, we develop both an event-triggered approach and a self-triggered approach such that the next QP is triggered by properly defined events. We show that both approaches, each in a different way, eliminate infeasible cases due to time-driven inter-sampling effects, thus also eliminating the need for selecting the size of time steps. Simulation examples are included to compare the two new schemes and to illustrate how overall infeasibilities can be significantly reduced while at the same time reducing the need for communication among CAVs without compromising performance.},

A new stability analysis method based on the switched transfer function matrix and ergodic property of the semi-Markov process is proposed to tackle difficulties caused by the complex nature of TLSSSs. Under such a framework, auxiliary systems are constructed for upper layer systems through the corresponding eigenvalues, and the latent subsystems of each auxiliary system are associated with the switched transfer function matrix. Then, the relations between the Lyapunov functions and prescribed system parameters are constructed to deal with the instability caused by the mode jumping. By comprehensively utilizing the property of the semi-Markov process and the above-mentioned methods, sufficient conditions are further presented to ensure the exponential mean-square (EMS) stability and exponential almost sure (EAS) stability, respectively.

  abstract     = {The Koopman framework proposes a linear representation of finite-dimensional nonlinear systems through a generally infinite-dimensional globally linear embedding. Originally, the Koopman formalism has been derived for autonomous systems . In applications for systems with inputs, generally a linear time invariant (LTI) form of the Koopman model is assumed, as it facilitates the use of control techniques such as linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control . However, it can be easily shown that this assumption is insufficient to capture the dynamics of the underlying nonlinear system. Proper theoretical extension for actuated continuous-time systems with a linear or a control-affine input has been worked out only recently, however extensions to discrete-time systems and general continuous-time systems have not been developed yet. In the present paper, we systematically investigate and analytically derive lifted forms under inputs for a rather wide class of nonlinear systems in both continuous and discrete time. We prove that the resulting lifted representations give Koopman models where the state transition is linear, but the input matrix becomes state-dependent (state and input-dependent in the discrete-time case), giving rise to a specially structured linear parameter-varying (LPV) description of the underlying system. We also provide error bounds on how much the dependency of the input matrix contributes to the resulting representation and how well the system behavior can be approximated by an LTI Koopman representation. The introduced theoretical insight greatly helps for performing proper model structure selection in system identification with Koopman models as well as making a proper choice for LTI or LPV techniques for the control of nonlinear systems through the Koopman approach.},

Asynchronous switching which refers to the mismatch between system modes and desired mode-dependent controllers may result in infeasibility of the conventional switched MPC design or even make the closed-loop system unstable. To handle this problem, the concept of stage MDT is employed and its minimum admissible value is determined offline so as to ensure the reachable set of a starting region is included in a target region. Then, we compute a constraint admissible contractive asynchronous switching MDT invariant (AMI) set as the common terminal constraints for all the switching modes and find out an important property: The existence of such an AMI set is equivalent to the asymptotic stability of the asynchronously switched closed-loop system. By letting the reachable set be contained in the AMI set, we present two criteria to determine the minimum admissible stage MDT offline such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.

The outer-loop, encapsulating the position tracking dynamics, is rendered input-to-state stable by designing a nested saturated control law with integrative action and applying small-gain arguments. The control strategy comprises an inner-loop that relies on a hybrid controller with integral action, designed based on the modified Rodrigues parameters attitude description, to solve the attitude tracking problem. The hybrid formulation of the controller benefits from the unique properties of the mentioned attitude description. Furthermore, it also provides a favorable framework to overcome the global stabilizing continuous feedback topological obstruction. For any given initial state , the resulting double-loop control architecture asymptotically tracks a position trajectory that satisfies some assumptions, while minimizing the distance to the desired attitude and satisfying the saturation limits of the thrust and torque inputs. The simulation results demonstrate the potential of the strategy. The experimental test carried out with a commercially available quadcopter and a motion capture system highlighted the proposed solution tracking capabilities, validating thereby the global saturated trajectory tracking controller. The proposed strategy is the first saturated MRP-based hybrid solution for quadrotor trajectory tracking.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to investigate event-triggered (ET) state estimation problems under measurement compression. A stochastic ET mechanism is developed by using the normalized innovation as a basis for triggering. In particular, when fixing the compression matrix, the closed form of the minimum mean squared error estimator is derived from Bayesian theory. Moreover, the ET decision process is proven to be independent and identically distributed, which allows to derive the communication rate using an explicit formula. We also develop a method for performance analysis without computing the expected mean squared error explicitly. We find that larger communication rates and compression ratios lead to smaller expected mean squared errors. These analysis results also serve as a tool for the design of the compression matrix, which is discussed under two scenarios. When the compression ratio is greater than or equal to the ratio of the rank of the observation matrix to the dimension of measurement, an analytic optimal compression matrix is derived via singular value decomposition . In the other scenario where the compression ratio is larger than the ratio of the rank of the observation matrix to the dimension of measurement, it is no longer feasible to achieve optimal compression using singular value decomposition. Instead, we compute the compression matrix by minimizing an upper bound of the steady-state mean squared error. In fact, this problem involves a rank constraint which is computationally demanding. For this reason, we provide a reformulation which produces the same optimal objective value. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods are verified by a target tracking system.},

The weighting matrices in the cost function are not assumed to be definite. We adopt the conditional expectations to transform the forward–backward stochastic difference equations (FBSDEs) of the finite-population system into the mean field FBSDEs of a representative player. For the non-cooperative games, the solvability of decentralized Nash equilibria is characterized by the existence of a solution to a system of FBSDEs, together with a convexity condition. For the cooperative social control, the solvability of decentralized social optimal control is characterized by the existence of regular solutions to two Riccati equations . The proposed decentralized strategies are optimal in the case of finite-population, and also consistent with the classical asymptotic optimal strategies in the case of infinite-population.

This way, the difficulty of selecting a proper set of features is also tackled. The proposed method is then extended to the infinite time horizon case. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the resulting Recursive Residual Approximate Dynamic Programming (RR-ADP) algorithm is applied to the sensor scheduling design in multi-process remote state estimation problems.},

In contrast to existing literature where performance bounds are only function of time, here we propose a revised performance bound which is also function of the tracking errors associated with the slung load subsystem. The unknown load mass is obtained from an adaptive law that is designed within the framework of backstepping. All system errors are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded, with simultaneous guarantees of prescribed accuracy and constraint satisfaction. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate and assess the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology.},

The objective of the parallel operation is to regulate the output of the plant accurately while allowing the actuators to fairly share the input of the plant. To address the parallel operation problem, it is assumed that the plant and the actuators are modeled by general linear systems as opposed to the existing results. Further it is assumed that the controllers for the actuators share their local information with each other through communication. A feedback control law for each actuator is proposed by using the plant output error measurement and the exchanged local information. Assuming the existence of the spanning tree in the graph representing the communication topology among the controllers, it is shown that the output regulation and plant input sharing properties can be achieved by the proposed control law. The design of the proposed control law is demonstrated by a numerical example.},

Standard distributed algorithms achieve DP typically by perturbing all local subgradients with noise, leading to significantly degenerated utility. To tackle this issue, we develop a class of private distributed dual averaging (DDA) algorithms, which activates a fraction of nodes to perform optimization. Such subsampling procedure provably amplifies the DP guarantee, thereby achieving an equivalent level of DP with reduced noise. We prove that the proposed algorithms have utility loss comparable to centralized private algorithms for both general and strongly convex problems . When removing the noise, our algorithm attains the optimal O ( 1 / t ) O(1/t) convergence for non-smooth stochastic optimization. Finally, experimental results on two benchmark datasets are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

The generalized inverse technique for matrices avoids the additional structural requirements caused by the nonlinear algebraic constraints. Moreover, we assume an easier-to-implement rank condition than infinite observability, allowing for the handling of two different observability. Building on the above, the method can be extended to systems with nonlinear outputs after converting them to a suitable form.

The agents’ interactions are modeled by general piecewise linear functions that can be heterogeneous and not necessarily monotone, thus generalizing the analytical framework usually considered in the literature, in particular, the well-known interval consensus (Fontanet al., 2020). In the considered novel multi-agent scenario, we formulate sufficient operative LMI conditions to assess global network asymptotic stability for either a consensus or a cluster equilibrium, without necessarily requiring strong network connectivity.

We focus on controllability of Turing’s model by linearization and spatial discretization . This linearized model is a networked system whose agents are second order linear systems and these agents interact with each other by Laplacian dynamics on a graph. A control signal can be added to agents of choice. Under mild conditions on the parameters of the linearized Turing’s model, we prove the equivalence between controllability of the linearized Turing’s model and controllability of a Laplace dynamic system with agents of first order dynamics.

The class of systems under consideration consists of a linear 2 × 2 hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDE) system coupled at both ends with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The proximal ODE system, which represents actuator dynamics, is actuated. Colocated measurements are available. The distal ODE system represents the load dynamics. The control objective is to ensure, in the presence of a disturbance signal (regulation problem), that a virtual output exponentially converges to zero. By doing so, we can ensure that a state component of the distal ODE state robustly converges towards a known reference trajectory (output tracking problem) even in the presence of a disturbance with a known structure. The proposed approach combines the backstepping methodology and frequency analysis techniques. We first map the original system to a simpler target system using an invertible integral change of coordinates. From there, we design an adequate full-state feedback controller in the frequency domain. Following a similar approach, we propose a state observer that estimates the state and reconstructs the disturbance from the available measurement. Combining the full-state feedback controller with the state estimation results in a dynamic output-feedback control law.

Optimizing over linear time-varying (LTV) state feedback controllers has been successfully used for robust MPC when only additive disturbances are present. However, it is challenging to design LTV state feedback controllers in the face of model uncertainty whose effects are difficult to bound. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to over-approximate the effects of both model uncertainty and additive disturbances by a filtered additive disturbance signal. Using the System Level Synthesis framework, we jointly search for robust LTV state feedback controllers and the bounds on the effects of uncertainty online, which allows us to reduce the conservatism and minimize an upper bound on the worst-case cost in robust MPC. We provide a comprehensive numerical comparison of our method and representative robust MPC methods from the literature. Numerical examples demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly reduce the conservatism over a wide range of uncertainty parameters with comparable computational effort as the baseline methods.},

To solve the problem, a novel distributed continuous-time algorithm is proposed by combining gradient dynamics with a dynamic average consensus estimator in a two-time scale. The exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm is established under the assumption of a convex global cost function by virtue of the stability theory of singular perturbation systems.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel disturbance-observer-based event-triggered model predictive control (DEMPC) framework for a class of nonlinear input-affine systems with state and control input constraints as well as unmatched disturbances to simultaneously enhance the robustness of standard MPC and reduce computational resource utilization . First, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to compensate for disturbances actively. Next, a constant-threshold-type event-triggering mechanism (CTETM) is designed in terms of the state prediction deviation caused by the remaining disturbances. Subsequently, a DEMPC algorithm is constructed using the disturbance estimation information, the CTETM, and the so-called dual-mode scheme. Furthermore, rigorous theoretical analysis is provided, involving robust constraint fulfillment, Zeno phenomenon prevention, recursive feasibility, and stability. Particularly for systems with only matched disturbances, it is proven that continuous disturbance compensation would result in a possibly lower triggering frequency and enhanced control performance for the DEMPC compared to conventional EMPC without introducing additional conservatism into the state constraints. In the end, simulation studies are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Different from existing works on mixed equilibrium problems with only convex set constraints, we consider a more general case where the feasible set is constrained by a set of convex inequalities. Moreover, each agent only has access to the information of its own bifunction and inequality constraint function, as well as the information of a local convex set. To handle this problem, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition that is suitable for continuous-time theoretical approaches is provided, and a continuous-time distributed primal–dual algorithm is proposed. Under mild assumptions on the graph and bifunctions, we prove that the states of all agents asymptotically converge to the common solution of the mixed equilibrium problem. Finally, a simulation example is worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Based on (Trenchant et al. 2017) where positive feedback and a late lumping approach is used, we extend the Control by Interconnection method and propose a new energy shaping methodology with an early lumping approach on the distributed spatial domain of the system. Our two main control objectives are to stabilize the closed-loop system, as well as to improve the closed-loop dynamic performances. With the early lumping approach, we investigate two cases of the controller design , the ideal case where each distributed controller acts independently on the spatial domain (fully-actuated), and the more realistic case where the control action is piecewise constant over certain intervals (under-actuated). We then analyze the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system when the infinite dimensional plant system is connected with the finite dimensional controller. Furthermore we provide simulation results comparing the performance of the fully-actuated case and the under-actuated case with an example of an elastic vibrating string.},

Essentially, the control problem consists in redesigning a standard distributed consensus controller which, for each system, relies on own state biased measurements and respective erroneous data received from a set of neighbors. The difficulty in such a scheme resides in the fact that the measurement bias is directly amplified by the control gain so it cannot be handled as an additive external disturbance . Our control design relies, on one hand, on the solution of a Riccati equation and, on the other, on the design of an estimator reminiscent of a model-reference-adaptive control design. The estimator successfully computes a bias estimate and completely compensates for its effect if the bias is constant—indeed, in this case, we establish exponential stability of the consensus manifold and we show that the controller provides robustness with respect to time-varying biases.},

More specifically, by the orthogonal transformation technique, the analytic expression of the L 2 L2 gain of a second-order multi-agent system with the absolute velocity protocol is firstly derived, followed by the counterpart with the relative velocity protocol. It is shown that both the L 2 L2 gains for the absolute and the relative velocity protocols are determined only by the minimum non-zero eigenvalues of Laplacian matrices and the tunable gains of position-like and velocity-like states. Then, we establish the graph conditions to tell which protocol has better anti-disturbance capability.

With the aid of the coordinate transformation, a linear sliding surface is constructed and the mode-dependent sliding mode controller is designed by means of only successfully transmitted state signals. Moreover, the resultant closed-loop systems composed of partial state and sliding mode variable are described as a continuous time-delay system with double randomness depending on the probability distribution characteristics of both the sampling periods and DoS attacks. Both the mean-square exponential ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system and the reachability of the sliding surface are analyzed and the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived.

Second, a novel adaptive distributed dynamic event-triggered mechanism is proposed to determine the triggering time when neighboring agents broadcast information to each other. Compared to the existing event-triggered mechanisms, the novelty of the proposed dynamic event-triggered mechanism lies in that it guarantees the existence of a positive and uniform minimum inter-event interval without sacrificing any accuracy of the estimation, which is much more practical than only ensuring the exclusion of the Zeno behavior or the boundedness of the estimation error. Third, a composite adaptive law is developed to update the adaptive gain employed in the distributed event-based DAC algorithm and dynamic event-triggered mechanism. Using the composite adaptive update law, the distributed event-based solution proposed in our work is implemented without requiring any global information.

Due to the nonsmoothness of payoff functions and constraints, the weaker communication networks as well as the coexistence of cooperation and competition among players, existing generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking algorithms cannot solve the problem. Also, they pose obstacles to the algorithm design and analysis, mainly because of the non-global Lipschitz continuity of subgradients and the unconnectedness of subnetworks .

Diverging from the existing literature, the form of intermittent control considered in this paper is asynchronous; that is, the intermittent control activation time of each node is different. Moreover, the average control rate for intermittent control is adopted, which is less conservative. More importantly, a Lyapunov function is constructed with the aid of an auxiliary function to overcome the difficulty of dealing with asynchronous aperiodical intermittent control. A dynamic variable and exponential function are then introduced into the AAIDE-TC strategy, playing an essential role in reducing event-triggered frequency and enhancing resource utilization efficiency. Furthermore, the event-triggered frequency for each node is designed to be asynchronous. By resorting to the Lyapunov method and graph theory, this paper derives a criterion for the input-to-state practically exponential stability of complex networks. Finally, the above results are applied to oscillator systems, and numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the obtained results.},

The agents’ collective behavior is modeled by a pair of radially-varying diffusion–reaction PDEs in polar coordinates, whose state determines the agents’ position. Having a radially-varying reaction coefficient not only increases the challenge of kernel equations becoming singular in radius, but also brings more potential deployment manifolds. To stabilize and increase the convergence of the deployment, a boundary controller and a boundary observer are designed by combining an infinite-dimensional backstepping approach with a Fourier series decomposition technique, thus driving all agents to the desired profile. A key feature of the presented result is that the desired profile only needs to be known by the leaders, with the followers only needing to follow a simple control strategy which requires only the measurement of its current position and communication with its neighbors as defined by the multi-agent system topology. The method provides closed-loop exponential stability with any prescribed convergence rate in the L 2 L2 norm. Simulation tests are shown to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

For policy learning, we customize a virtual auxiliary system, based on which an enhanced Bellman equation with the user-specified convergence rate is derived. This allows us not to explicitly measure the time for the system evolution, while only the input–output data are sufficient in our design. By utilizing the robust output regulation technique, we can learn an optimal tracker for such an auxiliary system via policy iteration and value iteration.

Unlike the existing adaptive distributed state observer, an output-based adaptive distributed output observer (OADOO) that only relies on the leader’s output is proposed to estimate the leader’s information. Meanwhile, an input-based triggering mechanism is exploited to avoid continuous interactions between agents, and between the leader and its neighboring agents, respectively. Then, a local controller is developed to achieve the output tracking control. In comparison with the existing results for the similar research problem, our results not only handle the tracking control subject to only relative output measurement, but also considerably lower the data exchange traffic and dimension among agents of the developed OADOO.},

All the system parameters are unknown while the disturbance with unknown bound and period is allowed which lead to more serious uncertainties than the related literature, and hence result into the incapability of the traditional schemes. To solve the control problem, a novel condition-based adaptive control framework is developed in the paper. Specifically, as preparation for the adaptive control design, a state-feedback controller is first designed under the assumption that all the system parameters are known. Then, an adaptive controller , together with two continuous adaptive laws and a condition-based updating mechanism for the online tuning of the controller parameters , is proposed for the original uncertain system. Finally, it is proven that the updating of controller parameters under the proposed condition-based updating mechanism stops at a finite time instant, then the proposed controller guarantees the stability of the resulting closed-loop system.

  abstract     = {Neural networks are central to many emerging technologies, but verifying their correctness remains a major challenge. It is known that network outputs can be sensitive and fragile to even small input perturbations, thereby increasing the risk of unpredictable and undesirable behavior. Fast and accurate verification of neural networks is therefore critical to their widespread adoption, and in recent years various methods have been developed as a response to this problem. In this paper, we focus on improving semidefinite programming (SDP) based techniques for neural network verification. Such techniques offer the power of expressing complex geometric constraints while retaining a convex problem formulation, but scalability remains a major issue in practice. Our starting point is the DeepSDP framework proposed by Fazlyab et al., which uses quadratic constraints to abstract the verification problem into a large-scale SDP. However, solving this SDP quickly becomes intractable when the network grows. Our key observation is that by leveraging chordal sparsity , we can decompose the primary computational bottleneck of DeepSDP — a large linear matrix inequality (LMI) — into an equivalent collection of smaller LMIs. We call our chordally sparse optimization program Chordal-DeepSDP and prove that its construction is identically expressive as that of DeepSDP. Moreover, we show that additional analysis of Chordal-DeepSDP allows us to further rewrite its collection of LMIs in a second level of decomposition that we call Chordal-DeepSDP-2 — which results in another significant computational gain. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on real networks of learned cart–pole dynamics, showcasing the computational advantage of Chordal-DeepSDP and Chordal-DeepSDP-2 over DeepSDP.},

To model such a scenario, we define identity concealment games: zero-sum stochastic reachability games with a zero-sum objective of identity concealment. To measure the identity concealment of the player, we introduce the notion of an average player. The average player’s policy represents the expected behavior of a non-hostile player. We show that there exists an equilibrium policy pair for every identity concealment game and give the optimality equations to synthesize an equilibrium policy pair. If the player’s opponent follows a non-equilibrium policy, the player can hide its identity better. For this reason, we study how the hostile player may learn the opponent’s policy. Since learning via exploration policies would quickly reveal the hostile player’s identity to the opponent, we consider the problem of learning a near-optimal policy for the hostile player using the game runs collected under the average player’s policy. Consequently, we propose an algorithm that provably learns a near-optimal policy and give an upper bound on the number of sample runs to be collected.},

We establish a necessary and sufficient condition to protect the control law from singularities and demonstrate the robot’s potential motion towards a homoclinic orbit or a closed-loop equilibrium point. After examining the robot’s closed-loop equilibrium points, we generate formulae to compute all such points and introduce two conditions concerning control parameters, eliminating all but the UEP and downward equilibrium point (DEP) with the robot in a downward position. We prove the instability of the equilibrium points with negative gravitational potential energy . This obviates the need for one of the two conditions concerning such equilibrium points. We also prove the robot’s linear controllability at the UEP. Our obtained results reveal that, regardless of its initial state , the soft robot can be swung-up towards its UEP using the energy-based controller, provided that it meets the proposed control parameter conditions, and can subsequently be balanced around the UEP using a locally stabilizing controller.

To address this challenge, this paper develops a gain scheduling strategy for linear multi-agent systems over a cooperative-antagonistic network. First, the strategy converts the problem to a time-varying parameter design problem using a time-varying parametric Lyapunov equation (TVPLE). By exploiting the time-varying solution to TVPLE for designing the feedback gains, prescribed-time bipartite synchronization protocols are designed for systems over undirected and directed networks, respectively. These protocols require some global information; therefore, edge- and node-based adaptive gain scheduling strategies are further developed to achieve the prescribed-time bipartite synchronization in a fully distributed manner, which guarantees simultaneous convergence of both state synchronization and adaptive gains within a prescribed time. Finally, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed adaptive protocols.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to investigating the problem of simultaneous input and state estimation for linear discrete-time systems with direct feedthrough from the perspective of a limiting case of the Kalman filtering problem. First, when the unknown input of the underlying system is described as a white Gaussian noise with finite mean and finite variance, a Kalman filter is derived. Next, under the case that the variance of the unknown input tends to infinity, the Kalman filter and the existing simultaneous input and state estimator are unified. Finally, for linear discrete-time systems without direct feedthrough, the relationship between the Kalman filter and the simultaneous input and state estimator is established in a simple manner. The result of this study will pave the way for designing an unbiased estimator for linear systems with unknown inputs and packet drops.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a controller that stabilizes a holonomic robot with single-integrator dynamics to a target position in a bounded domain, while preventing collisions with convex obstacles. We assume that the robot can measure its own position and heading in a global coordinate frame , as well as its relative position vector to the closest point on each obstacle in its sensing range. The robot has no information about the locations and shapes of the obstacles. We define regions around the boundaries of the obstacles and the domain within which the robot can sense these boundaries, and we associate each region with a virtual potential field that we call a local navigation-like function (NLF), which is only a function of the robot’s position and its distance from the corresponding boundary. We also define an NLF for the remaining free space of the domain, and we identify the critical points of the NLFs. Then, we propose a switching control law that drives the robot along the negative gradient of the NLF for the obstacle that is currently closest, or the NLF for the remaining free space if no obstacle is detected. We derive a conservative upper bound on the tunable parameter of the NLFs that guarantees the absence of locally stable equilibrium points, which can trap the robot, if the obstacles’ boundaries satisfy a minimum curvature condition. We also analyze the convergence and collision avoidance properties of the switching control law and, using a Lyapunov argument, prove that the robot safely navigates around the obstacles and converges asymptotically to the target position. We validate our analytical results for domains with different obstacle configurations by implementing the controller in both numerical simulations and physical experiments with a nonholonomic mobile robot.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a distributed state estimation problem for both continuous- and discrete-time linear systems. A simply structured distributed estimator {comprising interconnected local estimators} is first described for estimating the state of a continuous and multi-channel linear system whose sensed outputs are distributed across a fixed multi-agent network. The estimator is then extended to non-stationary networks whose graphs switch according to a switching signal. The estimator is guaranteed to solve the problem, provided a network-widely shared high gain condition achieving a form of spectrum separation is satisfied. As an alternative to sharing a common gain across the network, a fully distributed version of the estimator is also studied in which each agent adaptively adjusts a local gain, though the practicality of this approach is subject to a robustness issue common to adaptive control. A discrete-time version of the distributed state estimation problem is also studied, and a corresponding estimator based again on spectrum separation, but not high gain, is proposed for time-varying networks. For each scenario, it is explained how to construct the estimator so that the state estimation errors in the local estimators all converge to zero exponentially fast at a fixed but arbitrarily chosen rate, provided the network’s graph is strongly connected for all time. The proposed estimators are inherently resilient to abrupt changes in the number of agents and communication links in the inter-agent communication graph upon which the algorithms depend, provided the network is redundantly strongly connected and redundantly jointly observable.},

In this paper, we consider a parallel server system with dynamic routing subject to reliability and stability failures. For the reliability setting, we consider an infinite-horizon Markov decision process where the system operator strategically activates a protection mechanism upon each job arrival based on traffic state observations. We prove that an optimal deterministic threshold protecting policy exists based on the dynamic programming recursion of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. For the security setting, we extend the model to an infinite-horizon stochastic game where the attacker strategically manipulates routing assignments. We show that both players follow a threshold strategy at every Markov perfect equilibrium. For both failure settings, we also analyze the stability of the traffic queues. Finally, we develop approximate dynamic programming algorithms to compute the optimal/equilibrium policies and present numerical examples/experiments for validation and illustration.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-based optimization and control frameworks have been utilized in several applications. The learning rate parameter is typically chosen following a schedule or using methods such as line search to enhance the convergence rate. Recently, the machine learning community has developed methodologies for automated tuning of the learning rate, known as adaptive gradient methods. This paper develops a control theory-inspired framework for modeling adaptive gradient methods that solve non-convex optimization problems. We first model the adaptive gradient methods in a state–space framework, which allows us to present simpler convergence proofs of prominent adaptive optimizers, such as AdaGrad, Adam, and AdaBelief. The proposed framework is constructive because it allows synthesizing new adaptive optimizers. To illustrate this fact, we then utilize the transfer function paradigm from classical control to propose a new variant of Adam, coined AdamSSM, and prove its convergence. We add an appropriate pole-zero pair in the transfer function from squared gradients to the second moment estimate. Applications on benchmark machine learning tasks of image classification using CNN architectures and language modeling using LSTM architecture demonstrate that the AdamSSM algorithm improves the gap between generalization accuracy and faster convergence than the recent adaptive gradient methods.},

Based on the distributed feedforward control method, a novel distributed dynamic output feedback controller is developed to ensure output synchronization for each agent in the mean-square sense. To facilitate the consensus analysis, we utilize the relationship between the graph Laplacian matrix and the incidence matrix and matrix transformation technique, and find sufficient solvability conditions relying on each agent’s dynamics, the maximum eigenvalue of communication graph and the packet loss probability for the scenarios of undirected graph and directed graph, respectively.

Motivated by this, we consider the problem of designing a more flexible grid-aware control scheme for enlarging the actuation power of a DC MG . That is, existing DGUs are able to adopt different operation modes by switching among two decentralized passivity-based subsystem control laws in dependency of their node status. To this purpose, we design a time- and state-dependent switching logic that coordinates the DGU mode transitions and ensures that the closed-loop interconnected MG possesses a unique equilibrium point. Then, we derive sufficient tuning conditions on the control parameters that ensure global exponential stability of this equilibrium by adopting a multiple Lyapunov functions approach that exploits the passive interconnection properties of the MG together with dwell-time methods for switched systems .

In particular, much attention is being turned to FL scenarios where the network is strongly heterogeneous in terms of communication resources (e.g., bandwidth) and data distribution. In these cases, communication between local machines ( agents ) and the central server ( Master ) is a main consideration. In this work, we present SHED , an original communication-constrained Newton-type (NT) algorithm designed to accelerate FL in such scenarios. SHED is by design robust to non independent identically distributed (non i.i.d.) data distributions, handles heterogeneity of agents’ communication resources (CRs), only requires sporadic Hessian computations, and achieves global asymptotic super-linear convergence. This is possible thanks to an incremental strategy, based on eigendecomposition of the local Hessian matrices , which exploits (possibly) outdated second-order information. SHED is thoroughly validated on real datasets by assessing (i) the number of communication rounds required for convergence, (ii) the overall amount of data transmitted and (iii) the number of local Hessian computations. For all these metrics, SHED shows superior performance against state-of-the art techniques like BFGS, GIANT and FedNL.},

  abstract     = {Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) faces challenges in dealing with constraints in control problems. Model predictive control (MPC) is, in comparison, well-known for its accommodation of constraints and stability guarantees, although its computation is sometimes prohibitive. This paper introduces an approach combining the two methodologies to overcome their individual limitations. The predictive control law for constrained linear quadratic regulation (CLQR) problems has been proven to be piecewise affine (PWA) while the value function is piecewise quadratic. We exploit these formal results from MPC to design an ADP method for CLQR problems with a known model. A novel convex and piecewise quadratic neural network with a local–global architecture is proposed to provide an accurate approximation of the value function, which is used as the cost-to-go function in the online dynamic programming problem. An efficient decomposition algorithm is developed to generate the control policy and speed up the online computation. Rigorous stability analysis of the closed-loop system is conducted for the proposed control scheme under the condition that a good approximation of the value function is achieved. Comparative simulations are carried out to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in terms of online computation and optimality .},

  abstract     = {This paper considers no-regret learning for repeated continuous-kernel games with lossy bandit feedback. Since it is difficult to give an explicit model of the utility functions in dynamic environments, the players’ actions can only be learned with bandit feedback. Moreover, due to unreliable communication channels or privacy protection, the bandit feedback may be lost or dropped at random. Therefore, we study the asynchronous online learning strategy of the players to adaptively adjust the next actions for minimizing the long-term regret loss. The paper provides a novel no-regret learning algorithm, called Online Gradient Descent with lossy bandits (OGD-lb). We first give the regret analysis for concave games with differentiable and Lipschitz utilities. Then we show that the action profile converges to a Nash equilibrium with probability 1 when the game is also strictly monotone. We further provide the mean-squared convergence rate O N p i − 2 k − 1 / 3 ONpi−2k−1/3 when the game is β β -strongly monotone, where N N denotes the number of players and p i pi is the update probability. In addition, we extend the algorithm to the case when the loss probability of the bandit feedback is unknown, and prove its almost sure convergence to Nash equilibrium for strictly monotone games. Finally, we take the resource management in fog computing as an application example, and carry out numerical experiments to empirically demonstrate the algorithm performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a sensor placement problem for secure state estimation in an adversarial environment. Specifically, this paper deals with a system consisting of n n agents where up to l l sensor measurements are potentially compromised by malicious adversaries and tackles the problem of sensor placement such that the system state can be reconstructed even if the measurements are compromised. However, since it is costly to deploy sensors for all agents, we also aim to place sensors at the lowest possible cost. We call this problem the optimal resilient sensor placement problem (ORSPP) and show that this problem is coNP-hard. Therefore, it is, in general, impossible to compute the ORSPP in polynomial time unless P = coNP P=coNP . On the positive side, however, we also provide that this problem can be solved in polynomial time if the network structure of the agents satisfies certain conditions. The concrete algorithm for the ORSPP is provided, and further, in the process of providing the coNP-hardness, we also derive a new form of a necessary and sufficient condition for secure state estimation. Finally, we show the results of numerical simulations using a random graph and a diffusion process .},

Recent work by our team focused on the existence of Monge maps for similarly constrained transport minimizing average kinetic energy . The present formulation in this paper, besides being substantially more general, is cast as a (generalized) multi-marginal transport problem — a problem of considerable interest in modern-day machine learning literature and motivated extensive computational analyses. An enabling feature of our formalism is the representation of an average quadratic cost on the speed of transport as a convex constraint that involves crossing times.},

The averaging result requires milder assumptions on the system matrices with respect to those needed by the previous averaging techniques for SIS. The interest of the proposed model is strengthened by the fact that it reduces to the classical averaged model for PWM systems when there are no jumps in the state.

We then present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the strictly stealthy deception attack. The design method for the attacker to achieve the strictly stealthy deception attack is also provided. Considering that the strictly stealthy attack strategy is associated with the undetectable points of the difference equations, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to find such points. It is shown that these points form a subspace which can be obtained in finite recursion steps. The corresponding defense strategy is further designed by avoiding the initial state falling into the subspace. For ϵ ϵ -stealthy attack, a necessary condition is provided for its existence. Furthermore, due to the fact that the difference system matrix does not have an unstable eigenvalue, it is proved that the ϵ ϵ -stealthy attack does not exist.

Specifically, we assume that the observed state traces are generated by an underlying dynamical system whose model is known but the control law is unknown. The main idea is to use the dynamic of the system to predict future states when evaluating the satisfaction of the STL formulae. To this end, effective approaches for the computation of feasible sets of STL formulae are provided. We show that, by explicitly utilizing the model information of the dynamical system, the proposed online monitoring algorithm can falsify or certify of the specification in advance compared with existing algorithms, where no model information is used. We also demonstrate the proposed monitoring algorithm by several real world case studies.},

To circumvent the two problems, we design a rolling self-triggered DMPC strategy for large-scale dynamically coupled systems with state and control input constraints. First, the optimal control problem where the cost is subject to the coupled dynamic and the constraints are subject to the uncoupled counterpart is proposed, forming the dual-model DMPC that is simple in design and analysis but yields good control performance. Second, the information exchange only occurs at some specified triggering instants determined by a rolling self-triggered mechanism, saving communication resources more significantly. The effectiveness of the designed strategy is verified by numerical simulations.},

It is proved that the resulting system is input-to-state stable, and the solutions of the system will not exceed the highest admissible level dependent on the disturbance amplitude.

Its favorable performance over classic maximum likelihood/prediction error methods (ML/PEM) has been verified by extensive simulations. Recently, we noticed a surprising observation: for some data sets and kernels, no matter how the hyper-parameters are tuned, the regularized least square estimate cannot have higher model fit than the least square (LS) estimate, which implies that for such cases, the regularization cannot improve the LS estimate. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to understand this observation. To this purpose, we first introduce the squared error (SE) criterion, and the corresponding oracle hyper-parameter estimator in the sense of minimizing the SE criterion. Then we find the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the regularization cannot improve the LS estimate, and we show that the probability that this happens is greater than zero. The theoretical findings are demonstrated through numerical simulations, and simultaneously the anomalous simulation outcome wherein the probability is nearly zero is elucidated, and due to the ill-conditioned nature of either the kernel matrix, the Gram matrix, or both.},

We then truncate this deterministic system to obtain a finite-dimensional linear system, and use it for moment approximation by iteratively propagating the moments along the finite-dimensional linear dynamics across time. We provide efficient online computation methods for this propagation scheme with several error bounds for the approximation. Our results also show that precise values of certain moments at a given time step can be obtained when the truncated system is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we investigate techniques to reduce the offline computation load using reduced Kronecker power. Based on the obtained approximate moments and their errors, we also provide hyperellipsoidal regions that are safe for some given probability bound. Those bounds allow us to conduct probabilistic safety analysis online through convex optimization.

Subsequently, the corresponding dynamic event-triggered mechanisms are designed specifically for them to reduce the frequency of interactive communication networks, and a distributed filter is devised to eliminate the non-differentiability problem of event-triggered signals, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a new barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to indirectly restrict the velocity vector . The key novelty of this BLF is that the controller gain matrix caused by the designed BLF can be approximated as an identity matrix , when the distance between the velocity component and the designed boundary is substantial. To prevent the designed dynamic event-triggered mechanisms from being triggered infinitely for a period of time, Zeno behavior is excluded. By leveraging Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat lemma, we demonstrate that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and the formation error asymptotically converges to the origin. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control schemes.},

It is well-known that the twisting algorithm achieves the second-order sliding mode condition using the sign information of both the plant states. When all the states are not available, the twisting algorithm cannot be extended to the estimation problem directly. Hence, our proposed observer approximates this unknown sign term for the non-measurable state in the twisting observer with a delayed output-based switching function. It is shown that under some suitable gain conditions, the observer can guarantee any arbitrary accuracy of estimation error for some appropriate delay parameter which can be varied online. The advantage of this observer is that one needs to control only the delay parameter to achieve the desired steady-state accuracy, unlike the additional nonlinear functions found in the existing observers. The application of this observer to output feedback stabilization is also discussed. The separation principle for the closed-loop system is shown by designing the gains of controller and observer independently. Finally, we illustrate the design and performance of the proposed state observation scheme through a numerical example.},

Solving such integer POP (iPOP) problems is challenging because of the integer requirements and the fact that two objective values may not be comparable. Nevertheless, we prove the essential uniqueness of all optimal objective values and identify two particular ones for each iPOP problem. Furthermore, for every optimal objective value of each iPOP problem, we respectively develop a “peak-shaving” and a “valley-filling” algorithm to construct an associated optimal ( 0 , 1 ) (0,1) -matrix via a series of sorting processes.

  abstract     = {Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller is the most widely used form of feedback control by far. However, a satisfactory theory is still lacking to explain the rationale of the widespread PID control , and the gap between theory and practice of PID needs to be filled by control scientists. It is worth noting that a recent work (Zhao and Guo, 2022) proved that the classical PID controller has the ability to globally stabilize a basic class of uncertain nonaffine nonlinear systems , while the system nonlinear function is required to have a linear growth rate with respect to the state variables. In this paper, we will consider the more general case where the system nonlinear function may have super-linear growth rates, and show that the classical PID control can always be designed to stabilize such systems in the semiglobal sense, provided that the smallest eigenvalue of the control gain matrix has a positive lower bound. Moreover, a three dimensional parameter set for the stabilizing PID parameters will be constructed. Furthermore, under some additional knowledge about the system uncertain functions, we will propose a simpler PD controller with desired compensation, and show that the proposed controllers can still be designed to achieve semiglobal stability and desired tracking targets.},

We construct a predictor-feedback control law that exponentially stabilizes the output to a desired reference point . This is the first time that a predictor-feedback design is constructed that achieves complete input delay compensation for such a type of input delay and despite that control input affects the plant also without delay. This is attributed to the particular structure of the nonlinear system considered, which allows to deriving an implementable formula for the predictor state at the proper prediction horizon. We then identify a class of nonlinear systems with input-dependent input delay of hydraulic type for which complete delay compensation, through construction of an exact predictor state, is achievable.},

We distinguish and study two particular settings: (i) the robust case, in which the active mode is completely unknown and unobservable, and (ii) the mode-dependent case, in which the controller depends on the current active switching mode. The technical developments are based on graph-theory tools, relying in particular on the path-complete Lyapunov functions framework. The main idea is to use directed and labeled graphs to encode Lyapunov inequalities to design robust and mode-dependent piecewise linear state-feedback controllers. This results in novel and flexible conditions, with the particular feature of being in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Our technique thus provides a first controller-design strategy allowing piecewise linear feedback maps and piecewise quadratic (control) Lyapunov functions by means of semidefinite programming. Numerical examples illustrate the application of the proposed techniques, the relations between the graph order, the robustness, and the performance of the closed loop.},

  abstract     = {Consensus in multi-agent dynamical systems is prone to be sabotaged by the adversary, which has attracted much attention due to its key role in broad applications. In this paper, we study a new false data injection (FDI) attack design problem, where the adversary with limited capability aims to select a subset of agents and manipulate their local multi-dimensional states to maximize the consensus convergence error. We first formulate the FDI attack design problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and prove it is NP-hard. Then, based on the submodularity optimization theory, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee that the convergence error is a submodular function of the set of compromised agents, satisfying the property of diminishing marginal returns. In other words, the benefit of adding an extra agent to the compromised set decreases as that set becomes larger. With this property, we exploit the greedy scheme to find the optimal compromised agent set that can produce the maximum convergence error when adding one extra agent to that set each time. Thus, the FDI attack set selection algorithms are developed to obtain the near-optimal subset of the compromised agents. Furthermore, we derive the analytical suboptimality bounds and the worst-case running time under the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulation results are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Many complex engineering systems consist of multiple subsystems that are developed by different teams of engineers. To analyse, simulate and control such complex systems, accurate yet computationally efficient models are required. Modular model reduction, in which the subsystem models are reduced individually, is a practical and an efficient method to obtain accurate reduced-order models of such complex systems. However, when subsystems are reduced individually, without taking their interconnections into account, the effect on stability and accuracy of the resulting reduced-order interconnected system is difficult to predict. In this work, a mathematical relation between the accuracy of reduced-order linear-time invariant subsystem models and (stability and accuracy of) resulting reduced-order interconnected linear time-invariant model is introduced. This result can subsequently be used in two ways. Firstly, it can be used to translate accuracy characteristics of the reduced-order subsystem models directly to accuracy properties of the interconnected reduced-order model. Secondly, it can also be used to translate specifications on the interconnected system model accuracy to accuracy requirements on subsystem models that can be used for fit-for-purpose reduction of the subsystem models. These applications of the proposed analysis framework for modular model reduction are demonstrated on an illustrative structural dynamics example.},

However, the recursive CRLB applies to variables belonging to the Euclidean space, and a recursive formulation on matrix Lie groups was not introduced yet. Hence, this paper derives a recursive formula of the Fisher information matrix on Lie groups, which reveals to be a natural extension of the information matrix on the Euclidean space. This generic result is applied to nonlinear Gaussian systems on Lie groups and tested on a navigation problem. The proposed recursive CRLB is consistent with state-of-the-art filters and shows a representative behavior with respect to the estimation errors. This paper provides a simple method to recursively compute the minimal variance of an estimator on matrix Lie groups. It enables to assess the behavior of an estimator, which is fundamental to implement robust algorithms.},

The desirable tractability of the LQ-MFG setup must be balanced in this case by the fact that feature (ii) of the model can lead to agents escaping to infinity in finite time. An upper bound on the time horizon is derived to guarantee that the finite escape time behavior is avoided. The existence of a Nash equilibrium for the infinite population is then established, and it is shown that this equilibrium remains ɛ ɛ ɛ -Nash for the more realistic case of a large but finite population of agents.

Its difference from the well-known consensus-based Nash equilibrium seeking method is that each player’s local estimate of other players’ actions is updated through a timestamp-based broadcasting protocol instead of typical consensus protocols. We show that the proposed timestamp-based projected gradient play is indeed a projected gradient play with time delay, which can be further transformed into a disturbed full-information projected gradient play. Hence, we prove its convergence to the Nash equilibrium in the case of diminishing step-size and to the ϵ ϵ -approximation Nash equilibrium in the case of fixed step-size. Both convergence results are established on jointly strongly connected networks. The major advantage of the proposed approach is that it is intrinsically flexible to communication delay, disturbance, and asynchronization. Furthermore, its convergence rate is empirically comparable to the full-information projected gradient play with the same step-sizes. Illustrative numerical simulations are presented for distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in both quadratic and non-quadratic Nash–Cournot games over different types of communication networks.},

The system and the environment are coupled by chance constraints due to the uncertainty in the environment estimate, which depends on control actions.

The proposed detection mechanism can significantly reduce the requirement on the network robustness compared with the well-known mean-subsequence-reduced (MSR) algorithms. The resilient consensus of general linear constrained MAS with F F -locally adversarial attacks is achieved when the communication network is ( F + 1 F+1 )-robust. Furthermore, the DMPC-based resilient consensus framework exhibits the following key feature: the constrained consensus performance is optimized by minimizing a set of control variables. We demonstrate that the recursive feasibility of the associated DMPC optimization problem and the resilient consensus convergence of the constrained MAS can be guaranteed.

Each agent maximizes its expected utility on consumption under its subjective probability measure. Specifically, we formulate the individual optimization problem as a sup–sup–inf problem, which is an optimal consumption and portfolio problem with a choice of a probability measure. Moreover, we provide an expression of the state-price density process in a market equilibrium, which derives the representations of the interest rate and the market price of risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the multi-agent model with heterogeneous views on the risks by considering a market equilibrium and solving sup–sup–inf problems on the choice of a probability measure. We emphasize that the setting, where each agent has heterogeneous views on different risks, incorporates a special case where each agent has only conservative or neutral views on risks with different degrees of conservativeness . Also, the setting includes the case where the agents have aggressive views on risks, commonly observed as bullish sentiments in the financial markets in the monetary easing after the global financial crisis and particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we present numerical examples of the interest rate model, which show how heterogeneous views of the multiple agents on the risks affect the shape of the yield curve.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the scenario where a perturbed nonlinear system transmits its output measurements to a remote observer via a packet-based communication network. The sensors are grouped into N N nodes and each of these nodes decides when its measured data is transmitted over the network independently. The objective is to design both the observer and the local transmission policies in order to obtain accurate state estimates, while only sporadically using the communication network. In particular, given a general nonlinear observer designed in continuous-time satisfying an input-to-state stability property, we explain how to systematically design a dynamic event-triggering rule for each sensor node that avoids the use of a copy of the observer, thereby keeping local calculation simple. We prove the practical convergence property of the estimation error to the origin and we show that there exists a uniform strictly positive minimum inter-event time for each local triggering rule under mild conditions on the plant. The efficiency of the proposed techniques is illustrated on a numerical case study of a flexible robotic arm .},

A novel connectivity preservation and collision-free distributed control algorithm is proposed by combining prescribed performance control (PPC) and exponential zeroing control barrier Lyapunov functions (EZCBFs). In particular, we impose the time-varying performance constraints on the relative position and velocity errors between the neighboring agents, and then a PPC-based formation control algorithm is developed such that the connectivity of the communication graph can be preserved at all times, and the prescribed transient and steady performance on the relative position and velocity error can be achieved. Subsequently, by introducing the EZCBFs method, an inequality constraint condition on the control input is derived to guarantee the collision-free formation motion. By regarding the PPC-based formation controller as a nominal input, an actual formation control input is given by solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem such that each agent achieves collision-free formation motion while guaranteeing the connectivity and prescribed performance as much as possible.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hierarchical design framework is proposed for distributed control of multi-agent systems. Different from the traditional distributed design philosophy that directly couples the agents’ cooperation and individual regulations, the proposed framework decouples these regulations and separates the distributed control design into two layers, i.e., the layer of reference signal generator design and the layer of tracking controllers design . Specifically, the nodes of the generator play the roles of some virtual agents that achieve the distributed control goal and the agents’ tracking controllers are used to track the reference signals produced by the generator. The novel design framework makes the agents reach the distributed control goal well and it has better design flexibility/practicality and stronger versatility/scalability. To demonstrate these advantages, two types of representative examples on hierarchical design are exhibited for multi-agent systems with mismatched disturbances and those with communication/input delays, respectively. All examples confirm that the proposed design framework is a natural choice in the presence of some complex factors, which provides not only simpler design but also more autonomy to the agents.},

In particular, several distributed leader observers are firstly given to estimate and reconstruct the leader’s state over a directed graph. The new discrete-time adaptive distributed output observer is presented to remove the need of having fully access to the leader’s system matrices and to reduce the dimension and information exchange in the developed distributed observers. In terms of this estimated information from the adaptive distributed output observer, a distributed output feedback controller integrated with an observer-based scheme is developed to compensate for the impact of unknown faults such that time-varying output formation tracking is achieved with a global exponential convergence.

The discrete variables are often excluded from the NMPC layer and determined at a supervisory layer, which typically leads to suboptimal solutions. In contrast, the proposed controller optimizes both classes of degrees of freedom within the NMPC layer, thereby enhancing the closed-loop performance. Our approach relies on a computationally efficient relaxation and integrality restoration strategy. Initially, a nominal controller computes relaxed central reference trajectories for the states and the input variables. These trajectories are then tracked by an ancillary NMPC controller before the integrality of the discrete variables is restored. The role of the ancillary controller is to ensure robustness against the integer restoration error as well as other disturbances based on a nonlinear Tube MPC approach. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions to establish recursive feasibility and guarantee robust closed-loop stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through two nonlinear simulation examples, affirming its viability and robustness.},

To solve this problem, a finite-state abstraction of the original system is first constructed, and then a controller is synthesised for the abstraction. Due to the disturbances and uncertainty in the environment, future states cannot be predicted exactly, and the abstraction must take this into account. For this purpose, the robust stutter bisimulation relation is introduced, which preserves the existence of controllers for any given linear temporal logic formula that excludes the next operator. States are related by the robust stutter bisimulation relation if the same target sets can be guaranteed to be reached or avoided under control of some controller, thus ensuring that disturbances have similar effect on paths that start in related states. It is shown that there exists a controller enforcing a linear temporal logic formula for the original system if and only if a controller exists for the abstracted system.

To overcome these challenges, we investigate two optimal control problems : (i) how testing needs can be minimized while maintaining the number of infected individuals below a desired threshold, and (ii) how peak infections can be minimized given a typically scarce testing budget. We find that in both cases the optimal testing policy for the well-known Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model is adaptive, with testing rates that depend on the epidemic state, and leads to significant cost savings compared to non-adaptive policies. By using the concept of observability , we then show that a central planner can estimate the required unknown epidemic state by complementing molecular tests, which are highly sensitive but have a short detectability window, with serology tests, which are less sensitive but can detect past infections.},

  abstract     = {In safety-critical applications that rely on the solution of an optimization problem, the certification of the optimization algorithm is of vital importance. Certification and suboptimality results are available for a wide range of optimization algorithms. However, a typical underlying assumption is that the operations performed by the algorithm are exact, i.e., that there is no numerical error during the mathematical operations , which is hardly a valid assumption in a real hardware implementation. This is particularly true in the case of fixed-point hardware, where computational inaccuracies are not uncommon. This article presents a certification procedure for the proximal gradient method for box-constrained QP problems implemented in fixed-point arithmetic. The procedure provides a method to select the minimal fractional precision required to obtain a certain suboptimality bound, indicating the maximum number of iterations of the optimization method required to obtain it. The procedure makes use of formal verification methods to provide arbitrarily tight bounds on the suboptimality guarantee. We apply the proposed certification procedure on the implementation of a non-trivial model predictive controller on 32-bit fixed-point hardware.},

The controller is designed in a bounded state area, rather than every observable state, in order to reduce control cost. The time delay is more general in terms of the classical differentiability assumption being relaxed. Compared with the existing papers on discrete-state-feedback stabilisation problem, a new method to estimate the difference between current-time state and discrete-time state is presented, as a result of which the conditions imposed on the underlying system and the control function are less restrictive.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the resilient distributed state estimation problem for moving robots over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) under deception attacks. The state of a moving robot consists of its position and orientation, evolving according to a nonlinear motion model, and the WSNs are mobile. These settings make the problem more challenging than most existing researches on the resilient distributed state estimation which recover stationary or linear states by static WSNs. To achieve the resilient distributed state estimation for the robot over a mobile sensor network (MSN), we propose a novel invariant extended Kalman filter-based resilient distributed state estimation approach. Specifically, based on the mappings between a Lie group and its Lie algebra, we first define a new type of estimation errors and linearize it. Utilizing the linearization results, the calculation of the current prior estimate based on the last posterior one is achieved by each sensor, which avoids the estimation biases induced by the computation of Jacobian matrices . Then, sensors in the MSN fuse the local prior estimates of their neighbors according to the covariance intersection fusion rule, obtaining more accurate estimates than their local prior ones. Finally, measurements collected by the sensors are used to correct the estimates. In the correction process, an adaptive gain is designed for each sensor to restrict the negative effects of the attacks on the estimates, which is crucial for the accomplishment of the resilient estimation task. We illustrate the performance of the approach by convergence analysis of the estimation errors based on the boundedness of the covariance matrix estimates computed in the state estimation process and verify it by simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a class of distributed online convex optimization problems for heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems. Agents in a network, knowing only their own outputs, need to minimize the time-varying costs through neighboring interaction subject to time-varying coupled inequality constraints . Based on the saddle-point technique, we design a continuous-time distributed controller which is shown to achieve constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound, matching those of the standard centralized online method. We further extend the control law to the event-triggered communication mechanism and show that the constant regret bound and sublinear fit bound are still achieved while reducing the communication frequency. Additionally, we study the situation of communication noise, i.e., the agent’s measurement of the relative states of its neighbors is disturbed by a noise. It is shown that, if the noise is not excessive, the regret and fit bounds are unaffected, which indicates the controller’s noise-tolerance capability to some extent. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to support the theoretical conclusions.},

The approach is built upon smooth periodic delayed feedback which is a special case of linear periodic time-varying feedback. In contrast to existing periodic control approaches, the proposed feedback achieves prescribed-time convergence of the state to zero rather than asymptotic convergence. At the same time its synthesis requires solving algebraic equations rather than periodic differential equations. Compared with full-order observer based output feedback, the dimensions of the dynamic equations in the reduced-order observer and dual observer based output feedback are respectively n − p n−p and n − m n−m , where n , m n,m and p p are respectively the number of state variables, inputs and outputs, which indicates that the established controllers are less expensive than the full-order observer based controllers in implementations.

In this paper, we propose an approach to significantly reduce the complexity of solving optimal control problems for a class of CPS with nonlinear dynamics . We exploit the property of differential flatness to simplify the Euler–Lagrange equations that arise during optimization, and this simplification eliminates the numerical instabilities that plague optimal control in general. We also present an explicit differential equation that describes the evolution of the optimal state trajectory, and we extend our results to consider both the unconstrained and constrained cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of our approach by generating the optimal trajectory for a planar manipulator with two revolute joints . We show in simulation that our approach is able to generate the constrained optimal trajectory in 4 . 5 ms 4.5ms while respecting workspace constraints and switching between a ‘left’ and ‘right’ bend in the elbow joint .},

Our algorithm is based on constrained zonotopes (CZs) and employs a DC programming approach (where DC stands for difference of convex functions). Recently, techniques such as mean value extension and first-order Taylor extension have been adapted from zonotopes to facilitate the propagation of CZs across nonlinear mappings. While the resulting algorithms, known as CZMV and CZFO, achieve higher precision compared to the original zonotopic versions, they still exhibit sensitivity to the wrapping and dependency effects inherent in interval arithmetic. These interval-related challenges can be mitigated through the use of DC programming, as it allows for the determination of approximation error bounds by solving optimization problems . One direct advantage of this technique is the elimination of the dependency effect. Our set-membership filter, referred to as CZDC, provides an alternative solution to CZMV and CZFO. To showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments using CZDC on two numerical examples.},

For this purpose, we adopt a fixed constant as the prediction horizon, which is restricted to being within a sufficiently narrow range. Its function is to offset the partial effect of each delay. With a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional based on an infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation, we prove the global exponential stability of the closed-loop system.

In such a setting, the performance of a standard economic MPC scheme without terminal conditions can generally be far from optimal even with arbitrarily long prediction horizons. Whereas there are modified economic MPC schemes that guarantee optimal performance , all of them are based on prior knowledge of the optimal period length or of the optimal periodic orbit itself. In contrast to these approaches, we propose to achieve optimality by multiplying the stage cost by a linear discount factor. This modification is not only easy to implement but also independent of any system- or cost-specific properties, making the scheme robust against online changes therein. Under standard dissipativity and controllability assumptions, we can prove that the resulting linearly discounted economic MPC without terminal conditions achieves optimal asymptotic average performance up to an error that vanishes with growing prediction horizons. Moreover, we can guarantee practical asymptotic stability of the optimal periodic orbit under the additional technical assumption that dissipativity holds with a continuous storage function. We complement these qualitative guarantees with a quantitative analysis of the transient and asymptotic average performance of the linearly discounted MPC scheme in a numerical simulation study.},

Nevertheless, most of the research on data-driven sliding mode control relied on identification techniques, which limits its online applications due to the special requirements of the data. In this paper, an input-mapping technique is inserted into the design framework of sliding mode control to compensate for the influence generated by the unknown dynamic of the system. The principal novelty of the proposed input-mapping sliding mode control strategy lies in that the sliding mode surface and the sliding mode controller are co-designed through online learning from historical input–output data to minimize an objective function. Then, the convergence rate of the system is improved significantly based on the method designed in this work.

The agent can service a task with a normal or high fidelity level, where fidelity refers to the degree of exactness and precision while servicing the task. Therefore, high-fidelity servicing results in higher-quality service but leads to larger service times and increased operator tiredness. We treat the human cognitive state as a lumped parameter that captures psychological factors such as workload and fatigue. The operator’s service time distribution depends on her cognitive dynamics and the fidelity level selected for servicing the task. Her cognitive dynamics evolve as a Markov chain in which the cognitive state increases with high probability whenever she is busy and decreases while resting. The tasks arrive according to a Poisson process and the operator is penalized at a fixed rate for each task waiting in the queue. We address the trade-off between high-quality service of the task and consequent penalty due to a subsequent increase in queue length using a discrete-time Semi-Markov Decision Process framework. We numerically determine an optimal policy and the corresponding optimal value function. Finally, we establish the structural properties of an optimal fidelity policy and provide conditions under which the optimal policy is a threshold-based policy.},

For the obstacle-free case, a dynamic output feedback controller is derived to ensure that the distance between the robot and the target globally converges to a desired constant. The smooth bounded controller is computationally efficient and can be easily implemented. For the obstacle-presence case, a collision-allowed control strategy is developed to guarantee that the robot escapes from circular obstacles and eventually maintains a given distance from the target. Numerical simulations and practical experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the control method.},

A minimal-order specified-time observer is first proposed for the linear system without the unknown input, which can estimate the state exactly at the preset time by seeking for the unique solution of a system of linear equations . To further release the computational burden, another form of the specified-time observer is designed. In the presence of the unknown input, it is shown that the existing reduced-order specified-time unknown input observer is not the minimal-order one. By introducing a singular transformation to decouple the effect of the unknown input, the minimal-order specified-time unknown input observer is presented, with the strong* observability capturing the sufficient and necessary condition. The robustness of the proposed observers is also discussed.},

The approach is applied to Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, providing also a method for the design of a tailored state observer with convergence guarantees.

Yet, these controllers have amassed popularity in recent years because of their practical use in feedback control applications, such as fluid flow control and sensor/actuator selection. The inherent difficulty of synthesizing SOF controllers is rooted in solving a series of non-convex problems that make the solution computationally intractable. In this note, we show that SOF synthesis is a convex problem for the specific case of systems with a l o s s l e s s lossless (i.e., energy-conserving) nonlinearity. Our proposed method ensures asymptotic stability of an SOF controller by enforcing the l o s s l e s s lossless behavior of the nonlinearity using a quadratic constraint approach. In particular, we formulate a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) using the approach, then show that the resulting BMI can be recast as a linear matrix inequality (LMI). The resulting LMI is a convex problem whose feasible solution , if one exists, yields an asymptotically stabilizing SOF controller.},

The first substance in the chain is introduced via an impulsive feedback where both the impulse frequency and weights are modulated by the measured output of the continuous part. It is shown that, under the standard assumptions on the IGO, a positive periodic solution with one firing of the pulse-modulated feedback in the least period also exists in models with any m ≥ 1 m≥1 .

By taking advantage of dynamic rather than static feedback, we design delay-independent dynamic state and output feedback compensators, respectively, to achieve asymptotic state regulation with global stability. In the case of dynamic state feedback, a structural condition is imposed on the inverse dynamics that are nonlinear yet imply linear zero dynamics. In the case of dynamic output feedback, more strict conditions on the nonlinearity are characterized to guarantee the existence of a dynamic output controller. In both cases, it is proved by the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, combined with the Barbalat’s lemma, that all the states of the time-delay minimum-phase systems are regulated to zero and boundedness of the closed-loop system is ensured. Two examples are given to validate the proposed delay-free dynamic compensators.},

This work addresses the minimum-time task planning problem for multi-agent systems under complex global tasks stated as syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic (sc-LTL) formulas. These tasks include the temporal and spatial requirements on both independent local actions and direct sub-team collaborations. The proposed solution is an anytime algorithm that combines the partial-ordering analysis of the underlying task automaton for task decomposition , and the branch and bound (BnB) search method for task assignment. We analyze the soundness, completeness and optimality regarding the minimal completion time. We show that a feasible and near-optimal solution is quickly reached while the search continues within the time budget. Furthermore, to handle fluctuations in task duration and agent failures during online execution, we propose an adaptation algorithm to synchronize execution status and re-assign unfinished subtasks dynamically to maintain correctness and optimality. Both algorithms are validated over systems of more than 10 agents via numerical simulations and hardware experiments, against several established baselines.},

Under a mild assumption, it is demonstrated that the observer is internally stable under the proposed optimal design. Moreover, the proposed online optimal design method is directly related to an algebra Riccati equation as time approaches infinity, and hence an offline optimal design method is further proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Under the proposed optimal designs, it is demonstrated that the observer can detect faults more timely and with much less computational complexity.

By a completely different approach, this paper further studies the distributed state estimation problem with two new features. First, the asymptotic convergence is strengthened to the exponential convergence. This strengthened result not only offers a guaranteed convergence rate, but also renders the error system total stability and thus the capability to withstand small disturbances . Second, the coupling gains of our local observers can be different from each other and thus offers greater design flexibility, while the coupling gains in the existing result were required to be identical. These two new features are achieved by establishing exponential stability for two classes of linear time-varying systems, which may have other applications.},

The blended dynamics theorem enables to predict the behavior of heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Therefore, once we get a blended dynamics for a particular computational task, design idea of node dynamics for individual heterogeneous agents can easily occur. In the continuous-time case, prediction by blended dynamics was enabled by high coupling gain among neighboring agents. In the discrete-time case, we propose an equivalent action, which we call multi-step coupling in this paper. Compared to the continuous-time case, the blended dynamics can have more variety depending on the coupling matrix .

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the distributed state estimation problem of continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, where communication channels are attacked by stochastic impulsive sequences. In a networked system, the communication channel between an agent and its neighbor is vulnerable to being attacked. Continuous attacks have been widely studied so far, but with the development of attack techniques, intermittent attacks have been emerging, which are more difficult to be identified and detected, and have not been well portrayed and studied. Therefore, this paper investigates a random intermittent injection attack, which leads to abrupt and random changes of the state information transmitted by the neighbors. First, this attack is modeled as a stochastic impulsive sequential attack, where both its impulsive time and impulsive intensity are random. Then a distributed observer under stochastic impulsive sequential attack is proposed. Since the impulsive attack destroys the stability of the system, in order to attenuate the impact of the impulsive attack, a large feedback gain is necessary. By using the graph theory, matrix theory and stochastic analysis, sufficient conditions for the existence of the distributed observer in the sense of mean square and in the sense of almost sure are presented, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed observer is verified by numerical simulations.},

Our focus is on reducing sensing and communication burdens between agents. Based on relative output measurements, a dynamic output-feedback (DOF) protocol is proposed, which, by leveraging the structure of the closed-loop dynamics, integrates a hybrid time/event-triggered sampling mechanism such that only intermittent interaction between agents is needed. Consensus conditions are established by the Lyapunov method and numerical simulations are provided for illustrating the effectiveness of the protocol. Compared with the existing results, the proposed DOF protocol has the following merits: (1) they rely on relative output measurements but do not need absolute measurements about agents; (2) they only require agents to intermittently interact with neighbors and thus can greatly reduce sensing and communication burdens between agents; and (3) the designed event-triggering conditions do not need to perform extra reconstruction operations that are computationally demanding.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a novel multi-agent linear stochastic approximation algorithm driven by Markovian noise and general consensus-type interaction, in which each agent evolves according to its local stochastic approximation process which depends on the information from its neighbors. The interconnection structure among the agents is described by a time-varying directed graph. While the convergence of consensus-based stochastic approximation algorithms when the interconnection among the agents is described by doubly stochastic matrices (at least in expectation) has been studied, less is known about the case when the interconnection matrix is simply stochastic. For any uniformly strongly connected graph sequences whose associated interaction matrices are stochastic, the paper derives finite-time bounds on the mean-square error, defined as the deviation of the output of the algorithm from the unique equilibrium point of the associated ordinary differential equation. For the case of interconnection matrices being stochastic, the equilibrium point can be any unspecified convex combination of the local equilibria of all the agents in the absence of communication. Both the cases with constant and time-varying step-sizes are considered. In the case when the convex combination is required to be a straight average and interaction between any pair of neighboring agents may be uni-directional, so that doubly stochastic matrices cannot be implemented in a distributed manner, the paper proposes a push-sum-type distributed stochastic approximation algorithm and provides its finite-time bound for the time-varying step-size case by leveraging the analysis for the consensus-type algorithm with stochastic matrices and developing novel properties of the push-sum algorithm. Distributed temporal difference learning is discussed as an illustrative application.},

Our design is essentially a nonlinear multi-objective control to achieve both safety and asymptotic tracking if there is no conflict between the tracking and safety, or to decrease the tracking error under the safety constraints otherwise. Different from existing methods for safety critical control problems, the design idea is to find a tracking controller without safety consideration, and then design a safety controller based on a control barrier function, which is capable of dealing with both tracking and safety issues. The efficiency of our design is illustrated by a mechanical system in both non-conflicted and conflicted cases.},

  abstract     = {We consider a multi-agent network where each node has a stochastic (local) cost function that depends on the decision variable of that node and a random variable , and further, the decision variables of neighboring nodes are pairwise constrained. There is an aggregated objective function for the network, composed additively of the expected values of the local cost functions at the nodes, and the overall goal of the network is to obtain the minimizing solution to this aggregate objective function subject to all the pairwise constraints. This is to be achieved at the level of the nodes using decentralized information and local computation, with exchanges of only compressed information allowed by neighboring nodes. The paper develops algorithms and obtains performance bounds for two different models of local information availability at the nodes: (i) sample feedback, where each node has direct access to samples of the local random variable to evaluate its local cost, and (ii) bandit feedback, where samples of the random variables are not available, but only the values of the local cost functions at two random points close to the decision are available to each node. For both models, with compressed communication between neighbors, we have developed decentralized saddle-point algorithms that deliver performances no different (in order sense) from those without communication compression; specifically, we show that deviation from the global minimum value and violations of the constraints are upper-bounded by O ( T − 1 2 ) O(T−12) and O ( T − 1 4 ) O(T−14) , respectively, where T T is the number of iterations.

When an associated transfer function matrix is of full normal row rank, a matrix rank based necessary and sufficient condition is derived for parameter identifiability. This condition can be verified recursively. An algorithm is suggested to find a set of frequencies, at which system frequency responses are capable to uniquely determine its parameter values.

Our setting is in contrast to most of the existing literature that considers the Carnot paradigm, alternating contact with heat baths having different fixed temperatures, hot and cold. Specifically, we consider a periodic and bounded but otherwise arbitrary temperature profile and derive explicit bounds on the power and efficiency achievable by a suitably controlling potential that couples the thermodynamic engine to the external world – the time-varying potential represents the control input to the system. A standing assumption in our analysis is that the norm of the gradient of the potentials is bounded – in the absence of any such constraint on the control input, the physically questionable conclusion of arbitrarily large power can be drawn.},

A concept and sufficient conditions for solving this problem are first introduced and derived based on adaptive control Lyapunov function method. One difficulty obstructing current works to solve this problem is that inverse optimality and stability of the closed-loop system are not necessarily achieved simultaneously in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. To this end, a new auxiliary system and a cost functional that puts integral penalty on the state, control, parameter estimate and unmodeled dynamics are proposed to develop a new inverse optimal adaptive feedback approach. Then a small-gain approach is proposed to establish the links between inverse optimality and stability of the closed-loop system. It is proved that if inverse optimality is achieved and the small-gain condition holds, the closed-loop system is uniformly bounded and the system state converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin.

These point sources are arbitrarily located on the x x – y y plane and the boundary point sources, whose either x x or y y coordinate is extremal , already orient to the non-coplanar target point. The only global information shared among the remaining point sources is the positive directions of the global coordinate axes x x and y y , and hence, they have to rely on sensing the changes of the orientation angles of their nearest neighbors to adjust their own orientation. We prove that under our control law, the orientation lines will asymptotically intersect at the same point of concurrency as the boundary point sources. The main idea behind the designed control law is the intuitive argument from Euclidean geometry that reducing the differences between the distances to the x x – y y plane of the pairwise intersection points of the orientation lines leads to realizing concurrent targeting. We further show the boundedness and exponential convergence speed of the orientation angles.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate a class of stochastic aggregative games, where each player has an expectation-valued objective function depending on its local strategy and the aggregate of all players’ strategies. We propose a distributed algorithm with operator extrapolation to search for the Nash equilibrium , in which each player maintains an estimate of this aggregate by exchanging this information with its neighbors over a time-varying network, and updates its equilibrium estimate through the mirror descent method. Specially, we embed an operator extrapolation utilizing two step historical gradient samples at the search direction so as to accelerate the convergence. Under the generalized strongly monotone assumption characterized by the Bregman’s distance on the pseudo-gradient mapping, we prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve the optimal convergence rate O ( 1 / k ) O(1/k) in terms of the expected Bregman distance to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, the algorithm performance is demonstrated via numerical simulations.},

First of all, aimed at the characteristics of the Roesser model, the horizontal and vertical disturbance observers and sliding surface functions are established for the addressed two-dimensional systems, respectively. Then based on the disturbance estimation and rejection technique, a modified reaching law and its corresponding sliding mode controller are designed to achieve the system robustness and disturbance attenuation. To reduce the resource usage, the event-triggered strategy is further incorporated in the design of sliding mode control law.

We study a finite well-mixed heterogeneous population of individuals choosing between the two strategies, cooperation and defection , and earning based on their payoff matrices that can be unique to each individual. At each time step, an arbitrary individual becomes active to update her decision by imitating the highest earner in the population. We show that almost surely the dynamics reach either an equilibrium state or a non-singleton minimal positively invariant set , a fluctuation set , in the long run. In addition to finding all equilibria, we characterize the fluctuation sets, provide necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for their existence, and approximate their basins of attraction. Our results theoretically explain earlier reported simulation results and shed new light on the boundedly rational nature of imitation behaviours.},

  abstract     = {Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are organized prolonged cyberattacks by sophisticated attackers with the intent of stealing critical information. Although APT activities are stealthy and evade detection by traditional detection tools, they interact with the system components to make progress in the attack. These interactions lead to information flows that are recorded in the form of a system log. Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) has been shown to be an effective way to detect APTs using information flows. A DIFT-based detection mechanism dynamically performs security analysis on the information flows to detect possible attacks. However, wide range security analysis using DIFT results in a significant increase in performance overhead and high rates of false-positives and false-negatives. In this paper, we model the strategic interaction between APT and DIFT as a non-cooperative stochastic game. The game unfolds on a state space constructed from an information flow graph (IFG) that is extracted from the system log. The objective of the APT in the game is to choose transitions in the IFG to find an optimal path in the IFG from an entry point of the attack to an attack target. On the other hand, the objective of DIFT is to dynamically select nodes in the IFG to perform security analysis for detecting APT. Our game model has imperfect information as the players are unaware of the actions of the opponent. We consider two scenarios of the game (i) the false-positive and false-negative rates of DIFT (i.e., transition probabilities of the game) are known and (ii) the false-positive and false-negative rates are unknown. For case (i), we propose a value iteration-based algorithm and prove that the solution converges to the optimal solution (Nash equilibrium). Case (ii) translates to an incomplete information game with unknown transition probabilities. For case (ii), we propose a supervised learning-based algorithm, referred to as Hierarchical Supervised Learning (HSL) algorithm. HSL integrates a neural network, to predict the value vector of the game, with a policy iteration algorithm to compute an approximate equilibrium. We implemented our algorithms for cases (i) and (ii) on real attack datasets for nation state and ransomware attacks and validated the performance of our approach. We compared the performance of the HSL algorithm when the transition probabilities are unknown with instances with known transition probabilities and demonstrated that HSL algorithm converges to a solution close to optimal (i.e., optimal value vector) while the value vector obtained using greedy does not converge to optimal for 44.4% of the states and the mean absolute error is almost 200 times that of the HSL.},

Many works have focused on the consistency of the objective values and the iterates returned by the SA based algorithms. It is of fundamental interest to know how to quantify the uncertainty associated with SA solutions via the confidence regions of a prescribed level of significance for the true solution. In this paper, we discuss the framework of constructing the asymptotic confidence regions of the optimal solution to distributed stochastic optimization problem with a focus on the distributed stochastic gradient tracking method. To attain this goal, we first present the asymptotic normality of Polyak–Ruppert averaged distributed stochastic gradient tracking method. We then estimate the corresponding covariance matrix through online estimators. Finally, we provide a practical procedure to build the asymptotic confidence regions for the optimal solution. Numerical tests are also conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

We show that the existence of these two sets implies the existence of a robust control invariant set between both regions. We also provide results that allow finding an inner set from a given target outer set and we show a way of using both sets in Model Predictive Control schemes such that the target region is never abandoned in spite of the fact that nor that region neither the inner set are invariant. We also illustrate the ideas with an example in which the inner and outer sets are very simple notwithstanding that any robust invariant set is not convex.},

It decomposes the nonlinear SID problem into a series of linear least-square problems (in a precise sense), which can be solved analytically. This is in contrast to many existing methods that rely on iterative search of the global minimum. On the other hand, it is also a generalization of the invariant-subspace (ISP) based SID method. It inherits the nice property of the ISP method that the advantages of time-domain and frequency-domain SID methods are combined. In the paper, a persistence of excitation (PE) condition for the CM method is derived, which is described by the rank of certain Khatri–Rao product. Under the PE condition, the identification error is shown to be bounded within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin when measurement noise is presented.},

By directly referring to signals, this definition readily applies to any input-to-output mapping. As an illustration of this potentiality, this paper tackles the case where input and state constraints are imposed on the system. This context is indeed of foremost importance since input redundancy has been historically regarded as a way to deal with input saturations. An example illustrating how constraints can challenge redundancy is offered right at the outset. A more complex phenomenology is highlighted. This motivates the enrichment of the existing framework on redundancy. Then, a sufficient condition for redundancy to be preserved when imposing constraints is offered in the most general context of arbitrary constraints. It is shown that redundancy can be destroyed only when input and state trajectories lie on the border of the set of constraints almost all the time. Finally, those results are specialized and expanded under the assumption that input and state constraints are linear.},

It is assumed that unknown but bounded disturbances perturb its dynamical model. An error-based version of a generalized proportional–integral observer (GPIO) is proposed to estimate these perturbations, and saturation functions, based on position measurement and estimated velocity errors, are designed to achieve the control objective. Specifically, it is shown that the leader agents converge to a desired geometric pattern following a desired trajectory simultaneously. Furthermore, the follower agents converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders. The result applies to a group of robots in which a directed spanning tree gives the communication topology among the leaders with a root in the main leader. At the same time, each follower receives information from at least one leader agent, and the communication is directed. Real-time experiments and a comparison with a robust control technique exhibit the excellent performance of the proposed GPIO and control strategy in achieving formation containment control.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the approximation of the infinite-horizon value function of the continuous-time switched linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. We propose a two successive approximation approach to achieving arbitrarily high accuracy. The infinite-horizon value function is first approximated by a finite-horizon value function, and the resulting truncation error is shown to converge to zero exponentially as the length of the control horizon increases. Then, the finite-horizon value function is approximated through a uniform discretization of the switched linear system , and the approximation error is proven to be proportional to the discretization step. These theoretical results facilitate the development of an efficient approximation algorithm, which further results in a near-optimal control policy. Compared with the existing methods, our algorithm obviates numerical issues induced by singular optimal control. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

We derive a new sufficient condition for k k -contraction of a Lurie system. For k = 1 k=1 , our sufficient condition reduces to the standard stability condition based on the bounded real lemma and a small gain condition. However, Lurie systems often have more than a single equilibrium and are thus not contractive with respect to any norm. For k = 2 k=2 , our condition guarantees a well-ordered asymptotic behavior of the closed-loop system: every bounded solution converges to an equilibrium, which is not necessarily unique. We demonstrate our results by deriving a sufficient condition for k k -contraction of a general networked system, and then applying it to guarantee k k -contraction in a Hopfield neural network, a nonlinear opinion dynamics model, and a 2-bus power system .},

Involving both the transient response and the final consensus state, the problem is described as a constrained non-separable optimization problem. Inspired by the randomized Jacobi proximal alternating direction method of multipliers , the proposed algorithm makes it possible for only a fraction of agents to solve their private subproblems in parallel at each iteration, which greatly saves computational resources and enhances running efficiency. The convergence analysis of the algorithm gives fully distributed convergence conditions. A trade-off between the convergence speed and resource savings is then obtained, where the convergence rate is estimated to be at least O 1 t O1t . Furthermore, the algorithm can be accelerated to enjoy a convergence rate of O 1 t 2 O1t2 by adaptively adjusting the auxiliary parameters properly.

Linearizations are not involved, making this controller suitable beyond the limited scope of trim maneuvers. Furthermore, the controller features an adaptive bounded law that is used to compensate for unknown exogenous perturbations. The Lyapunov-based control design is rooted in an integral backstepping process, wherein the origin of the closed-loop total system error is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable.

In this paper, we develop systematic ways to deal with this issue. In particular, we first introduce the guidelines for kernel design and then extend the system theoretic framework to design the so-called non-causal simulation-induced (NCSI) kernel, and we also study its structural properties , including stability and semiseparability.

A set of actuators is chosen to be used by the system so that a metric of controllability and actuation attack resilience is maximized, given only partial knowledge of the physics of the system. Such a metric is related to the trace of a game theoretic Gramian, which is obtained by solving a zero-sum game between a defender who acts as a minimizer and wants to regulate the system, and an attacker who acts as a maximizer with an eventual goal to disrupt the regulation. To account for the lack of full knowledge of the system dynamics , we design an estimator that can learn the trace of the proposed game theoretic Gramian online, by utilizing data obtained across the system’s trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a scheduling algorithm that utilizes the estimator to select actuators for the system in an online manner. In fact, we prove that the set of actuators that optimize the game-based metric will be learnt and scheduled permanently in finite time. Finally, we show that the learning-based actuator placement procedure can be utilized, in its steady state, to detect a large class of actuation attacks in a partially model-free manner.

Under this setting, the fastest (worst-case) stabilizing rate is proposed as a quantitative metric of the systems’ stabilizability . Conditions are derived on when this stabilizing rate can be exactly achieved by an admissible control policy and a counter example is given to show that the stabilizing rate may not always be attained by a mode-dependent linear state feedback control policy. Bounds on the stabilizing rate are derived using (semi)norms. When such bounds are tight, the corresponding extremal norms are characterized geometrically. Numerical algorithms based on ellipsoid and polytope norms are developed for computing bounds of the stabilizing rate and illustrated through examples.},

We consider a DES plant controlled by a supervisor, whose security requirement is to maintain the initial-secret of the system undetected, i.e., it does not want to reveal the fact that it was initiated from a secret state. On the other hand, there exists an active attacker that can tamper with the observations received by the supervisor by, e.g., hacking into the communication channel between the sensors and the supervisor. The objective of the attacker is to deceive the supervisor such that the initial-secret is revealed due to incorrect control actions. We investigate the problem from the attacker’s point of view and focus on synthesizing attack strategies that threaten the security of the system. We consider two levels of success of the attacker: one requires that the attacker can detect the initial-secret of the system “ almost surely ” and the other only requires that the attacker has the possibility to detect the initial-secret of the system. For both cases, we present algorithms for synthesizing successful attack strategies. Our approach is based on the All Attack Structure (AAS) which records state estimates for both the supervisor and the attacker. Structural properties of the security requirements are also leveraged to reduce the synthesis complexity. A running academic example is provided to illustrate the proposed synthesis procedures.},

The key idea of zeroth-order optimization lies in the ability for a learner to build gradient estimates by queries sent to the cost function, and then traditional gradient descent algorithms can be executed replacing gradients by the estimates. For optimization over large-scale multi-agent systems with decentralized data and costs, zeroth-order optimization can continue to be utilized to develop scalable and distributed algorithms. In this paper, we aim at understanding the trend in performance transitioning from centralized to distributed zeroth-order algorithms in terms of convergence rates , and focus on multi-agent systems with time-varying communication networks. We establish a series of convergence rates for distributed zeroth-order subgradient algorithms under both one-point and two-point zeroth-order oracles. Apart from the additional node-to-node communication cost due to the distributed nature of algorithms, the established rates in convergence are shown to match their centralized counterpart. We also propose a multi-stage distributed zeroth-order algorithm that better utilizes the learning rates, reduces the computational complexity, and attains even faster convergence rates for compact decision set.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in modern, real-world applications. Yet, estimating the unknown parameters of stochastic, nonlinear dynamical models remains a challenging problem. The majority of existing methods employ maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. However, these methods suffer from some limitations, most notably the substantial computational time for inference coupled with limited flexibility in application. In this work, we propose DeepBayes estimators that leverage the power of deep recurrent neural networks. The method consists of first training a recurrent neural network to minimize the mean-squared estimation error over a set of synthetically generated data using models drawn from the model set of interest. The a priori trained estimator can then be used directly for inference by evaluating the network with the estimation data. The deep recurrent neural network architectures can be trained offline and ensure significant time savings during inference. We experiment with two popular recurrent neural networks — long short term memory network (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method on different example models and perform detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches. We also provide a study on a real-world nonlinear benchmark problem. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach is asymptotically as good as the Bayes estimator .},

These problems are first reduced to semi-infinite programs embedded with ordinary differential equations by performing the control vector parameterization technique.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the synchronization of heterogeneous agents interacting over a dynamical network is studied. The edge dynamics can model the inter-agent communications which are often heterogeneous by nature. They can also model the controllers of the agents which may be different for each agent or uniform for all the agents. Novel synchronization conditions are obtained for both cases from a phase perspective by exploiting a recently developed small phase theorem. The conditions scale well with the network and reveal the trade-off between the phases of node dynamics and edge dynamics. We also study the synchronizability problem which aims to characterize the allowable diversity of the agents for which controllers can be designed so as to achieve synchronization. The allowable diversity is captured in terms of phase conditions engaging the residue matrices of the agents at their persistent modes. Controller design algorithms are provided for the cases of agent-dependent and uniform controllers, respectively.},

The internal dynamics of each oscillator are general enough to capture their time-varying natural frequency as well as physical couplings and unknown bounded terms. A communication layer is set in place to allow the oscillators to exchange synchronizing coupling actions through a tree-like leaderless network. In particular, we present a class of hybrid coupling rules depending only on local information to ensure uniform global practical or asymptotic synchronization, which is impossible to obtain by using the Kuramoto model customarily used in the literature. We further show that the synchronization set can be made uniformly globally prescribed finite-time stable by selecting the coupling function to be discontinuous at the origin. Novel mathematical tools on non-pathological functions and set-valued Lie derivatives are developed to carry out the stability analysis. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in simulations where we apply our synchronizing hybrid coupling rules to models of power grids previously used in the literature.},

When a model of the system is available, barrier certificates have been successfully applied for ensuring the satisfaction of safety specifications. In this work, we formulate the computation of barrier certificates as a robust convex program (RCP). Solving the acquired RCP is hard in general because the model of the system that appears in one of the constraints of the RCP is unknown. We propose a data-driven approach that replaces the uncountable number of constraints in the RCP with a finite number of constraints by taking finitely many random samples from the trajectories of the system. We thus replace the original RCP with a scenario convex program (SCP) and show how to relate their optimizers. We guarantee that the solution of the SCP is a solution of the RCP with a priori guaranteed confidence when the number of samples is larger than a specific value. This provides a lower bound on the safety probability of the original unknown system together with a controller in the case of synthesis. We also discuss an extension of our verification approach to a case where the associated robust program is non-convex and show how a similar methodology can be applied. Finally, the applicability of our proposed approach is illustrated through three case studies.},

This approach has been widely used in the literature and numerous sufficient conditions of stability have been proposed and expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The main criticism of the method that is often pointed out is that these LMI conditions are only sufficient, and there is a lack of information regarding the reduction of the conservatism. Recently, scalable methods have been investigated using Bessel–Legendre inequality or orthogonal polynomial-based inequalities. The interest of these methods relies on their hierarchical structure with a guarantee of reduction of the level of conservatism. However, the convergence is still an open question that will be answered for the first time in this paper. The objective is to prove that the stability of a time-delay system implies the feasibility of these scalable LMI, at a sufficiently large order of the Legendre polynomials . Moreover, the proposed contribution is even able to provide an analytic estimation of this order, giving rise to a necessary and sufficient LMI for the stability of time-delay systems.},

The agents are assumed to have a severely under-actuated form of the unicycle kinematics, with the linear speeds being constant and the angular speeds being their only control inputs. The target is assumed to be stationary and can represent a landmark, beacon, etc . In order to achieve the desired formation, the controller design is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a bearing based attractive control law is proposed for every agent. Under the proposed law, the analysis of the relative motions reveals interesting behaviours like gathering and scattering of the agents. Building upon the attractive control law, in the second stage, the appropriate values of the controller parameters are determined which lead to a target centric circular formation. These parameters can also be suitably adjusted to achieve a pre-specified value of the radius of the circle and a desired distribution of the agents along the circle. The highlight of the work is that the convergence to the desired formation is guaranteed from almost all initial conditions of the agents by controlling only their angular speeds. Simulation results are also presented to illustrate the proposed theoretical results.},

More general than a linear Gaussian system, a linear SG system is presented, where the initial state , process noise, and measurement noise are mutually independent SGs. We first investigate the SG distribution and propose an SG process. Then, we develop a linear state-space model of the SG process, which subsumes the linear Gaussian system model in an analogous form. With additional parameters beyond the linear Gaussian case , it can model some practical problems involving certain asymmetry (skewness). Finally, for the linear SG system, we derive a finite fixed-dimensional exact filter, which is similar to the Kalman filter (KF) in structure and computation. The proposed recursive filter obtains the evolving posterior distribution exactly and includes the KF as a special case. As an illustration, our proposed skew-Gaussian filter is demonstrated via a simulation study.},

Although the traditional power iterative method can be applied to approximate the extremal eigenvalues which have the largest modulus, it has two limitations: (1) the extremal eigenvalues must be real numbers , and (2) the structures of the extremal eigenvalues should be known a priori. In this paper, a novel power iterative method is proposed to approximate the extremal eigenvalues. Compared with the traditional power iterative method, the method in this paper can (1) determine the types of the extremal eigenvalues without prior knowledge of the matrix; (2) approximate the true values of the extremal eigenvalues regardless of their type; (3) become a worthy addition to SSS algorithm and gradient descent algorithm.

In addition, the proposed algorithm is fully distributed in the sense that the gain parameter can be determined locally and does not require any global information of the network.

Different from centralized systems, the communication coupling of MASs enables attackers to have more complex adverse influences. In view of this, we focus on how attacks perform ripple effect by spreading their influences to the agents receiving no compromised communication data. First of all, the existence of cooperative false-data injection (CFDI) attacks is studied based on the spectral radius of system matrices. Further, we explore attack ripple effect from the relations between impaired agents and attack targets against communication links. Therefore, with the geometric and algebraic properties of edge-to-node incidence matrices, a necessary and sufficient condition of minimum attack targets is developed. On this basis, the protection targets of communication data are qualitatively analyzed to resist CFDI attacks in MASs. The numerical simulations conducted on a group of two-link planar robots illustrate the theoretical results.},

As measurement noise is omnipresent in practice and can have detrimental effects , for instance, by inducing Zeno behavior in the closed-loop system and with that the lack of a positive lower bound on the inter-event times, rendering the event-triggered control design practically useless, it is of great importance to address this gap in the literature. To do so, we present a general approach for set stabilization of (distributed) event-triggered control systems affected by additive measurement noise. It is shown that, under general conditions, Zeno-free static as well as dynamic triggering rules can be designed such that the closed-loop system satisfies an input-to-state practical set stability property. We ensure Zeno-freeness by proving the existence of a uniform strictly positive lower-bound on the minimum inter-event time. The general approach is applied to point stabilization and consensus problems as particular cases, where we show that, under similar assumptions as the original work, existing schemes can be redesigned to robustify them to measurement noise. Consequently, using this approach, noise-robust triggering conditions can be designed both from the ground up and by simple redesign of several important existing schemes.

  abstract     = {At the beginning of this century, Hegselmann and Krause proposed a dynamical model for opinion formation that is referred to as the Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics (BCOD) model and that has since attracted a wide interest from different research communities. The model can be viewed as a dynamic network, in which each agent is endowed with a state variable representing an opinion and two agents interact if the distance between their opinions does not exceed a constant confidence bound. This relation of instantaneous proximity between the opinions naturally induces a dynamic interaction graph. At each stage of the opinion iteration, all agents synchronously update their opinion to the average of all opinions that belong to the neighbors in the interaction graph. BCOD models exhibit a broad variety of phenomena that cannot be studied by traditional methods, and their analysis has enriched the systems and control field with a number of novel mathematical tools. This fact, together with the existence of an extensive literature on the topic scattered across different fields, calls for a systematic presentation of the existing results on this class of dynamic networks. The aim of this survey is to provide an overview of BCOD models with time-synchronous interactions, with possibly asymmetric and heterogeneous confidence bounds. Conditions on the different classes of BCOD which ensure the convergence (in finite time or asymptotically) of the opinions are discussed, and the possible structures of the terminal opinions are described. The numerous phenomena highlighted in the literature from numerical studies, e.g., the characterization of steady state behaviors and the sensitivity to confidence thresholds, are also reviewed. Finally, some recent modifications and applications of BCOD models are discussed, and suggestions of directions for future research are provided.},

Under this new anti-windup design framework, sufficient conditions are established for estimating the domain of attraction and the nonlinear L 2 L2 gain of saturated systems. Based on these conditions, we formulate optimization problems to determine the optimal gains of anti-windup and performance compensators for enlarging the domain of attraction and reducing the nonlinear L 2 L2 gain. Simulation results show that, compared with the existing methods, our proposed approach has the ability to acquire a significantly larger estimate of the domain of attraction, a significantly tighter estimate of the nonlinear L 2 L2 gain, and significantly higher transient quality in reference tracking.},

  abstract     = {We present two adaptive control methods conceived to enable a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) to perform a class of aerobatic maneuvers in the presence of aerodynamic-coefficient and torque-latency variations induced by changes of the local flow fields during high-speed aerobatic flight. First, we introduce a linear time-varying (LTV) dynamical model, which is assumed to have unknown time-dependent parameters, to describe the aerodynamic effects acting on the actuation dynamics of the system. Then, we present the design of a Lyapunov-based adaptive control scheme aimed to compensate for undesired behavior of the LTV actuator dynamics, according to which we derive the control and adaptation laws from a single Lyapunov candidate function. Next, we propose a modular adaptive control scheme to address the same problem, but in which the adaptation law is specified separately from that of the controller. We use modern nonlinear theory to deduce and analyze the conditions that guarantee the global asymptotic stability of both adaptive control strategies. In order to exemplify the controller synthesis procedures, we implemented both adaptive control methods on a quadrotor UAV to perform three different types of aerobatic-flight maneuvers—namely, triple flips, Pugachev’s cobras , and mixed flips. The obtained experimental results provide compelling evidence of the effectiveness of the two proposed methods to compensate for the undesired effects induced by aerodynamic-coefficient and torque-latency variations. Furthermore, the experimental data demonstrate that both adaptive schemes significantly improve the flight performance of the quadrotor UAV during the execution of aerobatic maneuvers, compared to those achieved with a controller that disregards the LTV actuator dynamics induced by high-speed aerodynamic effects. The suitability of the time-varying approach used to model the influence of high-speed local flow fields on the dynamics of the controlled UAV was indirectly validated through data obtained during the aerobatic-flight experiments presented here.},
