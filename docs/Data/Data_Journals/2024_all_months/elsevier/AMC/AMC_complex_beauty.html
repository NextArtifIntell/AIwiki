  abstract     = {Corruption of third-party judges seriously undermines the level of cooperation. Without intervention, more corruptors and defectors would emerge, disrupting social harmony. Therefore, introducing an anti-corruption mechanism is crucial for the evolution of cooperation. In this paper, we propose a social monitoring mechanism to monitor third-party judges so that their payoffs are affected by the proportions of cooperators. Monte Carlo simulations on periodic boundary lattices. The results show that the social monitoring mechanism is effective in promoting cooperation and inhibiting corruption, and enhances the effectiveness of zealots in promoting cooperation. This facilitation effect is not only manifested in the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma Game but also in the Snowdrift Game, which confirms the robustness of the results. Our research provides new insights for solving social dilemmas and curbing corruption.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we construct a nonlinear evolutionary game model to analyze the cooperation mechanisms of the population based on a nonlinear relationship among environment and strategies. In the model, replicator dynamics and aspiration dynamics are used to explore the evolutionary outcomes of collective decision, respectively. The results suggest that the environment tends to become progressively more affluent as the number of cooperators increases, if there is a smaller intensity of environmental destruction of defectors. Interestingly, the enriched environments may attract more defectors. Hence, the population requires a higher level of vigilance against plentiful environments in response to the emergence of defectors. As opposed to replicator dynamics, aspiration dynamics can avoid the persistent oscillatory loops due to the level of aspiration. Further, we investigate the effect of complexity between the population strategy and the environment on the evolutionary outcomes. It is found that higher level of complexity can drive the environment closer to a state of affluence, but the population&#39;s strategy structure will not be modified. These insights into the relationship between environment and strategies further our understanding of the evolutionary mechanism of population and society.},

On the other hand, motivated by the approximation of special functions with two asymptotic parameters, Nemes has generalized Laplace&#39;s method by considering Laplace integrals with two asymptotic parameters of a different asymptotic order. Nemes considers a linear dependence of the phase function on the two asymptotic parameters. In this paper, we investigate if the simplifying ideas introduced in López, Pagola and Perez (2009) [9] for Laplace integrals with one large parameter may be also applied to the more general Laplace integrals considered in Nemes&#39;s theory. We show in this paper that the answer is yes, but moreover, we show that those simplifying ideas can be applied to more general Laplace integrals where the phase function depends on the large variable in a more general way, not necessarily in a linear form. We derive new asymptotic expansions for this more general kind of integrals with simple and explicit formulas for the coefficients of the expansion. Our theory can be applied to special functions with two or more large parameters of a different asymptotic order. We give some examples of special functions that illustrate the theory.},

A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years, tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) which is based on tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) has got a lot of attention in recovering low-rank tensor corrupted by sparse noise. However, most TRPCA methods only consider the global structure of the image, ignoring the local details and sharp edge information of the image, resulting in the unsatisfactory restoration results. In this paper, to fully preserve the local details and edge information of the image, we propose a new TRPCA method by introducing a total generalized variation (TGV) regularization. The proposed method can simultaneously explore the global and local prior information of high-dimensional data. Specifically, the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) is employed to develop the global structure feature. Moreover, we introduce the TGV, a higher-order generalization of total variation (TV), to preserve the local details and edges of the underlying image. Subsequently, the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm is introduced to solve the proposed model. Sufficient experiments on color images and videos have demonstrated that our method is superior to other comparison methods.},

To process the measurement output and schedule the transmission sequence for relieving the communication burden, a dynamic quantizer and an event-triggered-based WTOD protocol are synthesized to determine whether the quantified measurement value of the sensor should be sent and which ones to be delivered. The main intention of this paper is to construct a mode-dependent filter such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable under the finite-time bounded and meets an energy-to-peak performance levels. The sufficient conditions for the existence of the admissible filter criterion are formulated, and the specific filter gains are obtained through solving a convex optimization problem.

(2020) [7] presented a unified approach to identify extremal chemical trees for degree-based graph invariants in terms of graph order. The exponential augmented Zagreb index ( EAZ ) is a well-established graph invariant formulated for a graph G as E A Z ( G ) = ∑ v i v j ∈ E ( G ) e ( d i d j d i + d j − 2 ) 3 , EAZ(G)=∑vivj∈E(G)e(didjdi+dj−2)3, where d i di signifies the degree of vertex v i vi , and E ( G ) E(G) is the edge set. Due to some special counting features of EAZ , it was not covered by the aforementioned unified approach. As a result, the exploration of extremal chemical trees for this invariant was posed as an open problem in the same article. The present work focuses on generating a complete solution to this problem. Our findings offer maximal and minimal chemical trees of EAZ in terms of the graph order n .},

The conflict-free connection number , indicated by c f c ( G ) cfc(G) , is the fewest number of colours necessary to make G conflict-free connected. Consider the subgraph C ( G ) C(G) of a connected graph G , which is constructed from the cut-edges of G . Let σ 3 ( G ) σ3(G) be the minimum degree-sum of any 3 independent vertices in G .

We accomplish this without relying on some extreme constraints, which are usually necessary in stability analysis. Then, with the aid of the integral form of the method coefficients, we provide a simple stability criterion that can be easily verified.

However, some evaluation methodologies have limitations, such as the image scoring model, a classic first-order paradigm. Several studies have suggested that higher-order rules with more individual information can enhance the stability of cooperation. In this study, we introduce a reputation incentive mechanism to explore the cooperative differences among various evaluation rules. Specifically, players evaluate their opponents&#39; actions following first-order and second-order evaluation rules, respectively. Given that players possess varying degrees of social influence, the evaluative intensity is influenced by the neighbor environment and updated in each round. This resultant fluctuations in reputation exhibit heterogeneity and dynamism. Numerical simulations based on the spatial prisoner&#39;s dilemma game demonstrate that under stringent conditions, the first-order rule can sustain cooperation, while the second-order rule may fail, leading to complete group defection. Under more relaxed conditions, the second-order rule proves more effective in promoting full cooperation than the first-order rule.

In this study, we propose a general theoretical framework based on improved voter model for opinion dynamics in social networks, which incorporates media outlets, network structure and individual heterogeneity, and allows us to systematically and analytically study the effect of diverse factors on opinion evolution and final steady state. We find that eventually only the opinions held by media outlets or stubborn agents can survive. The ultimate agents with specific opinions generally consist of four parts: stubborn ones, the agents induced by stubborn ones through network links, the agents directly caused by media outlets, and the agents indirectly induced by the effect of media outlets via network links. The model has abundant dynamic behaviors and can be potentially extended to more complicated but more realistic opinion evolution processes.

  abstract     = {In this work, we have studied the evolution of the cooperation and the global synchronization on the Kuramoto model upon random networks with two games, in which one is the evolutionary Kuramoto dilemma and the other is the weak prisoner&#39;s dilemma. Agents can gain their payoffs from these two games synchronously. In the evolutionary Kuramoto game, cooperators prefer the formation of local synchronization but pay less cooperative cost. Cooperators in weak prisoner&#39;s dilemma can form cooperator clusters because of the network reciprocity. Combining these two games shows a mutual promotion effect upon the order of the global synchronization but a competition effect on the cooperation level. The global synchronization begins to rise only when most agents choose cooperation. It is manifested by the fact that the optimal coupling strength for the highest cooperation level is smaller than that for the highest synchronization level. The high cooperation cost makes defection the most advantageous strategy when the coupling strength reaches rather high, which diminishes the effect of cooperator clusters, and ultimately results in the absence of both cooperators and global synchronization. When agents have more neighbors in the random network, it is observed that cooperation is consistently hindered unless the coupling strength is relatively small. Additionally, there is always an optimal average degree that allows for global synchronization.},

In order to strengthen the protection, development and rational utilization of fishery resources, this paper proposes a population capture model with state feedback control based on previous studies, in which the small fish is influenced by the Allee effect, and the catch of the big fish is linearly related with the release of the small fish. Firstly, we give the definition of the Poincaré map of the catch system based on impulsive point series, and study the complex dynamic properties of the map, including single peak, multi-peak functions and multiple jumping points. Moreover, the conditions of existence and the number of jumping points are discussed. At the same time, we analyze its properties including monotonicity, differentiability and fixed point. Secondly, the conditions under which the existence and uniqueness of the order-1 periodic solution are provided, and we address the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the order-1 periodic solution. Furthermore, existence of the order- k ( k ≥ 2 ) (k≥2) periodic solution is obtained. Finally, correctness of our theoretical results is illustrated by numerical simulations. The results show that under human control, the density of big fish and small fish will maintain periodic benign changes, and fishery resources are sufficient for sustainable development.},

  abstract     = {Cellular Automata (CA) is a qualitative simulation method widely used in complex systems. However, the anisotropy of the bottom grid is influenced by the sharp boundary, which leads to the problem of grid-induced anisotropy. It not only makes the CA show the anisotropy in the simulation of isotropic propagation, but also produces errors in the simulation of anisotropic propagation. Through a simple binary CA simulation, this paper discusses reasons and processes of grid anisotropy from three aspects: cellular space, neighbor rules and evolution rules, and the error between CA simulation and standard circle propagation is evaluated. Afterwards, five methods for reducing grid anisotropy are introduced and compared in isotropic and anisotropy propagation simulation. For illustration purpose, these methods are considered in the actual system of isotropic and anisotropic propagation, and then the CA model is successfully applied to the classical isotropic propagation, i.e. the chemical wave in B-Z reaction-diffusion system, and classical anisotropic propagation, i.e. the dendritic growth in crystallization system. The results show that the composition shape of neighboring cells affects the isotropic propagation process of CA simulation, and the square grid is one of potential upgrading methods. The weight of neighbors algorithm is more suitable for simulating diffusion processes, and the limited circular neighbourhood algorithm is more suitable for crystal growth process. These results can be a reference for quantitative application of CA in fields of chemical wave propagation and dendrite growth.},

The original formulation considered polar coordinates and harmonic polynomials as basis functions and is restricted to the Laplace equation in 2D. In this work, we start by adapting the approach to the Helmholtz equation in 2D and later extending it to elliptic coordinates. As in the Laplace case, the approach in polar coordinates has very good numerical results both in terms of conditioning and accuracy for domains close to a disk but does not perform so well for other domains, such as an eccentric ellipse. We therefore consider the MFS-SVD approach in elliptic coordinates with Mathieu functions as basis functions for the latter. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach by numerical examples in both cases.},

The variable order anomalous diffusion equations under consideration can be applied to the description of transient subdiffusion in inhomogeneous materials, the order of which depends on the considered spatial and/or time scale. Examples of numerical solutions for different situations are demonstrated.

This investigation studies the evolution of cooperation under the effects of the diverse selection intensity induced by network asymmetry on two-layer networks, where the gaming and learning environments are modeled by different layers, respectively. It is found that heterogeneous selection intensity can alleviate the cooperation dilemma induced by asymmetry between gaming and learning environments. When selection intensity has a correlation with the edge overlap level of two layers, it is found that both positive correlation and negative correlation can optimize the evolution of cooperation for a moderate overlap level. However, positive correlation performs better than negative correlation in promoting the evolution of cooperation. Moreover, the increasing heterogeneity of selection enhances the evolution of cooperation under positive correlation, yet has different effects on cooperation under negative correlation for different temptations. Furthermore, we prove that the results are robust to the deterministic learning process as well as a higher noise.},

The unnecessary data transmissions among agents in MASs are reduced by utilizing a unique dynamic event-triggering communication mechanism (DETCM), which can build communication time sequences for each agent automatically. Based on the sampled states of agents at event-triggering instants, a novel distributed formation containment control protocol is proposed. By mathematical analysis, the formation containment control problem is turned into the problem of stability in a reduced-order system. The global formation containment of the MASs is finally achieved through the application of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and general inequalities. Moreover, a valid example is also given to support the validity and effectiveness of the findings.},

Traditionally, evolutionary dynamics in finite populations are described by the Moran process, where the environment is constant. Therefore, we model the Moran process with environmental feedbacks. Our results show that the selection intensity, which is closely related to the population size, exerts varying influences on evolutionary dynamics. In the case of the specific payoff matrix, cooperation cannot be favored by selection in extremely small-sized populations. The medium-sized populations are beneficial for the evolution of cooperation under intermediate selection intensities. For weak or strong selection intensities, the larger the population size, the more favorable it is for the evolution of cooperation. In the case of the generalized payoff matrix, the low incentives for the defector to cooperate in the degraded state cannot promote the emergence of cooperation. As the incentive for the defector to cooperate in the degraded state increases, selection favors cooperation or defection depending on the population size and selection intensity. For large values of the incentive for the defector facing the cooperative opponent to cooperate in the degraded state, selection always favors cooperation.

  abstract     = {There have been numerous studies on collective behavior, among which communication between agents can have a great impact on both the payoff and the cost of making decisions. Research usually focuses on how to improve the collective synchronization rate or accelerate the process of cooperation under given communication cost constraints. In this context, evolutionary game theory (EGT) and reinforcement learning (RL) arise as essential frameworks for tackling this intricate problem. In this study, an adapted Vicsek model is introduced, wherein agents exhibit varying movement patterns contingent on their chosen strategies. Each agent gains a payoff determined by the advantages of collective motion juxtaposed with the cost of communicating with neighboring agents. Individuals choose the objective agents based on the Q-learning strategy and then adapt their strategies following the Fermi rule. The research reveals that the utmost level of cooperation and synchronization can be attained at an optimal communication radius after applying Q-learning. Similar conclusions have been drawn from research on the influence of random noise and relative cost. Different cost functions were considered in the study to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model and conclusions under a wide range of conditions.

If a follower fails, it will lose the communication ability in the topology and impede its neighbors from obtaining the information regarding the failed follower. If its neighbors continue to use the last state of the failed follower, the remaining agents may be unable to achieve consensus. For such issue, the topology is reconstructed by removing the failed follower and reconnecting the neighbors of the failed follower to the remaining agents according to the position in topology. In sequel, fixed-time leader-following consensus is concerned applying reconstructed topology approach.

In the diffusion equation, the diffusion term achieves the edge preserving smoothing, while the source term is response for designating dynamically the text and background pixels as two dominant modes separated by the final dynamic thresholding function. To evaluate the proposed model solely, we only utilize the simplest finite differencing rather than more elaborated scheme to solve it numerically.

Furthermore, we utilize the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a highly flexible optimization technique, to solve the DIP-AITV minimization problem effectively. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed DIP-AITV method over the state-of-the-art DIP, DIP-TV, DIP-WTV and CS-DIP, we solve two linear inverse problems, i.e., image denoising and compressed sensing .

  abstract     = {This paper develops two tempered fractional matrices that are computationally accurate, efficient, and stable to treat myriad tempered fractional differential problems. The suggested approaches are versatile in handling both spatial and temporal dimensions and treating integer- and fractional-order derivatives as well as non-tempered scenarios via utilizing pseudospectral techniques. We depend on Lagrange basis functions, which are derived from the tempered Jacobi-Müntz functions based on the left- and right-definitions of Erdélyi-Kober fractional derivatives. We aim to obtain the pseudospectral-tempered fractional differentiation matrices in two distinct ways. The study involves a numerical measurement of the condition number of tempered fractional differentiation matrices and the time spent to create the collocation matrices and find the numerical solutions. The suggested matrices&#39; accuracy and efficiency are investigated from the point of view of the L 2 L2 , L ∞ L∞ -norms errors, the maximum absolute error matrix ‖ E N , M y ‖ ∞ ‖EN,My‖∞ of the two-dimensional problems, and the fast rate of spectral convergence. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the exponential convergence, applicability, effectiveness, speed, and potential of the suggested matrices.},

We use a competition weight to control the tradeoff between absolute and relative performance. We consider both an n -agent game and the corresponding mean field game (MFG).

Recently, research on ecological evolutionary games has combined human behavior with environmental feedback, demonstrating that the co-evolution of cooperation and the environment exhibits rich dynamics, thereby attracting widespread attention. In this work, we aim to extend the theory of environmental feedback by exploring environmental evolution that incorporates spatial factors. Our model considers the context of a local environment, where an individual&#39;s environment is influenced only by herself and her neighbors, and the environment affects only the outcome of the game interactions in which she participates. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, our results suggest that cooperation can emerge in the co-evolution of local environments and can be facilitated more effectively with a higher degree of maximum possible environmental degradation. In particular, we discovered that environmental degradation of peripheral individuals in cooperative clusters reduces the profits of defectors, acting as a shield to protect clusters from defectors. However, in a more easily recoverable environment, this protective effect weakens, allowing free-riders to take advantage. Our research elucidates the co-evolutionary process within local environments and emphasizes the crucial role of environmental feedback in the evolution of cooperation.},

  abstract     = {Road traffic conditions exhibit spatial and temporal variations influenced by factors such as construction, speed limits, and accidents. Accurate and efficient modeling of vehicular flow on changing road conditions is crucial for understanding intricate traffic phenomena and analyzing dynamic characteristics in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we develop a rapid numerical approach that computes traffic flow solutions for roads divided into multiple sections with varying traffic conditions, utilizing the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model as the mathematical framework. The key aspect of our approach lies in solving the flow at the dividing point between consecutive road sections with different traffic conditions. For the two-section road scenario, we integrate the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the traffic model with the triangular fundamental diagram, capturing the explicit relationship between flow and density. This integration allows us to derive the spatiotemporal solution for a single dividing point. By accounting for the dynamic interaction between adjacent dividing points, we extend the applicability of our approach to an arbitrary number of road sections based on a semi-analytic Lax-Hopf formula. Our semi-analytical method is distinguished by grid-free computing, reducing computational demands and ensuring exceptional simulation speed. Particularly noteworthy is the formulation&#39;s remarkable efficacy in handling the complexities of heterogeneous road traffic conditions, marked by dynamic variations in both time and space, surpassing traditional macroscopic traffic flow simulations. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply the proposed approach to an optimization example involving traffic signal timing in a complex road environment. Additionally, we showcase its predictive capabilities by efficiently evaluating the impact of traffic accidents on the surrounding traffic flow. This research provides valuable insights for traffic management, optimization, and decision-making, enabling the analysis of complex scenarios and facilitating the development of strategies to enhance traffic efficiency and safety.},

Originally, a real-time bounding criterion is developed by analyzing the variation of subinterval piecewise function and combining the definition of the average impulsive interval. Additionally, a lower bound on the Lyapunov function is provided by introducing an inequality scaling technique to avoid acquiring state bounds based on system decomposition techniques. Subsequently, the real-time bounding closed set, including all reachable states of the system, is estimated by calculating the Dini derivative of the Lyapunov function and using the real-time bounding criterion and the integral inequality technique.

By the ATS, the training points are selected adaptively according to an empirical-value-type instead of residual-type error indicator from trajectories which are generated by a PDE-related stochastic process. We incorporate the ATS into three known deep learning solvers for PDEs, namely, the adaptive physics-informed neural network method (ATS-PINN), the adaptive derivative-free-loss method (ATS-DFLM), and the adaptive temporal-difference method for forward-backward stochastic differential equations (ATS-FBSTD). Our numerical experiments show that the ATS remarkably improves the computational accuracy and efficiency of the original deep solvers. In particular, for a high-dimensional peak problem, the relative errors by the ATS-PINN can achieve the order of O ( 10 − 3 ) O(10−3) , even when the vanilla PINN fails.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing the relationship between the spatial patterns in species concentrations and ecological heterogeneity is crucial for understanding demographics and species governance in a given domain, as ecological patterning processes are believed to be imitated in real ecosystems. In this present article, we have considered a two-prey-one-predator system with Holling type-II functional response where both the preys have fear of predator and compete in the absence of predator. Additionally, we have assumed that both the prey help each other when the predator attacks them. We have incorporated self-diffusion in this system under Neumann boundary conditions. The existence and stability conditions of different equilibria are discussed. We have studied the Hopf bifurcation around positive offset and derived the stability and direction of periodic solution. We have done a series of numerical simulations to ensure our theoretical finding. Diffusion-driven instability conditions are obtained. Different instability regions and fascinating patterns, such as spots, mixtures, and stripes, are depicted. Spatiotemporal dynamics also reflects that prey populations are located in isolated areas of low population concentration with increasing level of fear, whereas an increase in handling time forms lower-density stripes. But with increasing help, prey becomes more concentrated in some stripe regions. In the Hopf-Turing region, it is observed that the diffusion coefficient of predators can stabilize the system. Overall, pattern creation in predator-prey systems can help anticipate long-term system behaviour and analyze the influence of ecological factors on system dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We discuss a continuous-time portfolio optimization problem to beat a stochastic benchmark. The model considers non-linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to model the dynamics of assets and economic factors. Unlike existing literature on risk-sensitive criteria, the proposed framework allows the model to capture the non-linearity in assets and factors dynamics. This article contributes to the two essential aspects of the problem; first, the existence and uniqueness of optimal investment strategy, which we prove using stochastic control theory and shows optimal strategies remain unchanged for the finite and infinite time horizon problems. Second, we use forecasting to compare investment performance under different economic factors. We analyze returns for the proposed model for three years in two important financial markets; S&amp;P 100 and Dow 30. Risk versus return analysis indicates the importance of choosing relevant economic factors and their model for better portfolio performance. The results suggest an excellent bet to select the non-linear model over the linear one.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops an extended prediction for uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with input delays and unknown disturbances. The developed prediction employs more information of the disturbances that allows to reject perfectly constant disturbances and to lead to better attenuation performance with smaller ultimate bounds for the time-varying disturbances. The assumption from the existing predictor-based work that the time-varying disturbances are smooth is not required. Moreover, we consider the system subject to uncertainties, i.e. the parameter uncertainties and the uncertain non-small delays, whose nominal values are assumed to be known. Compared to that for the uncertainty-free case, the resulting closed-loop system has additional errors due to the uncertainties. Then via Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, sufficient conditions are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for finding the quantitative upper bounds on the uncertainties that guarantee the stability. We demonstrate that a better attenuation is achieved in the absence/presence of uncertainties. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the method.},

DPI overcomes the limitations of PI, which is constrained by the curse of dimensionality to low-dimensional problems, by iteratively training three neural networks to solve PI equations and satisfy forward-backwards conditions. Our findings indicate that DPI achieves comparable convergence levels to the Mean Field Deep Galerkin Method (MFDGM), with additional advantages. Furthermore, deep learning techniques show promise in handling separable Hamiltonian cases where PI alone is less effective. DPI effectively manages high-dimensional problems, extending the applicability of PI to both separable and non-separable Hamiltonians.},

Subsequently, based on the reformulations, a PTUIO is developed such that the state, the actuator fault and the sensor fault can all be estimated within an arbitrarily prescribed time regardless of what the initial conditions are. In addition, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the PTUIO are given in terms of the original system matrices.

The development mainly consists of construction, implementation, and application of this kind of algorithms. The construction is based on a direct discretization of the Pfaff–Birkhoff principle in which time is treated as a dynamical variable particularly. The resulting discrete Birkhoffian equations then determine a numerical algorithm for iteration which automatically meets the requirement of structure preservation and time step adaptation. Following the construction, an alternative optimization technique of solving discrete Birkhoffian equations and a reasonable method for initialization of the simulation are provided subsequently, for practical implementation of the algorithm. The performance of the developed algorithm is examined finally by preliminary application in typical examples. Numerical results indicate that the time step adaptation leads to a much improved performance on precisely preserving conserved quantities.},

It was conjectured that every connected graph is edge decomposable to 3 locally irregular subgraphs, unless it belongs to a certain family of exceptions, including graphs of small maximum degrees, which are not decomposable to any number of such subgraphs. Recently Sedlar and Škrekovski exhibited a counterexample to the conjecture, which necessitates a decomposition to (at least) 4 locally irregular subgraphs. We prove that every d -regular graph with d large enough, i.e. d ≥ 54000 d≥54000 , is decomposable to 4 locally irregular subgraphs. Our proof relies on a mixture of a numerically optimized application of the probabilistic method and certain deterministic results on degree constrained subgraphs due to Addario-Berry, Dalal, McDiarmid, Reed, and Thomason, and to Alon and Wei, introduced in the context of related problems concerning irregular subgraphs.},

It is natural to choose such a vector only from efficient ones. One of the most used ranking methods employs the (right) Perron eigenvector of the reciprocal matrix as the vector of weights. It is known that the Perron vector may not be efficient. Here, we focus on extending arbitrary reciprocal matrices and show, constructively, that two different extensions of any fixed size always exist for which the Perron vector is inefficient and for which it is efficient, with the following exception. If B is consistent, any reciprocal matrix obtained from B by adding one row and one column has efficient Perron vector. As a consequence of our results, we obtain families of reciprocal matrices for which the Perron vector is inefficient. These include known classes of such matrices and many more. We also characterize the 4-by-4 reciprocal matrices with inefficient Perron vector. Some prior results are generalized or completed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we analyze a method for approximating the first-passage time density and the corresponding distribution function for a CIR process. This approximation is obtained by truncating a series expansion involving the generalized Laguerre polynomials and the gamma probability density. The suggested approach involves a number of numerical issues which depend strongly on the coefficient of variation of the first passage time random variable. These issues are examined and solutions are proposed also involving the first passage time distribution function. Numerical results and comparisons with alternative approximation methods show the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method. A general acceptance-rejection-like procedure, that makes use of the approximation, is presented. It allows the generation of first passage time data, even if its distribution is unknown.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate how the updating of weights during forward operation and the computation of gradients during backpropagation impact the optimization process, training procedure, and overall performance of the neural network, particularly the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This paper introduces a novel neural network structure called the Power-Enhancing residual network, inspired by highway network and residual network, designed to improve the network&#39;s capabilities for both smooth and non-smooth functions approximation in 2D and 3D settings. By incorporating power terms into residual elements, the architecture enhances the stability of weight updating, thereby facilitating better convergence and accuracy. The study explores network depth, width, and optimization methods, showing the architecture&#39;s adaptability and performance advantages. Consistently, the results emphasize the exceptional accuracy of the proposed Power-Enhancing residual network, particularly for non-smooth functions. Real-world examples also confirm its superiority over plain neural network in terms of accuracy, convergence, and efficiency. Moreover, the proposed architecture is also applied to solving the inverse Burgers&#39; equation, demonstrating superior performance. In conclusion, the Power-Enhancing residual network offers a versatile solution that significantly enhances neural network capabilities by emphasizing the importance of stable weight updates for effective training in deep neural networks.

The algorithm is a refactorization of Cauchy&#39;s one-leg θ -method: the implicit backward Euler method on [ t n , t n + θ ] [tn,tn+θ] , and a linear extrapolation on [ t n + θ , t n + 1 ] [tn+θ,tn+1] . In the backward Euler step, the decoupled equations are solved iteratively, with the iterations converging linearly. In the absence of the chain rule for time-discrete setting, we approximate the change in the free energy by the product of a second-order accurate discrete gradient (chemical potential) and the one-step increment of the state variables. Similar to the continuous case, we also prove a discrete Helmholtz free energy balance equation, without numerical dissipation. In the numerical tests we compare this symplectic implicit midpoint method ( θ = 1 / 2 θ=1/2 ) with the classic backward Euler method, and two implicit-explicit time-lagging schemes. The midpoint method outperforms the other schemes in terms of rates of convergence, long-time behavior and energy approximation, for both small and large values of the time step.},

  abstract     = {Mosquito-borne diseases persist as a global health challenge despite ongoing control efforts, necessitating the exploration of alternative control approaches. This research proposes a Filippov incompatible insect technique (IIT) model with a threshold policy control for suppressing mosquito population. The model implements biological and chemical control strategies only when wild mosquito density surpasses an economic threshold. The biological strategy involves releasing Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes, offering advantages such as a shortened lifespan and disease blocking. Simultaneously, moderate insecticide and larvicide spraying serve as a chemical approach to expedite the control process. The model provides economic advantages by minimizing control costs and environmental benefits through the integration of biological strategies, thus reducing reliance on chemicals. By employing Filippov&#39;s convex method, we identify necessary conditions for the existence of sliding segments and determine the dynamics of the switching line. Theoretical analysis reveals the model&#39;s long-term dynamics, including sliding bifurcations, pseudo-equilibria, and their stability. The model exhibits boundary equilibrium bifurcations and transcritical bifurcations in both free and controlled systems. Varying threshold values significantly impact the control outcomes effectiveness. The main findings demonstrate that integrated strategies efficiently decrease the population density of wild mosquitoes.},

By using the Gauss-cosh model in the Fourier transform space, a Gauss-cos model for autocorrelation functions is suggested on time domain. The physical interpretation of the Gauss-cos model is also provided that it is a quadratic damping oscillator. Then a new algorithm is derived to approximate the autocorrelation function based on the Gauss-cos model. Numerical experiments verify that the Gauss-cos model effectively fits the autocorrelation function of the fertility rate. After analyzing the numerical results, we detect that the autocorrelation of the fertility rate is described by two major principal phases, which are caused by the public influence and the mother-daughter influence. The mother-daughter influence strongly expresses a periodic regression of the generation.},

  abstract     = {The study of moving particles (e.g. molecules, virus, vesicles, organelles, or whole cells) is crucial to decipher a plethora of cellular mechanisms within physiological and pathological conditions. Powerful live-imaging approaches enable life scientists to capture particle movements at different scale from cells to single molecules, that are collected in a series of frames. However, although these events can be captured, an accurate quantitative analysis of live-imaging experiments still remains a challenge. Two main approaches are currently used to study particle kinematics: kymographs, which are graphical representation of spatial motion over time, and single particle tracking (SPT) followed by linear linking. Both kymograph and SPT apply a space-time approximation in quantifying particle kinematics, considering the velocity constant either over several frames or between consecutive frames, respectively. Thus, both approaches intrinsically limit the analysis of complex motions with rapid changes in velocity. Therefore, we design, implement and validate a novel reconstruction algorithm aiming at supporting tracking particle trafficking analysis with mathematical foundations. Our method is based on polynomial reconstruction of 4D (3D+time) particle trajectories, enabling to assess particle instantaneous velocity and acceleration, at any time, over the entire trajectory. Here, the new algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art SPT followed by linear linking, demonstrating an increased accuracy in quantifying particle kinematics. Our approach is directly derived from the governing equations of motion, thus it arises from physical principles and, as such, it is a versatile and reliable numerical method for accurate particle kinematics analysis which can be applied to any live-imaging experiment where the space-time coordinates can be retrieved.},

In this context, we integrate the concept of investment trustworthiness into the strategy updating process and explore the outcomes of dynamic beliefs through numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that dynamic trustworthiness significantly supports cooperation. Cooperators impede the incursion of defectors by progressively reducing their willingness to invest, thus fostering the formation of cooperative clusters. Our findings suggest that while sensitivity to higher payoffs bolsters cooperation, a tempered response to negative payoffs is advantageous. Additionally, the initial distribution of willingness is pivotal for the success of this dynamic. Our study expands the repertoire of strategy update techniques in investigating the evolution of cooperation and offers profound insights into the complexities of human cooperative behaviour.},

However, PINNs still encounter difficulties in simulating a kind of partial differential equations (PDEs), i.e. gradient flow equations of complex dynamic systems. Through analysis from the neural tangent kernel&#39;s (NTK) point of view, we find that directly training PINNs on the large temporal window may lead to failure. To tackle this problem, we utilize one of the gradient flow equations&#39; significant physical properties, the energy dissipation law, to propose an adaptive energy-based sequential training method for PINNs. Specifically, the gradient of free energy is employed to determine the adaptive temporal steps of the training window, which also enhances the training efficiency. Numerical experiments are demonstrated among gradient flow equations including Cahn-Hilliard, heat conduction, and Allen-Cahn equations. Our method not only outperforms PINNs but also preserves the energy dissipation law, which shows the ability to solve complex long-time simulation problems of gradient flow systems.},

Our approach exploits the potential of annihilation operators to infer the underlying grid, thereby obviating the need for end-users to specify such information. We define the scheme in a non-stationary manner, ensuring that it progressively approaches a classical linear scheme as the iteration number increases, all while preserving its polynomial reproduction capability. The convergence is established through two distinct theoretical methods. Firstly, we propose a new class of schemes, including ours, for which we establish C 1 C1 convergence by combining results from the analysis of quasilinear schemes and asymptotically equivalent linear non-uniform non-stationary schemes.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of successive lag synchronization for distributed-order multilayer neural networks with short-term memory characteristic. At first, a definition of distributed-order derivative with short-term memory is proposed to better describe the dynamic behavior of network nodes. Based on this definition, a distributed-order multilayer neural network model with short-term memory property is established. Subsequently, by employing the Laplace transform method, the short memory distributed-order Halanay-type inequality is derived. Furthermore, two sets of successive lag synchronization criteria for the considered system are obtained using a linear feedback controller and an adaptive controller, respectively. Finally, the validity of the conclusions is verified through two numerical examples.},

We overcome this disadvantage by multiplying some factors, resulting in a sequence of irrational functions. We deduce various generating functions of this sequence and find the associated Sturm-Liouville problems, which bring orthogonality. Then we establish a Hilbert space of functions defined on a semi-infinite interval with an inner product induced by a weight function determined by the Sturm-Liouville problems mentioned above. The even subsequence of the irrational function sequence above forms an orthonormal basis for this space. The Fourier expansions of some power functions are deduced. The sequence of non-positive integer power functions forms a non-orthogonal basis for this Hilbert space.

To reduce the calculation complexity and improve the dynamic performance, an innovative joint-space dynamic theory for mobile multi-axis systems with unilateral constraints is proposed. This present study builds on our existing explicit dynamics studies of tree-chain rigid multi-axis systems. By analyzing the formulation of the unilateral constraints, the complexity of establishing the constraint equations is reduced while the physical implications are clear. The constraint equations are derived and established based on the explicit partial derivative equations, where the expression of the constraint equations is greatly simplified. Then, based on the process of backward force iteration and in combination with the derived dynamic and unilateral constraint equations, the solution and analytical procedure for unilateral constraints are presented. The accuracy of the proposed method is proved by the three-wheeled multi-axis system and Mars rover examples. The proposed method is explicit, canonical, and symbolic and has the advantages of simple modeling and low computational complexity, which is analyzed by comparing it with the Open Dynamic Engine&#39;s approach.},

To address message fatigue in information diffusion and group interactions, we developed a novel coupled information-disease spreading model within the framework of multiplex temporal networks. Here, the information network simulates the process of disease-related information diffusion using a temporal simplicial network. Furthermore, we utilize a threshold model to characterize the effects of message fatigue. We describe the dynamic evolutionary equations of the model by the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) approach to determine the epidemic threshold. We also validated the proposed model using a number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The experimental results of the MC simulations and MMC theoretical results are in good agreement. Our research has shown that message fatigue can lead to a two-stage change in the information-disease coupled spreading. Raising the threshold for message fatigue and preventing a large number of individuals from experiencing it can help inhibit the disease spreading. In short, excessive publicizing of related-disease information can backfire. The results can facilitate us to accurately capture the spreading characteristics of real-world diseases.},

We first convert the KGDE to a coupled system and then consider LEWIFP method for the coupled system. The LEWIFP method is proved to be time symmetric which is an important structure in numerical geometric integration. Through careful and rigorous convergence analysis, we establish the error bounds O ( h m + ε τ 2 + τ 0 m ) O(hm+ετ2+τ0m) for the full-discretization, where m is determined by the regularity conditions. If the solution is sufficiently smooth with m sufficiently large, we obtain the errors with improved uniform bounds at O ( h m + ε τ 2 ) O(hm+ετ2) in the long-time domain up to O ( 1 / ε ) O(1/ε) . These error bounds are much better than the classical bounds O ( h m + τ 2 ) O(hm+τ2) provided by the traditional analysis for the non-Lawson-type exponential wave integrators equipped with Fourier pseudo-spectral method. Combined with the classical analysis tools such as mathematical induction and energy method, we complete our error analysis by adopting the regularity compensation oscillation (RCO) technique which controls the high frequency modes by the regularity of the solution and low frequency modes by phase cancellation. By applying the LEWIFP method to some problems, we show the numerical results to support our error bounds. In addition, the numerical results also show that the discrete mass and energy are stable in the time domain which is long enough. Finally we extend our method to the oscillatory problem.},

In previous finite-time control designs for impulsive systems, the convergence rate of these control strategies is even less rapid than the exponential convergence rate when the initial state is distant from the origin. To overcome this problem, two sufficient conditions for the novel finite-time stability of impulsive systems are presented, in which the stabilizing impulses and the destabilizing impulses are considered, respectively. Meanwhile, the upper bound of the settling-time is evaluated. In addition, combining Lyapunov functions theory with impulsive control, we design a controller for impulsive dynamical systems to satisfy the novel finite-time stability. Finally, two simulation examples are given, in which the first example demonstrates the superiority of the proposed finite-time stability criterion for nonlinear impulsive systems by comparing it with traditional finite-time stability, and the second example verifies the effectiveness of the presented controller.},

The existence of affine terms gives rise to the lack of a common equilibrium point and further makes it more difficult to propose the desired output-feedback-based fault-tolerant control scheme. Firstly, the actuator fault estimation is achieved through a reduced-order observer design approach. Then, a kind of dynamic output feedback controller is constructed to perform the fault tolerance goal by utilizing fault estimation information. Moreover, the mode-dependent average dwell time switching constraint is borrowed to avoid the chattering owing to the high-frequency switching. The sufficient conditions with less conservative are derived to guarantee the practical exponential stability of closed-loop system with a prescribed L ∞ L∞ gain. Finally, both the effectiveness and validity of the designed fault-tolerant control strategy are illustrated via a case study of a buck-boost DC-DC converter.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we mainly consider the solution of two-person zero-sum fuzzy matrix games with payoffs of triangular fuzzy numbers. Contrary to the literature, we focus on developing the methods to solve the game directly based on only the norms of the payoff matrix holistically, without solving a linear programming problem or handling sub-games created by taking the components of fuzzy numbers separately. For this purpose, we first present fuzzy versions of 1-norm and ∞-norm with the help of a ranking function and develop the fuzzy matrix norm method to obtain an approximate solution of the zero-sum fuzzy matrix game. In addition to this approach, we provide the fuzzy extended matrix norm method as an enhanced version of the method, which involves the use of newly defined fuzzy matrix norms. Thus, we managed to avoid the complexity of the optimization process of the linear programming problem via the proposed matrix norm-based methods. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of the methods by considering several benchmark examples and a 3 × 3 fuzzy matrix game.},

  abstract     = {Bateman equations model mass balance in a linear radioactive decay chain of isotopes. A generalization of this model may be based on the introduction of a fractional derivative, to include memory effects, and on the incorporation of randomness in the input parameters (decay rate and initial concentrations), since it is not possible to predict when a particular nuclide will decay from a quantum-mechanical point of view. In this new context, a recent contribution studied the stochastic solution in the pathwise and the mean-square senses and, for a chain of length three, determined analytical forms for the probability density functions, with several numerical examples. In this paper, we focus on the computation of statistical moments of the solution, instead, in the setting of forward uncertainty quantification. We investigate the use of stochastic polynomial approximations to efficiently address that matter: for independent random inputs, generalized polynomial chaos expansions and the Galerkin projection technique are employed; and for non-independent random inputs, the Galerkin method is mimicked from the canonical polynomial basis. The deterministic system for the expansion&#39;s coefficients can be explicitly solved in terms of the matrix Mittag-Leffler function. Albeit these polynomial expansions are theoretically optimal for estimation of the expectation and the variance, we conduct numerical experiments to compare with Monte Carlo simulation and derive interesting conclusions that depend on the specific problem analyzed.},

  abstract     = {In a social dilemma situation, where individual and collective interests are in conflict, it sounds a reasonable assumption that the presence of super or smart players, who simultaneously punish defection and reward cooperation without allowing exploitation, could solve the basic problem. The behavior of such a multi-strategy system, however, is more subtle than it is firstly anticipated. When exploring the complete parameter space we find that the emergence of cyclic dominance among strategies is rather common, which results in several counter-intuitive phenomena. For example, the defection level can be lowered at higher temptation, or weaker punishment provides better conditions for smart players. Our study indicates that smart cooperators can unexpectedly thrive under high temptation, emphasizing the complexity of strategic interactions. This study suggests that the principles governing these interactions can be applied to other moral behaviors, such as truth-telling and honesty, providing valuable insights for future research in multi-agent systems.},

The mechanism adjusts the game type of supervised nodes when their evaluation value falls below a critical threshold. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the mutual supervision mechanism effectively encourages the emergence of cooperative strategies on interdependent networks. The experimental results show a direct positive linkage between the number of supervised nodes and the fraction of cooperation. In detail, the effect of the sucker&#39;s payoff on cooperation is more noticeable when most of the nodes are supervised by the mechanism. However, a higher sucker&#39;s payoff discourages cooperation when there are few supervised nodes. Furthermore, the stability of cooperation is closely related to a stricter supervision threshold. Conversely, if the supervision threshold is too lenient, previously stable cooperation levels will suddenly collapse.},

Specifically, a distributed adaptive nominal control law is designed to accomplish the formation control task. Then, based on ISSf-CBF derived safety constraints, a distributed quadratic programming problem is established for computing the optimal control input subject to safety constraints. The safety and stability of the closed-loop control system have been demonstrated.

The rate of packet dropouts is influenced mainly by the distance from the target to the transmitter and transmission energy. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the energy allocation policies to ensure the desired positioning performance using a two-level hierarchical framework. Initially, a lower-level policy works on a specified time scale and aims at minimize error covariances with prescribed distance to meet the step objective. Subsequently, a higher-level policy plans the step time scale and calls for the desired step objectives for the lower-level policy. Both policy levels are trained through deep reinforcement learning.

When there are no pending orders, the manufacturing unit transits into a maintenance phase, also termed as working vacation, during which production continues, albeit at a slower rate. This diminished productivity could result in longer lead times and potential customer dissatisfaction. Depending on the influx of demand, the maintenance phase could be interrupted, propelling the unit back to full operational capacity. Conversely, if no orders are received during the maintenance phase, the unit has the choice of switching to standby mode in anticipation of incoming orders, or initiating an extended break. We utilize mathematical techniques such as continued fractions, Modified Bessel functions, and Laplace transforms to precisely compute the transient state probabilities of this model. To further illustrate the impact of these operational dynamics on production management, we present corroborative numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the leader-follower consensus (LFC) issue for a class of Lipschitz-type nonlinear multi-agent systems (NMASs) that include one leader and multiple followers. To enable the leader to denote a flexible noncooperative reference trajectory, it is considered that the leader&#39;s control input (LCI) exists and cannot be obtained by other followers. A novel robust distributed adaptive continuous event-triggered control protocol is developed. Through rigorous analysis, it is shown that under this control protocol, the NMASs can reach LFC and the Zeno behavior is not exhibited. Compared to existing research works, the main merits of this control protocol are as follows: 1) It is chattering-free while can completely eliminate the adverse effects brought by the LCI; 2) The communication traffic between agents is lower; 3) It can be executed in a fully distributed way (i.e., no global information is required for the design process of this control protocol). Finally, the effectiveness of the developed control protocol is validated through an example.},

The nonlinear transformation function-based system transformation approach is employed to convert the initial constrained system into an unconstrained one. To achieve the objective of asymptotic tracking, the tracking error is scaled by an exponential proportional function. Furthermore, to address the challenge of repetitive derivation of virtual control laws that occurs in the traditional design process of high-order backstepping methods, a first-order filter is applied. The designed control scheme guarantees that the system output will asymptotically track a predefined reference tracking trajectory while ensuring that the output constraint is not violated. Moreover, it is shown that the filter error will converge asymptotically to the origin. The effectiveness of the developed control strategy is verified through simulation results.},

Numerous mechanisms have been presented to promote cooperation level by introducing various third-party strategies. This paper considers the more realistic strategy named punishing evil and promoting good (PEPG) in the public goods game, whose fundamental action is cooperation. Players selecting this strategy can not only reward cooperators but also penalize defectors, effectively amalgamating the advantages of both rewarders and punishers. Moreover, distinct strategic choices lead to dynamic changes in players&#39; reputation, which in turn significantly influence their income distribution. Notably, individuals with elevated reputation are entitled to allocate more benefits rather than homogeneous distribution. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the PEPG strategy is pivotal in eliminating defectors and fostering cooperative behavior. Importantly, three intriguing phenomena are displayed in this research, including the resurgence of defectors, the polarization of reputation and the disparities of payoffs, all of which help us understand the emergence of cooperation in the real world.},

The second constructs the curve by imposing zero-residue conditions, thus extending ideas of previous papers by (Farouki and Sakkalis 2019) and the authors themselves (Schröcker and Šír 2023). The third method generalizes the dual approach of (Pottmann 1995) from planar to spatial curves. The three methods share the same quaternion based representation in which not only the PH curve but also its arc length function are compactly expressed. We also present a new proof based on the quaternion polynomial factorization theory of the well known characterization of the Pythagorean quadruples.},

  abstract     = {The secondary control of islanded microgrids holds paramount importance for maintaining power quality in smart grid regions, posing a significant challenge in recent research on multi-agent systems. This paper presents an improved secondary control approach designed in AC islanded microgrids (MGs) operating in a communication network environment. The proposed method first considers that the communication topology of distributed generation (DG) is switched randomly, and such switching is described by the semi-Markov process with an uncertain transition rate. Then, an asynchronous mechanism is used to correlate the evolution of system and controller modes in response to solve the difficulty of obtaining modal information. Based on the aforementioned foundation, an event-based distributed security secondary control algorithm is constructed, leveraging feedback linearization and the leader-follower consensus protocol. Specifically, a hybrid event-triggered mechanism, characterized by both memorability and dynamics, is introduced, effectively mitigating communication load. Furthermore, by taking the false-data-injection attack as a case study, the algorithm enhances the security of communication control. Besides, considering the limitation of model error and the influence of external noise, a sliding mode control is additionally applied to enhance the control robustness among the secondary control layer. The proposed method is verified and evaluated from theoretical and emulational perspectives. The research findings demonstrate that the suggested secondary control has robust performance for the environment constraint while satisfying the targeted frequency recovery and real power allocation.},

Firstly, to take full account of the information of state variables and time delay, an augmented delay-product-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is established for obtaining an accurate reachable set described by an ellipsoid. Some single and quadratic integral states are introduced into the LKF as augmented variables to reduce the conservatism of the reachable set result. However, the introduction of the integral states causes the LKF derivative to generate higher-order terms of the time-varying delay. Then, the variables-augmented-based free-weighting-matrices method is introduced to solve this problem. The method makes the LKF derivative turn into a linear function and gives more freedom to derive an improved result. Finally, a more accurate reachable set is obtained, whose merits are shown by a numerical example.},

We first propose a simplicial threshold model to describe the dynamics of social contagion on higher-order community networks and then provide a dimension-reduction approach to accurately and qualitatively describe the dynamical process. Both numerical analysis and theoretical results indicate that a hysteresis loop exists in the social contagion. The higher-order structural characteristic significantly reduces the gap between the threshold points. With the increase of higher-order interactions, the outbreak threshold in the network decreases. Furthermore, the stronger the community structure, the more it facilitates information spreading, demonstrating that enhancing community structure strength contributes to more efficient dissemination.},

To avoid the Runge phenomenon that may appear when the number of nodes increases, we choose the Chebyshev zeros as the collocation points. But, when increasing the number of nodes to improve the precision, the problem of possible ill-conditioning of the linear system involved in the collocation method may arise.

In this paper, we presented a modified relaxed block upper-lower triangular (MRBULT) preconditioner, which is an extension of the RBULT preconditioner. The advantage of this preconditioner is that it retains the computational advantage of RBULT preconditioner, and the choice of optimal parameters is simpler. We analyze the eigenvalue distribution and an upper bound of the degree of the minimal polynomial of the preconditioned matrix. Furthermore, the selection of the optimal parameter α and β are given. Finally, the theoretical analysis is proven by numerical examples, which has more advantages than previous existing preconditioners.},

  abstract     = {Delayed fractional neural network models are addressed to describe the effects of signal losses due to delay, the memory of neurons and self-feedback delay on the dynamics. The stable intervals of communication delay are first determined when the self-feedback delay is absent. The network with signal losses can exhibit stability switches. Then, the criteria for the generation of Hopf bifurcation for self-feedback delay are established by treating communication delay as a constant and it is shown that self-feedback delay can induce changes in stability for the equilibrium as it crosses the first Hopf bifurcation point. The stable regions in the delay plane are also plotted by the geometric method. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to corroborate the efficiency of the procured results. The obtained results illustrate that the stable regions for delays become larger as fractional order decreases, which indicates that the memory of neurons can dampen the oscillatory behaviors.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes two non-iterative explicit and implicit finite volume methods (FVM) to calculate the unsteady characteristics of natural gas in distribution systems. The proposed finite volume model could be used to solve the gas network as a whole for each time step. The main advantage of this approach is that it can analyze gas distribution networks with less computational cost. In addition, contrary to the conventional iterative algorithms, it does not consist of any divergence problems. To achieve this goal, the explicit FVM is derived from the governing equations. Then, the linearization process is performed, and the numerical solution of the linear equations is developed by using the implicit FVM. Three classic test cases are exemplified to check the performance of the proposed methods. The results confirm that both explicit and implicit methods, even in complicated distribution networks, can predict the elements of unsteady natural gas flows. Furthermore, when the governing equations are linearized and the implicit FVM is applied, satisfactory results with less computational cost, compared to the explicit one, are produced.},

To save network resources, an event-based protocol is introduced to achieve lower information communication frequency, where Zeno behavior is excluded. Furthermore, an improved control strategy is employed where an auxiliary system is designed to improve the performance under actuator saturation. According to Lyapunov stability theory, the expected practical TVF tracking control problem is solved for the MASs.

  abstract     = {This research investigation delves into the concept of cyclic dominance and its interplay with environmental feedback within the framework of the Optional Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma (OPD) game. A quantitative model has been meticulously constructed to encompass both the OPD and Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) games, wherein the outcomes are contingent upon environmental feedback. The intricate relationship between player populations and their surrounding environment is elucidated through the utilization of replicator dynamics. The empirical findings of this study shed light on the existence of distinct equilibria contingent upon the prevailing environmental circumstances. Under scenarios characterized by resource depletion, an equilibrium state emerges wherein only solitary individuals (referred to as &quot;loners&quot;) persist. Conversely, under conditions of resource replenishment, an equilibrium is established where various strategic approaches coexist in equal proportions, akin to the dynamics of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Notably, cyclic dominance manifests itself during periods characterized by intermediate environmental conditions. Several pivotal factors have been identified as determinants of these dynamic phenomena, including the rate of environmental replenishment, the strength of the dilemma presented, the payoff for loners, and the reward for a draw. It has been empirically demonstrated that the presence of extreme values in the replenishment rate, irrespective of whether exceptionally high or exceptionally low, serves as an impediment to the emergence of cyclic dominance. This model underscores the substantial influence of environmental feedback on social dilemmas, particularly in the context of the OPD game, ultimately leading to the emergence of competitive cyclic dominance games reminiscent of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. In doing so, it elucidates the intricate interplay between evolutionary game incentives and the dynamics of the surrounding environment.},

In the simulation, we demonstrate the evolution of cooperation frequency over time and investigate the influence of insurance premium, pension baseline, the number of defected neighbors of cooperators, and the enhancement factor on the cooperation frequency. Additionally, we examine the impact of the pension system on cooperative behavior in triangular and hexagonal networks. Our results suggest that in the public goods game on networked structure, the pension system not only fails to promote cooperation but actually inhibits it, even when cooperators do not have to pay any costs and can receive pensions when conditions are met.},

Considering a positive integer k , we introduce D k Dk , a set comprising graphs within G , each with a maximum degree not exceeding k . Extending the concept of a packing, a near packing that accommodates D k Dk in graph G emerges, realized by overlapping two iterations of G . In this configuration, the intersecting subgraph formed by edges shared in both G copies is a member of D k Dk . The notation m ( n , D k ) m(n,Dk) represents the highest possible value of m , ensuring each graph with order n and size at most m can incorporate a near packing that accommodates D k Dk . A notable case is m ( n , D 0 ) = n − 2 m(n,D0)=n−2 , highlighting that a near packing which admits D 0 D0 equates to a standard packing.

First, the affine constraints of uncertainty are plotted in an N -dimensional space, where N is the number of elements that should be considered. Due to the properties of the affine constraints, the affine constraints are expressed as an ( N -1) dimensional structure. The interval information is then expressed as an N -dimensional structure. The algorithm iteratively checks the edges of the N -dimensional structure between two geometrical structures to determine the intersection region. The algorithm then collects the vertices of the convex polytope that overlap the two structures. To show the effectiveness of proposed algorithm, this study proposes a consensus criterion for a multi-agent time-delayed system with uncertain switching topologies as an application of a system with uncertainties in system elements.},

Especially, the impulsive intensity and impulsive density are both stochastic, which triggered by a renewal process. Taking into account asynchrony of switching and impulsive signal, a new comprehensive admissible edge-dependent average impulsive interval (CAED-AII) concept is proposed to characterize the impulsive signal. Under constrained switching and stochastic impulses, we investigate ISSiP of impulsive switched systems in two cases: the impulsive intensity is supposed to be stochastic and impulsive density is fixed, and the impulsive intensity and density are both stochastic. In these cases, the situation of the subsystem is divided into two scenarios for discussion as well. The first scenario is that all subsystems are unstable. The second scenario is that some subsystems are unstable and some subsystems are stable. With the help of the admissible edge-dependent average dwell time (AED-ADT), CAED-AII, and Lyapunov-like function, sufficient conditions are established for ISSiP of the whole system.

  abstract     = {We study limit points of the spectral radii of Laplacian matrices of graphs. We adapted the method used by J. B. Shearer in 1989, devised to prove the density of adjacency limit points of caterpillars, to Laplacian limit points. We show that this fails, in the sense that there is an interval for which the method produces no limit points. Then we generalize the method to Laplacian limit points of linear trees and prove that it generates a larger set of limit points. The results of this manuscript may provide important tools for proving the density of Laplacian limit points in [ 4.38 + , ∞ ) [4.38+,∞) .},

Then, we present a model-free VI algorithm, based on which feedback control strategies for players are designed using only the data of states and inputs, without requiring the prior knowledge of the system matrices. Moreover, we show that the designed feedback control strategies make the closed-loop game system stable and reach the Nash equilibrium.

A variety of wave propagation problems, including the mechanically and electrically excited high-frequency Lamb wave propagation in FGM plates, impact waves in FGM bars, and thermal shock waves in functionally graded piezoelectric cylinders, are solved using the present formulation, and results are validated with available solutions.

Aiming at promising performance, it is critical to deeply understand and effectively design advanced model for image reconstruction. Indeed, one possible solution is to integrate the deep learning methods with the variational approaches to absorb benefits from both parts. In this paper, to protect more details and a better balance between the computational burden and the numerical performance, we carefully choose the multi-level wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN) for this issue. As the tight frame regularizer has the capability of maintaining edge information in image, we combine the MWCNN with the tight frame regularizer to reconstruct images. The proposed model can be solved by the celebrated proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm. Furthermore, our method is a noise-adaptive framework as it can also handle real-world images. To prove the robustness of our strategy, we address two important medical image reconstruction tasks: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Extensive numerical experiments show clearly that our approach achieves better performance over several state-of-the-art methods.},

Evolutionary game theory has been utilized to investigate the evolution of cooperation. In recent years, many researchers have paid massive attention on the evolution of cooperative behavior from the perspective of multiple games, especially the transition of games. Nevertheless, not only are the current interactive actions crucial, but also the historical interactive experience is fateful. Motivated by this, the persistence-based game transition mechanism is proposed and introduced to investigate the evolution of cooperation, where both the current pairwise strategies and the persistence of the pairwise strategies determine the game played in the next time step. Through analyzing the evolutionary results of strategies and games, we find that the cooperation can be facilitated by the enhanced network reciprocity as the persistence-based game transition makes mutual cooperators play games with weak dilemma more persistently.},

Unlike the existing works on IETM, two kinds of novel IETMs including static IETM and dynamic IETM are developed, where the asynchronous nature is mainly reflected in the fact that each node in each layer possesses its own control and rest intervals. Remarkably, under two control schemes, the choice of control time sequence is based on corresponding event-triggered condition rather than being preset artificially. Moreover, by utilizing graph theory and Lyapunov approach, two synchronization conditions for CVMLCSs are given, respectively.

To this end, we designed three subsidy policies in a scenario where purchasing insurance is one of the available strategies to users: under S P I n s SPIns and S P I n s p SPInsp , the subsidies are used as the insurance funds and the risk precaution aspect of the insurance funds, respectively, and under S P I n s d SPInsd , a fraction of the subsidies are used to support some free-riding users with high node importance in their purchase of insurance, and the remaining subsidies are used as the precaution aspect of the insurance funds. The subsidy policies are studied with a formulated security investment game model on scale-free networks from the perspectives of the public and insurer. The results show that S P I n s d SPInsd can always work effectively and outperforms others in limiting the extent of an epidemic outbreak with similar or lower social costs, and without a reduction in profit for the insurer. More importantly, an interesting phenomenon emerges in the S P I n s p SPInsp scenario: under specific insurance parameters, the increase in subsidy funding has a negative impact on preventing the risk spread, leading to larger final epidemic sizes. In addition, the effectiveness of S P I n s d SPInsd on scale-free networks with larger average degree or network size and random networks are also studied. We anticipate this work can provide useful insights for policy makers with respect to design and implementation of optimal subsidy policies related to the control of epidemic security risks under an insurance scenario.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of the evolution of cooperation, interaction diversity has attracted extensive attention. Traditional studies mainly focus exclusively on either time or space, and the comprehensive impact of these two dimensions on the evolution of cooperation deserves further exploration. In this paper, the interaction willingness is abstracted as the network weight, and an adaptive mechanism for interaction willingness based on the delay effect is proposed by combining the network weight and accumulated payoff. Specifically, individuals adjust their willingness to participate in the game with a delay, considering the change in accumulated payoffs within a certain period, rather than the change in immediate payoffs. The degree of delay is reflected in the length of individuals&#39; memory of historical payoffs. Simulation results deviate from the intuition that more information facilitates cooperation, and in certain modes of interaction willingness adjustment, the correlation between cooperation level and memory–length is non–monotonic. Long–memory is conducive to promoting cooperation under the condition of a relatively large range adjustment of interaction willingness. Conversely, with a narrow adjustment range of interaction willingness, cooperation can be effectively established with short–memory. These results hold substantial implications for both theory and practice, as slight adjustment often corresponds to low loss and high operability. In addition, the underlying mechanism is furthermore explored, revealing that the ‘isolation zones’ composed of individuals with low interaction willingness play an important role in promoting cooperation.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we studied the fraction of cooperators in the public goods game, taking into account the memory effect that affects the strategy updating. Unlike previous studies where an agent learned the opponent&#39;s last strategy based on their last payoffs, agents with memory in this study choose to cooperate according to opponents&#39; effective strategies by comparing their effective payoffs based on payoffs and strategies in their memories. The effective payoff of an agent is the weighted average of previous strategies in the agent&#39;s memory. The weight is the decay measuring the significance of previous strategies and former payoffs are less significant than latter ones upon the future strategy. And it is the same with the effective strategy. By this means, when the effective payoff and the effective strategy share a same memory length and a same set of decay, the numerical simulation shows increasing the memory length or a homogeneous decay promotes cooperation among agents. However, it is a surprise that the effective payoff and the effective strategy have opposite effects. Homogeneous payoff weights lead to a higher fraction of cooperators, while heterogeneous strategy weights favors the cooperation, especially when agents only consider the latest strategy. Comparing the effect of memorizing payoffs and strategies, the effect of memorizing payoffs plays a dominant role. Furthermore, when the total memory length is limited, agents should memorize as many historical payoffs as possible. In addition the qualitative result above is independent of the rational noise.},

Motivated by the need for model-free and optimal consensus control in complex MASs, a novel distributed scheme utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to overcome these challenges. The MAS network is randomly partitioned into sub-networks where agents collaborate within each subgroup to attain tracking control and ensure convergence of positions and speeds to a common value. However, agents from distinct subgroups compete to achieve diverse tracking objectives. Furthermore, the heterogeneous MASs considered have unknown first and second-order dynamics, adding to the complexity of the problem. To address the OBCC issue, the policy iteration (PI) algorithm is used to acquire solutions for discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations while implementing a data-driven actor-critic neural network (ACNN) framework. Ultimately, the accuracy of our proposed approach is confirmed through the presentation of numerical simulations.},

This breakthrough stimulates us to consider the signed graphs version of Hedetniemi&#39;s conjecture, where signed graphs are graphs with an assignment of { ± 1 } {±1} to the edges. In this paper, we provide counterexamples to the signed analog of Hedetniemi&#39;s conjecture. Nevertheless, we show that the chromatic number of the product is determined by its factors in some instances, i.e., if Γ → Θ Γ→Θ and ( Θ , π ) (Θ,π) is balanced, then χ ( ( Γ , σ ) × ( Θ , π ) ) = χ ( ( Γ , σ ) ) χ((Γ,σ)×(Θ,π))=χ((Γ,σ)) . As a byproduct, we investigate the homomorphisms from a factor of ( Γ , σ ) × ( Θ , π ) (Γ,σ)×(Θ,π) to the other, say from ( Γ , σ ) (Γ,σ) to ( Θ , π ) (Θ,π) . We find that if such homomorphisms exist, then the chromatic number of ( Γ , + ) (Γ,+) provides a lower bound for χ ( ( Γ , σ ) × ( Θ , π ) ) χ((Γ,σ)×(Θ,π)) . Moreover, if Γ is a core, then the number of balanced subgraphs isomorphic to ( Γ , + ) (Γ,+) in ( Γ , σ ) × ( Θ , π ) (Γ,σ)×(Θ,π) is equal to the number of such homomorphisms.},

For populations engaging in group foraging or migration, complex societies with multiple hierarchical levels are common. A prevalent scenario involves two dominant levels, one corresponding to leaders and the other composed of followers. In this paper, we explore how a group can be influenced by a set of leaders to organize and move in a coordinated manner towards a preferred direction. Specifically, we balance social interactions among group members through two weighted factors, corresponding to the leadership and experience of leaders. Through computer simulations, we observe a linear relationship between the proportion of leaders guiding group movement and the group size, with larger groups requiring a higher proportion of leaders while maintaining initial density. Additionally, we identify an optimal leadership interval where group movement performance enhances with increasing leadership up to a certain point, beyond which it starts to decline. Similar patterns are observed concerning individual visual field, indicating the existence of an optimal interval for visual angle. Our findings not only contribute to understanding collective motion in natural biological systems but also provide new insights into effective leadership mechanisms in artificial swarm systems.},

Due to an extension of the standard law of quantitative inheritance, each evolutionary mechanism corresponds to a function between random variables associated with distinct stages of the life cycle. Such an approach leads to a two-dimensional map where the dynamics of the phenotypic mean and variance are directly connected. Then, the declining population paradigm is explored in terms of the critical rate of environmental change and using the techniques of the dynamical systems theory. Our results first reveal the opposing pressures on the phenotypic variance due to the conflict between phenotypic load and the ability to pursue the optimum, translated into an optimal value for maximizing the critical rate. Secondly, the introduction of development, through the particular case of linear plasticity, leads to a decreasing degree of stability with the magnitude of plasticity, which means that the recovery time from disturbances is harmed as the plastic effect intensifies, even though no constitutive costs have been assumed, a feature almost as important as the mean fitness to the viability of populations subject to persistent changes. Notwithstanding, the system is stable, and the growth rate benefits from increased plasticity, as expected.},

First, the dynamic properties of the model are analyzed, including the existence and stability of equilibria, bifurcations dynamics, such as transcritical, saddle-node, and Hopf bifurcations. Our results reveal that fear can promote the formation of the stability of the model by transforming it from an unstable state to a stable state. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis indicated that when the level of fear reaches 25.4, the number of juvenile prey affected by fear decreases by 40% compared to those not affected by fear. Terrifyingly, the predators are on the brink of extinction in high levels of fear. Moreover, we examine the impact of time delay on fear in the previous model as prey needs some time to assess the predation risk. Some dynamic characteristics of this delayed model are also analyzed. Results indicate that the fear effect is conducive to generating a stable state, while delay is detrimental to generating a stable state, leading to limit cycles or even chaos.},

The extortion strategy can unilaterally ensure that its own payoffs are not lower than its opponents&#39;, which has aroused widespread concern. In this article, based on spatial multigame, an evolutionary dynamics model with extortion strategy is proposed, which can significantly influence the evolution of different dilemma strategies in the system. Moreover, the limited resources as a co-evolutionary factor are also involved in this model. Throughout the entire evolutionary process, individuals in SDG and collaborators are more likely to obtain more resources and the number of resources owned by individuals in PDG is continuously decreasing. By using single square lattice network, we discuss in detail the evolutionary dynamics of the proposed model and study the impact of the sucker&#39;s payoff θ and extortion factor λ on different strategies of the system. Through a large number of experiments, it is found that the θ can significantly increase the number of cooperators. And there is an appropriate λ value, which can not increase the number of its own individuals, but also form an alliance with cooperators to jointly resist the intrusion of defectors. Besides, the relationship between θ , λ and network reciprocity is studied. We obtain that the θ and λ can significantly improve network reciprocity. Finally, based on different extortion factor λ , the proportion of different strategy in PDG and SDG is discussed to explain the robustness of the results.},

However, it inhibits rapid parameter updating and requires extra computational resources in the online stage. In the present study, the pre-reduced interface sampling method is proposed by synthesizing substructures and reducing the interface before beginning the online stage. The interface solution is obtained through offline and online adaptation, likewise the procedure of computing the interior solution of previous studies. Additionally, congruence transformations are applied to each reduced interface, which is mandatory for interpolating symmetric positive definite matrices with respect to a new input parameter. As a result, the online performance of IB-PROM is greatly enhanced, showing rapid and near real-time adaptations to the variations in system parameters.},

The fundamental framework for this exploration involves the application of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method coupled with inequality techniques. The investigation derives sufficient conditions that guarantee both input and output strict passivity in FRDSs. Furthermore, in the presence of fluctuating uncertain parameters within FRDSs, robust passivity is also studied and sufficient conditions are offered. The obtained sufficient condition shows that a larger diffusion coefficient facilitates the achievement of the passivity of FRDSs. Finally, the validity of our theoretical findings is subsequently corroborated through numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The finite-time stabilization of discontinuous switched systems is a highly challenging problem. To address this problem, this article proposes a unified controller that achieves fixed-time and preassigned-time stabilization of discontinuous switched systems with time-varying delays, which is superior to finite-time stabilization. Compared with finite-time stabilization results, the settling time for fixed-time stabilization is independent of the initial state of the system. For preassigned-time stabilization, the settling time can be set in advance regardless of the initial state and controller parameters. Also, the fixed-time and preassigned-time stabilization methods proposed in this article are general and can be extended for applications to other nonlinear discontinuous systems with time delays.},

To solve this problem, it is necessary to ensure that each agent can obtain the reference trajectory originating from an unknown exosystem and reconstruct the solution of the regulator equation containing the exogenous signal and unknown parameter vectors within a fixed time, and the unknown exosystem makes it difficult to solve these two problems with existing tools. By using auxiliary filtering variables, we propose a fixed-time adaptive distributed observer (FTADO) and design a fixed-time distributed internal model (FTDIM) based on this FTADO. These two new tools ensure the solvability of the two problems just mentioned. Then, based on these two tools, we transform the problem into a fixed-time stabilization problem of a so-called augmented system. Through the backstepping technique, we propose a distributed controller that solves this fixed-time stabilization problem while relaxing the assumptions of similar references.},

  abstract     = {We explore the complex dynamics of epidemics, considering the significant effects of disease transmission, newborn individuals, and mortality rate. Employing an evolutionary game theory approach, we model the vaccination aspect for newborns, incorporating potential periodic behavior. The goal is to create an engaging simulation that underscores the criticality of timely infant vaccinations. By introducing periodic elements, the game adds complexity, fostering player participation and awareness of vaccination schedules. In contrast to traditional intervention game models focused on adult vaccine behavior, our approach recognizes the unique challenges posed by newborn vaccination. We address the limitations of existing models by developing a generalized compartmental model, accommodating infection duration distribution, and accurately capturing both periodic and non-periodic disease trajectories. The results show that higher efficacy in a newborn vaccine program can potentially eradicate the disease, but higher effectiveness and cost may deter vaccination. Increased motivation cost boosts vaccination rates without impacting epidemic size, whereas lower costs stabilize vaccination rates. Lower vaccine costs call for increased government investment to counter hesitancy. However, reduced efficacy and lower motivation lead to higher Vaccine Fear Scores, discouraging participation. Our work also offers a unique perspective on the dilemma of newborn vaccination, providing solutions with closed-form expressions that may exhibit periodic or non-periodic behavior. This approach facilitates disease modelers in exploring the potential periodicity of newborn vaccination programs, aiding efforts to prevent recurrent outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {An arbitrarily partitionable (AP) graph is a graph that can be partitioned into arbitrarily many connected graphs with arbitrary orders. Since independent seminal works by Barth, Baudon, and Puech, and Horňák and Woźniak, AP graphs have been receiving increasing attention in the literature, dedicated to understanding several of their aspects, including structural aspects, algorithmic aspects, and their connections with Hamiltonian graphs. Other aspects of interest cover variants of AP graphs, such as AP graphs that can be partitioned in an online way (OLAP graphs), AP graphs that can be partitioned in a recursive way (RAP graphs), and AP graphs that are edge-minimal (minAP graphs). In the current work, we initiate the study of the latter notion of minimality for OLAP and RAP graphs. That is, we wonder about OLAP and RAP graphs that are not spanned by any strictly smaller OLAP or RAP graph, respectively, leading to the notions of minOLAP and minRAP graphs. We prove that such non-trivial graphs exist, and explore connections between minAPness, minOLAPness, and minRAPness. In particular, we prove that some fundamental connections between APness, OLAPness, and RAPness do not generalise to their minimal counterparts. We also investigate small minOLAP and minRAP graphs, as well as sufficient conditions guaranteeing an OLAP or RAP graph is not minimal, thereby generalising known results on AP graphs. This work also includes many open questions and problems for further work on the topic, that are disseminated throughout.},

The new stochastic system studied in this paper has completely different system structures in different switching subspaces, and the coefficients are highly nonlinear. Moreover, the neutral term is subject to the Markovian switching. This work fills the gap of the stability analysis for differently structured highly nonlinear neutral stochastic functional systems. By using the Lyapunov functional method and the generalized Khasminskii-type conditions, we first establish the existence and uniqueness theorem as well as the asymptotical bounded property of the unique global solution. Then the important stable properties are obtained including H ∞ H∞ stability, asymptotic stability and exponential stability in L p Lp .

Three cases where the reputation reasoning ability parameter is homogeneous, endogenous, and exogenous are considered and compared. From simulation results, we find that high reputation reasoning ability can promote cooperation in all cases. Specifically, in the homogeneous reputation reasoning ability situation, compared with the first-order rules, the second-order information on reputation inhibits cooperation rather than promotes it and a significant magnitude of reputation change can also inhibit cooperation. In endogenous situations where reasoning ability is negatively correlated with individual reputation, large correlation coefficients can inhibit cooperation. In exogenous situations of the normal distribution, a high mean of reputation reasoning ability boosts cooperation, but when the variance is sufficiently large, the level of cooperation will no longer be affected. In scenarios of the power law distribution, the cooperation level improves with an increase in the power index. These findings further expand our understanding of high-order reputation evaluation rules in multiplayer games and incomplete reputation information environment on the evolution of cooperation from the perspective of reputation-dependent social learning.},

The command filtered backstepping approach is employed to address the “explosion of terms” issue inherent in standard backstepping method. A novel compensating system is incorporated to mitigate the effects of filtering errors and enhance the convergence of tracking errors. The composite estimation laws are designed by integrating the compensated tracking errors, prediction errors stemming from output estimators, along with the proportional and integral estimation errors of faulty terms. This on-line estimation framework enables achieving fast, robust and accurate estimation, even when employing low learning and modification gains. By incorporating modification terms with appropriate time-varying gains, it is demonstrated that the resulting system is globally exponentially stable.

Collatz conjecture has attracted a great deal of attention since it was put forward in 1930s due to the surprising nature. However, after strenuous efforts, many mathematicians think the current knowledge seems insufficient to solve Collatz conjecture, although it appears in a very simple form. As a replacement, a “periodic” (weaker) version of Collatz conjecture (called Collatz periodic conjecture) was proposed and discussed. In this paper, we would like to explore what properties Collatz (periodic) conjecture could imply. Maybe it is another possible direction to confirm or disprove Collatz (periodic) conjecture.}}},

  abstract     = {Cardiac arrhythmia is a common clinical problem in cardiology defined as the abnormality in heart rhythm. Bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter and sinus irregularity are common different classifications for arrhythmia. In this study, we develop a new approach to distinguishing between these most common heart rhythms. Our approach is based on dynamical system techniques, namely recurrence entropy of microstates, and recurrence vicinity threshold, in association with artificial intelligence. The results are based on a 12-lead electrocardiogram open dataset with more than 10,000 subjects which includes 11 different heart rhythms. The rhythms and other cardiac conditions of the dataset were labeled by more than one licensed physician. The main contributions of this work are the identification of how different heart rhythms affects the entropy of recurrence microstates and recurrence vicinity threshold parameter, and in doing so, this quantifier may be used as a feature extraction to artificial intelligence classifiers. We expect that our freely available methodology and our algorithm will be useful to communities where real-time physician diagnostics are not easily available. We show the 12 signals arising from ECG ( 12 × 5000 12×5000 ) data points can be pre-treated using the entropy of recurrence microstates and recurrence threshold, so that only 12 × 2 12×2 scalar values may be used in machine learning techniques. So our method involves a significant reduction of the data set to be analyzed by machine learning algorithms and can bring benefits in situations of pre-testing individuals, due to the minimum processing time and hardware required to perform the analysis. The additional information obtained by the two quantifiers may also be put together with the signals, consolidating data from multiple sources, adding more useful information to the dataset.},

  abstract     = {Due to their dynamic properties such as irregular sampling rate and high-frequency sampling, Continuous Time Series (CTS) are found in many applications. Since CTS with irregular sampling rate are difficult to model with standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), RNNs have been generalised to have continuous-time hidden dynamics defined by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), leading to the ODE-RNN model. Another approach that provides a better modelling is that of the Latent ODE model, which constructs a continuous-time model where a latent state is defined at all times. The Latent ODE model uses a standard RNN as the encoder and a Neural ODE as the decoder. However, since the RNN encoder leads to difficulties with missing data and ill-defined latent variables, a Latent ODE-RNN model has recently been proposed that uses a ODE-RNN model as the encoder instead. Both the Latent ODE and Latent ODE-RNN models are difficult to train due to the vanishing and exploding gradients problem. To overcome this problem, the main contribution of this paper is to propose and illustrate a new model based on a new Latent ODE using an ODE-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network as an encoder - the Latent ODE-LSTM model. To limit the growth of the gradients, the Norm Gradient Clipping strategy was embedded on the Latent ODE-LSTM model. The performance evaluation of the new Latent ODE-LSTM (with and without Norm Gradient Clipping) for modelling CTS with regular and irregular sampling rates is then demonstrated. Numerical experiments show that the new Latent ODE-LSTM performs better than Latent ODE-RNNs and can avoid the vanishing and exploding gradients during training.

Initially, an unstructured mesh fluid solver with multi-type elements is developed using the cell-based S-FEM (CS-FEM) in the Eulerian framework. Subsequently, a fluid force-driven strategy is employed to trace the particle trajectories based on the Lagrangian approach. Moreover, a one-way coupling strategy is designed to perform the solution of the particle-fluid system. To ensure accurate computation of fluid information at the particle positions, we introduce the spherical mean value interpolation algorithm that is compatible with polyhedral elements, enabling uniform interpolation across different types of elements. The correctness of both the Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers is validated independently using benchmarks. Numerical results, validated by references and the finite volume method (FVM) software Fluent, demonstrate the effective prediction of particle trajectories and distributions by the proposed algorithm. Overall, this algorithm expands the application of CS-FEM to multiphase flows and exhibits its capability to handle practical particle-laden flow problems.},

The output signal relies on an output mapping acted as a mask, defined as a privacy-protection-like method, so that the internal state of one agent cannot be identified by other distrustful eavesdroppers or attackers. Moreover, the construction of a unified event-triggered control scheme retains the advantages of the saturation threshold triggering strategy, incorporates distributed errors, and increases the flexibility of thresholds. Furthermore, for stochastic time-delay multi-agent systems, the initial value limitation of the conventional first-order filter is removed by a first-order Levant differentiator, and a new estimation term in the fuzzy observer is established to solve the nonlinear fault. The unknown function in pure-feedback form is addressed via combining Butterworth low-pass filter and radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs). Finally, the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop systems is demonstrated, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by some simulation results.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on investigating the stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with double weakly singular kernels. Our primary objective is to examine the well-posedness of the proposed equation. Specifically, we explore the presence of existence, uniqueness, boundedness, and the continuous dependence of the exact solution on the initial data. Additionally, we develop a stochastic θ -scheme as a numerical solution for the equation and demonstrate that the convergence rate of the scheme is influenced by the kernel parameters. To validate the accuracy and reliability of our theoretical findings, we present two numerical examples. Notably, one of these examples concentrates on estimating the price of a European call option using the Heston stochastic volatility model with a singular kernel. Our results, when compared to the corresponding findings by Li et al. [3] , not only relax the integrable limitations of singular kernels but also establish a precise convergence order. In addition, we propose an improved scheme, based on the efficient sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation, to address the low computational efficiency of the stochastic θ -scheme. The results confirm that our approach aligns significantly with the expected physical interpretations.},

  abstract     = {The competition between rumor and knowledge has received significant attention from the global world. How to spread knowledge to better contain rumor has also become an important practical issue. In this study, we build a multi-compartment model in a multiplex network to study the competitive diffusion of knowledge and rumor. Two factors are emphasized in the model: penetration of knowledge into rumor, and spreading channel difference between knowledge and rumor. The model is further improved with the information-infected states divided into two sub-states: information-accepted and information-sharing. The mean-field method is adopted to analyze the model and then verified by the numerical results in both ER random networks and BA scale-free networks. The consistent results in ER and BA networks show that both rumor and knowledge thresholds are increased by the intensity of competition between them, and the rumor-knowledge competition goes through four phases: “no rumor and no knowledge”, “rumor outbreak and no knowledge” (rumor wins), “no rumor and knowledge outbreak” (knowledge wins), and “rumor vs knowledge” (rumor competes and coexists with knowledge), where the thresholds of rumor and knowledge act as the boundary of different phases. The different results in ER and BA networks show that rumor and knowledge are generally easier to break out in BA networks. But the BA rumor threshold may exceed the ER rumor threshold with the increase of rumor-knowledge competition, making rumor instead become difficult to break out in ER networks than that in BA networks, which infers that the hub nodes play very important roles in knowledge spreading. Based on the results, two types of management on rumor-knowledge competition are explored to control rumor and accelerate knowledge. Interestingly, critical values are discovered in both types of management, highlighting the importance of strengthening knowledge sharing and penetrating knowledge into rumor spreaders and listeners. The results reveal the management complexity of rumor-knowledge competition under different conditions.},

Specifically, in pursuit of relieving the communication pressure, the stochastic communication protocol is adopted, which can regulate the transmission of output signal during the communication process. Moreover, for the purpose of decreasing the negative impact of one channel failure on network communication and enhancing data reliability, the redundant channels transmission is introduced. Then, the protocol-based FD filter is constructed such that the resultant FD dynamics system attains the global asymptotic stability in mean-square sense and satisfies the H ∞ H∞ performance index. Moreover, an implement-to-easy algorithm is developed to facilitate the solvability of the desirable FD filtering method. In the end, two illustrative examples are utilized to demonstrate the validity of the developed FD filtering algorithm.},

We first establish semi-discrete scheme of time-space fractional diffusion equation, which uses linear finite element or fourth-order compact difference method combining with matrix transfer technique to approximate spectral fractional Laplacian. Then we introduce a fast time-stepping L1 scheme for time discretization. The proposed scheme can exactly evaluate fractional power of matrix and perform matrix-vector multiplication at per time level by using discrete sine transform, which doesn&#39;t need to resort to any iteration method and can significantly reduce computation cost and memory requirement. Further, we address stability and convergence analyses of full discrete scheme based on fast time-stepping L1 scheme on graded time mesh. Our error analysis shows that the choice of graded mesh factor ω = ( 2 − α ) / α ω=(2−α)/α shall give an optimal temporal convergence O ( N − ( 2 − α ) ) O(N−(2−α)) with N denoting the number of time mesh. Finally, ample numerical examples are delivered to illustrate our theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the suggested scheme.},

Secondly, the generalized ∞-norm and 1-norm are introduced to induce the global exponential stability for CLVMNNs, and two special Lyapunov functionals are established to prove the stability. Thirdly, the strict assumption of the boundedness of activation function in previous research is loosened, and some less conservative conditions of stability are obtained based on the constructed Lyapunov functionals.

Compared with the simple adaptive control, the designed control protocol consists of two parts: NNAFC and the event-triggered impulsive estimator. To save communication costs, communications among followers are only carried out at discrete instants determined by the event-triggered impulsive rule. Two kinds of estimators and controllers are designed for two cases with or without communication delay, respectively. Further, NNAFC can be further improved to eliminate errors due to uncertain function approximation for some special cases. Utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory and impulsive control theory, we obtain some sufficient conditions to implement time-varying formation task.

This helps not only reduce the number of estimated parameters but also relax the restriction of using inequality when exploiting the norm estimation concept in a conventional way; thus, retaining the same properties of the original system.

Based on the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma, we synthesize these sources of anxiety and propose a new model that can reflect the impact of anxiety on people&#39;s strategies. We consider the effect of anxiety on the evolution of a group in a square lattice network with periodic boundaries, and propose the rules for quantifying the individual&#39;s anxiety and for updating the individual&#39;s strategies. Simulation results from our model show that if the players focus more on the past game records or have a strong resilience to stress, then this can lead to stable cooperation in the group.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a distributed continuous-time algorithm that utilizes dual consensus to tackle the optimization problem involving time-varying (TV) local objective functions and TV coupled equality constraint. Here, the local objective functions can be any strongly convex functions. The optimum solution is represented by a trajectory rather than a fixed point, owing to the dynamic nature of the objective functions and the constraint. The initial step involves converting the studied problem into an equivalent saddle-point problem. Subsequently, we provide the optimal conditions for this transformed problem. Then a distributed continuous-time algorithm based on dual consensus is provided, guaranteeing that all agents possess the capability to discover and follow the optimal TV trajectories. It is noticeable that there are no limitations imposed on the information regarding local objective functions and the coupled equality constraint except for the strongly convexity of local objective functions. In addition, two simulation instances and the comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are performed in order to validate the proposed algorithm.},

This paper integrates both reputation and emotions to examine their collective impacts on the evolution of cooperation. Initially, we define the expression of individual emotional profiles and emotional reputation. Subsequently, we consider the combined effects of the emotional reputation of an individual&#39;s neighbors and their interactive individuals on emotional responses. Further, an emotional transfer activation parameter is introduced. Lastly, we construct an algorithm for the evolutionary game of emotions. Simulation results demonstrate that considering emotional reputation is more conducive to the cooperation. The emotional reputation of interacting individuals has a greater influence on the development of positive emotions and the establishment of collaboration within groups than that of neighboring environments. In heterogeneous networks, considering the emotional reputation of neighbors increases the probability of “free-riding” by unfriendly people. When game parameters are set in favor of betrayal and negative emotions, the system evolves to produce “cautious and friendly people”. Individuals with stable emotions, high sympathy for the weak, and high respect for the strong dominate the group. Furthermore, the individuals&#39; emotional expression towards both the weak and the strong exhibits an evolutionary synchronicity. Compared to other network structures, scale-free networks are more conducive to the evolutionary dominance of emotions of high respect for the strong.},

It is generally believed that the smaller the minimum number of driver nodes and the lower the cost of external control of the whole network to achieve the ideal state, the better the controllability of networks. In this paper, the minimum driver node problem of a hypernetwork is transformed into the maximum multiplicative problem of the eigenvalue of its 2-section graph. The minimum driver node numbers of two types of typical k -uniform hypertree networks are described, and their bounds are also given. By designing an algorithm, the method of characterizing the driver node set is obtained, and it is found that the selection of the minimum driver nodes of the network tends to the nodes with low hyperdegree. In addition, the paper verifies the minimum driver node set and the theoretical analysis results of controllability by simulation analysis.},

Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate unknown smooth functions. In the control design, an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) from sensor-to-controller is introduced to economize on unnecessary transmission and communication resources. Additionally, a novel performance function is constructed to bound tracking errors, and a series of error transformations are devised to convert the “constrained” system into an equivalent “unconstrained” system. The proposed control strategy ensures that all signals in the closed-loop system have semi-globally uniformly bounded stability. Moreover, prescribed performance bounds ensure output tracking with minimal (or even zero) overshoot. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed control method are validated through comparative simulations.},

Individuals are categorized based on their susceptibility to and their capacity for disease propagation, while the influence of varying infection rates on epidemic expansion is investigated. Information is bifurcated into constructive narratives with beneficial outcomes, and detrimental narratives originating from rumors. The method of information dispersion incorporates considerations such as herd behavior, preventative costs, and individual risk perception. Utilizing the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA), a dynamic equation is formulated to delineate epidemic propagation and the epidemic threshold for the proposed model is calculated. Results demonstrate that promoting swift dissemination of positive information, concurrently with curbing the spread of negative narratives, can appreciably mitigate epidemic proliferation. The findings also imply that facilitating access to beneficial information, minimizing the consequences of harmful narratives, decreasing prevention-related expenses, and enhancing personal risk perception can significantly reduce the ultimate magnitude of the epidemic. Notably, the study reveals that indirect contact can considerably augment epidemic spread. As the infection rate via indirect contact escalities, the extent of epidemic transmission broadens and the threshold for epidemic transmission diminishes.},

The necessary and sufficient conditions of the H ∞ H∞ performance for FOSs over finite frequency range are given through the generalized μ analysis method. This method is different from the traditional μ -analysis method, which is only suitable for integer order systems. Secondly, according to these obtained LMI-based criteria for H ∞ H∞ performance index and a key projection lemma, we design an H ∞ H∞ observer-based controller to stabilize the estimation error and decrease the H ∞ H∞ norm for the FOS simultaneously. With the help of the matrix congruence transformation, the feedback gain matrix is parameterized by a scalar matrix. Thirdly, to deal with the nonlinear terms in matrix inequalities, an iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) algorithm is developed. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to explain the correctness of the established results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for constructing incoherent unit norm tight frames, termed block coordinate descent-based alternating projection. In the proposed approach, the underlying min-max problem was reformulated in a block-wise fashion by taking a fixed number of columns as a block and adding a spectral constraint, and it was approximately solved via an alternating projection method with Nesterov accelerated gradient technique. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is particularly efficient for the construction of incoherent unit norm tight frames with high redundancy and has great advantages in running efficiency.},

In particular, an improved-equivalent-input-disturbance estimator approach (IEIDEA)-based truncated predictive controller is designed to synchronously compensate the effect of unknown external disturbances and time-varying delay. Specifically, by making use of IEIDEA, the unknown disturbances are estimated with high precision and incorporated into the control input channel, which eases the way to achieve the desired tracking performances. Specifically, the state predictor satisfies the delay-free state-space equation and is used in controller design along with prediction. In accordance with linear matrix inequality framework and Lyapunov stability theory, a set of adequate conditions are established to guarantee the state tracking performance of SMJSs. Finally, the numerical examples with simulation results are provided to validate the efficacy and practicability of the established control technique.},

A system of DDE equations was derived, both theoretically and numerically, using the Galerkin technique method. A condition is defined that helps to find the existence of Hopf bifurcation points. Full diagrams of the Hopf bifurcation points and areas of stability are investigated in detail. Furthermore, we discuss three different sources of delay on bifurcation maps, and what impacts of all these cases of delays on others free rates on the regions of the Hopf bifurcation in this model. We find two different stability regions when the delay time is positive ( τ &gt; 0 τ&amp;gt;0 ), while the no-delay case ( τ = 0 τ=0 ) has only one stable region. Moreover, the effect of delays and diffusion rates on all free others parameters in this model have been considered, which can significantly impact upon the stability regions in both population concentrations. It is also found that, as diffusion increases, the time delay increases. However, as the delay maturation is increased, the Hopf points for both proliferation of the population and advection rates are decreased and it causes raises to the region of instability. In addition, bifurcation diagrams are drawn to display chosen instances of the periodic oscillation and two dimensional phase portraits for both concentrations have been plotted to corroborate all analytical outputs that investigated in the theoretical part.},

The micro-macro Markov chain works in three steps: 1) compute the reaction coordinate value associated to the current molecular state; 2) generate a new macroscopic proposal using a proposal distribution; 3) reconstruct a molecular configuration that is consistent with the newly sampled macroscopic value. Here, we systematically study the impact of method parameters on the efficiency of the micro-macro Markov chain Monte Carlo method, namely the chosen macroscopic dynamics and the microscopic reconstruction distribution. We specifically investigate the impact of the macroscopic and reconstruction proposal distributions and their parameters on this efficiency on two prototypical molecular systems, a three-atom molecule and butane. We find, through detailed computational experiments, that the efficiency is largest when these proposal distributions are close to their time-invariant counterparts and that it is robust with respect to parameter changes.},

Our main results are as follows: Let R 0 P R0P and R 0 V R0V represent the basic reproduction numbers in the physical and virtual worlds, respectively.

Due to the weakly singular behavior of the exact solution near the initial time t = 0 , we use the non-uniform meshes to capture the rapid change of the solution at t = 0 . The Crank-Nicolson method and product-integration (PI) rule are proposed to approximate temporal derivative and the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional integral term, respectively. The fully discrete scheme is obtained by the standard central finite difference method (FDM) in space. The stability in L 2 -norm and convergence of the CN-ADI difference scheme are strictly proved, where the convergence reached O ( τ 2 + h x 2 + h y 2 + h z 2 ) . The ADI algorithm greatly reduces the computational cost of the three-dimensional problems in viscoelastic dynamics. At last, the results of numerical examples verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It capitalizes on the inherent principles of social cooperation, adaptability and learning from peers to help individuals in a population search for optima. In this work, we propose a novel co-evolutionary game model in which individuals adapt their interaction radii by applying the PSO algorithm and study how the learning factor ω in the algorithm shapes the cooperation dynamics. We find that the adaptive interaction radii based on PSO could significantly enhance cooperation, especially in the scenario with strong social dilemma. By studying the snapshots of strategy pattern and the distributions of interaction radii in the population, we further reveal that the PSO-based adapting mechanism can protect cooperators by shrinking the interaction radii in a severe environment with an appropriate ω . Nevertheless, when cooperation is favorable, the adaptation leads to a relatively wide distribution of interaction radii to facilitate the spread of cooperation. The results of this work highlight the potential of the PSO algorithm to resolve social dilemmas when combined with the evolutionary dynamics.},

Far less is known, however, how the determination of the optimal threshold for prior agreement in force and the posterior compensation affect collaboration, and the relevance of different strategies. Here, in the context of public goods games and using an evolutionary game theory model, we investigate the evolution of cooperation and the relevance of different strategies by introducing prior agreements and posterior compensation in structured populations. Analytical results show that posterior compensation does not always promote cooperation and that there are sudden increases and decreases in the first-order phase transition. Interestingly, prior agreements without posterior compensation can also effectively restrain defectors, with cooperation abundance remaining at a high level. Furthermore, the threshold of effective agreement has nonlinear effects on cooperation, with cooperation abundance peaking at intermediate thresholds under specific parameters.},

A novel prescribed time synchronous tracking control scheme is proposed within a denial of service attack conversion mechanism. Firstly, on account of the UAV formation in the presence of aerodynamic damping and denial of service attacks, a formation cooperative control model is established under a second-order system. Secondly, to perform formation synchronous tracking within a settling time, a time-varying auxiliary function on account of synchronous state errors is designed for the convergence of prescribed time tracking. The control parameters are designed using a key eigenvalue scaling technique under the effect of denial of service attacks on network topology. The proposed scheme is also extended to UAV formation with a detailed-balanced graph. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {How did cooperation emerge and persist while betrayal was beneficial for individuals? Previous studies suggested that network reciprocity was a promising explanation. However, these studies usually analyzed cooperation performances of different types of networks separately and/or statically, thus failing to fully capture the co-evolution and interaction features in our history. We proposed a mechanism that analyzed the cooperation level of different types of networks under co-evolutionary circumstances of cooperation and heterogeneous networks. The paper adopted the prisoner&#39;s dilemma game and analyzed Erdos-Renyi (ER) random networks, Watts Strogatz (WS) small-world networks, and Barabasi-Albert (BA) scale-free networks. In this study, these networks were interconnected and continuously grew after gaming evolutions were stable. And the growth versions of WS and ER respectively were proposed that maintained their topology features. Comprehensive experimental results showed that high-level cooperation emerged and was maintained in scale-free networks. This advantage was strengthened with networks grew from a small scale to a middle scale. Moreover, once most nodes of a scale-free network evolved to be cooperators, the group cooperation they formed were able to survive in betrayer-prevailing and high betrayal temptation environments. These findings may deepen our understanding of the relationship between how cooperation evolved and why many social networks exhibited scale-free properties.},

  abstract     = {Pediatric traumatic brain injuries represent a public health concern globally. Epidemiological studies are essential to understand their extent, uncover risk factors and outcome predictors, and establish efficient prevention policies. Etiological investigations also benefit from epidemiological data. In young, pre-linguistic children, distinguishing between accidental and non-accidental trauma is often challenging for frontline clinicians. Classification errors can have severe repercussions for children and their families. Past influential epidemiological studies have drawn general conclusions about the etiology of pediatric traumatic brain injuries based on specific statistical information, such as hospital patient fatality rates after reported accidental falls. In this article, we use simple mathematical models to revisit one of these studies and discuss the reliability of its conclusion. We show that apparent paradoxical discrepancies, such as hospital patient fatality rates that are higher after short versus long falls, may have mathematical justification and do not necessarily justify seeking alternative etiological explanations such as non-accidental trauma.},

The difference for each control point is computed concerning the randomized block coordinate descent method. From geometric and algebraic aspects, the illustrations of RPIA are provided. We prove that RPIA constructs a series of fitting curves (resp., surfaces), whose limit curve (resp., surface) can converge in expectation to the least-squares fitting result of the given data points.

Then, a novel error compensation mechanism based on the state constraint conditions is incorporated into the tracking differentiator (TD) technology to tackle the “differential explosion” problem in the backstepping design, and a low-cost adaptive control strategy under single adaptive law is built to simplify the computation, meanwhile, the control objective is achieved.

The first benchmark is provided by [4] in the no-reinsurance setting and when the claims are exponentially distributed. The second benchmark refers to [8] where capital injections are not permitted, but different claim distributions can be employed. On the other hand, we illustrate the improvement of the models in [8] when capital injection is allowed. We also look into the effect of reinsurance in the model [4] .

First, the states and sparse malicious attacks of the original system are reorganized into the states of the new system obtained by an improved augmentation method (rather than a singular augmentation method). Then, based on the new system, the states and attacks can be reconstructed simultaneously by the designed Luenberger-like observer. Furthermore, a novel dynamic output feedback (DOF) controller is proposed using the estimated values of the attacks, and a cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm is designed to obtain the controller gains. The results show that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov that both the estimation errors and the original system states will converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. In addition, the correlation results without delay are given. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

To avoid the commonly made assumption of time-invariant transition probabilities, a piecewise-homogeneous Markov chain is presented, wherein the variations of transition probabilities are regulated by a higher-level Markov process. Additionally, a memory-based dynamic event-triggered protocol is proposed to leverage the useful information contained in historically launched packets and achieve better control performance. Moreover, a hidden nonhomogeneous Markov model strategy is utilized to identify the modes mismatch between the estimator and the Markov jump memristive neural networks. This greatly reduces the complexity of processing the mode information of the system. Eventually, to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results, a simulation example is carried out.},

By employing the Lyapunov stability method, a sufficient condition is presented in the framework of linear matrix inequality to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with the prescribed cost. Comparative simulation studies are supplied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed composite control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Crosstalk represents a ubiquitous phenomenon in which strategic moves made in one game can influence actions in another. Reiter et al. [1] first integrated crosstalk with the repeated prisoner&#39;s dilemma model in structured populations. We extend their strategic space from one-step reactive strategies that consider only the actions of the opponent to memory-one strategies that consider the actions of both parties. We explore the cooperation rate of some representative memory-one strategies in repeated prisoner&#39;s dilemma games for multi-player structured populations when crosstalk exists, and focus on finding evolutionarily stable strategies that are cooperative in the memory-one strategy space under the impact of crosstalk. Simulation results in the strategic dynamics show that appropriately forgiving defection is conducive to cooperative stability in the population when crosstalk exists. Specifically, for strategies that can promote cooperation, there is a mutual restriction between tolerating the behavior of both defecting (the focused player and his opponent both defecting, DD) and forgiving unilateral defecting (the focused player cooperating while his opponent defecting, CD). That is, a more forgiving behavior of CD requires a lower tolerance for DD, while a higher tolerance of DD requires a less forgiving behavior of CD. Notably, we find two effective strategies, namely, Win-Stay-Lose-Shift (WSLS) and Firm‑but-Fair (FBF) in the facilitation of cooperation in game dynamics with crosstalk. Moreover, we reveal that the structured population can better suppress the negative impact of crosstalk on cooperation. This investigation provides complementary insights into the interplay between strategic decision-making and the influence of crosstalk within the context of memory-one strategies.},

  abstract     = {Investigations into trust behavior between investors and trustees using trust games have gained significant attention in recent years. However, understanding the process of trust evolution remains challenging. The margin system, widely employed in the financial industry as an economic and behavioral incentive mechanism, aims to maintain order in financial markets and protect participants&#39; rights and interests. Despite its extensive use, the precise influence of the margin system on trust evolution dynamics remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose an N -player trust game model that incorporates a margin system within an infinite well-mixed population. In our model, a third-party institution collects a proportionate amount of margin from trustees, which is returned upon fulfilling their obligations but forfeited otherwise. By utilizing replicated dynamic equations, we find that implementing the margin system can establish a stable coexistence state between investors and trustworthy trustees, representing a significant advancement in trust evolution. Additionally, an intriguing finding arises from our observation of an inverted U -shaped relationship between the magnitude of the attraction domain for coexistence and the coefficient of the margin. This suggests that excessively high margin proportions can discourage trustees&#39; participation, while excessively low proportions may fail to effectively deter dishonest behavior. Optimal margin proportions can effectively promote trust evolution.},

  abstract     = {Studying social dilemmas prompts the question of how cooperation can emerge in situations where individuals are expected to act selfishly. Here, in the framework of the one-shot Public Goods Game (PGG), we introduce the concept that individuals can adjust their behaviour based on the cooperative commitments made by other players in the group prior to the actual PGG interaction. To this end, we establish a commitment threshold that group members must meet for a commitment to be formed. We explore the effects of punishing commitment non-compliant players (those who commit and defect if the commitment is formed) and rewarding commitment-compliant players (those who commit and cooperate if the commitment is formed). In the presence of commitment and absence of an incentive mechanism, we observe that conditional behaviour based on commitment alone can enhance cooperation, especially when considering a specific commitment threshold value. In the presence of punishment, our results suggest that the survival of cooperation is most likely at intermediate commitment thresholds. Notably, cooperation is maximised at high commitment thresholds, when punishment occurs more frequently. Moreover, even when cooperation rarely survives, a cyclic behaviour emerges, facilitating the persistence of cooperation. For the reward case, we found that cooperation is highly frequent regardless of the commitment threshold adopted.},

The regularization properties of SODM are demonstrated under both a priori and a posteriori stopping rules. In the context of time discretization, we propose several iterative schemes with different choices of damping parameters. A truncated discrepancy principle is employed as the stop criterion. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to show the efficiency of the SODM: on the whole, compared with the classical Tikhonov method and the first-order dynamical-system method, the SODM leads to more-accurate approximate solutions while requiring fewer-iterative numbers.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the impulsive observers design problem of perturbed Lipschitz nonlinear systems subject to noisy delayed discrete measurements. The transmission delay, state perturbation, and measurement noise simultaneously hinder the convergence of impulsive observer. To deal with the difficulty, the observation error system with delayed impulses is represented as an augmented system with switching delay-free impulses. By taking into account the switching structure of the impulse dynamics, the impulse observation gain matrix is modelled as a function of the time interval between two consecutive sampling instant and update instant. Such a structure of the observation gain matrix is able to adapt to the variation of sampling period and transmission delay. To obtain a tractable design condition, the idea of piecewise linear interpolation is applied to represent the impulse observation gain matrix as a piecewise linear form, which is determined by finite static impulse gains. A piecewise Lyapunov function which matches the piecewise linear structure of the observation gain is constructed to analyze the exponential input-to-state stability (EISS) property of the observation error system. The EISS gain quantifies the robustness performance of the designed impulsive observer. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed variable gain impulsive observers are presented. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed impulsive observation strategy.},

By affecting the dynamics of their interaction radius, emotions play a role in cooperation. Specifically, adjusting the interaction radius based on emotions effectively enhances cooperation by enabling individuals to secure survival opportunities through distinct evolutionary pathways. The study also explores the influence of unit emotional value size and unit game initiation cost on cooperation evolution, shedding light on their effects. Furthermore, the research examines the non-linear relationship between the maximum interaction radius and cooperation.

It will be seen that the presented optimal controller will have hybrid decision variables such as continuous and discrete variables. Meanwhile, the related cost function is in contrast to the traditionally linear quadratic functions. The conditions for the existence of the developed controller are established via using rigorous theory analysis, and its detailed computation method is presented too. It can be concluded that traditionally mode-dependent and -independent controllers about MJSs are contained as two special situations.

  abstract     = {A unified approach is developed to solve functional equations defining generating functions. Such equations are often constructed as a means to solve recurrence relations, such as those arising from queue length probabilities and response time probability distributions in Markov models. Many such equations have been obtained over several decades. Some have been solved analytically, some numerically and for some no tractable solution has been found. Our unified approach is able to provide accurate numerical solutions to such equations, even when they include derivatives of the generating function. It solves the JSQ model with two queues for the first time, utilizing a novel “partial” generating function related to the one the functional equation defines. Numerical results, displayed in tables of moments and graphs of probability density functions, show good accuracy against simulations with 500 000 regenerative cycles.},

Electric vehicles are utilized for load frequency control, and a multi-area power system model is established while considering parameter uncertainty. To minimize network data transmission, a memory-based adaptive hybrid event-triggered mechanism is designed, utilizing historical data to construct a threshold function. In addition, both the system states as well as the faults are estimated using a sliding mode observer. The proposed fault-tolerant load frequency control scheme uses observers to mitigate the impact of sensor failures. By applying Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are derived for the stability of the multi-area power system. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or protein regions (IDRs) do not have a stable three-dimensional structure, even though they exhibit important biological functions. They are structurally and functionally very different from ordered proteins and can cause many critical diseases. Accurate identification of disordered proteins/regions significantly impacts fields such as drug design, protein engineering, protein design, and related research. However, experimental identification of IDRs is complex and time-consuming, necessitating the development of an accurate and efficient computational method. The recent development of deep learning methods for protein language models shows the ability to learn evolutionary information from billions of protein sequences. This motivates us to develop a computational method, named DisPredict3.0, to predict proteins’ disordered regions (IDRs) using evolutionary information from a protein language model. Compared to the state-of-the-art method in the CAID (2018) assessment, DisPredict3.0 has an improvement of 2.51 %, 16.13 %, 17.98 %, and 11.94 % in terms of AUC, F1-score, MCC, and kappa, respectively. In addition, in the CAID-2 assessment (2022), DisPredict3.0 shows promising results and is ranked first for disorder residue prediction on the Disorder-NOX dataset.

In particular, we study how this extended dynamics alters the evolution of cooperation when individual reputation is directly linked to collected payoff, hence providing a general fitness function. For a broadly valid conclusion, our spatial populations cover different types of interaction topologies, including lattices, small-world and scale-free graphs. By means of intensive simulations we can detect substantial increase in cooperation level that shows a reasonable stability in the presence of a notable strategy mutation.},

The interplay spreading processes present significant challenges in studying the mechanisms of epidemic infectious diseases and the prevention and control of public health emergencies. Therefore, this paper incorporates the impact of government encouragement of multiple doses of vaccination on the evolutionary process of epidemic propagation, and investigates the interplay between the epidemic spreading and the diffusion of awareness in multiplex networks. The microscopic Markov chain approach is utilized to derive evolutionary equations for various states and capture an epidemic spread threshold, they are consistent with simulation results. Numerical results indicate that intensifying vaccination efforts and enhancing vaccine efficacy can effectively mitigate the magnitude of epidemic spreading and delay the disease outbreak threshold. It is worth noting that receiving multiple vaccine doses significantly reduces the magnitude of epidemic spreading compared to receiving a single dose. Therefore, increasing vaccine coverage, enhancing vaccine efficacy, and administering multiple vaccine doses can effectively mitigate the spread of epidemics in real-world scenarios.},

In particular, we deduce a very simple formula to compute the error in terms of some neighboring knots and a few coefficients of the considered spline. Furthermore, we show precisely how this error is related to the jump of a derivative of the spline at the knot. We then use the developed theory to propose efficient and very low-cost local error indicators and adaptive coarsening algorithms.

  abstract     = {A k -limited packing partition ( k LP partition) of a graph G is a partition of V ( G ) V(G) into k -limited packing sets. We consider the k LP partitions with minimum cardinality (with emphasis on k = 2 k=2 ). The minimum cardinality is called k LP partition number of G and denoted by χ × k ( G ) χ×k(G) . This problem is the dual problem of k -tuple domatic partitioning as well as a generalization of the well-studied 2-distance coloring problem in graphs. We give the exact value of χ × 2 χ×2 for trees and bound it for general graphs. A section of this paper is devoted to the dual of this problem, where we give a solution to an open problem posed in 1998. We also revisit the total limited packing number in this paper and prove that the problem of computing this parameter is NP-hard even for some special families of graphs. We give some inequalities concerning this parameter and discuss the difference between 2TLP number and 2LP number with emphasis on trees.},

  abstract     = {The signed double Roman domination problem is a combinatorial optimization problem on a graph asking to assign a label from { ± 1 , 2 , 3 } to each vertex feasibly, such that the total sum of assigned labels is minimized. Here feasibility is given whenever (i) vertices labeled ±1 have at least one neighbor with label in { 2 , 3 } ; (ii) each vertex labeled −1 has one 3-labeled neighbor or at least two 2-labeled neighbors; and (iii) the sum of labels over the closed neighborhood of any vertex is positive. The cumulative weight of an optimal labeling is called signed double Roman domination number (SDRDN). In this work, we first consider the problem on general cubic graphs of order n for which we present a sharp n / 2 + Θ ( 1 ) lower bound for the SDRDN by means of the discharging method. Moreover, we derive a new best upper bound. Observing that we are often able to minimize the SDRDN over the class of cubic graphs of a fixed order, we then study in this context generalized Petersen graphs for independent interest, for which we propose a constraint programming guided proof. We then use these insights to determine the SDRDNs of subcubic 2 × m grid graphs, among other results.},

  abstract     = {Computations of risk measures in the context of the dividend valuation model is a crucial aspect to deal with when investors decide to buy a share of common stock. This is achieved by using a Markov chain model of growth-dividend evolution, imposing an assumption that controls the growth of the dividend process and in turn allows for the computation of the moments of the price process and the fulfillment of a set of transversality conditions which allows avoiding the presence of speculative bubbles in the market. The probability distribution of the fundamental value of the stock is recovered by solving a moment problem, based on the solution of a maximum-entropy approach from which it is possible to compute classical risk measures based on these fundamental variables. The methodology is applied to real dividend data from the S&amp;P 500 index. Results show that our model provides complete information about the fundamental price not limited to its expectation.},

To accomplish this, we will consider certain conditions on the main equation.

Firstly, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of a local solution for a more general class of AVIEs (including the proposed equation in this paper) under certain hypotheses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the conditions under which this local solution blows up at a finite time. In other words, the solution becomes unbounded at that time. Furthermore, we establish that this blow-up solution can be extended to an arbitrary interval on the non-negative real line, thus referred to as a global solution. These results are also discussed for a special case of generalized AVIEs in which the kernel functions are taken as positive constants.},

  abstract     = {WENO scheme is popular for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. However for the traditional WENO schemes, they often increase the order of accuracy by enlarging the stencil, thus lack the compactness and do not obtain the highest resolution and efficiency. In order to overcome this problem, we consider to improve the traditional WENO scheme by using subcell strategy, which basic idea is that: first, in order to obtain higher resolution, each control volume is divided into some subcells further; second, in order to save the computational cost, the WENO reconstruction is still implemented on the control volume; finally, in order to keep the compactness, the whole subcells in control volume and whole or part of subcells in neighbor ones are used to construct the final WENO reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, the corresponding research is still limited. In this paper, we first propose the framework of WENO scheme with subcell strategy, in which various WENO techniques can be used for the spatial reconstruction in theory; then two traditional WENO schemes, i.e., XWENO (X=DK and AO), are selected for the improvement. The resulted XWENO-SC (X=DK and AO) schemes not only inherit the high order of accuracy and ENO property of original WENO schemes, but also show their significant advantages in the compactness, resolution and efficiency.},

The use of non-convex regularizers, such as those defined by trained neural networks, has been shown to be effective in many cases. However, finding global minimizers in non-convex situations can be challenging, making existing theory inapplicable. A recent development in regularization theory relaxes this requirement by providing convergence based on critical points instead of strict minimizers. This paper investigates convergence rates for the regularization with critical points using Bregman distances. Furthermore, we show that when implementing near-minimization through an iterative algorithm, a finite number of iterations is sufficient without affecting convergence rates.},

Then based on some a priori bounds of the discrete solution, the superclose estimate in energy norm is obtained unconditionally, and the global superconvergence result is deduced with the help of the interpolated postprocessing technique. Moreover, a two-grid method (TGM) is presented, which can maintain the superconvergence result and save about half of the computing cost. Finally, numerical results are provided to show that the proposed two-grid nonconforming FEMs have a good performance.

  abstract     = {The trust game, derived from an economics experiment, has recently attracted interest in the field of evolutionary dynamics. In a recent version of the evolutionary trust game, players adopt one of three strategies: investor, trustworthy trustee, or untrustworthy trustee. Trustworthy trustees enhance and share the investment with the investor, whereas untrustworthy trustees retain the full amount, betraying the investor. Following this setup, we investigate a two-player trust game, which is analytically feasible under weak selection. We explore the evolution of trust in structured populations, factoring in four strategy updating rules: pairwise comparison (PC), birth-death (BD), imitation (IM), and death-birth (DB). Comparing structured populations with well-mixed populations, we arrive at two main conclusions. First, in the absence of untrustworthy trustees, there is a saddle point between investors and trustworthy trustees, with collaboration thriving best in well-mixed populations. The collaboration diminishes sequentially from DB to IM to PC/BD updating rules in structured populations. Second, an invasion of untrustworthy trustees makes this saddle point unstable and leads to the extinction of investors. The 3-strategy system stabilizes at an equilibrium line where the trustworthy and untrustworthy trustees coexist. The stability span of trustworthy trustees is maximally extended under the PC and BD updating rules in structured populations, while it decreases in a sequence from IM to DB updating rules, with the well-mixed population being the least favorable. This research thus adds an analytical lens to the evolution of trust in structured populations.},

To reinforce the perturbation rejection ability, perturbation estimators with nonlinear dynamics are established by employing a filtering operation, which can result in asymptotic convergence of estimation errors. Besides, by devising funnel variables with an exponential decaying function, a funnel control strategy is constructed to ensure tracking errors restricting into a prescribed region under the influence of persistent perturbations. Moreover, the tracking errors of the Euler-Lagrange system are concluded to be asymptotic stability with prescribed performance via Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness of the developed control technology.},

By investigating the replicator dynamics of the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma game with these negotiable strategies in infinite populations , cooperators and defectors may coexist stably only in a bilaterally-negotiating Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma game that includes all negotiable strategies. Moreover, we define the defection temptation as individuals&#39; willingness to gamble for higher payoffs in a game and show that bilateral negotiation can diminish the defection temptation. Importantly, the bilaterally-negotiating Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma game&#39;s defection temptation being positive is the necessary and sufficient condition for stable coexistence, implying that bilateral negotiation can help cooperators coexist with defectors even when defection is tempting in the current game. In the stable coexistence equilibrium, the frequency of negotiable cooperators increases with their relative negotiation ability.},

In addition, we have shown that the derivatives of the approximation solution converge to the corresponding derivatives of the exact solution with the same convergence rates as we attained for approximate solutions . Finally, numerical examples lend credibility to the presented theoretical framework.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose first- and second-order exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) schemes for solving the phase field crystal equation with the periodic boundary condition. Specifically, the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) in this work is constructed based on an exponential function, which differs from the square root form commonly used in the traditional SAV method. This feature allows the proposed schemes that only need to solve one linear system with constant coefficients at each time step. To construct the first-order ESAV scheme, we utilize the backward Euler method . Combining the ESAV method with the leapfrog approach, the second-order ESAV scheme is developed. Theoretically, the proposed schemes are proven to be uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable. Furthermore, the error estimates of the second-order ESAV scheme is rigorously proved. The numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Disorders in the heart&#39;s conduction system can lead to the formation of rotating spiral waves, and terminating the re-entrant seeds is crucial to restore cardiac function. Myocyte action potential (AP) morphology is spatially dependent within the myocardium, forming an intrinsic gradient. This study investigates the impact of gradients in AP morphology on the behavior of spiral seeds and their traveling wavefronts, explicitly focusing on spatial variations in action potential duration (APD) and resting level. By employing a memristive FitzHugh-Nagumo grid, a gradient of Gaussian distribution is introduced in distinct parametric planes capable of altering AP morphology. The steepness of the AP gradient is controlled via the variance of the Gaussian formulation. It is found that when APD is shortened along a gradient, the spiral tip tends to drift towards more excitable regions. In contrast, when the APD is prolonged, the spiral seed is stationary, and the wavelength of the spiral wave increases. The gradient in the resting levels induces instability, possibly eliminating the spiral seed and leading to disturbed patterns. The distribution variance is not a determining factor in the scenarios seen in the APD gradient. However, changing the variance in the resting levels gradient tends to affect the wave pattern&#39;s homogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a new class of memory-one strategies, zero-determinant (ZD), has been proposed in the context of repeated Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma game. A player using a ZD strategy can unilaterally enforce a linear relation between the two players’ payoffs. In this paper, we study ZD strategies in arbitrary 2 × 2 asymmetric games. We show that the existence of three typical subclasses of ZD strategies, equalizer, extortionate, and generous strategies, depends crucially on the payoff structure of the games. More interestingly, we find that extortionate and generous strategies can be expressed in a unified form of ZD strategies, so-called “multiplicative” ZD strategies, where this type of strategy can establish a multiplicative relation between the net payoffs of two players. Then, we identify the range of multiplicative factors when two players have different payoff functions or identities and discuss how this type of strategy implies extortion or generosity in different asymmetric games. Finally, we apply the above results to some specific asymmetric games, including the asymmetric PD game, the ultimatum game, the trust game as well as the generalized asymmetric social dilemma games, and analyze the effects of ZD strategies on cooperation and payoff control in these games.},

Additionally, the above concept is extended to a system of differential equations with respect to the distorted Lebesgue measure which gives rise to the study of a matrix m -exponential function.

First, an attack compensator is built for each agent in order to obtain the system output when the DoS attacks appear. Then, a fuzzy estimator is developed to estimate the unknown states based on the attack compensator. Second, a prescribed performance control (PPC) approach is utilized to ensure the bipartite containment error within a preassigned boundary, and the restriction related to the initial condition is removed. Finally, a set of switching laws is designed by combining the average dwell time method with the limited conditions of DoS attacks. Under this framework, an appealing feature of the designed controller is that the output signals of followers converge to a convex hull formed by leaders and all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy.},

In the measurement channel, the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and deception attack are cogitated simultaneously. Meanwhile, the impact generated by the deficiency of plant mode information due to cyber-attacks is described via the partial unknown mode transition probability and the asynchronization between the plant and the controller. On these bases, a detected-mode-dependent asynchronous dynamic controller with a certain capacity to resist malevolent cyber-attacks is proposed. Then, to guarantee the stochastic stability and reach the designated H ∞ H∞ performance for MJCPSs under hybrid cyber-attacks, sufficient conditions are given by means of some decoupling technologies. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented control tactic is demonstrated, which is supported by an application on a linearized F-404 engine system.},

Simulation results show that the strategy of self-isolation can substantially inhibit the spread of infectious diseases on complex social networks, and introducing rewarding mechanism would further enhance this effect. Moreover, counterintuitively, larger network degree is conducive to the prevalence of self-isolation, thereby hindering virus spreading.

In order to gain improved comprehension and refine the cooperative evolution process, we suggest a pioneering deep cooperation strategy. The strategy of deep cooperation is grounded on the conventional Prisoner&#39;s dilemma model. It highlights that individuals incur additional costs in the game to attain more benefits while also maximizing mutual social advantages. By doing so, individuals and the collective attain a win-win situation. After research, we find that the system has the following five evolutionary results: only deep cooperation strategy, pure defection strategy, deep cooperation strategy and cooperation strategy coexistence, deep cooperation strategy and defection strategy retained, and three strategies exist simultaneously. The simulation validates that the expensive deep cooperation strategy can enhance the system&#39;s resilience to defection, prompt cooperation strategy in the populace to transition their approach to garner a greater payoff, and foster a favorable atmosphere for cooperation strategy. It provides a new perspective for understanding cooperation.},

  abstract     = {Koopman operator with numerical approximation method for modelling nonlinear systems has become a popular data-driven approach in the past five years. However, when the system contains time-varying parameters, the data-driven Koopman operator-based model produces deviations between the nominal model and the true one. It affects the control performance when it serves as the nominal model in Model Predictive Control (MPC). To solve this issue, the Koopman operator-based model learned by using a multi-step prediction autoencoder and the strategy of online updating model are proposed. In the first step, a neural network with encoder-decoder structure is trained to search for the optimal lifted functions of the corresponding nonlinear system with fixed parameters. In the second step, an online updating strategy is presented to update the Koopman operator-based model using the collected data, when the nominal model is applied in the closed loop operation of MPC. In order to reduce the additional time consumption on updating the nominal model, the matrix inversion lemma is applied and it leads the strategy of updating to be presented in a recursive form . In general, this paper proposed an iterative MPC algorithm for online updating the Koopman operator-based model in a recursive form based on the optimal lifted function using autoencoder. Numerical simulations on three nonlinear cases with time-varying parameters show good performances on tracking control using the proposed Koopman operator-based model using autoencoder and online updating strategy.},

First we discretize this equation by using a second-order weighted and shifted Grünward difference operator and obtain a system of semilinear differential equations with linear and nonlinear parts . Afterwards, we employ a Strang splitting method to solve this semi-discretization scheme. To further reduce computational time, we propose a two-level Strang splitting method from the linear part. This method significantly reduces computational complexity to O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) by implementing the fast Fourier transform . Importantly, our proposed method ensures the unconditional preservation of mass conservation and achieves second-order convergence.

  abstract     = {The maintenance of biological diversity has perpetually remained a central focus in the field of ecology. In the pursuit of enhanced survival rates, species have begun to explore cooperation with one another. However, the consequences of such collaboration remain largely unexplored. To delve into this matter, we introduce intraspecific cooperation within the framework of the classic rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game. In this model, the competition rate is intricately tied to interactions among individuals of the same species. A greater population of individuals from the same species tends to lead to an increased predation rate and a decreased prey rate. Through extensive simulations, we observe that (i) in the case of homogeneous intraspecific cooperation (all three species have intraspecific cooperation), increased cooperation between predators tends to increase the likelihood of species coexistence. In contrast, high levels of cooperation between prey appeared to decrease the favorability of species coexistence. Measurements of the characteristic length of spiral structures revealed that the characteristic length of spirals became longer when the intensity of prey cooperation increased. (ii) In the case of heterogeneous intraspecific cooperation (two species or only one species with intraspecific cooperation), neither an increase in the intensity of intraspecific cooperation of the predator nor an increase in the intensity of intraspecific cooperation of the prey is favorable for species coexistence. Our work underscores the critical role of intraspecific cooperation in maintaining biodiversity.},

A mathematical model is established using the Roesser model, and asynchrony is accounted for using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The modes jumping between the target system and the designed filter are determined by the given conditional probability matrix. Sufficient conditions are derived using suitable Lyapunov function and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure stable filtering performance. The practical applicability of the approach is illustrated by two examples.

First, a nonlinear observer is constructed using triggered output information to compensate for faults and mismatched disturbances. An integrated event-observer-based secure control scheme is then proposed to implement multiple triggering to resist DoS attacks on both measurement and control channels by designing multiple event-triggering mechanisms. Meanwhile, it bypasses the non-differentiability of the virtual controllers arising from the discontinuity in output-triggering. Moreover, we perform nonlinear scaling of tracking error to realize the desired transient performance of tracking with a prescribed accuracy within a finite time interval.

The first one is utilized to channel the unknown disturbance to a stable system so that the second can observe the unknown disturbance.

These colorings need not to be necessarily proper, and as coloring of all vertices with only one color is both open and closed, a natural goal is to maximize the total number of colors used for these colorings. We discuss some properties of the corresponding chromatic numbers and conditions for the existence of a proper (open and closed) interval vertex colorings. In the case of open interval coloring we show that only bipartite graphs admit a proper open interval vertex coloring. We also describe a technique for obtaining a closed interval vertex coloring of a tree with the maximum possible number of colors, where the resulting coloring is in fact proper.

And those two edge connectivity parameters can measure edge fault tolerance more than the traditional definition. The edge matroidal connectivity is based on the associated edge partition and the other is a generalization called conditional edge matroidal connectivity.

Firstly, to deal with the uncertainty problem of the manipulator model, we consider using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) to approximate, and on this basis, we add immune algorithms to optimize the RBFNN parameters to improve the approximation ability. Secondly, to compensate for the unknown backlash-like hysteresis error and RBFNN approximation error, an adaptive reaching law is designed to improve the control accuracy and reduce chattering to a certain extent.

  abstract     = {The solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations may contain discontinuous derivatives, which brings numerical difficulties in capturing sharply these derivatives. This paper presents a third-order weighted compact nonlinear scheme (WCNS) and a third-order perturbed WCNS (WCNS-P) for solving HJ equations. A linear combination of hybrid cell-edge and cell-node values of the function is applied to approximate the spatial derivatives of the function. For the WCNS, the upwind-biased nonlinear weighted interpolation is used for the unknown cell-edge values, while for the WCNS-P perturbations with a free parameter is introduced to the upwind-biased linear interpolation . The free parameter can be optimized to reduce numerical errors in smooth regions. To enhance the numerical stability , a monotone polynomial interpolation method is designed to switch the WCNS-P to the WCNS. Several numerical experiments are performed to test the order of accuracy and the discontinuity-capturing ability of the two schemes.},

  abstract     = {Research on public goods game has traditionally focused on studying the effects of punishment and reward in experimental settings, commonly known as standard games. However, these standard games often examine isolated interactions among individuals, leading to varying results based on factors such as the population studied, number of participants, and geographical context. Consequently, the understanding of cooperation evolution remains imprecise. To address this limitation, we are trying to generalize these experimental studies, we employ an agent-based model in this study to simulate interactions in public goods game and explore the influence of punishment and reward on the evolution of cooperation. Unlike standard games, evolutionary games offer a more comprehensive framework to capture and analyze a broader range of strategic interactions and behaviors. In our approach, we introduce two methods for applying punishment or reward: Individual Punishment or Reward and Collective Punishment or Reward. Under the first method, actors can individually reward or punish each other based on their contributions or free-riding behavior towards the collective good. In the second method, decisions for punishment or reward are made collectively after achieving a consensus or agreement among the members of the group. We provide a model for comparing Individual Decision Rule and Collective Decision Rule under punishment and reward, to study their effects on the evolution of contributions. Consistent with recent experimental findings, our results indicate that these mechanisms lead to a significant increase in contributions compared to the outcomes observed in standard public goods game. Additionally, we demonstrate the significant role of rewards in promoting contribution within public goods game.},

Time-scaling functions with preset parameters T 1 T1 and T 2 T2 respectively take effect in the observer and the controller, and by computing the output regulation matrix which turns the output errors of followers tracking the heterogeneous leader into their state errors, the model-mismatched agents could reach bipartite output tracking consensus within a total duration of T 1 + T 2 T1+T2 . Moreover, neural networks are deployed to estimate and eliminate the unknown disturbances. Thorough Lyapunov-based derivations approve the preset-time convergence and robustness for the controller.

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problem of trajectory tracking control for mobile robot nonlinear systems with non-repetitive uncertain parameters, we propose a novel neural network compensator-based robust iterative learning control (NNRILC) scheme to achieve excellent tracking performance and uncertainty compensation. The NNRILC scheme consists of a parallel structure that includes a robust iterative learning control (RILC) term and a neural network (NN) compensator. The RILC term is used to ensure robust control performance and promise closed-loop stability. The compensator based on the neural network is employed to handle the uncertainties resulted from the nonlinear dynamics as well as the suppressed disturbances in the mobile robot nonlinear systems. Additionally, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm is employed to solve the state differential equation of the mobile robot. Consequently, The H ∞ H∞ robust technique is used to construct an iterative learning control update rule to reduce the impact of disturbances. Meanwhile, the RILC scheme is designed to optimize the neural network initial parameters and weights of the NN compensator at each trial. Then the convergence of the proposed NNRILC scheme is analyzed, and the results are incorporated into the control update for the next process trial. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by mobile robot simulation.},

The tumor cells are categorized as sensitive, resistant, or infected by oncolytic viruses. We show that if resistant tumor cells cannot be transformed into sensitive cells, every tumor cell will eventually acquire resistance. The model can possess at most one positive equilibrium, and we determine the critical delay magnitude beyond which the equilibrium becomes unstable. Our numerical simulations indicate that delays in the viral cycle can result in an increase in the total tumor burden. However, in terms of the overall tumor load, resistance may not be detrimental to the host if the delay in the viral cycle is substantial.},

  abstract     = {Most individuals opt for vaccination to acquire immunity protection and prevent disease transmission. However, individuals cannot obtain perfect immunity protection after vaccination, due to various factors such as the limitation of vaccine itself, storage and transportation. Failed vaccination experiences can alter individuals&#39; perception of vaccination behavior. To analyze the influence of vaccine efficacy on vaccination behavior with adaptive perception, we propose a novel vaccination game model. The results demonstrate that for the moderate vaccination cost, the introduction of adaptive perception can promote vaccination behavior, and the promoting effect becomes more pronounced in the population with smaller perception fluctuation. Nonetheless, vaccination behavior is still constrained by a significant number of free-riders when vaccine effectiveness is high. Analyzing the distribution of strategies among individuals with different degrees, it is revealed that the reduction in vaccinated individuals influenced by free-riders predominantly occurs in individuals with low-degree. Furthermore, we examine the coupled effects of vaccination cost and vaccine efficacy on vaccination behavior, considering various levels of perception fluctuations. The results indicate the crucial role of vaccination cost in enhancing vaccination behavior, and previous findings also are consistent across scenarios with diverse vaccination cost. Our work contributes to an improved comprehension of vaccination behavior considering vaccine efficacy and perception.},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary game theory , the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior in a population often face challenges posed by the temptation of free-riding behavior, which offers high individual payoff. Recently, apart from a range of mechanisms that promote the formation of cooperation, individual learning abilities under limited information have emerged as a key factor in adjusting agents&#39; strategies. This paper introduces q-learning and particle swarm optimization into the realm of evolutionary dynamics. The primary focus is on investigating the impact of Exploration-based Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) and Q-learning-based Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) on the evolution of cooperation in a continuous version of the spatial public goods game (SPGG) with punishment. EPSO defines a rule for updating agents&#39; strategies based on individual and limited population information. It also integrates an exploration mechanism to increase the diversity and directionality of the strategies. Additionally, QPSO serves to adaptively optimize the parameters of EPSO, addressing the issue of parameter control limiting the EPSO&#39;s performance. Leveraging experiential learning and iterative adjustment, QPSO progressively refines system parameters, thus rationally assimilating knowledge and updating individual strategies to attain optimal payoff. Through extensive simulation studies, it has been observed that employing QPSO&#39;s adaptively optimized parameters in EPSO significantly promotes the cooperative evolution in the SPGG with punishment. Furthermore, individual learning coefficients, when too low or too high, both facilitate the occurrence of cooperation. Simultaneously, higher inertia weight coefficients strengthen the system&#39;s cooperation level, while lower punishment intensity coefficients and higher gain intensity coefficients effectively promote the cooperation emergence and exert a significant influence on the overall cooperation level of the system. This research provides a new perspective for designing real-world schemes that encourage cooperation and offers insights into the intricate dynamics of cooperation in complex systems.},

Fuzzy logic systems (FLS) are used to model unknown nonlinear dynamics and the FDI attacks are represented by the sum of the system states and unknown time-varying bounded functions . To deal with the problem of the system states are unavailable under FDI attacks, a new coordinate transformation is proposed for control design. By using the backstepping control design theory and Nussbaum function property, a fuzzy adaptive resilient decentralized control scheme is developed, where the Nussbaum functions are employed to deal with the unknown time-varying weight. Then, the stability of the controlled systems is proved by constructing a appropriate Lyapunov function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy adaptive resilient decentralized control scheme is verified by the simulation and comparison results.},

To model the intermittent nature of faults, two sequences of shifted gate functions are employed to depict the fault appearance and disappearance moments. Considering that DoS attacks can prevent transmission of signals, resulting in measurement data losses over the sensor to observer channel, switching-like observer and sliding mode fault-tolerant controller are presented to accommodate both situations with and without attacks. The designed sliding mode fault-tolerant controller can ensure the finite-time reachability of the sliding surface such that it can enter the quasi-sliding mode domain within finite time from any initial state. Moreover, based on the Lyapunov theory, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the finite-time boundedness of the closed-loop systems with intermittent faults and DoS attacks in both the reaching and sliding motion phases. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed sliding mode fault-tolerant control scheme is verified by a numerical example and a practical example.},

In order to obtain less conservative stability criteria, two novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) with delay-derivative-variation-dependent matrices are constructed. In one LKF, two delay-product terms are double utilized and more free matrices are incorporated. Additionally, a new type of the LKF with delay-derivative-variation-dependent matrices, namely, the neuronal-activation-function-based looped functional, is developed by accounting for the periodic nature of the delay function and the coupling information of the system state and the neural activation function. Then, several stability conditions of delayed neural networks are developed by combining some integral inequalities.

The conditions under which higher-order EDOs are strictly better than lower-order EDOs are derived analytically. Furthermore, the steady-state performance of the EDO-based SMC is analyzed, where it is shown that the improvement of the tracking accuracy of the EDO can reduce the sensitivity of the state variables and the control input with respect to the controller parameters. This implies that the SMC parameter tuning requirement can be reduced if a high tracking accuracy of the EDO is guaranteed.

The barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is introduced to guarantee that the output constraints are not violated. Then, a generalized relative threshold is proposed by utilizing the neighboring controller errors to alleviate the computation burden dramatically. It is further shown that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and that the consensus tracking errors asymptotically tend to zero.

  abstract     = {The rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game is a classic model for exploring the performance of how multiple strategies interact and evolve over time. The classic RPS game assumes a fixed benefit and cost for each strategy against another one when two players meet, while its evolutionary game considers the frequency dynamics of the three strategies with each&#39;s fitness influenced by its net payoff. This may not reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios as strategies can co-adapt with each other. We introduce an adaptive RPS game that captures the dynamics of strategy densities with trait-mediated payoffs, and the adaptive dynamics of coevolving traits via incremental mutations leading to adaptively evolving payoffs. Results show that the adaptive RPS game approaches a steady state of strategy density, if any, faster than the evolutionary RPS game. The stable coexistence of all strategies in the evolutionary game can be easily destabilized in the adaptive game. Strategies that are allowed to adaptively change their traits also performed better and achieved greater strategy densities than those fixed strategies in the adaptive game. The coevolving strategies in the adaptive RPS game exhibit complex and diverse attractors in the trait space, sensitive to both initial conditions and model parameters, but exhibiting positive payoffs with greater benefits than costs. These findings highlight how adaptive games enhance strategy performance by sacrificing eco-evolutionary dynamic stability.},

Prior to the onset of the infection and to prevent the spread of this disease, a proportion of individuals was vaccinated. But the administered vaccine is imperfect and can fail, which implies that some vaccinated individuals get the infection when being in contact with infectious individuals. We study the evolution of the epidemic process over time in terms of a continuous-time Markov chain, which represents a general SIR model with an additional compartment for vaccinated individuals. In our stochastic framework, we study two bi-dimensional variables recording infection events, produced by a single infectious individual or by the whole infected group, taking into account if the newly infected individual was previously vaccinated or not. Theoretical schemes and recursive algorithms are derived in order to compute joint probability mass functions and factorial moments for these random variables. We illustrate the applicability of our techniques by means of a set of numerical experiments.},

For the parabolic contribution, we adopt a second-order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev scheme, while we use a two-stage Taylor discretization combined with a path-conservative strategy, to deal with the purely hyperbolic contribution. The proposed strategy allows to decouple hyperbolic from parabolic-reaction stiff contributions resulting in an overall well-balanced scheme subject just to stability restrictions of the hyperbolic term. The spatial discretization we adopt is based on a standard finite element method , associated with a hierarchically refined Cartesian grid. After providing numerical evidence of the well-balancing property, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to select time steps larger than the ones adopted by a classical Taylor-Galerkin scheme. Finally, we provide some meaningful scaling results on ideal and realistic scenarios.},

When a thermal property of the material is unknown, we can add a boundary condition to formulate an Inverse Stefan Problem, and determine this property. In this paper we study a heat conduction phase-change problem with Robin and Neumann boundary condition at a fixed face. This overspecified condition allows to simultaneously determine two unknown thermal coefficients through a moving boundary problem or a free boundary problem. Formulae for different cases where obtained by Ceretani and Tarzia (2015) [6] . The formulation with these type of boundary conditions is a more realistic one than the heat conduction phase-change problems with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition at the fixed face, considered by Tarzia, (1982-1983). Therefore we propose to study the relationship between the problems with Robin-Neumann conditions, and the problems with Dirichlet-Neumann conditions. The main result of this work is the convergence analysis of these problems, when the heat transfer coefficient h of the Robin condition is very large. We present for each case of the free and moving boundary problems, an upper bound for the error of the two unknown parameters, obtaining in every case a bound of order o ( 1 h ) o(1h) . Finally we show a numerical example of the convergence, for a phase change material commonly used in heating or cooling processes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose the frozen form of nonstationary iterated Tikhonov regularization to solve the inverse problems and study its convergence analysis in the Banach space setting, where the iterates of proposed method are defined through minimization problems . These minimization problems involve uniformly convex penalty terms that may be non-smooth, which can be utilized in the reconstruction of several notable features (e.g., discontinuities and sparsity) of the sought solutions. We terminate our method through a discrepancy principle and show its regularizing nature. Moreover, we show the convergence of the iterates of the method with respect to Bregman distance as well as their strong convergence. In order to show the applicability of the proposed method, we show that it is applicable on two ill-posed inverse problems. Finally, by assuming that a stability estimate holds within a certain set, we derive the convergence rates of our method.},

Investigating the dual behavior of these particles, which are called swarmalators, has recently attracted the attention of many researchers. However, more needs to be done to analyze the dynamics of swarmalators separately. This paper explores the dynamics of the swarmalators&#39; movements individually over time in two-dimensional plane. This study&#39;s findings represent that based on the two rules of high sensitivity to the initial conditions and the positive largest Lyapunov exponent, the swarmalators’ movements in the dynamic states have a chaotic nature. This result can lead to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of natural swarmalators. It may provide an opportunity for other researchers to analyze the individual behavior of swarmalators along with their collective behavior.},

By implementing a sophisticated two-layer partial mapping network model (UAU-SIRS), we investigate the dynamic relationship between information flow and disease transmission. Our approach utilizes extensive multiplexed network data, processed through a micro Markov chain ( MMC ) model, to simulate the interplay between information spread and disease dynamics. The findings reveal a noteworthy positive correlation between the rates of information dissemination, recovery in the network, and the epidemic threshold. Conversely, the conversion rate is inversely related to this threshold. A critical observation is that Scale-free ( SF ) networks, characterized by their uneven node distribution , are more susceptible to the impacts of information spread on their outbreak thresholds compared to Erdős-Rényi ( ER ) networks. This research offers crucial insights for epidemic prevention strategies and provides valuable guidance for managing the dissemination of disease-related information within complex network structures.},

A kind of dynamic event-triggered (ETM) based strategy is adopted to maximize the savings of network bandwidth resources. And the hybrid cyber-attacks including two common attacks, the spoofing attack and the denial of service (DoS) attack are considered, which are assumed to be mutually independent and meet Bernoulli distribution . The singular MJSs under cyber-attacks are converted into the singular Markov jump time-delay systems. Then, the criteria of stochastically stable for the closed-loop singular MJSs meeting the mixed H ∞ H∞ and passive performance are obtained by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). And by optimizing the obtained LMIs, the gains of asynchronous resilient controller are further derived, and the weighting matrices of dynamic event-triggered based strategy are also gained. Eventually, the feasibility of the offered way is verified by an industrial example of DC motor control system .},

The method is based on a Lamperti transform, splitting and applying a tamed numerical method for the nonlinearity. The main difficulty in the analysis is caused by the non-globally Lipschitz drift coefficients of the model. We consider the existence, uniqueness of the solution and boundedness of moments for the transformed SDE before proving bounded moments and inverse moment bounds for the numerical approximation. The exponential tamed method is a hybrid method in the sense that a backstop method is invoked to prevent solutions from overshooting zero and becoming negative. We successfully recover the strong convergence rate of order one for the exponential tamed method. In addition we prove that the probability of ever needing the backstop method to prevent a negative value can be made arbitrarily small. In our numerical experiments we compare to other numerical methods in the literature for realistic parameter values.},

Numerical Gaussian processes are very good at fitting latent solution of PDEs, when all observation data is noisy and discontinuous. And the methodology can clearly quantify the uncertainty of the predicted solution. For complex boundaries controlled by ODEs, we consider mixed boundary conditions of delay PDEs in this paper.

The WG method has been demonstrated to be accurate and efficient, providing optimal order error estimates in discrete H 2 H2 and standard L 2 L2 norms. A series of extensive numerical tests are conducted to validate the WG solutions, showcasing the flexibility, stability, and robustness of the proposed method for handling both smooth and complicated interfaces.},

  abstract     = {In the United States the laws regulating the carrying of firearms in public vary state-to-state. In a highly publicized event, the Governor of New Mexico recently issued an emergency order temporarily banning the carrying of firearms in some areas – and thus rescinding the right-to-carry law in New Mexico – after a spate of gun violence, citing a statistical threshold of general societal violence under which right-to-carry laws should be superseded. In this paper we frame this policy intervention as a dynamical systems model that measures the incidence of gun violence as a function of gun prevalence. We show that the Governor&#39;s emergency order – fittingly issued as an emergency health order – is effectively like trying to stop an epidemic after it has become viral in that with this kind of instantaneous stopping condition, under simple assumptions, such a regulation is too little, too late. On the other hand, a graduated response that scales with increasing violence can drive equilibrium gun prevalence to zero. This is a new mathematical model relating gun violence with gun prevalence which we hope continues to spur the modeling community to bring its tools and techniques to bear on this important and challenging social problem. More importantly, our model, despite its simplicity, exhibits complex dynamics and has substantial research and educational value in promoting the application of mathematics in the social sciences, extending beyond gun control issues.},

An edge-coloring of G is normal if every edge of G is either rich or poor. In this paper we consider snarks G ˜ obtained by a simple superposition of edges and vertices of a cycle C in a snark G . For an even cycle C we show that a normal coloring of G can be extended to a normal coloring of G ˜ without changing colors of edges outside C in G . An interesting remark is that this is in general impossible for odd cycles, since the normal coloring of a Petersen graph P 10 cannot be extended to a superposition of P 10 on a 5-cycle without changing colors outside the 5-cycle. On the other hand, as our colorings of the superpositioned snarks introduce 18 or more poor edges, we are inclined to believe that every bridgeless cubic graph distinct from P 10 has a normal coloring with at least one poor edge and possibly with at least 6 if we also exclude the Petersen graph with one vertex being truncated.},

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental challenges insurance companies face is forecasting a fair premium that covers the cost of claims while maintaining profitability. To comprehend the risk of insurance claims, one needs to construct a collective risk model. In this study, we aim to propose a new collective risk model, namely a dependent compound Poisson–Lindley process. We capture the dependence structure between the claim frequency and severity using a bivariate Sarmanov distribution. We then employ this model to perform premium-based risk measure forecasting such that the insurance company can obtain the premium value for the policyholder. We accomplish this task by proposing a specific risk spectrum to adjust the premium for risk-aversion-type insurance companies. Our main results demonstrate that a collective risk model based on the Poisson–Lindley process is able to capture the overdispersion phenomenon in claim frequency that is common in practice. This ability is confirmed by our simulation conducted using real insurance data. Furthermore, when accounting for the Sarmanov dependence structure, the resulting premium value becomes more appropriate.},

  abstract     = {The Fokker–Planck equation describes the evolution of the probability density associated with a stochastic differential equation . As the dimension of the system grows, solving this partial differential equation (PDE) using conventional numerical methods becomes computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a fast, scalable, and interpretable method for solving the Fokker–Planck equation which is applicable in higher dimensions . This method approximates the solution as a linear combination of shape-morphing Gaussians with time-dependent means and covariances. These parameters evolve according to the method of reduced-order nonlinear solutions (RONS) which ensures that the approximate solution stays close to the true solution of the PDE for all times. As such, the proposed method approximates the transient dynamics as well as the equilibrium density, when the latter exists. Our approximate solutions can be viewed as an evolution on a finite-dimensional statistical manifold embedded in the space of probability densities. We show that the metric tensor in RONS coincides with the Fisher information matrix on this manifold. We also discuss the interpretation of our method as a shallow neural network with Gaussian activation functions and time-varying parameters. In contrast to existing deep learning methods, our method is interpretable, requires no training, and automatically ensures that the approximate solution satisfies all properties of a probability density.},

On this basis, subsystem transformation technology is employed to decouple the jumping modes. Then, a model-free on-policy Q -learning algorithm is introduced in the zero-sum game architecture to obtain the optimal control gain by measured system data. However, the probing noise will produce biases in on-policy algorithm. Thus, an off-policy Q -learning algorithm is proposed to eliminate the effect of probing noise.

To reveal the coupled dynamics between information propagation on the cyberspace and evolutionary games in the physical world, we propose a double-layer dynamical graph model for adaptive cyber-physical systems. The reputation information aggregated from the cyber layer can be used for the decision-making in the physical layer, meanwhile the population evolution and competition in the physical layer will reorganise the information network in the cyber layer. Our results show that public and private information on the trustworthiness of others can play significantly different roles in the decision-making to cooperate or defect, leading to very different performance in the global prosperity of the population. Limited consideration for the available public information reduces the benefits of the reorganization of the information network in the cyber layer leading to the increasing of mutual defections. On the other way, when public information is prioritized, the reorganization of the cyber layer can facilitate cooperation. However, the optimal decision-making to maximize population prosperity strongly depends on the way the cyber layer is reorganized and on the opportune balance of public and private information. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay between information reliability and restructuring of the cyber layer for the resilience of cooperation and prosperity in cyber-physical systems.},

But from the perspective of defective strategy, individual holding defective strategy can also be seen as so-called loyalty to defective strategy. This paper presents a spatial prisoner&#39;s dilemma game model with the local loyalty of two-strategy, in which the loyalty to cooperative strategy and loyalty to defective strategy are considered simultaneously. To distinguish the loyalties of these two types of strategies, the loyalty value corresponding to defective strategy is represented as a negative number. A fitness of an individual is defined as weighted average of individual&#39;s payoff and power of average loyalty of local nearest neighbors. In strategy learning, if the loyalty of an individual and the loyalty of the target neighbor are different signs, a discount coefficient is added to the strategy transition probability function to reduce the probability. Numerical simulations show that considering individual loyalty to the two strategies can promote cooperative behavior in the system when the strength index of local loyalty in fitness function is positive, and there are optimal values for the weighting coefficient and the strength index of local loyalty, which can enable the system to reach full cooperators state. The discount coefficient to the fitness of neighbor can impact on the frequency of cooperators surviving and the proportion of surviving cooperators during phase transition.},

  abstract     = {Under appropriate technical assumptions, the simple-loop theory allows to derive various types of asymptotic expansions for the eigenvalues of Toeplitz matrices T n ( f ) Tn(f) generated by a function f . Unfortunately, such a theory is not available in the preconditioning setting, that is for matrices of the form T n − 1 ( g ) T n ( ℓ ) Tn−1(g)Tn(ℓ) with g , ℓ g,ℓ real-valued, g nonnnegative and not identically zero almost everywhere. Independently and under the milder hypothesis that f = ℓ / g f=ℓ/g is even and monotonic over [ 0 , π ] [0,π] , matrix-less algorithms have been developed for the fast eigenvalue computation of large preconditioned matrices of the type above, within a linear complexity in the matrix order: behind the high efficiency of such algorithms there are the expansions as in the case g ≡ 1 g≡1 , combined with the extrapolation idea, and hence we conjecture that the simple-loop theory has to be extended in such a new setting, as the numerics strongly suggest. Here we focus our attention on a change of variable, followed by the asymptotic expansion of the new variable, and we consider new matrix-less algorithms ad hoc for the current case. Numerical experiments show a much higher accuracy till machine precision and the same linear computational cost, when compared with the matrix-less procedures already proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {A new ensemble forecast algorithm, named the physics-informed data-driven algorithm with conditional Gaussian statistics (PIDD-CG), is developed to predict the probability density functions (PDFs) of complex turbulent systems with partial observations. The PIDD-CG algorithm integrates a unique multiscale statistical closure modeling strategy with a highly efficient nonlinear data assimilation scheme to create a mixture of conditional statistics. An effective data-driven modeling method is integrated with the dominant conditional statistics to serve as the forecast ensemble members that can significantly reduce the high computational cost of recovering high-dimensional PDFs. The multiscale features in the time evolution of these conditional statistics ensembles are effectively predicted by an appropriate combination of physics-informed analytic formulae and recurrent neural networks. An information metric is adopted as the loss function for the latter to more accurately capture the desirable turbulent features. The proposed algorithm displays effective forecasting performance in both the transient and statistical equilibrium non-Gaussian PDFs of strongly turbulent systems with intermittency, regime switching, and extreme events. It also facilitates the development of efficient statistical reduced-order models in recovering and predicting the large-scale coherent structures of a large group of multiscale complex systems.},

Type I agents only prioritize the facility closer to their location, while type II agents are concerned with the overall distance to both facilities. The objective is to minimize the total cost of all agents. In a game setting, agents have the option to strategically report their locations or types. Therefore, a mechanism which ensures that agents do not have any incentive to misreport their private information is considered strategy-proof. We design strategy-proof mechanisms with approximation ratios for both continuous and discrete facility locations, which are designed with respect to various restrictions on misreporting. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds on approximation ratios.},

  abstract     = {In signal analysis, among the effort of seeking for efficient representations of a signal into the basic ones of meaningful frequencies, to extract principal frequency components, consecutively one after another or n at one time, is a fundamental strategy. For this goal, we define the concept of mean-frequency and develop the related frequency decomposition with the complete Szegö kernel dictionary, the latter consisting of the multiple kernels, being defined as the parameter-derivatives of the Szegö kernels. Several major energy matching pursuit type sparse representations, including greedy algorithm (GA), orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA), adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD), pre-orthogonal adaptive Fourier decomposition (POAFD), n -Best approximation, and unwinding Blaschke expansion, are analyzed and compared. Of which an order in reconstruction efficiency between the mentioned algorithms is given based on the detailed study of their respective remainders. The study spells out the natural connections between the multiple kernels and the related Laguerre system, and in particular, shows that both, like the Fourier series, extract out the O ( n − σ ) O(n−σ) order convergence rate from the functions in the Hardy-Sobolev space of order σ &gt; 0 σ&amp;gt;0 . The existence of the n -Best approximation with the complete Szegö dictionary is proved and the related algorithm aspects are discussed. The included experiments form a significant integration part of the study, for they not only illustrate the theoretical results but also provide cross comparison between various ways of combination between the matching pursuit algorithms and the dictionaries in use. Experiments show that the complete dictionary remarkably improves approximation efficiency.},

To do so, through an interval observer, a mathematical relationship between the state and the disturbance is set up in advance. Secondarily, by using the estimations of the state and the disturbance, a local feedback controller is designed aiming at stabilizing the linear part of each follower. Thirdly, an odd distributed impulsive control method is proposed which is utilized to deal with the nonlinearity .

They take advantage of the factorized form and avoid forming the matrix C = A B C=AB explicitly. However, they can only find the minimum norm (least squares) solution. In contrast, the regularized randomized Kaczmarz (RRK) algorithm can find solutions with certain structures from consistent linear systems. In this work, by combining the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm or the randomized Gauss–Seidel algorithm with the RRK algorithm, we propose two new regularized randomized iterative algorithms to find (least squares) solutions with certain structures of A B x = b ABx=b . We prove linear convergence of the new algorithms. Computed examples are given to illustrate that the new algorithms can find sparse (least squares) solutions of A B x = b ABx=b and can be better than the existing randomized iterative algorithms for the corresponding full linear system C x = b Cx=b with C = A B C=AB .},

Firstly, the interval type-2 fuzzy model is utilized to approximate nonlinear singular semi-Markovian jump systems. Secondly, by employing the state decomposition approach, the interval type-2 fuzzy singular system is decomposed into a differential equation and an algebraic equation . Thirdly, a new periodic dynamic event-triggered scheme with the adaptive variable is proposed to further relieve the communication pressure while ensuring the system performance. The hidden semi-Markov model is used to describe the phenomenon that the modes of fuzzy controller and the modes of original system are asynchronously operational. By designing the asynchronous event-triggered fuzzy controller based on quantized decomposed state vectors and constructing suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop fuzzy singular system is stochastically admissible. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to verify the validity and advantages of obtained results.},

The occurrence of some destabilizing switching and unsolvable OR of each individual subsystem is permitted. Dual distributed event-triggered mechanisms (DDETMs) are proposed, incorporating both distributed event detection conditions to tackle the issue of unreliable single-channel data during deception attacks on sensor networks, and mode-matching detection conditions to reduce asynchronous intervals. A dwell time switching rule is developed without consistency constraint, i.e., the sub-controller&#39;s stabilizing/destabilizing switching may be inconsistent with that of the subsystem. Judging conditions are introduced for the occurrence of multiple deception attacks on dual-terminal sensor/transmission networks, which adjust the increment coefficients of Lyapunov functions before or after switching instants. Sufficient conditions are provided to ensure secure OR for NSSs under multiple deception attacks.

The dynamics of the proposed model are analyzed, revealing the effect of group interactions on the system dynamics. We derive a global asymptotically stability condition of the zero equilibrium point. If the parameters enhancement factor and transform probability meet the condition, the social contagion will eventually disappear. The bifurcation behavior arising from group interactions is investigated, when the enhancement factor exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes a backward bifurcation. This implies that R 0 &lt; 1 R0&amp;lt;1 does not guarantee the disappearance of social contagion, we also need to control the initial values of social contagion at a lower level. The optimal control strategies for the model are provided. Moreover, the numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. It is worth noting that the group interactions lead to the emergence of a bistable phenomenon, in which the social contagion will either fade away or persist eventually, depending on the initial values.},

  abstract     = {Human behaviors are strongly influenced by social norms. This work couples injunctive social norms with evolutionary games. Injunctive norms refer to behaviors which individuals should conform to and thereby entail social pressure to adhere to a particular action. Here we investigate impact of such social norms on both pairwise and multi-player games. It is shown that injunctive norms can enforce the system to either extreme, meaning that they give rise to the possibility of bi-stability (two stable equilibrium states) in evolutionary games. We derive the condition for such bi-stability in the mean-field limit. While investigating pairwise games with social norms, we observe that —besides other possibilities—Prisoner&#39;s dilemma (PD), snow-drift (SD), and Trivial (TR) games may experience the bi-stability like the stag-hunt (SH) game. Interestingly, SD game with social norms exhibits four possible asymptotic outcomes: all-cooperation (All C ), all-defection (All D ), either All C or All D (bi-stable), and coexistence. However, its multi-player variant does not manifest a unique coexistence equilibrium. Moreover, it demonstrates another bi-stable equilibrium, comprising either coexistence or All C , besides other outcomes observed in the two-player case. Conversely, PD and its multi-player variant, i.e., public goods game with injunctive norms show identical evolutionary outcomes (All D or bi-stable).},

  abstract     = {Recent developments in additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have empowered the design and fabrication of intricate bioinspired engineering structures at the nano/micro scale. However, mathematical modeling and computation of these structures are still challenging. The main target of this study is to address an efficient computational approach for predicting the mechanical behavior of graphene platelets (GPLs)-reinforced functionally graded triply periodic minimal surface (FG-TPMS) nanoplates. The computational model integrates both nonlocal elasticity and strain gradient effects into the NURBS-based isogeometric analysis of these small-scale structures. We establish advanced nanoplate models by combining three sheet-based TPMS architectures with two new porosity distribution patterns and three distribution patterns of GPLs across the thickness direction. Moreover, the present work makes a pioneering attempt to elucidate how the stiffness-hardening and stiffness-softening mechanisms influence FG-TPMS nanoplates reinforced with GPLs. Compared with two common cellular solids, the superiority of TPMS architectures&#39; mechanical performance is demonstrated. Among all, P and IWP TPMS types along with symmetric porosity and GPLs distributions exhibit outstanding behaviors under static bending, free vibration, and dynamic instability. Furthermore, we conducted a performance analysis for the first time, showcasing the superior capabilities of TPMS architectures under dynamic in-plane compressive loads, especially when compared to isotropic plates of equal weight. The findings of this study greatly enhance our understanding of the intricate mechanical responses of GPLs-reinforced TPMS architectures at the small-scale level, contributing to future interdisciplinary applications.},

The recommended numerical scheme is third order accurate for the linear advection in the 2D case with a space dependent velocity. Using a combination of analytical and numerical tools in the von Neumann stability analysis, the third order scheme is claimed to be unconditionally stable. We also present a simple high-resolution scheme that gives a TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) approximation of the spatial derivative for the advected level set function in the 1D case. In the case of nonlinear advection, a semi-implicit discretization is proposed to linearize the problem. The compact implicit part of the stencil of numerical schemes contains unknowns only in the upwind direction. Consequently, algebraic solvers like the fast sweeping method can be applied efficiently to solve the resulting algebraic systems. Numerical tests to evolve a smooth and non-smooth interface and an example with a large variation of the velocity confirm the good accuracy of the third order scheme even in the case of very large Courant numbers. The advantage of the high-resolution scheme is documented for examples where the advected level set functions contain large jumps in the gradient.},

With the aid of a second-order Strang splitting approach employed to the Dirac equation, the major local truncation error of the indicated numerical methods is established. Moreover, for the semi-discrete scheme and full-discretization, we rigorously demonstrate the improved, sharp uniform error estimates are O ( ε τ 2 ) O(ετ2) and O ( h 1 m + h 2 m + ε τ 2 ) O(h1m+h2m+ετ2) in virtue of the regularity compensation oscillation (RCO) technique.

The method involves introducing an auxiliary variable and utilizing a reducing order technique for the fractional derivative. This reduces the original fractional wave equations to a coupled system consisting of two equations with lower order derivative in time. The time-fractional derivative is discretized using the L2- 1σ formula, while a second-order scheme is used for discretizing the first-order time derivative. The spatial direction is discretized using an efficient two-grid Galerkin FEM. The paper demonstrates that the optimal error estimates in L2 -norm and H1 -norm of the two-grid methods can achieve optimal convergence order when the mesh size satisfies H=h12 and H=hr2r+2 , respectively. To handle the initial singularity of the solution and the historical memory of the fractional derivative term, the paper presents the nonuniform and fast two-grid algorithms.

In this work, we propose an extension of the spatial PGG on hypergraphs , where cooperators are allowed to allocate their investments unevenly. A tunable parameter, α , is introduced to characterize the investment preference. α &gt; 0 α&amp;gt;0 means that cooperators will allocate more investment to the PGG group from which they obtain higher payoff, while for α &lt; 0 α&amp;lt;0 , cooperators will allocate more investment to the group from which they gain lower payoff. Results from numerical simulations indicate that compared with the results of homogeneous case, allocating more resources to profitable groups can effectively promote cooperation. Additionally, for a relative high synergy factor r , there exists a moderate negative value of α that will induce the lowest cooperation level, larger or smaller values of α can enable a higher cooperation level relative to the worst result. Moreover, the nontrivial results are robust against hypergraphs with different orders.},

This work aims to improve the axial force accuracy of the element by using the second-order centerline approximate function and precise constraint equations. The second-order function includes the quintic Hermite shape function and the vector of nodal coordinates containing zeroth to second-order derivatives of position. The elastic force vector of the element and its tangent stiffness were then formulated based on the decoupled elastic line method. The exact kinematic requirements of three types of constraint points were fully clarified. On this basis, the corresponding concise constraint equations, constraint Jacobian and Hessian matrices were rigorously derived in the context of ANCF, where G 2 continuity was demonstrated to be satisfied at the node acted by an inclined concentrated force, the relative rotation constraint of the rigid joint was described using the dot product of the gradients on both sides of the joint, and the fixing gradient direction at the partially-clamped end was expressed by using the zero cross product of the end gradients in the initial and deformed configurations. Large deformation problems of typical beams under fixed and follower loads were solved using five types of elements, where the results of the ABAQUS B22 elements were taken as a reference for validation. It is found that when using the first- and second-order beam elements having over-constraint equations of the three types of constraint points, obvious axial force error occurs near the corresponding constraint points. In comparison, a few second-order elements containing the derived constraint equations output correct axial force consistent with ABAQUS. However, a large number of the first-order elements containing the correct constraint equations still yield inaccurate axial force in certain beam regions.},

  abstract     = {Public supervision, as a source of social behavioral norms and moral guidelines, exerts important guidance and influence on individuals. To maintain public order, in this study, we propose a reputation incentives mechanism with public supervision, in which each player is granted the authority to evaluate others. These players, by observing, can make positive or negative evaluations that derive from the satisfaction level of the interactive behavior to neighbors choosing cooperation or defection in each round of the evolutionary game. Evaluations made by defectors are considered untrustworthy, resulting in the evaluation values assigned to others being halved. After mutual evaluation, the reputation is an average of the evaluations given by all their neighbors and then is consequently granted to each player. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate that reputation provides rewards that positively incentivize cooperation. And we observe that a weaker evaluation intensity leads to more stable and higher levels of cooperation among individuals. This mechanism provides valuable insights into the evolution of reputation and the optimization of supervising mechanisms.},

Furthermore, a novel Kalman filter with a compensation mechanism is designed to estimate the ideal states of CPS subject to replay attacks, and the Kalman filter gain is optimized based on the detection results.

An improved second-order dynamic surface control technology is developed to deal with the piecewise differentiability of safe desired signals and the phenomenon of repeatedly differentiation, simultaneously. To handle the negative effects of system uncertainties and obtain better estimation effect of high order time-varying disturbances, the radial basis function neural networks and high-order disturbance observer methods are developed. The safety and performance of the closed-loop nonlinear system under the proposed control scheme have been rigorous proved and discussed by Lyapunov stability analysis.

The methods are based on affine combinations of time-splitting integrators and pseudo-spectral discretizations using Hermite and Fourier expansions. We show the effectiveness of the proposed methods by numerically computing the dynamics of soliton solutions of the standard and fractional variants of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), and by comparing the results with those obtained by standard splitting integrators. An exhaustive numerical investigation shows that the new technique is competitive when compared to traditional composition-splitting schemes for the case of Hamiltonian problems both in terms accuracy and computational cost. Moreover, it is applicable straightforwardly to irreversible models, outperforming high-order symplectic integrators which could become unstable due to their need of negative time steps. Finally, we discuss potential improvements of the numerical methods aimed to increase their efficiency, and possible applications to the investigation of dissipative solitons that arise in nonlinear optical systems of contemporary interest. Overall, the method offers a promising alternative for solving a wide range of evolutionary partial differential equations.},

In this work, focusing on an ODE context, we investigate several strategies to improve this approach. Our initial emphasis is on the order of accuracy of the method in connection with the polynomial discretization of the weak formulation. We demonstrate that precise choices lead to higher-order convergences in comparison to the existing literature. Then, we put ADER methods into a Deferred Correction (DeC) formalism. This allows to determine the optimal number of iterations, which is equal to the formal order of accuracy of the method, and to introduce efficient p -adaptive modifications. These are defined by matching the order of accuracy achieved and the degree of the polynomial reconstruction at each iteration. We provide analytical and numerical results, including the stability analysis of the new modified methods, the investigation of the computational efficiency, an application to adaptivity and an application to hyperbolic PDEs with a Spectral Difference (SD) space discretization.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel approach for detecting a change point in the service rate of an M / M / 1 / m M/M/1/m queue. The change point is identified by detecting a change in the probability distribution of a stochastic process. To achieve this, the article proposes a likelihood function that is constructed based on the observed number of customers left in the system at departures. Bayesian estimators are then derived using this likelihood function. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for detecting change points in service rates.},

  abstract     = {Noise is ubiquitous in natural systems and can induce coherent stochastic oscillations which cannot occur in the absence of noise, or stochastic quasiperiodic orbits which are markedly different from the deterministic limit cycle. For fast-slow systems, noise acting on the fast subsystem can induce quasi-periodic orbits tuned by the slow variable, which were termed as self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR). In our previous work [Zhu et al., 2022 [46] ], we proposed a phase reduction framework on the SISR-oscillator by the hybrid approximation on the stochastic quasiperiodic orbit and the estimation of the effective noise. In this work, we remove the restriction of the additive Gaussian form assumption on the effective noise, and propose a more natural dimensionality-reduction method which we refer to as embedding phase reduction. Different SISR-oscillators induced by varying noise intensities, which can be embedded into a limit cycle, can have a unified form of the reduced phase equation. The efficiency of the embedding phase reduction is validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the case of periodic forcing, where excellent agreement is achieved for the entrainment and phase drifting dynamics. The simplicity and generality of the proposed embedding phase reduction approach indicate its potential applications in practical experiments and relevance in biological systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies customers&#39; equilibrium joining behavior in a multi-server queue with threshold policy, and then puts forward effective schemes to control customers&#39; behaviors and to optimize social welfare. The stream of customers consists of two parts: customers in class 1 and customers in class 2, and they wait for service in order until the system is empty. Then the servers take a vacation and they would be reactivated as soon as the queue length reaches a threshold N . The two types of customers are heterogeneous in service revenue and delay sensitivity, i.e., they have different revenue-cost structures. Besides, customers in class 1 can access to the delay information on servers&#39; status and queue length as they arrive, but customers in class 2 can not. Distinguishing the two scenarios of whether there is a joining threshold for customers in class 1 in vacation state, we get the two types of customers&#39; equilibrium joint joining strategies, respectively, and observe the interaction between the behaviors of the two types of customers. Moreover, we also get their socially optimal joint joining strategy for comparisons and for making control measures , and discuss the influence of the fraction of customers in class 1 on social welfare and system throughput. We find that in any scenario, the equilibrium social welfare is always unimodal with respect to the fraction of customers in class 1, which indicates that the higher fraction of customers in class 1 is not necessarily beneficial. However, on the premise of effectively controlling customer behavior, this high fraction is still necessary to optimize social welfare and increase system throughput, although the optimal social welfare is also unimodal.},

The cardinality of a largest (total) mutual-visibility set in G is known under the name (total) mutual-visibility number, and has been studied in several recent works. In this paper, we propose two lower variants of these concepts, defined as the smallest possible cardinality among all maximal (total) mutual-visibility sets in G , and denote them by μ − ( G ) μ−(G) and μ t − ( G ) μt−(G) , respectively. While the total mutual-visibility number is never larger than the mutual-visibility number in a graph G , we prove that both differences μ − ( G ) − μ t − ( G ) μ−(G)−μt−(G) and μ t − ( G ) − μ − ( G ) μt−(G)−μ−(G) can be arbitrarily large. We characterize graphs G with some small values of μ − ( G ) μ−(G) and μ t − ( G ) μt−(G) , and prove a useful tool called the Neighborhood Lemma, which enables us to find upper bounds on the lower mutual-visibility number in several classes of graphs. We compare the lower mutual-visibility number with the lower general position number, and find a close relationship with the Bollobás-Wessel theorem when this number is considered in Cartesian products of complete graphs. Finally, we also prove the NP-completeness of the decision problem related to μ t − ( G ) μt−(G) .},

In this paper, an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm combined with integral sliding mode control (ISMC) is utilized to deal with LDs, and then the robustness of the system is improved. Firstly, the hot strip rolling is a complex nonlinear system , the looper model is linearized to be approximated around the operating point for simplicity. Secondly, the ISMC is addressed for LDs in hot strip rolling; meanwhile, due to the chattering phenomenon in conventional sliding mode control, a novel reaching law is designed; whereafter an off-policy RL algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal controller.

Then the convergences of those distributed optimization algorithms were proved for strictly convex objective functions. And the initial conditions of systems for the algorithm are free. The simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed optimazation approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the dual-mode coupling resonance and dynamic stability of axially moving ferromagnetic thin plate strips in alternating magnetic field. According to the basic electromagnetic theory and the magnetoelastic mechanics model, Lorentz electromagnetic force and torque generated by eddy current effect and the magnetizing force generated by magnetization are determined for the ferromagnetic plate strip. Introducing Von Karman geometric nonlinearity, the nonlinear governing equation of axially moving ferromagnetic plate strips under the combined action of mechanical load and magnetizing force is established by Hamilton&#39;s principle. For the simply supported plate strip, Galerkin method and the multi-scale method are employed to solve the modal coupling resonance dominated by electromagnetic excitation, obtaining the amplitude-frequency response equations. The stability of resonance responses is analyzed by the Lyapunov stability theory. Through parametric research, the amplitude-frequency characteristic curves, bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponent spectra of each mode are plotted; the effect of different parameters on vibration characteristics and dynamic stability under the modal coupling is analyzed for the system. The results show that as one of the modal amplitudes enters the resonance region, the other modal amplitude decays into the &quot;collapse&quot; region due to energy exchange between modes; each modal amplitudes has more complex multi-valued and jumping phenomena for the nonlinear coupling effect. The increase in velocity will affect the stability of system; the enhancement of magnetic field will make the system change into chaos at high velocity.},

However, the disagreement boundary in which is influenced by the initial values of the system. To avoid this, a practical time-boundary (PTB) consensus framework using a novel time-boundary-base generator (TBBG) is proposed in this paper, and it is extended to fractional-order multi-agent systems and estimable topology. A significant fractional differential equation is solved as the theoretical basis to achieve PTB consensus. Evolving from the time-base generator, this novel TBBG inherits the benefit of reducing the initial control input and saves energy consumption by optimizing four newly added adjustable parameters compared to the existing work. Additionally, outcomes are extended to quasi-PTB consensus and PTB-cluster consensus. The effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed approach are illustrated by two numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {With the need for large-scale networks evolving in a variety of fields, such as cloud/edge computing, social networks, privacy protection, etc., the network&#39;s robustness against faulty clusters has recently gained more attention. The family of bijection-connected networks includes numerous instances of remarkable network topologies, for example, hypercubes , Möbius cubes, crossed cubes, etc. For a network whose underlying topology is modeled by a graph G , its node-connectivity, κ ( G ) κ(G) , is a key performance index of network robustness, which is formalized as the total number of nodes in the smallest node-cut of G . Apparently, κ ( G ) κ(G) happens to be bounded above by G &#39;s minimum degree. A node-cut is trivial if it is nothing but an arbitrary node&#39;s neighborhood. Then, G can be r -connected if 1 ≤ r ≤ κ ( G ) 1≤r≤κ(G) . To say the least, if each smallest node-cut of G is trivial, G is super connected. The super P k Pk -connectivity is an innovative assessment to quantify the connectedness level of G , where P k Pk notates a path consisting of k nodes ( k ≥ 1 k≥1 ). This article aims to investigate the super P k Pk -connectivity for the bijection-connected networks. With regard to some specific instances, such as hypercubes, locally twisted cubes, etc., a sufficient and necessary condition is established to identify whether they are really super P k Pk -connected.},

  abstract     = {We consider a four-species cyclic community with species u i ui where i = 1 , … , 4 i=1,…,4 . For each i , species u i ui exhibit a crowding effect, competing with members of its own species (intraspecies competition). Furthermore, there is interspecies competition as u i ui competes with u i + 1 ui+1 (mod 4). We also allow for species mobility via Fickian diffusion. A feature of this cyclic competition scheme is that there are two alliances of non-competing species, d 13, consisting only of species u 1 u1 and u 3 u3 , and d 24, consisting only of species u 2 u2 and u 4 u4 . We focus on the parameter regime where these two alliances are the only stable states. We consider the invasion problem, where these two states are initially adjacent, and derive conditions where one state displaces the other. We focus primarily on the standstill problem, where both alliances are evenly matched, dividing the parameter space into two regions - one where d 13 displaces d 24 and one where d 24 displaces d 13. We concentrate on three specific parameter regimes: (i) moderate competition - the interspecies and intraspecies competitions are roughly of equal strength, (ii) strong competition - interspecies competition is significantly larger than intraspecies competition, and (iii) slow competitors - the species comprising one alliance are significantly less mobile than the species comprising the other alliance. We employ asymptotic and perturbation methods to determine the outcome of the invasion (winning alliance) and compare our analytic results (generally very positively) with both numerical computations and, when parameters are such that the problem can be reduced to the two-species problem, with previously obtained results.},

In the present paper, we study the behavior of solutions in the case of three possible states and show that in some cases a kind of self–organization occurs but in others, a periodic behavior characterizes the system. We can observe a wide variety of dynamics that can relate to the behavior of real systems . The model contains a natural interaction intensity parameter γ ≥ 1 γ≥1 . Case γ &gt; 1 γ&amp;gt;1 leads to “ very ” nonlinear structures. We prove that the system has no non–constant periodic solutions. We propose conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of equilibrium points on the boundary that corresponds to the asymptotic extinction of two states. Moreover, conditions for the uniqueness and instability of an inner equilibrium point, corresponding to an asymptotic presence of all states, are formulated. The case of γ = 1 γ=1 with asymmetric interaction rate is studied as well. Possible complex behavior of solutions can reflect the possible complex performance of systems with asymmetric interactions — typical e.g. in Economy and some applications in Biology.},

We design the GSNN as a graph of transition functions of the structure of the model to ensure that the three properties of the ODE solution are satisfied: additivity to one, positivity, and boundness. Rather than directly estimating the solution, these neural networks approximate the transition functions. We present theoretical evidence substantiating that our GSNN maintains these properties, along with approximation outcomes from both simulated and real-world data. These outcomes demonstrate that our GSNN outperforms the non-graph-supported approach for these issues, with instances where it even surpasses full model-based solutions and Recurrent Neural Networks. Furthermore, an evolutionary algorithm successfully generated a consistent model using the data, offering a comprehensive framework for neural network-based model discovery in these scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample from the posterior distribution of problems with nonsmooth potential functions. Following the Bayesian paradigm, our potential function will be some of two convex functions, where one of which is smooth. We first approximate the potential function by the so-called forward-backward envelope function, which is a real-valued smooth function with the same critical points as the original one. Then, we incorporate this smoothing technique with the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), leading to smoothing ULA, called SULA. We next establish non-asymptotic convergence results of SULA under mild assumption on the original potential function. We finally report some numerical results to establish the promising performance of SULA on both synthetic and real chemoinformatics data.},

  abstract     = {Continuous dynamical systems with different nonlinear terms can show rich dynamical characteristic, which can be presented and verified in nonlinear oscillators. Reliable algorithm for discretization is crucial to obtain suitable numerical solutions and then equivalent maps can be proposed to reproduce similar dynamics as the nonlinear oscillators. The application of Helmholtz theorem provides helpful way to define exact Hamilton energy function when the dynamical equations for a nonlinear oscillator are written in the vector form. However, reliable definition of energy function for maps is kept open from physical aspect. In this work, scale transformation for parameter and variables is applied to convert some maps into equivalent nonlinear oscillators and the definition of energy function is presented. Furthermore, a generic memristive term is introduced into the map for developing memristive map, and its equivalent memristive oscillator is obtained for clarifying the energy function and oscillatory characteristics. Then, the Hamilton energy function is dispersed to measure the shift of energy level in the map. Our scheme and results provide a criterion to check the reliability of maps derived from realistic system. When the nonlinear oscillator has the same nonlinear form for variables and local kinetics after linear transformation accompanying suitable parameters transformation, it indicates this map is discertized from dynamical systems for realistic systems rather than presenting it in mathematical form arbitrarily. It provides clues to convert periodic oscillators for nonlinear/linear circuits into low-dimensional map for inducing chaos, and digital circuits can be suggested for logic operation and signal processing.},

Under this kind of communication protocol, the transmission order of sensor nodes is predefined. And, only the selected sensor nodes are able to get the privileges to visit the communication network at sampling instants. In addition, because of the network-induced transmission delays, the addressed system becomes an impulsive time-delayed one. For the protocol-induced system, sufficient conditions are obtained based on a refined Lyapunov functional to ensure the so-called input-to-state stability. Moreover, a suitable algorithm is developed to calculate the corresponding controller gains.

They sequentially solve subproblems represented as squared residual of the Newton equations with the L 2 L2 regularization to determine the search direction . However, since the subproblems of the LMMs are usually reduced to linear equations with n variables, it takes much time to solve them when m ≪ n m≪n . In this paper, we propose a new LMM which generalizes the L 2 L2 regularization of the subproblems of the ordinary LMMs. By virtue of the generalization, we can choose a suitable regularization term for each given problem. Moreover, we show that a sequence generated by the proposed method converges globally and quadratically under some reasonable assumptions. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to confirm that the proposed method performs better than the existing LMMs for some problems that satisfy m ≪ n m≪n .},

Q-learning, in particular, has become a mainstream method during this development. Here we introduce Q-learning agents into the evolutionary prisoner&#39;s dilemma game on a square lattice . Specifically, we associate the state space of Q-learning agents with the strategies of their neighbors, and we introduce a neighboring reward information sharing mechanism. We thus provide Q-learning agents with the payoff information of their neighbors, in addition to their strategies, which has not been done in previous studies. Through simulations, we show that considering neighborhood payoff information can significantly promote cooperation in the population. Moreover, we show that for an appropriate strength of neighborhood payoff information sharing, a chessboard pattern emerges on the lattice. We analyze in detail the reasons for the emergence of the chessboard pattern and the increase in cooperation frequency, and we also provide a theoretical analysis based on the pair approximation method. We hope that our research will inspire effective approaches for resolving social dilemmas by means of sharing more information among reinforcement learning agents during evolutionary games.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a shifting asymmetric time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based model-free hybrid force/position controller (SABMHC) is proposed for the endpoint of the 3-DOF series elastic actuator (SEA)-based manipulator which can be used for machining of large curved surfaces. The proposed SABMHC contains a force sub-control loop and a position sub-control loop. The force sub-control loop converts the force control into position control based on the idea of impedance control, and realizes the hybrid force/position control through the position sub-control. Then, in order to achieve accurate trajectory tracking control of the position sub-control loop, a shifting asymmetric time-varying BLF-based model-free controller is proposed, which includes the error shifting function, asymmetric time varying BLF, time-delay estimation (TDE) technique, and adaptive compensation term. To prevent the random initial error from being so large that it exceeds the pre-set boundary and affects the steady-state response, an error shifting function is introduced. The error shifting function can make the shifting error independent of the tracking error before reaching the pre-set shifting time, so as to achieve better control performance by setting a small pre-set boundary for the shifting error. With the Lyapunov function, the designed SABMHC can ensure that the stability and the shifting error converges within the pre-set boundary in a finite time. Finally, the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed SABMHC are analyzed by comparison with the TDE-based intelligent PID (TDE-iPD) and BLF-based sliding-mode controller (BLF-SMC).},

The purpose of this article is to reduce the load of communication and controller updates for multi-agent systems on the basis of consensus achieving, a novel distributed event-triggered impulsive control strategy is therefore proposed to realize the global and exponential leader-following consensus. By jointly utilizing the matrix measure protocol, the comparison principle and the parameter variation formula method, sufficient conditions for the realization of leader-following consensus are successfully obtained. Moreover, the convergence rate is precisely estimated and the Zeno behavior is proved not exist in closed-loop systems.

To handle unknown time-varying parameters, the congelation of variables method is employed. Different novel functions are introduced to achieve prescribed performance tracking and finite-time prescribed performance tracking, respectively. Meanwhile, the problem of explosion of complexity is avoided by utilizing the command filter and the compensation mechanism. For reasons of saving network resources and reducing communication burden, a new event-triggered mechanism is proposed, which can circumvent the Zeno behavior. Then, an event-triggered adaptive prescribed performance tracking control scheme is constructed and is extended to event-triggered finite-time adaptive prescribed performance tracking, both of which guarantee that all closed-loop signals are bounded and the trajectory of the tracking error can be limited to the prescribed region.

  abstract     = {The role of costly punishment in shaping the evolution of cooperation has long been a subject of debate, given its contested effectiveness due to challenges posed by second-order free-riders and antisocial punishment. However, these conclusions have predominantly arisen from scenarios characterized by symmetry, where individuals possess the ability to mutually impose punishment. In this study, we delve into the impact of asymmetric punishment on the development of cooperation within interdependent networks. Notably, our approach involves the exclusive application of punishment between players situated on different network layers, with no punitive interactions occurring within the same network layer. A critical distinction lies in the fact that punitive authority resides solely with the upper-layer players, while the reverse is not true. Specifically, we investigate two modes of punishment: (i) pro-social punishment, where cooperators penalize defectors, and (ii) anti-social punishment, wherein defectors penalize cooperators. Through extensive numerical simulations, we unveil a synchronization phenomenon of strategies within the two networks when the costs of punishment are comparatively high. This synchronization gives rise to the gradual emergence of cooperative clusters, resulting in higher payoffs for the individuals involved. Conversely, when punishment costs are relatively low, the synchronization phenomenon does not manifest, and the evolution of cooperation takes a divergent course. In summary, our findings enrich the theory of punishment by underscoring the pivotal role played by asymmetric punishment in molding cooperative behavior.},

In the ISEFG method, the DSMLS approximation is adopted to construct the shape function, and the stabilization factor is established based on the solution space of velocity and pressure. The Galerkin weak form and integral coordinate transformation are taken to achieve the final discrete equations of the problems. Following the ideas of the dimensional splitting method, the DSMLS method approximates the functions from the direction of dimension splitting and the dimension-splitting subdivision surfaces. Then the ISEFG method can reduce the dimensionality and complexity of matrix operations in solving the shape function, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy. This paper introduces several numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stabilized meshless method. The numerical examples show that the ISEFG method based on the DSMLS approximation can find stable solutions of the velocities and pressure without physical oscillation. The method presented in this paper offers higher accuracy and consumes less CPU time than the EFG method based on the MLS approximation.},

In this paper, we derive a lower bound for the exact value of h -extra 3-component edge-connectivity of BC networks B n and demonstrate that it is tight for one member of B n , hypercube Q n , in the interval 1 ≤ h ≤ 2 ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − 1 − 1 , n ≥ 4 . This lower bound is also tight for the exact value of 2 c -extra 3-component edge-connectivity of B n with 0 ≤ c ≤ n − 2 , n ≥ 4 . Specifically, c λ 3 h ( Q n ) = 2 n h − ∑ i = 0 t k i 2 k i + 1 − ∑ i = 0 t i 2 k i + 2 − h for 1 ≤ h ≤ 2 ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − 1 − 1 , n ≥ 4 and c λ 3 2 c ( B n ) = ( 2 n − 2 c − 1 ) 2 c for 0 ≤ c ≤ n − 2 , n ≥ 4 . Exact value of h -extra 3-component edge-connectivity of n -dimensional folded hypercube F Q n , c λ 3 h ( F Q n ) is 2 ( n + 1 ) h − ∑ i = 0 t k i 2 k i + 1 − ∑ i = 0 t i 2 k i + 2 − h for 1 ≤ h ≤ 2 ⌈ n 2 ⌉ − 1 − 1 , n ≥ 4 , and that of 2 c -extra 3-component edge-connectivity of F Q n , c λ 3 2 c ( F Q n ) , is ( 2 n − 2 c + 1 ) 2 c for 0 ≤ c ≤ n − 2 , n ≥ 4 .},

  abstract     = {A chaotic map plays a critical role in image encryption (IME). The map used to generate chaotic sequences should perform high dynamic characteristics. In this study, a new chaotic system depending on the Bessel function , so-called Bessel map, and a novel Bessel map-based IME scheme are proposed for the IME. The Bessel map has three control parameters, which provide superior ergodicity and diversity. Bessel map has also order degree rather than Sine map, which is used as a control parameter boosting the security. The chaotic characteristic of the Bessel map is verified through different reliable measurements such as bifurcation diagram, trajectory phase, Lyapunov exponent (LE), sample entropy (SE), permutation entropy (PE), and 0-1 test. Then, the Bessel map is employed in a new bitwise IME (BIME) scheme based on bit-level permutation and diffusion processes. The Bessel map-based BIME is validated through various simulated cryptanalyses and cyberattacks as well as compared with the state-of-the-art schemes. The achieved results demonstrate that the BIME based on the Bessel map ensures the most secure ciphered images thanks to the excellent randomness and complexity performance.},

A new network mode-dependent round-robin-like protocol (RRLP) is introduced to the networked SPSs, which can dynamically adjust the number of the selected sensor nodes according to the network environment condition. Based on this RRLP and Markov lossy network, a Markov mode and scheduling order co-dependent output feedback controller is constructed to ensure the system control performance. By constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional dependent on the singular perturbation parameter, Markov mode, and scheduling order simultaneously, sufficient conditions of mean square stability for SPSs are obtained, and numerical stiffness is avoided. Finally, a direct current motor-controlled inverted pendulum example is proposed to verify the effectiveness of our main results.},

First, a uniform channel model is proposed to describe the employed MDES subject to the effect of packet dropouts by introducing two independent random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution and three indicator variables. Subsequently, a novel intermediate estimator is designed to estimate both system states and a fictitious intermediate variable (an integration of faults and leader&#39;s inputs) based on relatively measured outputs. In terms of the Lyapunov stability theory , some sufficient conditions are acquired to guarantee that the closed-loop system is exponentially ultimately bounded in the mean-square sense. Furthermore, the desired gain matrices are obtained by resorting to both the graph feature and singular value decomposition . Finally, the effectiveness and superiority are tested by two simulation examples for the proposed tracking protocol.},

An antidirected spanning closed trail of D is a spanning closed trail in which consecutive arcs have opposite directions and each arc of D occurs at most once. If all vertices in this antidirected spanning closed trail are distinct, then the antidirected spanning closed trail is called an antidirected hamiltonian cycle. Grünbaum in 1971 conjectured that every even tournament T n with n ≥ 10 has an antidirected hamiltonian cycle. In 1983, Petrović proved that any even tournament with at least 16 vertices has an antidirected hamiltonian cycle, which was the best result supporting this conjecture by far. In this paper, we investigate the existence of antidirected spanning closed trails in tournaments. Moreover, we show that every tournament T n with n ≥ 6 has an antidirected spanning closed trail, and prove that it is optimal.},

The typical result first leads to two-year and multiyear cycles by the principle of period doubling on a folded Möbius strip, up to the emergence of a chaotic and hyper-chaotic attractor living close to the trivial equilibrium corresponding to the extinction of populations. Moreover, this instability of the ecosystem can be hidden for a long time and the transition to its basin of attraction can occur by external perturbation in a random and irreversible manner.

This method, proposed a decade ago as an alternative technique to the Empirical Mode Decomposition, has been used extensively in many applied fields of research and studied, from a mathematical point of view, in several papers published in the last few years. However, even if its convergence and stability are now established both in the continuous and discrete setting, it is still an open problem to understand up to what extent this approach can separate two close-by frequencies contained in a signal. In this paper, first we recall previously discovered theoretical results about Iterative Filtering. Afterward, we prove a few new theorems regarding the ability of this method in separating two nearby frequencies both in the case of continuously and discrete sampled signals. Among them, we prove a theorem which allows to construct filters which captures, up to machine precision, a specific frequency. We run numerical tests to confirm our findings and to compare the performance of Iterative Filtering with the one of Empirical Mode Decomposition and Synchrosqueezing methods. All the results presented confirm the ability of the technique under investigation in addressing the fundamental “one or two frequencies” question.},

Previous studies, whether identifying the initial cooperators in a network that can lead to the spread of cooperation or assessing the chances that an intrusive defector may lead to the collapse of cooperation, have assumed that all individual attributes are homogeneous. However, heterogeneity among humans is widespread and can sometimes affect cooperation and welfare. For example, the layout of non-cooperative individuals in cooperative individuals inhibits the evolution of cooperation. Therefore, specifying the heterogeneity of individuals and studying the effect of their initial position on cooperation is the focus of our attention. Here we hypothesize that individuals in the network are divided into cooperative and non-cooperative individuals according to the heterogeneity of social value orientations, and we investigate the effects of the initial position of non-cooperative individuals on cooperation by adding them through different ranking rules to the network composed of cooperative individuals. We investigate separately the effects of the proportion of non-cooperative individuals, the proportion of initial cooperators of different types of individuals and different game scenarios on cooperation under different ranking rules. The results show that the addition of non-cooperative individuals to cooperative populations can effectively hinder the spread of cooperation. We also find that the proportion of initial cooperators for different types of individuals and the effects of different game types on population evolution also differ significantly under different ranking rules.},

We therefore propose a new two-layer rumor propagation model, which simultaneously introduces simplicial complexes into the online and offline network layers and considers the social adaptation of individuals. We derive the basic regeneration number, the rumor-free equilibrium, and the rumor-prevalence equilibrium using mean-field theory, and verify their accuracy through extensive computer simulations. The results show that the inclusion of higher-order interactions in both layers leads to richer dynamical phenomena. Specifically, higher-order interactions lead to bistable states, discontinuous transitions, and the coexistence of multiple rumor-prevalence equilibria, and increasing the infection parameter within a certain range reduces the outbreak size of rumors in another layer. In addition, a higher speed and degree of social adaptation, a stronger strength of coupled propagation enhancement effect, and a weaker strength of coupled recovery enhancement effect significantly increase the spread speed and size of rumors. Finally, we present and analyze two intervention strategies: improving public media literacy and building a truth space. We find that both intervention strategies can reduce the spread size and speed of rumors, but the synergy of two intervention strategies is more effective.},

  abstract     = {The rapid informatization and digitalization of the society heavily rely on the extensive use of parallel and distributed, networked computer systems. It is important for large-scale parallel and distributed systems to be able to detect and tolerate faulty vertices in the network. A network&#39;s fault status can often be characterized with the network&#39;s connectivity and diagnosability. The connectivity/diagnosability can be defined under various conditions. This paper is concerned with the connectivity/diagnosability under the “ g -good-neighbor condition”, which can more accurately measure a network&#39;s fault status. In this paper, we propose a new class of recursive networks, named recursive match networks (RMNs), which contain the well-known BCube and BC networks. We determine the RMNs&#39; g -good-neighbor connectivity and g -good-neighbor conditional diagnosability under the classic MM* and PMC diagnostic models for g ≥ 0 . Since the RMN is a more general network covering the BCube and BC networks, our results can be directly applied to these two networks.},

Our algorithm aims to achieve exceptional precision and accuracy in determining all potential solutions, as previous studies in the literature have only managed to produce limited accurate results. Additionally, our computational scheme approximates the critical values of the transition parameter. Moreover, we establish a rigorous proof demonstrating the uniform convergence of the approximation sequence to the exact solution of the original problem, under the condition that the initial guess is sufficiently close to the true solution. This theoretical result further establishes the reliability of our algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive numerical simulations, which convincingly demonstrate its capability to accurately solve the 3D Bratu problem while effectively determining the critical values of the transition parameter. Furthermore, we investigate the bifurcated behavior of the solution by analyzing the infinity norm for various values of the transition parameter. The outcomes of our study offer a robust and efficient method for tackling the 3D Bratu problem, making a significant contribution to the field of numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) where non-unique solutions are commonly encountered. Our algorithm&#39;s ability to produce accurate results for this challenging problem showcases its potential for broader applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains.},

The WG finite element method adopts locally piecewise polynomials of degree k for the approximation of the primal variable in the interior of elements, and piecewise polynomials of degree k + 1 k+1 for the weak derivatives. Theoretically, the optimal error estimates in both discrete H 1 H1 and standard L 2 L2 norms are derived.

The resistance distance among vertices u and v in a graph G is the effective resistance among the corresponding points in the given electrical network obtained from G by converting each edge of G with resistor of 1 ohm. The Kirchhoff index is the sum of resistance distance between all pairs of vertices of graph G . Chain of triangular bipyramid hexahedron structure which is a polyhedral graph has many applications in the area of reticular chemistry.

Firstly, the output regulation problem is transformed into a stabilization problem by using coordination transformation. The feedback control gain is computed directly by solving an optimization problem using input and state data. The feedforward control gain is obtained by using data-based solutions of regulator equations. Secondly, the design of a dynamic feedback controller is also explored within the framework of a data-driven strategy. Thirdly, two algorithms corresponding to the optimal and dynamic data-driven output regulation problems are developed to implement the proposed data-driven method.

  abstract     = {This article presents the problem of distributed training with a decentralized execution policy as a safe, optimal formation control for a heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent system. The control objective is to guarantee safety while achieving optimal performance. This objective is achieved by introducing novel distributed optimization problems with cost and local control barrier functions (CBFs). Designing an optimal formation controller is defined as optimal performance and modeled by a cost function. A local CBF trains a safe controller to ensure multi-agent systems operate within the safe regions. Instead of optimizing constrained optimization problems, this method generates safe, optimal controllers from unconstrained optimization problems by utilizing local CBFs. As a result, the presented approach has a lower computational cost than constrained optimization problems. It is proven that the proposed controller&#39;s optimality and stability are not affected by adding the local CBF to the cost function. A safe, optimal policy is iteratively derived using a new off-policy multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that does not need knowledge of the agents&#39; dynamics. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulation of the collision-free problem of the multi-quadrotor formation control.},

  abstract     = {With the development of urban architecture, the growing demand for larger public buildings is becoming challenging for indoor human evacuation under emergencies such as fires. However, the indoor fire evacuation behaviour of heterogeneous crowds when including individuals with disabilities have not been adequately explained. Therefore, this paper aims to study indoor evacuation characteristics of a crowd involving individuals with different types of disabilities (i.e., individuals on crutches and wheelchair users) through a modified social force model. The computation and simulation is performed in a room with an exit in 15 scenarios involving varying number of agents (i.e., 20, 40 and 60). The real-time trajectories and coordinates of agents are obtained. It is found that with an increase in the proportion of pedestrians with disabilities, individual evacuation time of agents increases. This tendency is consistent with results obtained from a previously controlled experiment. The average evacuation speed of agents is negatively impacted by the mixture proportion of individuals with disabilities. The fundamental diagrams acquired from the simulation are similar with the experimental results. Furthermore, it is discovered that the presence of individuals of disabilities in a scenario triggers higher crowd pressure compared to scenarios involving all non-disabled individuals. With an increase in the proportion of pedestrians with disabilities, the crowd danger of agents increases, as also consistent with the experimental findings. These findings are helpful for computer-aided safe evacuation design to decrease heterogeneous crowd congestion during in-building fire evacuation.},

  abstract     = {The theory of inverse location involves modifying parameters in such a way that the total cost is minimized and one/several prespecified facilities become optimal based on these perturbed parameters. When the modifying parameters are grouped into sets, with each group&#39;s cost measured under the rectilinear norm and the overall cost measured under the Chebyshev norm, the resulting problem is known as the max-sum inverse location problem. This paper addresses the max-sum inverse median location problem on trees with a budget constraint, where the objective is to modify the vertex weights so that a specified vertex becomes a 1-median, while minimizing the max-sum objective within the available budget. To solve this problem, a uni-variable optimization problem is first induced, where the objective function for each specified value of the variable can be obtained through a continuous knapsack problem. Leveraging the monotonicity of the cost function, a combinatorial algorithm is developed, which solves the problem in O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) time, where n denotes the number of vertices present in the tree.},

An interesting phenomenon is that we find the transition points of the global threshold from increasing to decreasing, which was not mentioned in previous work.

  abstract     = {The asymptotic stability and long time decay rates of solutions to linear Caputo time-fractional ordinary differential equations are known to be completely determined by the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrices. Very different from the exponential decay of solutions to classical ordinary differential equations, solutions of time-fractional ordinary differential equations decay only polynomially, leading to the so-called Mittag-Leffler stability, which were already extended to linear fractional delay differential equations (FDDEs) with real constants by Čermák et al. (2017) [17] . This paper is devoted to the asymptotical stability and long time decay rates of the solutions for a class of fractional delay abstract evolution equations with complex-valued coefficients. By applying the spectral decomposition method, we reformulate the fractional delay abstract evolution equations to an infinite-dimensional FDDEs. Through the root locus technique, we develop a necessary and sufficient stability condition in a coefficient criterion for FDDEs. At the same time, we are able to deal with the awful singularities caused by delay and fractional exponent by introducing a novel integral path, and hence to give an accurate estimation for the fractional resolvent operators. We show that the long time decay rates of the solutions for both linear FDDEs and fractional delay abstract evolution equations with complex-valued coefficients are O ( t − α ) . Finally, several application models including both time and time-space fractional Schrödinger equations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed criteria.},

In general, the number of states of the network grows exponentially with its size, and a master equation description suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Almost all methods widely used in practice are versions of the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which is notoriously known for its slow convergence. In this paper we numerically solve the chemical master equation for an SIR model on a general network using recently proposed tensor product algorithms. In numerical experiments we show that tensor product algorithms converge much faster than SSA and deliver more accurate results, which becomes particularly important for uncovering the probabilities of rare events, e.g. for number of infected people to exceed a (high) threshold.},

Firstly, the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed based on the state vectors of the third order integral inequalities. Then, by introducing two sets of state vectors, the LKF derivative is presented as the quadratic and quintic polynomials of the delay, respectively. Next, the new quadratic and quintic polynomial negative definite conditions (NDCs) are proposed to set up the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In addition, based on the same LKF and third order integral inequalities, this paper proves that the introduction of extra state vectors increases the conservatism of the derived stability conditions. Eventually, the advantages of the provided conditions are illustrated by several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We propose two conservative fourth-order compact finite difference (CFD4C) schemes and give the rigorous error analysis for the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system (KGZS) with ε ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] being a small parameter. In the case 0 &lt; ε ≪ 1 , i.e., the subsonic limit regime, the solution of KGZS propagates waves with wavelength O ( ε ) in time and O ( 1 ) in space, respectively, with amplitude at O ( ε α † ) with α † = min ⁡ { α , β + 1 , 2 } , where α and β describe the incompatibility between the initial data of the KGZS and the limiting Klein-Gordon equation (KGE) as ε → 0 + and satisfy α ≥ 0 , β + 1 ≥ 0 . Different from the standard KGZS, the oscillation in time becomes the main difficulty in constructing numerical schemes and giving the error analysis for KGZS in this regime. We prove that the schemes conserve the discrete energies. By defining a discrete ‘energy’, applying cut-off technique and considering the convergence rate of the KGZS to the limiting KGE, we obtain two independent error estimates with the bounds at O ( h 4 / ε 1 − α ⁎ + τ 2 / ε 3 − α † ) and O ( h 4 + τ 2 + ε α ⁎ ) where α ⁎ = min ⁡ { 1 , α , 1 + β } , τ is time step and h is mesh size. Hence, we get uniformly accurate error estimates with the bounds at O ( h 4 + τ 2 / ( 4 − α † ) ) when α ≥ 1 and β ≥ 0 , and O ( h 4 α ⁎ + τ 2 α ⁎ / 3 ) when 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 or − 1 &lt; β &lt; 0 . While for α = 0 or β = − 1 , the meshing requirements of CFD4Cs are h = O ( ε 1 / 4 ) and τ = O ( ε 3 / 2 ) for 0 &lt; ε ≪ 1 . The compact schemes provide much better spatial resolution compared with the usual second order finite difference schemes. Our numerical results support energy-conserving properties and the results of the convergence analysis.},

However, combination of both approaches leads to splines defined over mixed triangle and quadrilateral meshes using the isogeometric approach. Mixed meshes are especially useful for representing complicated geometries obtained e.g. from trimming. As (bi-)linearly parameterized mesh elements are not flexible enough to cover smooth domains, we focus in this work on the case of planar mixed meshes parameterized by (bi-)quadratic geometry mappings. In particular we study in detail the space of C 1 C1 -smooth isogeometric spline functions of general polynomial degree over two such mixed mesh elements. We present the theoretical framework to analyze the smoothness conditions over the common interface for all possible configurations of mesh elements. This comprises the investigation of the dimension as well as the construction of a basis of the corresponding C 1 C1 -smooth isogeometric spline space over the domain described by two elements.
