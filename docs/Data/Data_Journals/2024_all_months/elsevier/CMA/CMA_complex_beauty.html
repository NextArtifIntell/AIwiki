Our approach incorporates water height and pollutant concentration constraints within the same discretization, utilizing weak monotonicity and a simple bound-preserving limiter while preserving the well-balanced property.

This work proposes a monolithic strategy for solving the equations of motion for both the fluid and structural domains under the unique Lagrangian framework of the B-spline material point method (BSMPM). A node-based density smoothing BSMPM (referred to as ds-BSMPM) is proposed to eliminate pressure instability and oscillation in the simulation of weakly compressible fluids, which is straightforwardly implemented using B-spline basis functions without the need for any sophisticated particle search algorithm. The interaction between the fluid and structure is conducted using the Lagrangian multiplier method on the tensor product grid, whose actual position is determined by the Greville abscissa and is used to detect contact. The proposed method is verified and validated against existing numerical approaches and experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating the oscillations of water pressure and solid stress, and avoiding premature and erroneous contact. In particular, this work presents a promising monolithic approach for achieving high-fidelity solutions to complex FSI problems.},

However, this nonlocal formulation significantly increases the computational cost in numerical simulations, necessitating the development of efficient and accurate time integration schemes. Inspired by the newly developed generalized scalar auxiliary variable (GSAV) method in Refs. [8] , [24] for dissipative systems, this paper uses the GSAV approach to construct linearly-implicit energy-preserving schemes for nonlocal wave systems. The developed numerical schemes only require solving linear equations with constant coefficients at each time step and are more efficient than the original SAV schemes [30] for wave equations. We also discuss the unique solvability, conduct a rigorous error analysis, and present numerical examples to demonstrate the accuracy, conservation and effectiveness of the obtained schemes.},

To demonstrate the advantages of the particle method under consideration, a comparison with other numerical methods for viscous compressible fluid models is provided. Since the solutions of the macroscopic traffic model can be approximated by the solutions of a reduced model consisting of a single nonlinear heat-type partial differential equation, the numerical solutions produced by the particle method are also compared with the numerical solutions of the reduced model. Finally, a traffic simulation scenario and a comparison with the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model are provided, illustrating the advantages of the use of automated vehicles.},

The fully discrete scheme developed here is employed by the stabilizing strategy, implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme and a rotational pressure-correction method. One particular feature of the scheme is adding a stabilization term artificially in the conservation of charge density equation to decouple the computations of velocity field from electric field, which can be treated as a first-order perturbation term for balancing the explicit treatment of the coupling term. We rigorously prove the unique solvability, unconditional energy stability and error estimates of the proposed scheme.

Progress in this area of mathematical modelling would contribute to a sustainable future manufacturing involving high temperature and phase change. Accurately predicting phase-change interface is the crucial step for these applications in non-grey semi-transparent media. In the present study, the conduction and radiation effects are analyzed by a set of nonlinear partial differential equations and a linear integral equation, respectively. The proposed model forms a system of nonlinear integro-differential equations and it accounts for both thermal radiation and phase change in the design. For non-grey media, the spectrum is divided into a sequence of finite intervals of frequency bands with averaged absorption coefficients resulting in coupled systems to be solved for each frequency band. The coupled equations are approximated using a second-order method in both time and space. Using discrete ordinates for the angular discretization of the integral equation for the radiation effects, a Newton-type algorithm is used to deal with the nonlinear systems. Numerical results are presented for several test problems in both grey and non-grey media, and comparisons to simulations without radiation are also shown in this study. The findings here could be used to understand effects of thermal radiation in non-grey absorbing and emitting media under phase change.},

Based on the First-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and domain decomposition method (DDM), the theoretical model of spherical shell structure is established. The improved Jacobi polynomial is innovatively used to construct the displacement tolerance function of the spherical shell. Based on the spectral Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral formula, the theoretical model of the acoustic fluid outside the spherical shell is established. The special form of Jacobi polynomial Chebyshev polynomial is used to describe the excitation sound pressure on the spherical shell segment, so as to ensure that the generalized coordinates of the structure can be perfectly matched with the acoustic boundary element nodes. In addition, the integration along the meridian of the shell is used to control the movement of the fluid, which simplifies the surface integration. The CHIEF method is used to solve the problem of non-unique solution of acoustic variables of rotary structure. Compared with the published literature, numerical simulation results and experimental results, the proposed method has higher calculation accuracy. In addition, based on this method, the influence of boundary conditions, geometric dimensions and other factors on the acoustic and vibration characteristics of spherical shells is discussed, which accumulates data for analyzing the acoustic and vibration behavior of spherical shells.},

  abstract     = {The behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids, and their interaction with other fluid phases and components, is of interest in a diverse range of scientific and engineering problems. In the context of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), both non-Newtonian rheology and multiphase flows have received significant attention in the literature. This study builds on that work by presenting the development and validation of a phase-field LBM which combines these features in three-dimensional flows. Specifically, the model presented herein combines the simulation of Herschel-Bulkley fluids, which exhibit both a yield stress and power-law dependence on shear rate, interacting with a Newtonian fluid. The developed model is verified and validated using a diverse set of rheological properties and flow conditions, which in their totality represent an additional contribution of this work. Comparison with steady-state layered Poiseuille flow, where one fluid is Newtonian and the other is non-Newtonian, showed excellent correlation with the corresponding analytic solution. Validation against analytic solutions for the rise of a power-law fluid in a capillary tube also showed good correlation, but highlighted some sensitivity to initial conditions and high velocities occurring early in the simulation. A demonstration of the model in a microfluidic junction highlighted how non-Newtonian rheology can alter behaviour from cases where only Newtonian fluids are present. It also showed that significant changes in behaviour can occur when making small and smooth changes in non-Newtonian parameters. To summarise, this work broadens the range of physical phenomena that can be captured in computational analysis of complex fluid flows using the LBM.},

Our approach introduces a new fast tempered F λ L 2 − 1 σ difference method, achieving a higher convergence rate of order O ( Δ t 3 − α ) . Specifically, we apply this method to a class of two-dimensional tempered-fractional reaction-advection-subdiffusion equations (2D-TF-RASDE) characterized by the tempered parameter λ and a tempered fractional derivative of order α , (where 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 ). The novel fast tempered scheme is based on the sum of exponents (SOE) technique. Additionally, we develop a novel high order compact finite difference (CFD) scheme using an alternating direction implicit (ADI) formulation for the 2D-TF-RASDE. We investigate the stability and convergence of this FL λ 2 − 1 σ -ADI-CD scheme. Numerical simulations reveal a convergence order of O ( Δ t 1 + α + h ϰ 4 + h y 4 + ϵ ) under robust regularity assumptions underlining the scheme&#39;s superior computational efficiency. Furthermore, our computational results align well with theoretical analysis, demonstrating both accuracy and reduced computational complexity and storage requirements as compared to the standard tempered L λ 2 − 1 σ -ADI-CD scheme. Notably, the fast tempered FL λ 2 − 1 σ -ADI-CD scheme exhibits competitive performance and reduced CPU time relative to the standard L λ 2 − 1 σ -ADI-CD scheme, thereby offering a distinct advantage for efficiently solving complex fractional differential equations.},

The time derivative is treated by Crank-Nicolson (CN) method and the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) integral by product integration (PI) rule on graded meshes. The linear interpolation combining with Taylor formula is applied in time to deal with nonlinear term v ∇ v in interval ( t 0 , t 1 ) , and linear interpolation concerning two previous time points is employed to deal with v ∇ v in intervals ( t n − 1 , t n ) , n ≥ 2 . A linearized semi-discrete scheme is obtained, which can achieve second-order convergence in time. Then via introducing two kinds of compact difference operators to discretize the spatial derivatives. To improve the computing efficiency, we construct a ADI compact difference method. It is the first time that the ADI compact difference method is applied for the nonlinear 2D and 3D PIDE with a WSK. The advantage of our proposed scheme is that it not only has second-order accuracy in time and fourth-order accuracy in space, but also fast computational speed, just by solving the linear coupled equations for tridiagonal matrices. In addition, we prove the existence, uniqueness and convergence of 2D scheme. Four numerical examples in 2D and 3D are present to demonstrate our proposed method.},

The schemes are based on Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Legendre rules. We show that taking a number of quadrature points slightly exceeding the polynomial degree is enough to preserve root exponential convergence. The total number of algebraic operations to set up the system is O ( N 5 / 2 ) , where N is the problem size. Numerical examples illustrate the analysis. We also extend our analysis to the fractional Laplacian in higher dimensions for hp -finite element spaces based on shape regular meshes.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a topology optimization model for designing devices that operate with multiple relative velocities considering turbulent compressible flows is proposed. The model consists of the Favre-averaged Navier-stokes equations in an axisymmetric domain coupled with a continuous boundary propagation model. The propagation is used to impose different solid behaviors based on which wall it is connected to, for example, solid material in contact with a rotating shaft will have a rotational velocity, while material encrusted in the support will have zero absolute velocity. The implementation is composed of a segregated solver with steps for the FANS equations, the k − ϵ turbulent equations, and the propagation model. The sensitivity is obtained with automatic differentiation of the adjoint method and an internal point optimizer is used to update the design variable. A study case of a labyrinth seal is defined to illustrate the methodology by using three different objective functions, maximization of radial velocity, static pressure change rate, and vorticity. The results are designs for small-scale labyrinth seals in real operation conditions.},

In this study, a phase-field lattice-Boltzmann model, accelerated by state-of-the-art parallel-adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, is solved to investigate the morphological evolution of the Mg-Gd dendrite under convection. The lengths of the dendrite primary arms are quantified to analyze the asymmetric dendrite patterns under convection. The effects of the multiple factors including the orientation angle, the flow intensity, and the undercooling are elucidated, and the relation between the length ratios and the three independent factors is established through multiple regression analysis. The upstream-downstream arm length difference and the included angle between the primary arms are characterized to illustrate the effect of convection on the evolution of the Mg-Gd dendrite. The 3D morphological selection, together with algorithm performance tests, is further discussed to elucidate the change of morphological symmetry under different growth conditions and to demonstrate the robustness of the numerical scheme. Deep understanding of the synergy between convection-induced solute transport and undercooling-driven growth, which largely determines the morphological selection, can assist guidance for the prediction and control of the magnesium alloy microstructures.},

Its original architecture explicitly takes into account the boundary conditions, a critical pre-requisite for physical applications, and is able to adapt to any initially provided solution. Ψ-GNN is trained using a physics-informed loss, and the training process is stable by design. Furthermore, the consistency of the approach is theoretically proven, and its flexibility and generalization efficiency are experimentally demonstrated: the same learned model can accurately handle unstructured meshes of various sizes, as well as different boundary conditions. To the best of our knowledge, Ψ-GNN is the first physics-informed GNN-based method that can handle various unstructured domains, boundary conditions and initial solutions while also providing convergence guarantees.},

  abstract     = {Cerebral aneurysms represent a life-threatening condition associated with considerable morbidity and mortality rates. The formation of cerebral aneurysms is influenced by various factors, including vessel geometry, blood flow characteristics, and hemodynamic forces. In this study, we investigate the impact of vessel geometry on the formation of cerebral aneurysms utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for multi-phase blood flow models. More precisely, we employ the Finite Volume Method to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations for simulating blood flow. To accurately capture the intricate nature of blood behavior, we utilize a multiphase blood flow model, as blood consists of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets suspended in the blood plasma. Our results demonstrate that the local curvature of the vessel has a pronounced effect on the blood flow patterns and hemodynamic forces within the vessel. Specifically, our simulations indicate that an increase in vessel curvature can lead to the formation of regions of high stress and flow stagnation, both of which are known to be associated with an increased risk of aneurysm formation. The current study provides significant insights into the impact of vessel geometry on the formation of cerebral aneurysms. The obtained results may aid in designing treatment and preventive strategies for cerebral aneurysms, while also contributing to the existing body of knowledge on the subject. Additionally, the approach developed in this study can be applied to investigate various other vascular pathologies, including arterial stenosis and atherosclerosis.},

Each module is a generic parametric solution considering parametric geometry, material and boundary conditions. By assembling these modules and satisfying continuity constraints at the interfaces, a parametric surrogate model of the full problem can be obtained. In the present paper, the PGD technique in connection with NURBS geometry representation is used to create a parametric model for each module. In this technique, the NURBS objects allow to map the governing boundary value problem from a parametric non-regular domain into a regular reference domain and the PGD is used to create a reduced model in the reference domain. In the assembly stage, an optimization problem is solved to satisfy the continuity constraints at the interfaces. The proposed procedure is based on the offline–online paradigm: the offline stage consists of creating multiple pre-solved modules which can be afterwards assembled in almost real-time during the online stage, enabling quick evaluations of the full system response. To show the potential of the proposed approach some numerical examples in heat conduction and structural plates under bending are presented.},

To discrete the constrained governing system of nonlinear multi-component flows, the splitting improved upwind finite difference scheme is developed for multicomponent PDEs system involving nonlinear chemical reactions of multicomponent pollutants and the pollutant injected rates on the upper part boundary. We employ the differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm to solve the optimization. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by analyzing the flow simulation on a simple geometric aquifer and identifying the optimal injection rates by minimizing the concentration derivation and the abatement costs. We also investigate the simulation of the contamination flow in a more realistic-shaped aquifer, which further validates our model&#39;s robustness and efficacy.

A special contribution of this work is to prove that the error in L 2 -norm for smooth eigenfunctions is of higher order than that in mesh-dependent norm, so that the DG eigenvalues can approximate the true eigenvalues from upper. Another contribution of this work is to provide a-posteriori error analysis for the DG method. A reliable a-posteriori error estimator is analyzed.

The high-order explicit first stage, specifically the singly diagonal implicit Runge–Kutta (ESDIRK) method, is employed for time integration, where the pseudo-transient continuation is integrated with the restarted generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method to handle the solution of nonlinear equations at each stage of ESDIRK, excluding the initial stage. Relying on smoothness indicators, we carry out the refinement/coarsening process for p -adaptation with dynamic load balancing. This approach involves a coarse level (distributed memory) decomposition based on MPI paradigm and a fine level (shared memory) decomposition based on OpenMP paradigm, enhancing parallel efficiency. Dynamic load balancing is achieved by computing weights based on degrees of freedom, ensuring balanced computational loads across processors. The parallel computing framework adopts either a graph-based type (ParMETIS and Zoltan) or space-filling curves type (GeMPa) for coarse level partitioning, and a graph-based type (METIS and Zoltan) for fine level partitioning. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical examples, highlighting its potential to significantly improve the scalability and efficiency of compressible flow simulations.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the first numerical attempt on fourth-order interface problems on surfaces. A mixed immersed surface finite element method based on Ciarlet-Raviart formulation is proposed for solving the problem with three types of boundary conditions. One important advantage of this method is that it can avoid the generation of complex body-fitting surface meshes. The immersed surface finite element space is given based on the mixed formulation. By modifying the representation of numerical solutions, the method is extended to solve the fourth-order interface problem with nonhomogeneous flux jump conditions. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed method.},

Shape transformation has been achieved using phase-field models. However, previous phase-field models have intrinsic drawbacks, such as shrinkage due to motion by mean curvature and unwanted growth. To overcome these drawbacks associated with previous models, we propose a novel phase-field model that eliminates these shortcomings. The proposed phase-field model is based on the Allen–Cahn (AC) equation with nonstandard mobility and a nonlinear source term. To numerically and efficiently solve the proposed phase-field equation, we adopt an operator splitting method, which consists of the AC equation with a nonstandard mobility and a fidelity equation. The modified AC equation is solved using a fully explicit finite difference method with a time step that ensures stability. For solving the fidelity equation, we use a semi-implicit scheme with a frozen coefficient. We have performed several numerical experiments with various 3D sources and target shapes to verify the robustness and efficacy of our proposed mathematical model and its numerical method.},

  abstract     = {Conventional freeze-drying takes a long drying time and makes the process expensive. High-quality biological materials, medicine, and vaccines may not find easy acceptance with this technology. To overcome the operative time, several engineering innovations are carried out. A long drying time during freeze-drying can be minimized by accelerating the sublimation rate. Obtaining a fast drying rate without harming the material properties is the prime focus of the accelerated freeze-drying ( AFD ) like-techniques. In connection with this, the study of temperature-dependent thermal-physical properties of the medium during sublimation is considered in this study. For example, a temperature-dependent volumetric heat source is assumed within the vapor region. An increase in the temperature field results in higher pressure. Therefore, a temperature-dependent specific heat of vapor pressure is also accounted for. Furthermore, the permeability of the medium and the specific heat of the water vapor are also assumed to be temperature-dependent. Exploring realistic theoretical models with variable-dependent characteristics and convection is essential since the experimental investigation of sublimation in a porous media may be challenging. Despite the previous available studies on sublimation heat and mass transfer, there is still a lack of mathematical modeling of this particular problem. To solve this non-linear sublimation problem, the Genocchi operational matrix of differentiation method ( G O M O D ) method is employed to obtain the numerical results. In case of full non-linear model, results obtained via current numerical technique are verified with finite-difference method ( FDM ). Furthermore, in a particular case, the accuracy test of the G O M O D method against FDM is presented, and it is found that the current numerical technique is more accurate than FDM . In the current study, it is found that a temperature-dependent heat source offers a faster sublimation rate than a constant one. Similarly, temperature-dependent specific heat of vapor pressure accelerates the pressure distribution within the sublimated region. With temperature-dependent permeability, the concentration distribution within the medium decreases. Moreover, the temperature-dependent specific heat of water vapor delayed the sublimation rate. Results found from this study are expected to aid in AFD techniques, food industry and pharmaceuticals.},

The method is applied to predict underwater acoustic propagation induced by structural vibrations in diverse ocean environments, including the unbounded ocean, deep ocean, and shallow ocean. In the hybrid method, PIKFNN is regarded as an improved shallow physics-informed neural network (PINN) in which the activation function in the PINN is replaced with a physics-informed kernel function (PIKF). This ensures the integration of prior physical information into the neural network model. Moreover, PIKFNN circumvents embedding the governing equations into the loss function in the PINN and requires only training on boundary data. By using Green&#39;s function as PIKF and the structural-acoustic coupling response information obtained from the FEM as training data, PIKFNN can inherently capture the Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity, which are naturally suitable for predicting ocean acoustic propagation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of FEM-PIKFNN in comparison with analytical solutions and finite element results.},

  abstract     = {The discrete velocity method (DVM) for rarefied flows and the unified methods (based on the DVM framework) for flows in all regimes, from continuum one to free molecular one, have worked well as precise flow solvers over the past decades and have been successfully extended to other important physical fields. Both DVM and unified methods endeavor to model the gas-gas interaction physically. However, for the gas-surface interaction (GSI) at the wall boundary, they have only use the full accommodation boundary up to now, which can be viewed as a rough Maxwell boundary with a fixed accommodation coefficient (AC) at unity, deviating from the real value. For example, the AC for metal materials typically falls in the range of 0.8 to 0.9. To overcome this bottleneck and extend the DVM and unified methods to more physical boundary conditions, an algorithm for Maxwell boundary with an adjustable AC is established into the DVM framework. The Maxwell boundary model splits the distribution of the bounce-back molecules into specular ones and Maxwellian (normal) ones. Since the bounce-back molecules after the spectral reflection does not math with the discrete velocity space (DVS), both macroscopic conservation (from numerical quadrature) and microscopic consistency in the DVS are hard to achieve in the DVM framework. In this work, this problem is addressed by employing a combination of interpolation methods for mismatch points in DVS and an efficient numerical error correction method for micro-macro consistency. On the other hand, the current Maxwell boundary for DVM takes the generality into consideration, accommodating both the recently developed efficient unstructured velocity space and the traditional Cartesian velocity space. Moreover, the proposed algorithm allows for calculations of both monatomic gases and diatomic gases with internal degrees in DVS. Finally, by being integrated with the unified gas-kinetic scheme within the DVM framework, the performance of the present GSI algorithm is validated through a series of benchmark numerical tests across a wide range of Knudsen numbers.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are interested in the mathematical properties of methods based on a fictitious domain approach combined with reduced-order interface coupling conditions, which have been recently introduced to simulate 3D-1D fluid-structure or structure-structure coupled problems. To give insights on the approximation properties of these methods, we investigate them in a simplified setting by considering the Poisson problem in a two-dimensional domain with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on small inclusions. The approximated reduced problem is obtained using a fictitious domain approach combined with a projection on a Fourier finite-dimensional space of the Lagrange multiplier associated to the Dirichlet boundary constraints, obtaining in this way a Poisson problem with defective interface conditions. After analyzing the existence of a solution of the reduced problem, we prove its convergence towards the original full problem, when the size of the holes tends towards zero, with a rate which depends on the number of modes of the finite-dimensional space. In particular, our estimates highlight the fact that to obtain a good convergence on the Lagrange multiplier, one needs to consider more modes than the first Fourier mode (constant mode). This is a key issue when one wants to deal with real coupled problems, such as fluid-structure problems for instance. Next, the numerical discretization of the reduced problem using the finite element method is analyzed in the case where the computational mesh does not fit the small inclusion interface. As is standard for these types of problem, the convergence of the solution is not optimal due to the lack of regularity of the solution. Moreover, convergence exhibits a well-known locking effect when the mesh size and the inclusion size are of the same order of magnitude. This locking effect is more apparent when increasing the number of modes and affects the Lagrange multiplier convergence rate more heavily. To resolve these issues, we propose and analyze a stabilized method and an enriched method for which additional basis functions are added without changing the approximation space of the Lagrange multiplier. Finally, the properties of numerical strategies are illustrated by numerical experiments.},

By introducing some stabilization terms and penalty terms, as well as some special terms defined on non-cut edges of interface elements in the discrete bilinear form, we prove the discrete inf-sup condition and obtain optimal error estimates. It is shown that all results are not only independent of the mesh size and the viscosity coefficient, but also the interface position.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear time-fractional diffusion problems, a significant class of parabolic-type problems, appear in various diffusion phenomena that seem extensively in nature. Such physical problems arise in numerous fields, such as phase transition, filtration, biochemistry, and dynamics of biological groups. Because of its massive involvement, its accurate solutions have become a challenging task among researchers. In this framework, this article proposed two operational-based robust iterative spectral schemes for accurate solutions of the nonlinear time-fractional diffusion problems. Temporal and spatial variables are approximated using Vieta-Lucas polynomials, and derivative operators are approximated using novel operational matrices. The approximated solution, novel operational matrices, and uniform collection points convert the problem into a system of nonlinear equations. Here, two robust methods, namely Picard&#39;s iterative and Newton&#39;s, are incorporated to tackle a nonlinear system of equations. Some problems are considered in authenticating the present methods&#39; accuracy, credibility, and reliability. An inclusive comparative study demonstrates that the proposed computational schemes are effective, accurate, and well-matched to find the numerical solutions to the problems mentioned above. The proposed methods improve the accuracy of numerical solutions from 27 % to 100 % when M &gt; 2 as compared to the existing results. The suggested methods&#39; convergence, error bound, and stability are investigated theoretically and numerically.},

Collocation and Galerkin methods are applied. In the interest of increasing the efficiency of the boundary element method, a low-rank approximation such as the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) is carried out. We discuss a generalisation of the ACA to approximate a three-dimensional array of data, i.e., usual boundary element matrices at several complex frequencies. This method is used within the generalised convolution quadrature (gCQ) method to obtain a real time domain formulation. The behaviour of the proposed method is studied with three examples, a unit cube, a unit cube with a reentrant corner, and a unit ball. The properties of the method are preserved in the data sparse representation and a significant reduction in storage is obtained.},

Real-world engineering problems involve diverse materials, elements, and connectivity relationships, making it difficult for iterative methods to handle their global stiffness matrices. Direct methods, owing to their robustness, emerge as the preferred choice. In this paper, a novel block-based supernodal LDL T numerical factorization method is introduced. The computational process is disassembled into distinct tasks, and the dependency relationships between these tasks are expressed via a directed acyclic graph to guide the calculation sequence. Based on this approach, a global task pool and local task stack are established to store task queues, enhancing data reuse and multicore collaboration efficiency. Additionally, an effective task dispatch and work-stealing mechanism is implemented to prevent performance degradation caused by load imbalances. Numerical experiments, including a publicly available matrix test set and real-world engineering finite element problems, are conducted to compare the parallel performances of the Pardiso, MUMPS, and proposed solver. The results illustrate that the proposed solver performs significantly better than the other solvers when handling various types of sparse matrices and diverse architectures of multicore processors.},

The method has inherited the one-dimensional integral expression of Fourier symbols of the nonlocal diffusion operator from Fourier spectral methods for any d spatial dimensions. High precision of its solution can be achieved via a direct solver such as pivoted QR decomposition even though the corresponding system is extremely ill-conditioned, due to the redundancy in the frame. The extension of AZ algorithm improves the complexity of solving the rectangular linear system to O ( N log 2 ⁡ N ) for 1 d problems and O ( N 2 log 2 ⁡ N ) for 2 d problems, compared with O ( N 3 ) of the direct solvers, where N is the number of degrees of freedom.

In practical computations, inaccuracies in model parameters and initial conditions can introduce observation errors, even leading to inaccurate results. To enhance the precision and efficiency of the numerical simulation, the data assimilation method with parallel simulation are considered in this study. Firstly, based on the phase-field dendritic crystal growth model, a Lagrangian data assimilation method, which adds Lagrange multiplier terms into the phase-field partial differential equations (PDEs), is presented to integrate the observed data of physical information to modify the numerical solution, thereby improving simulation accuracy. Secondly, to achieve efficient data assimilation, a parallel directional operator splitting method is presented to solve the modified data assimilation PDEs. Thirdly, in the section of numerical experiments, we investigate the validity of the method and assess the impact of various factors such as the Lagrange multiplier parameter, spatio-temporal sampling rate and parameter perturbation ratio on the effectiveness of data assimilation. The evaluation is conducted for two distinct problem categories: initial observation errors and model parameter errors. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively assimilate experimental observations in simulations, thereby enhancing more accurate dendritic crystal growth processes.},

The paper presents a new three-dimensional (3D) peridynamic model to explore the localized explosive effects on composite plates. The study utilizes the peridynamic method to simulate fractures and deformations in composite plates when exposed to localized explosive blasts. Accurate prediction of composites&#39; performance during explosive blast events is crucial in the design process to avoid the deadly effects of their failures. This study highlights the following novelties: (1) We present, for the first time, a novel 3D mesh-free model to simulate the fracture and damage behavior of composite plates when exposed to explosive blasts; (2) The adopted numerical modeling technique enables highly efficient simulations of fractures and failures in composites when compared with other mesh-based numerical models; (3) We introduce a new mathematical framework to reflect the explosive pressure loads through different composite layers; (4) The study provides an accessible and efficient tool for engineers and researchers to enhance the design of composites in several industries instead relying on limited-access commercial software packages. In addition to the previous novelties, the paper presents a new parametric study that investigates the performance of several composite plates, such as titanium-aramid and aluminum-aramid composites, in explosive blast scenarios. Moreover, the roles of explosive mass and plate thickness in the failure mechanisms of composites are examined.},

The method is founded on a two-level decomposition of the approximation space, where a nonlinear artificial viscosity operator is exclusively added to the unresolved scales. It can be regarded as a self-adaptive method, since the amount of subgrid viscosity is automatically introduced according to the residual of the equation, in its strong form, associated with the resolved scales. Two variants for the subgrid viscosity are presented: one considering only the residual of the momentum equation and the other also incorporating the residual of the conservation of mass. To alleviate the computational cost typical of two-scale methods, the microscale space is defined through polynomial functions that vanish on the boundary of the elements, known as bubble functions. We compared the numerical and computational performance of the method with the results obtained by the Streamline-Upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) formulation combined with the Pressure Stabilizing/Petrov-Galerkin (PSPG) method through a set of 2D reference problems.},

The Cauchy problem under consideration is related to a real finite-dimensional Hilbert space and includes a self-adjoint operator that is both positive and definite. We introduce a transformative technique for converting the Cauchy problem incorporating memory, into a local evolutionary system of equations by approximating the difference kernel using the sum of exponentials (SoE) approach. A second-order explicit scheme is then constructed to solve the local system. We thoroughly investigate the stability of this explicit scheme, and present the necessary conditions for the stability of the scheme. Moreover, we extended our investigation to encompass time-fractional diffusion-wave equations (TFDWEs) involving a fractional Caputo derivative with an order ranging between (1,2). Initially, we transform the main TFDWE model into a new model that incorporates the fractional Riemann-Liouville integral. Subsequently, we expand the applicability of our idea to develop an explicit fast numerical algorithm for approximating the model. The stability properties of this fast scheme for solving TFDWEs are assessed. Numerical simulations including a two-dimensional Cauchy problem as well as one-dimensional and two-dimensional TFDWE models are provided to validate the accuracy and experimental order of convergence of the schemes.},

Some results on the composite Laguerre-Legendre interpolation, which is a set of piecewise mixed interpolations coupled with domain decomposition, are introduced. As an important application, the composite spectral collocation scheme based on the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto and the Laguerre-Gauss-Radau nodes is provided for the exterior problems of the Fisher&#39;s equation. The convergence of the proposed scheme is proved. Efficient algorithm is implemented.

  abstract     = {For the time fractional Allen-Cahn equation, integration of the exponential scalar auxiliary variable (ESAV) time discretization with the virtual element method (VEM) spatial discretization leads to ESAV-VEM schemes on polygonal meshes. The resulting ESAV-VEM algorithms are linear and effective for the completely decoupled computations of the phase variable u and the auxiliary variable r . Based on the positive definiteness of variable-step discrete convolution kernels relevant to L1 and L1-CN time discretizations, the corresponding unconditionally energy boundedness results are proven on arbitrary nonuniform time meshes. By means of the discrete gradient structure of the temporal discretization operator, the discrete energy dissipation laws are developed via a unified framework. Moreover, the discrete energy decay nature coincides with the classical analogies as the fractional order tends to one. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

To address this issue, a novel numerical algorithm that enhances standard isogeometric analysis is proposed in this paper by using a single-patch graded mesh refinement scheme. Numerical tests demonstrate optimal convergence rates for both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Furthermore, the results show that smooth splines possess a superior approximation constant compared to their C 0 -continuous counterparts for the lower part of the Laplace spectrum. This is an extension of previous findings about excellent spectral approximation properties of smooth splines on rectangular domains to circular sectors. In addition, graded meshes prove to be particularly advantageous for an accurate approximation of a limited number of eigenvalues. Finally, a hierarchical mesh structure is presented to avoid anisotropic elements in the physical domain and to omit redundant degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the singularity. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of hierarchical mesh grading for simulating eigenfunctions of low and high regularity.},

  abstract     = {Helmholtz decompositions of the elastic fields open up new avenues for the solution of linear elastic scattering problems via boundary integral equations (BIE) (Dong et al. (2021) [20] ). The main appeal of this approach is that the ensuing systems of BIE feature only integral operators associated with the Helmholtz equation. However, these BIE involve non standard boundary integral operators that do not result after the application of either the Dirichlet or the Neumann trace to Helmholtz single and double layer potentials. Rather, the Helmholtz decomposition approach leads to BIE formulations of elastic scattering problems with Neumann boundary conditions that involve boundary traces of the Hessians of Helmholtz layer potential. As a consequence, the classical combined field approach applied in the framework of the Helmholtz decompositions leads to BIE formulations which, although robust, are not of the second kind. Following the regularizing methodology introduced in Boubendir et al. (2015) [6] we design and analyze novel robust Helmholtz decomposition BIE for the solution of elastic scattering that are of the second kind in the case of smooth scatterers in two dimensions. We present a variety of numerical results based on Nyström discretizations that illustrate the good performance of the second kind regularized formulations in connections to iterative solvers.},

Introducing a vorticity variable enables construction of H 1 − conforming VEM spaces for both stream function and vorticity and circumventing stringent C 1 − continuity constraints. The proposed method provides an initial exploration of stream function-vorticity discretizations on general polygonal meshes using the flexible VEM of arbitrary order. Existence and uniqueness of discrete solutions are established theoretically under a small data assumption. Optimal error estimates are then derived in the energy norm for the stream function, H 1 − norm for the stream function and L 2 − norm for the vorticity, rigorously demonstrating convergence. Numerical results validate the error analysis and illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the mixed VEM for simulation of incompressible flows on complex geometries.},

Our present model is derived from the Francfort–Marigo energy with the Ambrosio–Tortorelli regularization, and thermal energy. Our study aims to numerically investigate the thermal response in materials due to crack growth using the proposed model. In the numerical method, we apply the adaptive finite element method because the mesh needs to be fine enough to capture the damage variable z . Several interesting numerical examples are demonstrated, such as Mode I crack propagation and scalar Mode III crack propagation in non-isothermal and adiabatic processes.

  abstract     = {Simulations of large-scale dynamical systems require expensive computations and large amounts of storage. Low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional states such as in reduced order models deriving from, say, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) trade in a reduced model complexity against accuracy and can be a solution to lessen the computational burdens. However, for really low-dimensional parametrizations of the states as they may be needed for example for controller design, linear methods like the POD come to their natural limits so that nonlinear approaches will be the methods of choice. In this work, we propose a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) consisting of a nonlinear encoder and an affine linear decoder and consider a deep clustering model where a CAE is integrated with k-means clustering for improved encoding performance. The proposed set of methods is compared to the standard POD approach in three scenarios: single- and double-cylinder wakes modeled by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and flow setup described by viscous Burgers&#39; equations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a least-square finite difference-based physics-informed neural network (LSFD-PINN) is proposed to simulate steady incompressible flows. The original PINN employs the automatic differentiation (AD) method to compute differential operators. However, the AD method, which is essentially based on the chain rule, requires a series of matrix operations to obtain derivatives during the training process. This may reduce computational efficiency, especially for large-scale networks. Additionally, the AD method still needs to compute lower-order derivative terms even if the partial differential equation (PDE) involves only higher-order derivatives, leading to unnecessary calculations. Although conventional finite difference (FD) methods can effectively mitigate these limitations, they only consider information in a single direction. Moreover, they require introducing extra virtual collocation points for each collocation point to assist in computing differential operators when using randomly distributed collocation points. This increases the computational effort and storage requirements, especially in scenarios involving high-order discretization schemes or a large number of collocation points. To address these issues, we introduced the least squares finite difference (LSFD) method to calculate the differential operators required in PINN. Compared to the AD method, the LSFD method relies only on the network&#39;s output for calculating derivatives, thus avoiding a series of matrix operations. In comparison to the FD method, the LSFD not only considers multi-directional information but also can be applied to random point distributions without the need for introducing virtual points. To demonstrate its effectiveness, LSFD-PINN is tested on representative problems such as lid-driven cavity flow, flow around a backward-facing step, and flow around a circular cylinder in a pipe. Numerical results indicate that LSFD-PINN achieves satisfactory accuracy without any labeled data, significantly outperforming AD-PINN and FD-PINN, especially in high Reynolds number flows. Additionally, the computational efficiency of LSFD-PINN is superior to that of AD-PINN.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a novel approach for the design of high order general boundary conditions when approximating solutions of the Euler equations on domains with curved boundaries, using meshes which may not be boundary conformal. When dealing with curved boundaries and/or unfitted discretizations, the consistency of boundary conditions is a well-known challenge, especially in the context of high order schemes. In order to tackle such consistency problems, the so-called Reconstruction for Off-site Data (ROD) method has been recently introduced in the finite volume framework: it is based on performing a boundary polynomial reconstruction that embeds the considered boundary treatment thanks to the implementation of a constrained minimization problem. This work is devoted to the development of the ROD approach in the context of discontinuous finite elements. We use the genuine space-time nature of the local ADER predictors to reformulate the ROD as a single space-time reconstruction procedure. This allows us to avoid a new reconstruction (linear system inversion) at each sub-time node and retrieve a single space-time polynomial that embeds the considered boundary conditions for the entire space-time element. Several numerical experiments are presented proving the consistency of the new approach for all kinds of boundary conditions. Computations involving the interaction of shocks with embedded curved boundaries are made possible through an a posteriori limiting technique.},

By employing a spatial two-grid FEM, computational costs are reduced. Utilizing the cut-off technique and an auxiliary function, the condition on the nonlinear term is lessened to meet the local Lipschitz requirement. We further devise the associated fast algorithms for two-grid nonuniform L2- 1 σ FEM. To prevent roundoff errors, we introduce an innovative fast algorithm to precisely calculate the kernel coefficients. An α -robust analysis of the stability and optimal error estimates in terms of L 2 -norm and H 1 -norm for the fully discrete scheme is presented. The derived error bound remains stable as the order of the fractional derivative α → 1 − . Furthermore, a new two-grid algorithm and its corresponding fast algorithm are proposed to decrease the computational expenses by eliminating redundancy in discrete convolutional summation.

To mitigate the size effect caused by a large length-to-width ratio, a technique known as the ‘direct method’ is employed. This method effectively reduces the influence of the shape parameter, thereby improving the accuracy of the partial derivative calculations in LRBFCM. The combination of LRBFCM with the direct method is applied to the deep excavation problem, which consists of both the soil and support structures. The soil is modeled using the Drucker-Prager (D-P) elastic-plastic model, while an elastic model is employed for the support structure. Elastic-plastic discretization is performed using incremental theory. The proposed approach is validated through four different examples, comparing the results with numerical solutions obtained from traditional finite element methods (FEM). This study advocates the use of the direct method to optimize the distribution of local influence nodes, particularly in cases involving large length-to-width ratios. The combination of LRBFCM with incremental theory is shown to be effective for addressing elastic-plastic problems.},

  abstract     = {Numerical analysis for linear constant-coefficient multi-step Finite Difference schemes is a longstanding topic, developed approximately fifty years ago. It relies on the stability of the scheme, and thus—within the L 2 setting—on the absence of multiple roots of the amplification polynomial on the unit circle. This allows for the decoupling, while discussing the convergence of the method, of the study of the consistency of the scheme from the precise knowledge of its parasitic/spurious modes, so that the methods can be essentially studied as if they had only one step. Furthermore, stability alleviates the need to delve into the complexities of floating-point arithmetic on computers, which can be challenging topics to address. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the case of “weakly” unstable Finite Difference schemes with multiple roots on the unit circle, although the schemes may remain stable, considering parasitic modes is essential in studying their consistency and, consequently, their convergence. This research was prompted by unexpected numerical results on stable lattice Boltzmann schemes, which can be rewritten in terms of multi-step Finite Difference schemes. Unlike Finite Difference schemes, rigorous numerical analysis for lattice Boltzmann schemes is a contemporary topic with much left for future discoveries. Initial expectations suggested that third-order initialization schemes would suffice to maintain the accuracy of fourth-order schemes. However, this assumption proved incorrect for weakly unstable Finite Difference schemes and for stable lattice Boltzmann methods. This borderline scenario underscores that particular care must be adopted for lattice Boltzmann schemes, and the significance of genuine stability in facilitating the construction of Lax-Richtmyer-like theorems and in mastering the impact of round-off errors concerning Finite Difference schemes. Despite the simplicity and apparent lack of practical usage of the linear transport equation at constant velocity considered throughout the paper, we demonstrate that high-order lattice Boltzmann schemes for this equation can be used to tackle nonlinear systems of conservation laws relying on a Jin-Xin approximation and high-order splitting formulæ.},

Furthermore, simulations of soliton propagation following nonlinear sine-Gordon and Klein-Gordon equations in homogeneous and heterogeneous mediums are discussed. Numerical solutions are also compared with the results available in the literature. The present method accurately resolves the physical characteristics of the chosen problems, competing well with existing multi-stage time-integration methods. Moreover, it has significantly lower computational complexity than the four-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta-Nyström method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, two linearized second-order energy-conserving schemes for the nonlinear regularized long wave (RLW) equation are introduced, the unconditional superclose and superconvergence results are presented by using the conforming finite element method (FEM). Initially, through a skillful decomposition of the nonlinear term, two linearized second-order fully discrete schemes are developed. Compared to the previous nonlinear approaches, these schemes significantly reduce the number of iterations and improve computational efficiency; moreover, they conserve energy, and ensure the boundedness of the numerical solution in the H 1 -norm directly, which represents an advancement over the L ∞ -norm boundedness reported in prior studies. Secondly, based on the boundedness of the FE solution, the Ritz projection operator and high-precision results of the linear triangular element, the error estimates for superclose and superconvergence are derived without any restrictions on the ratio between time step size Δ t and spatial mesh size h . Finally, four numerical examples are provided to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the method.},

First, a sequential version of the algorithm is presented and its computational complexity is determined. Then, a parallelization of the algorithm is implemented and analyzed. The complexity of the derived parallel algorithm is expressed as a function of m and n as well as of the number μ of utilized CPU threads. Results of numerical experiments demonstrate the CPU time superiority of the parallel algorithm versus the respective sequential version and a standard inversion method applied to the original block matrix. An efficient parallelizable procedure to compute the determinants of such block matrices is also described.

  abstract     = {A hybrid method is developed to simulate two-phase flows with soluble surfactants. In this method, the interface and bulk surfactant concentration equations of diffuse-interface form, which include source terms to consider surfactant adsorption and desorption dynamics, are solved in the entire fluid domain by the finite difference method, while two-phase flows are solved by a lattice Boltzmann color-gradient model, which can accurately simulate binary fluids with unequal densities. The flow and interface surfactant concentration fields are coupled by a modified Langmuir equation of state, which allows for surfactant concentration beyond critical micelle concentration. The capability and accuracy of the hybrid method are first validated by simulating three numerical examples, including the adsorption of bulk surfactants onto the interface of a stationary droplet, the droplet migration in a constant surfactant gradient, and the deformation of a surfactant-laden droplet in a simple shear flow, in which the numerical results are compared with theoretical solutions and available literature data. Then, the hybrid method is applied to simulate the buoyancy-driven bubble rise in a surfactant solution, in which the influence of surfactants is identified for varying wall confinement, density ratio, Eotvos number and Biot number. It is found that surfactants exhibit a retardation effect on the bubble rise due to the Marangoni stress that resists interface motion, and the retardation effect weakens as the Eotvos or Biot number increases. We further show that the weakened retardation effect at higher Biot numbers is attributed to a decreased non-uniform effect of surfactants at the interface. By comparing with the Cahn-Hilliard phase-field method, we also show that the present method conserves the mass for each fluid, improves numerical stability especially at high density ratio and Eotvos number, and does not need the selection of free parameters, thus breaking the limitations of the existing method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present an asymptotic preserving scheme for the two-dimensional space-dependent and multi-scale kinetic SIR epidemic model which is widely used to model the spread of infectious diseases in populations. The scheme combines a discrete ordinate method for the velocity variables and finite volume method for the spatial and time variables. The idea of unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) is used to construct the numerical boundary fluxes which needs the formal integral solutions of the model. Due to the coupling of the three transfer equations in the SIR model, it is difficult to obtain these integral solutions dependently. We decouple the system by constructing the fluxes in a separate way. Then following the framework of UGKS we can obtain the macro auxiliary quantities which is needed in the scheme. Thus the SIR model can be solved in the sequential way. In addition, we can show numerically that the scheme is second-order accurate both in space and time. Moreover, it can not only capture the solution of the diffusion limit equations without requiring the cell size and time step being related to the smallness of the scaling parameters, but also resolve the solution in hyperbolic regime in a natural way. Furthermore, the positive property of the UGKS is analyzed in detail, and through adding time step constraint conditions and applying nodal limiters together, the positive UGKS, called P P U G K S 2 − o r d e r , is obtained. Moreover, in order release the time step constraints in the diffusion regime, a temporal first-order accuracy positive preserving UGKS, called P P U G K S 1 − o r d e r , is proposed. Finally, several numerical tests are included to validate the performance of the proposed schemes.},

The study focuses on a composite material with a pore inclusion within an ABS plastic matrix, exploring various pore volumes, orientations, and shapes. As part of the proposed hybrid model, a regression-type neural network was trained in MATLAB® to predict and correct discrepancies between the Generalized Stiffness Formulation (GSF) homogenization-based modeling method and the collected compression experimental test results. Using MATLAB® neural network, random error datasets were used to train the feed-forward neural network, and the remaining error datasets were used for validating the performance of the proposed hybrid modeling scheme. The hybrid model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest Mean Error (ME) of 0.1684864, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.051846, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3.500952, and highest R-squared of 0.998797. The proposed hybrid model outperformed both the Generalized Stiffness Formulation (GSF) and standalone ANN models. The significant improvement in prediction accuracy underscores the novelty and robustness of the hybrid approach in composite material modeling. Furthermore, this method can be used to refine any existing physical model by focusing on improving these established models to match experimental results and reducing the discrepancies, which offers a more efficient and attractive strategy for accurate predictions.},

Further, regularity results for the weak solution are derived based on assumptions of smoothness for both the initial data and the external forcing. Using the regularity of the solution, the uniqueness of weak solutions has been established. In terms of numerical approximation, we introduce a semi-discrete scheme using the conforming finite element method (CFEM) for space discretization and derive optimal error estimates. Subsequently, we present a fully discrete approximation scheme that employs backward Euler discretization in time and CFEM in space. A priori error estimates for both the semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes are discussed under minimal regularity assumptions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a high-order generalised differential quadrature element method (GDQE) is proposed to simulate two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flows on unstructured meshes. In this method, the computational domain is decomposed into unstructured elements. In each element, the high-order generalised differential quadrature (GDQ) discretisation is applied. Specifically, the GDQ method is utilised to approximate the partial derivatives of flow variables and fluxes with high-order accuracy inside each element. At the shared interfaces between different GDQ elements, the common flux is computed to account for the information exchange, which is achieved by the lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LBFS) in the present work. Since the solution in each GDQ element solely relies on information from itself and its direct neighbouring element, the developed method is authentically compact, and it is naturally suitable for parallel computing. Furthermore, by selecting the order of elemental GDQ discretisation, arbitrary accuracy orders can be achieved with ease. Representative incompressible flow problems, including 2D laminar flows as well as 3D turbulent simulations, are considered to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the present method. Successful numerical simulations, especially for scale-resolving 3D turbulent flow problems, confirm that the present method is efficient and high-order accurate.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces an efficient numerical methodology for the analysis of three-dimensional (3D) elastodynamics, featuring high-order precision in the temporal and spatial domains. In the temporal discretization process using the Krylov deferred correction (KDC) technique, the second-order time derivative is treated as a new variable in the governing equations. Spectral integration is then employed to mitigate the instability associated with numerical differentiation operators. Additionally, an improved numerical implementation of boundary conditions based on time integration is incorporated into the KDC approach. The boundary value problems at time nodes resulting from the above discretization process are resolved by employing generalized finite difference method (GFDM), providing the flexibility to choose the Taylor series expansion order. We present four numerical examples to indicate the performance of the developed method in the accuracy and stability. The obtained numerical results are meticulously compared with either analytical solutions or those calculated using COMSOL software.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic waves in water pipes pose a structural threat but also offer a valuable tool for non-invasive inspection. Complex pipe geometries such as bends and surface liners create complex fluid boundaries, triggering interactions between fluid flow and acoustics. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) excels at capturing these interactions near complex boundaries, in contrast to the finite volume method, which can result in errors. However, the application of LBM in water pipes has been limited by stability problems. This study proposes a two-step (DM-TS) collision operator based on a direct method (LBM-HA) for stable LBM simulations in water pipes. LBM-HA enables direct hydroacoustic predictions for both acoustic and dynamic flow fields in a pipe orifice. A novel acoustic-dynamic complex boundary condition was formulated from the linearized Euler&#39;s equation to account for the physical effects of the bounded domain of the LBM-HA analysis. To distinguish between dynamic and acoustic components, wavenumber and frequency decomposition techniques were applied to the pressure data obtained within the pipe. In addition, mode decomposition of the acoustic pressure was conducted to identify the dominant acoustic modes. By comparing the LBM-HA results with experimental data, we highlighted the method&#39;s potential for direct hydroacoustic analysis considering the acoustic characteristics of the water pipe.},

  abstract     = {This work tackles a novel parabolic equation driven by a nonlinear operator with double variable exponents, aiming to decompose and denoise images. Our primary approach involves enhancing classical models based on variable exponent operators by considering a novel nonlinear operator having a double-phase flux with unbalanced growth. We begin initially by analyzing the theoretical solvability of our model. Employing the Musielak-Orlicz space, we establish a suitable functional framework for investigating the proposed model. Subsequently, we use the Faedo-Galerkin approach to establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution for our problem. Furthermore, we provide a demonstration showcasing how our model preserves solution positivity, emphasizing this as a consistent feature of the proposed model. To evaluate our theoretical results, we present various numerical simulations on some grayscale and medical images (Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI)). These simulations covered aspects like decomposition, robustness and behavior sensitivity of model parameters with visual and quantitative comparisons. The obtained numerical results strongly support the efficiency of the proposed model in preserving features, reducing artifacts and deleting noise in comparison to some well-known existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the proposed model quantitatively surpasses the competitive models in terms of several well-known criteria, namely the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Mean-Square Error (MSE).},

The major physical unknowns (the potential, electron concentration, hole concentration, and the heat) are defined by four nonlinear PDEs: an elliptic equation, two convection-diffusion equations and a heat conductor equation. A conservative block-centered method is used to approximate the elliptic equation. The derivatives to time t , ∂ ∂ t ( ⋅ ) , are discretized by multistep differences for improving the computational accuracy. The diffusions and convection terms are treated by block-centered differences and upwind approximations, respectively. This composite numerical method is suitable for this nonlinear system. Firstly, numerical dispersion and nonphysical oscillations are avoided. Secondly, the unknowns and their adjoint vectors are obtained simultaneously. Thirdly, the law of conservation is preserved. An error estimates is derived. Finally, simple examples are given for showing the efficiency and accuracy.},

As a result, we propose a fully unsupervised approach, requiring no training data, to estimate finite difference solutions for PDEs directly via small linear convolutional neural networks. Our proposed approach uses substantially fewer parameters than similar finite difference-based approaches while also demonstrating comparable accuracy to the true solution for several selected elliptic and parabolic problems compared to the finite difference method.},

The NCCR model proposed by Myong is constructed from the generalized hydrodynamic equations of Eu, and aims to describe rarefied flows. In the non-equilibrium regime, the NCCR equations are more reliable than the Navier-Stokes equations. And the NCCR equations have an advantage of efficiency over the discrete velocity methods and stochastic particle methods. However, the NCCR model is a complicated nonlinear system. Many assumptions have been used in the schemes for solving the NCCR equations. The corresponding numerical methods may be associated with unphysical solution and instability. At the same time, it is hard to analyze the physical accuracy and stability of NCCR model due to the uncertainties in the numerical discretization. In this study, a new numerical method for solving NCCR equations is proposed and used to analyze the properties of NCCR equations. More specifically, the nonlinear equations are converted into the solutions of an objective function of a single variable. Under this formulation, the multiple solutions of the NCCR system are identified and the criteria for picking up the physical solution are proposed. Therefore, a numerical scheme for solving NCCR equations is constructed. A series of flow problems in the near continuum and low transition regimes with a large variation of Mach numbers are conducted to validate the numerical performance of proposed method and the physical accuracy of NCCR model.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the temporal stability analysis of a two-layer flow inside a channel that is driven by pressure. The channel consists of a fluid layer overlying an inhomogeneous and anisotropic porous layer. The flow contains a Couette component due to the movement of the horizontal impermeable upper and lower walls binding the two layers. These walls of the channel move at an identical speed but in opposite directions. The flow dynamics for the porous medium are modelled by the Darcy-Brinkman equations, and the Navier-Stokes equations are employed to describe the motion within the fluid layer. The hydrodynamic instability of infinitesimal disturbance is investigated using Orr-Sommerfeld analysis. The corresponding eigenvalue problem is derived and solved numerically using the Chebyshev polynomial-based spectral collocation method. Results reveal that stability features are strongly affected by the axial and spatial permeability variations of the porous medium. Further, the ratio of the depth of the fluid layer to the porous layer and the strength of the Couette component play a crucial role. The destabilization of the perturbed system is noticed by strengthening the Couette flow component. The combined impact of increasing the anisotropy parameter and depth ratio, decreasing Darcy number, and reducing the inhomogeneity factor stabilizes the system. This facilitates us to have greater control over the instability characteristics of such fluid-porous configuration by suitably adjusting various flow parameters. The outcome will be beneficial in relevant applications for enhancing or suppressing the instability of perturbation waves, as preferable.},

  abstract     = {Non-Newtonian fluids within heterogeneous porous media may give rise to complex spatial energy and mass distributions owing to non-local mechanisms, the modeling of which remains unclear. This study investigates the natural convection heat and mass transfer of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media, considering the Soret and Dufour effects. A strongly coupled model is developed to quantify the coupled transport of energy and reactive pollutants with the non-Newtonian fluid. The constitutive equation for the non-Newtonian fluid is described by a two-sided Caputo type space fractional velocity gradient. The governing equation, with a symmetric diffusion term, is effectively solved using a stable and convergent shifted Grünwald–Letnikov formula. The influences of three important parameters, which are the average skin friction coefficient, the average Nusselt number, and the Sherwood number, on fluid heat and mass transfer are calculated and analyzed. Numerical results reveal a significant interaction between the fractional derivative and the buoyancy ratio number, both of which affect the average skin friction coefficient. Furthermore, the average Nusselt number increases with the Dufour number while decreasing with the average Sherwood number. These findings enhance our understandings of the dynamics of energy and mass co-transport in non-Newtonian fluids, particularly in relation to their constitutive equation featuring spatial non-local properties.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a low rank approximation method for efficiently solving stochastic partial differential equations. Specifically, our method utilizes a novel low rank approximation of the stiffness matrices, which can significantly reduce the computational load and storage requirements associated with matrix inversion without losing accuracy. To demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our method, we apply it to address two crucial uncertainty quantification problems: stochastic elliptic equations and optimal control problems governed by stochastic elliptic PDE constraints. Based on varying dimension reduction ratios, our algorithm exhibits the capability to yield a high-precision numerical solution for stochastic partial differential equations, or provides a rough representation of the exact solutions as a pre-processing phase. Meanwhile, our algorithm for solving stochastic optimal control problems allows a diverse range of gradient-based unconstrained optimization methods, rendering it particularly appealing for computationally intensive large-scale problems. Numerical experiments are conducted and the results provide strong validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm.},

While bond-based models exhibit more computational efficiency, they sometimes could be limited in modeling capabilities. In this paper, we successfully develop a novel bond-based nonlocal model for the diffusion process with matrix-valued coefficients in non-divergence form. Our approach incorporates the coefficients into a covariance matrix and employs the multivariate Gaussian function with truncation to define the kernel function, and subsequently model the nonlocal diffusion through the bond-based formulation. We establish the well-posedness of the proposed model along with deriving some of its properties on maximum principle and mass conservation. Furthermore, an efficient linear collocation scheme is designed for numerical solution of our model. Comprehensive experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to showcase application of the proposed nonlocal model to both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion problems, and to demonstrate high-order accuracy and conditional δ -convergence of the proposed collocation scheme.},

The novelty of this work is that, for any fully anisotropic diffusion tensor, we provide some specific ω K to ensure the coercivity result of the proposed schemes on arbitrary parallelogram, quasi-parallelogram, trapezoidal and some general convex quadrilateral meshes. More interesting is that, the parameter ω K can only involves the anisotropic diffusion tensor and the geometry of quadrilateral cell.

For the successful application of MUSIC, exact values of permittivity, conductivity, and permeability of the background must be known. If one of these values is unknown, it will fail to identify the location of an anomaly. However, to the best of our knowledge, no explanation of this failure has been provided yet. In this paper, we consider the application of MUSIC to the localization of a small anomaly from scattering parameter data when complete information of the background is not available. Thanks to the framework of the integral equation formulation for the scattering parameter data, an analytical expression of the MUSIC-type imaging function in terms of the infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order is derived. Based on the theoretical result, we confirm that the identification of a small anomaly is significantly affected by the applied values of permittivity and conductivity. However, fortunately, it is possible to recognize the anomaly if the applied value of conductivity is small. Simulation results with synthetic data are reported to demonstrate the theoretical result.},

  abstract     = {Numerical solution of discrete PDEs corresponding to saddle point problems is highly relevant to physical systems such as Stokes flow. However, scaling up numerical solvers for such systems is often met with challenges in efficiency and convergence. Multigrid is an approach with excellent applicability to elliptic problems such as the Stokes equations, and can be a solution to such challenges of scalability and efficiency. The degree of success of such methods, however, is highly contingent on the design of key components of the multigrid scheme, including the hierarchy of discretizations, and the relaxation scheme used. Additionally, in many practical cases, it may be more effective to use a multigrid scheme as a preconditioner to an iterative Krylov subspace solver, as opposed to striving for maximum efficacy of the relaxation scheme in all foreseeable settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient symmetric multigrid preconditioner for the Stokes Equations on a staggered finite difference discretization. Our contribution is focused on crafting a preconditioner that (a) is symmetric indefinite, matching the property of the Stokes system itself, (b) is appropriate for preconditioning the SQMR iterative scheme [1] , and (c) has the requisite symmetry properties to be used in this context. In addition, our design is efficient in terms of computational cost and facilitates scaling to large domains.},

  abstract     = {Grid-Nesting is a common method of local refinement when using structured quadrilateral grid in estuarine models. Nevertheless, various issues need to be improved, such as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) limitations of external gravity wave and information exchange between two-way nesting grids. Based on the material conservation law, a novel scheme with Implicit, Grid-Nesting Elevation Solution (IGNES) and matched Nesting Boundary Flux Conservation Interpolation (NBFCI) was developed in this paper. The unstructured quadrilateral grid, finite-differencing, estuarine and coastal ocean model (UFDECOM) was update to UFDECOM-i. The gravity wave propagation experiment shows that the IGNES can relax the CFL limitations. Compared to traditional i-j two-direction strip refinement, the new scheme has higher computational efficiency. When the root-mean-square-error of elevation and current velocity increases by less than 0.05% and 0.2%, the calculation time is reduced by 40%. When simulating vortex motion, it overcomes the problem of simulation collapse caused by errors in nested boundaries. When simulating material transport, NBFCI scheme has smaller errors at the nesting boundary compared to quadratic interpolation, the high-order spatial interpolation at the middle temporal level (HSMIT) parabolic interpolation, upwind Advection-Equivalent interpolation, and HSIMT Advection-Equivalent interpolation scheme. The simulation results of the severe saltwater intrusion in the Changjiang Estuary in the late summer and early autumn of 2022 demonstrate that the UFDECOM-i with NBFCI and IGNES has higher computational efficiency and accuracy.},

The collocation procedure is then implemented in HWA, to transform the given model to the system of linear algebraic equations for the determination of unknown constant coefficient of the Haar wavelet series, which update the derivatives and the numerical solutions. The sufficient condition is established for the stability of the proposed technique, and then verified computationally.

Furthermore, the stability analysis and error estimation of the corresponding partition scheme are given. 2D/3D numerical experiments verify the validity of the theoretical analysis and prove the reliability and applicability of the scheme.},

Due to the complexity of the multiple variables and the strong coupling of the equations, it is not easy to prove rigorous error estimates. Under the corresponding regularity assumption and the superconvergence of the negative norm estimates of the two quasi-projections, we prove that the error estimates for phase-field ϕ in the H 1 -semi-norm and velocity u in the H 1 -norm are able to achieve second-order convergence rates in time and the O ( h r + 1 ) ( r ≥ 1 ) in space. The nonlocal variables Q and r also achieve the same convergence rate. In addition, the pressure p in the L 2 -norm can only reach first-order convergence rate in time and the O ( h r ) ( r ≥ 1 ) in space. At the same time, several numerical examples are given to illustrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the numerical scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper derives well-posedness and asymptotic results that provide qualitative information about the behavior, mechanism and strategies used by living organisms to navigate their biological networks. Chemical driven swimming is a captivating phenomenon that is observed in various living organisms like bacteria and protozoa but the problem in weighted networks is more complex, since the equations of parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel model coupled with incompressible Navier-Stokes equations must be reformulated in a discrete setting. The starting point is to transpose the coupled system from the Euclidean case to the connected networks with certain network-theoretic simplified approaches, which yields fruitful key results. These results not only enable the construction of global solutions but also serve as a foundation for determining information about the stability and large time behavior of the system. Then, decay rates are well established to predict important features, such as how quickly weak solutions at a given point decrease over time due to dissipative processes. Additionally, the L 1 - convergence of cell densities towards the self-similar Gaussian solution of the heat equation is well proved by time dependent scaling, which shows that the solution maintains its shape and only scales in time and space as time evolves. Finally, this paper includes many numerical tests through a recent robust numerical scheme to illustrate the theoretical results and to develop computational control and prediction of living organisms&#39; trajectories around central nodes in networked flows.},

  abstract     = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a widely used numerical technique for simulating electromagnetic wave interactions with complex media. Various efficient approaches have been used to analyze complex media, and the surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) is one of the most powerful techniques in FDTD simulations, allowing efficient electromagnetic modeling of lossy materials. However, conventional SIBC-FDTD formulations face challenges when analyzing lossy dispersive materials because of the assumption of frequency-independent relative permittivity and conductivity in the inverse Laplace transform. To address this, we propose a dispersion-modeling approach for the surface impedance of lossy dispersive materials. Additionally, to reduce grid errors in the FDTD discrete domain, we introduce the surface admittance boundary condition (SABC) for lossy dispersive materials. We investigated the numerical accuracy by deriving the numerical surface impedance and admittance for the proposed surface boundary condition (SBC)-FDTD formulations. In addition, we determined the numerical stability conditions of the SBC-FDTD formulations using the von Neumann method combined with the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Numerical examples validate both the numerical accuracy and stability of the proposed SBC-FDTD formulations. Our findings enhance the understanding and application of the SBC in FDTD simulations, especially for lossy dispersive materials, and provide insights for future research and electromagnetic modeling in various fields.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a novel phase field smoothing-physics informed neural network (PFS-PINN) approach to efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous coefficients. This method combines the phase field model and the PINN model to overcome the difficulty of low regularity solutions and eliminate the limitations of interface constraints in existing neural network solvers for PDEs with discontinuous coefficients. The proposed PFS-PINN approach includes two key parts. In the first part, the low regularity solutions to PDEs with discontinuous coefficients create challenges for solving the problem by neural networks. A neural network solver for phase field models is presented for constructing approximate PDEs with smooth coefficients, and the associated convergence results are proven. In the second part, the mixed PINN model is introduced to solve the approximate PDEs. Both the solution and the first-order derivatives of the solution are used as the outputs of the neural network, and the time-consuming second-order derivatives in loss functions are avoided effectively. In addition, in order to improve the performance of the PFS-PINN method, the adaptive sampling strategies are also investigated. We carry out some numerical experiments, including the elliptic equations defined over various complex microstructures. The numerical examples demonstrate that the PFS-PINN approach is accurate and effective in solving the elliptic equation with discontinuous coefficients. Besides, the proposed PFS-PINN approach has the potential to solve other PDEs with discontinuous coefficients in science and engineering.},

Two stabilization variants, gradient-jump face and normal-gradient volume, are considered for continuous trace spaces of the first and second degrees, based on the polynomial families Q 1 Q1 and Q 2 Q2 . We propose a practical error indicator that estimates the ‘jumps’ of finite element solution derivatives across background mesh faces and it avoids integration of any quantities along implicitly defined curvilinear edges of the discrete surface elements. For the Q 1 Q1 family of piecewise trilinear polynomials on bulk cells, the solve-estimate-mark-refine strategy, combined with the suggested error indicator, achieves optimal convergence rates typical of two-dimensional problems. We also provide a posteriori error estimates, establishing the reliability of the error indicator for the Q 1 Q1 and Q 2 Q2 elements and for two types of stabilization. In numerical experiments, we assess the reliability and efficiency of the error indicator. While both stabilizations are found to deliver comparable performance, the lowest degree finite element space appears to be the more robust choice for the adaptive TraceFEM framework.},

This technique yields a global linear problem that can be solved iteratively via a Krylov-type method. More precisely, at each iteration of the scheme, two second-order elliptic problems have to be solved, and a normal derivative on the boundary has to be computed. In this work, we specialize this scheme for the HHO discretization. To this aim, an explicit technique to compute the discrete normal derivative of an HHO solution of a Laplacian problem is proposed. Moreover, we show that the resulting discrete scheme is well-posed. Finally, a new preconditioner is designed to speed up the convergence of the Krylov method.

  abstract     = {An enriched hybrid high-order method is designed for the Stokes equations of fluid flow and is fully applicable to generic curved meshes. Minimal regularity requirements of the enrichment spaces are given, and an abstract error analysis of the scheme is provided. The method achieves consistency in the enrichment space and is proven to converge optimally in energy error. The scheme is applied to 2D flow around circular cylinders, for which the local behaviour of the velocity and pressure fields is known. By enriching the local spaces with these solutions, superior numerical results near the submerged cylinders are achieved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the variable-order time fractional mobile/immobile diffusion (TF-MID) equation in two-dimensional spatial domain, where the fractional order α ( t ) α(t) satisfies ⁎ ⁎ 0 &lt; α ⁎ ≤ α ( t ) ≤ α ⁎ &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;α⁎≤α(t)≤α⁎&amp;lt;1 . We combine the quadratic spline collocation (QSC) method and the L 1 + L1+ formula to propose a QSC- L 1 + L1+ scheme. It can be proved that, the QSC- L 1 + L1+ scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent with ⁎ O ( τ min ⁡ { 3 − α ⁎ − α ( 0 ) , 2 } + Δ x 2 + Δ y 2 ) O(τmin⁡{3−α⁎−α(0),2}+Δx2+Δy2) , where τ , Δ x and Δ y are the temporal and spatial step sizes, respectively. With some restrictions on α ( t ) α(t) , the QSC- L 1 + L1+ scheme has second order convergence in time even on the uniform mesh, without any restrictions on the solution of the equation. We further construct a novel alternating direction implicit (ADI) framework to develop an ADI-QSC- L 1 + L1+ scheme, which has the same unconditionally stability and convergence orders. In addition, a fast implementation for the ADI-QSC- L 1 + L1+ scheme based on the exponential-sum-approximation (ESA) technique is proposed. Moreover, we also introduce the optimal QSC method to improve the spatial convergence to fourth-order. Numerical experiments are attached to support the theoretical analysis, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

When solving by the continuous Galerkin mixed finite element method, the model exists two kind of locking phenomena for special physical parameters. To overcome these locking phenomena, we introduce new variables to reformulate the original problem into a new problem, which exists a built-in mechanism to keep the continuous Galerkin mixed finite element method stable. It can be regarded as a generalized Stokes problem for two given β and η and two diffusion problems for a given δ . The generalized Stokes problem can be adopted by some stable solver and the diffusion problems can be solved by continuous Galerkin finite element. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of weak solution is proved by using the standard Galerkin method and combining with priori estimates and some invariant quantities. After that, we design fully discrete time-stepping schemes to use mixed finite element method with P 2 − P 1 − P 1 − P 1 P2−P1−P1−P1 element pairs for space variables and backward Euler method for time variable, and analyze the coupled and decoupled time stepping methods based on the proposed scheme. The optimal convergence order is obtained in both space and time. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to show the optimal convergence rates about variables and the robustness of proposed method with respect to ν , and to verify that there is no locking phenomenon.},

In this approach, the convection term is handled as a source term in the lattice Boltzmann evolution equation; thus, the derivation term that may be induced by the convection term disappears. By using the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the anisotropic convection-diffusion equation is recovered up to second-order accurate in space. In particular, we also present a local scheme for computing the convection term, indicating that the present method retains the main advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method. We then test the proposed model by considering the Gaussian hill problem and an anisotropic convection diffusion equation with constant velocity and diffusion tensor. The results illustrate that our model has acceptable numerical accuracy and can be a good candidate for simulating anisotropic convection-diffusion equation.},

This manuscript delves into the dynamic behavior of time-dependent complex Oldroyd-B nanofluids as they traverse between parallel plates within a porous media. Intriguingly, the study introduces captivating elements, including magnetic fields, convection, diffusion, heat source effects, and chemical reactions, which augment the uniqueness of the research. The designed model exhibits the potential to uncover the inherent characteristics and memory effects of viscoelastic nanofluids, pioneering the utilization of non-integer Caputo fractional derivatives to address this challenge. To tackle the complexities of this problem, we employ a combination of finite difference and finite element methods for the discretization of the governing flow equations. This enables us to flawlessly compute key parameters such as the Nusselt number, Sherwood number, and Skin friction coefficient for the complex fractional viscoelastic model. Our rigorous approach also involves the validation of the numerical scheme for convergence and the provision of error estimates. Our research delves into the realm of heat and mass transfer phenomena in porous media, specifically focusing on the intricate interplay between complex fluid dynamics and nanoparticle suspension. The results are given graphically, providing a picture of the importance of certain fractional and dimensionless physical characteristics.

In this paper, we first give an overview of the various methods and discuss the connection to the Krein-spectral shift function and computational aspects. We propose variants of Krylov subspace methods for the computation of the Casimir energy for large-scale problems and demonstrate Casimir computations for several complex configurations.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical comparison of finite-element methods resulting in local mass conservation at the element level for Poisson&#39;s problem, namely the primal hybrid and mixed methods. These formulations result in an indefinite system. Alternative formulations yielding a positive-definite system are obtained after hybridizing each method. The choice of approximation spaces yields methods with enhanced accuracy for the pressure variable, and results in systems with identical size and structure after static condensation. A regular pressure precision mixed formulation is also considered based on the classical RT k space. The simulations are accelerated using Open multi-processing (OMP) and Thread-Building Blocks (TBB) multithreading paradigms alongside either a coloring strategy or atomic operations ensuring a thread-safe execution. An additional parallel strategy is developed using C++ threads, which is based on the producer-consumer paradigm, and uses locks and semaphores as synchronization primitives. Numerical tests show the optimal parallel strategy for these finite-element formulations, and the computational performance of the methods are compared in terms of simulation time and approximation errors. Additional results are developed during the process. Numerical solvers often fail to find an accurate solution to the highly indefinite systems arising from finite-element formulations, and this paper documents a matrix ordering strategy to stabilize the resolution. A procedure to enable static condensation based on the introduction of piecewise constant functions that also fulfills Neumann&#39;s compatibility condition, and yet computes an average pressure per element is presented.},

The techniques of the discrete orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernels and the discrete complementary convolution (DCC) kernels are used to derive the optimal error estimations in L2 -norm and the stability analysis for the fully discrete scheme on the coarse and fine grids, and to prove the optimal H1 -norm error estimation for the fully discrete TGFE scheme. These analyses hold for adjacent time-step ratios 0&amp;lt;rk≤4.8645−δ ( δ being an arbitrarily small constant). Finally, the effectiveness and computing efficiency of the proposed algorithm are verified through several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The current research, which can be employed in various engineering applications, is involved with the investigation of the heat transfer effect on the laminar and fully developed ferrohydrodynamic flow into a curved annular cylindrical duct, when a constant very strong transverse magnetic field is applied. The numerical solution of the involved constitutive partial differential equations, i.e. the continuity, momentum, energy, magnetization and Maxwell&#39;s equations with the corresponding boundary conditions, is achieved via the computational Continuity-Vorticity-Pressure (C.V.P.) algorithmic method, using a conveniently chosen non-uniform grid. The method is implemented via an in-house code, which has been applied and validated in several ferrohydrodynamic flows. It incorporates a general theoretical model for the magnetohydrodynamic flow of micropolar magnetic fluids. The results show that the velocity distribution, the pressure drop and the temperature are significantly affected by the magnetic field strength and the volumetric concentration of the ferrofluid particles. The flow in the axial direction is redistributed in four symmetric poles, where its maximum value is readily observed. A secondary flow is generated, due to the combined effect of the buoyancy, the curvature and the magnetic field, which improves the heat transfer between the walls and the fluid. The axial pressure gradient, which is required to maintain the same mass flow, also increases as the field strength and concentration of magnetic particles increases, but with a lower rate in comparison to the increase in heat transfer.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces an unstructured variational nodal method (UVNM-S N ), also recognized as the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, for solving heterogeneous neutron Boltzmann transport problems. The UVNM-S N solves the variational formulation of neutron Boltzmann transport equation (NBTE) by meshing the problem domain with non-overlapping nodes, i.e. the meshes. Lagrange multipliers are introduced along nodal interfaces enforcing neutron conservation. The interface unknowns are globally coupled and solved as the Dirichlet data to recover local within-node unknowns. Unstructured meshes are handled using the coordinate transformation technique, while the angular variables are discretized using the discrete-ordinates (S N ) method. Furthermore, within the framework of the UVNM-S N , the nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA) is incorporated to tackle the issue of slow convergence of the power iteration (PI). Besides, the volume correction method is developed to facilitate the implementation of the UVNM-S N for heterogeneous problems. The 2D and 3D C5G7 benchmark problems and the SIMONS test problem are utilized to verify the suggested methods. According to numerical results, UVNM-S N exhibits geometric compatibility and precision in a variety of applications. Moreover, the volume correction method yields a speed-up ratio of around 10, and the NDA method provides a 6-12 speed-up ratio.},

Employing the Fourier transform, the governing electro-elastic equations are solved in terms of the Burgers vectors b x bx , b y by and b ϕ bϕ . These equations converted into a system of singular integral equations with Cauchy type then are solved numerically with the help of collocation methods. Crack problems can be solved by establishing the stress and displacement fields in the crack&#39;s absence and distributing strain nuclei along the line of the crack. The distributed strain nucleus is a powerful method to calculate accurate solutions to plane crack problems. In fact, the technique is excellent for solutions of complex crack patterns and it is suitable to analyze multiple cracks. Hence this technique allows considering multiple cracks with arbitrary lengths and positions at the interface. The validation of results has been checked by available analytical, finite element and experimental papers. The primary objective of this paper is to study the interacting effects among multiple unequal interface cracks, the non-homogeneity parameter, geometry and material properties and loading parameters on the field intensity factors. Numerical results show that the normalized modes I/II SIFs and EDIFs decreasing with increasing stiffness and thickness of coating.},

The scheme in 2D cylindrical coordinates is based on the control volume approach and it can preserve the conservation property for all the conserved variables including mass, momentum and total energy. In this hydrodynamic scheme, a kind of high-order Taylor expansion basis function on the general element is used to construct the interpolation polynomials of the physical variables for the DG discretization. The terms including the material derivatives of the test functions are omitted, which simplifies the scheme significantly. Furthermore, the mesh velocity in the direct ALE framework is obtained by implementing an adaptive mesh movement method with a kind of dimensional-splitting type monitor function. This type of mesh movement method can automatically concentrate the mesh nodes near the regions with large gradients of the variables, which can greatly improve the resolutions of numerical solutions near the specified regions. For removing the numerical oscillations in the simulations, a Hermite Weighted Essential Non-oscillatory (HWENO) reconstruction is employed as a slope limiter. Finally, some test cases are displayed to verify the accuracy and the good performance of our scheme.},

Firstly, a OOSM is constructed, which consists of five steps. The projection strategy is adopted to get the values of linear velocity and pressure in the first two steps, then the three elliptic subproblems about the angular velocity, the temperature, and the concentration variables are solved in the last three steps. The original variables with the predefined boundary conditions need to be solved separately in each step. Next, in order to solve the problem efficiently, a TOSM is presented, which only solves the nonlinear equations in the coarse level subspaces and the Oseen type linearized equations in the fine level. The numerical analysis of stability and error estimates of the fully discrete methods show that TOSM can reach the same accuracy as the OOSM with H ∼ O ( h 2 / 3 ) H∼O(h2/3) .

In this work, the skin panels on the upper surface of the wing butt box are selected using a sub-modeling technique based on the nonlinear structural analysis. A reduced-order method is proposed to trace the geometrically nonlinear response of the single and double-curved skin panels in a stepwise manner. A predictor-corrector strategy is developed using the Koiter-perturbation-theory based reduced-order model and Newton iterations. The high-efficiency of the proposed method is validated by comparing the number of path-following steps and iterations with the full-order method. A fairly large step size is achieved to significantly reduce the computational cost in a nonlinear buckling analysis. The influence of the number of closely-spaced modes on the numerical accuracy and efficiency of the proposed reduced-order method is also studied.

Coupling the two methods is usually based on the continuity and equilibrium conditions at the finite element-meshless interface. In the proposed hybrid method, the equilibrium condition is satisfied by the action-reaction principle to ensure the coupling between the finite element method and the strong-form meshless method. The idea is to satisfy the equilibrium condition by calculating the interface force vector in the finite element formulation using a strong-form meshless technique. In the weak formulation the forces are modeled by the interface force functional. This hybrid method has been used to study the behavior of functionally graded materials in small deformations, with a comparison between the results of other numerical methods and those of analytical solutions. Following this validation, the hybrid numerical approach is adapted to the simulation of static computational problems for inhomogeneous functionally graded materials with geometric nonlinearity. In this context, a high-order algorithm has been developed by associating a high-order development, continuation procedure and hybrid method. Numerical analysis is performed to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the present approach, through a comparative study with solutions provided by high-order algorithms derived from the finite element method and strong-form meshless methods. In addition, the good qualities of the solution are controlled by the residues, which do not exceed 10 − 6 .},

  abstract     = {Forward–backward doubly stochastic differential equations (FBDSDEs) serve as a probabilistic interpretation of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with diverse applications. Coupled FBDSDEs encounter numerous challenges in numerical approximation compared to forward–backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and decoupled FBDSDEs, including ensuring the measurability of the numerical solutions, accounting for the mutual influences between forward and backward processes, and considering the relationship with respect to SPDEs rather than PDEs. This paper introduces, for the first time, a numerical method for solving multi-dimensional coupled FBDSDEs. By integrating an optimal control-based approach with deep neural networks, it effectively addresses the coupling-related challenges between forward and backward equations. Computational examples of coupled FBDSDEs with explicit solutions demonstrate that the proposed deep learning-based numerical algorithm achieves commendable performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

The stabilized term constructed in this method is quite different from those of the existing literature. This method not only has the same attractive computational properties as the conforming stabilized finite element method with local polynomial pressure projection, such as parameter-free, avoiding higher-order derivatives and edge-based date structure, but also guarantees the superclose and superconvergence results for the velocity and pressure. Finally, two numerical examples are supported to confirm the theoretical analysis.},

However, their performance is limited when encountering oscillatory part in the solutions of PDEs. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-scale deep neural network with periodic activation function to achieve high-frequency to low-frequency conversion, which can capture the oscillation part of the solution of PDEs. Moreover, the use of adaptive sampling method can adaptively change the location and distribution of residual points, improving the performance of the network. Additionally, the gradient-enhanced strategy is also utilized to embed the gradient information of the PDEs into the loss function of the neural network, which further improves the accuracy of PINNs. Through the numerical experiments verification, it is found that our method is better than PINNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical and computational finite element study of a thermal non-equilibrium model governed by modified Navier-Stokes equations coupled with energy conservation governing the flow and heat transfer in a complex hybrid nanofluid saturated porous media is carried out. The thermal influence of the porous solid matrix on the fluid and the vice-versa is incorporated into the respective energy conservation models for fluid and solid. The a priori error estimates providing the convergence analysis for the finite element scheme are derived in the H 1 H1 norm. The coupling between mass, momentum, and energy conservation of fluid is further tightened by Boussinesq approximation. Babuska-Brezzy equivalence condition is used in estimating the pressure. The use of hybrid nanoparticles leads to the enhancement of heat conduction in the H-shaped domain in most of the cases. While a butterfly-like flow pattern with a multi-cellular structure is noticed, the flow pattern of isotherm curves depicts a thermal boundary layer along the hot wall of the H-shaped domain. For various input parameters such as volume fraction of hybrid nano-particle ( ϕ ) ; ( 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 0.01 ) (ϕ);(0≤ϕ≤0.01) , Rayleigh Number ( R a ) ; ( 1 ≤ R a ≤ 10 5 ) (Ra);(1≤Ra≤105) , Prandtl Number ( P r ) ; ( 1 ≤ P r ≤ 50 ) (Pr);(1≤Pr≤50) , porosity ( ϵ ) ; ( 0.1 ≤ ϵ ≤ 0.4 ) (ϵ);(0.1≤ϵ≤0.4) and, Darcy number ( D a ) ; ( 0.01 ≤ D a ≤ 10 3 ) (Da);(0.01≤Da≤103) , a thorough parametric analysis of the physics of flow and heat transport is conducted. The important Statistical results in percentage are addressed here. Corresponding to the 10 5 times increase of Ra and 75% increase in ϵ , the minimum rate of increment in heat flux is 88.17% and 51.76%, respectively. Again, due to 10 4 times increment in Da , the minimum rate of fall in Nu and N u s Nus are 3.6278% and 7.54%, respectively.

Ultimately, the accuracy and efficiency of the presented algorithms are verified through the comparison of the fixed point, Newton and SOR methods in 3D numerical experiments.

Chebyšev coefficients can be computed easily from the values of the function in the Clenshaw–Curtis points using the inverse fast Fourier transform. Bounds on expression rates and stability are obtained that are superior to those of constructions based on ReLU NN emulations of monomials as considered in [24] , [22] . All emulation bounds are explicit in terms of the (arbitrary) partition of the interval, the target emulation accuracy and the polynomial degree in each element of the partition. ReLU NN emulation error estimates are provided for various classes of functions and norms, commonly encountered in numerical analysis. In particular, we show exponential ReLU emulation rate bounds for analytic functions with point singularities and develop an interface between Chebfun approximations and constructive ReLU NN emulations.},

To improve the approximation ability of the PINN, the algorithm we proposed generates effective samples adaptively based on Gaussian mixture distribution by combining the time-adaptive strategy, failure-informed enrichment technique, and pre-fixed technique. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to learn the solution operator of three-component NLSE within a specialized solution space. The results of numerical simulation demonstrate that the improved algorithm has better approximation ability and faster convergence rate in approximating the solution and solution operator of the considered equation while using a smaller training set.},

  abstract     = {We consider a one-dimensional nonlocal hyperbolic model introduced to describe the formation and movement of self-organizing collectives of animals in homogeneous 1D environments. Previous research has shown that this model exhibits a large number of complex spatial and spatiotemporal aggregation patterns, as evidenced by numerical simulations and weakly nonlinear analysis. In this study, we focus on a particular type of localised patterns with odd/even/no symmetries (which are usually part of snaking solution branches with different symmetries that form complex bifurcation structures called snake-and-ladder bifurcations). To numerically investigate the bifurcating solution branches (to eventually construct the full bifurcating structures), we first need to understand the numerical issues that could appear when using different numerical schemes. To this end, in this study, we consider ten different numerical schemes (the upwind scheme, the MacCormack scheme, the Fractional-Step method, and the Quasi-Steady Wave-Propagation algorithm, combining them with high-resolution methods), while paying attention to the preservation of the solution symmetries with all these schemes. We show several numerical issues: first, we observe the presence of two distinct types of numerical solutions (with different symmetries) that exhibit very small errors, which might initially suggest that we have reached a steady-state solution, but this is not the case (this also implies an extremely slow convergence); second, in some cases, none of the investigated numerical schemes converge, posing a challenge for the development of numerical continuation algorithms for nonlocal hyperbolic systems; lastly, the choice of the numerical schemes, as well as their corresponding parameters such as time-space steps, exert a significant influence on the type and symmetry of bifurcating solutions. To conclude we emphasize that if we want to construct numerically bifurcation diagrams for these localised solutions with different symmetries, the resulting bifurcations may vary when different numerical schemes and/or corresponding parameters are employed.},

The FGP-GPL-MEE plate is supported by the Winkler-Pasternak foundation and subjected to the initial external electric voltage and magnetic loads. The governing equations for FGP-GPL-MEE plates are derived from the combination of Hamilton&#39;s principle and the refined plate theory (RPT) with four variables. The FGP-GPL-MEE plate is formed by combining three porosity distributions of functionally graded materials and three patterns of graphene platelets dispersion distributed along the plate thickness. Using the modified Halpin-Tsai model, effective material properties of the FGP-GPL-MEE plate are estimated. Isogeometric approach (IGA) is used to discretize the plate geometry and extract mode shapes and natural frequencies. The effects of various parameters such as porosity distributions, porosity coefficient, GPLs distributions and magnetic and electric potentials on the natural frequencies of the FGP-GPL-MEE plate are performed. The results indicate that the GPLs reinforcement can be significantly enhanced the natural frequencies of the FGP-GPL-MEE plate. Moreover, the free vibration behavior is significantly influenced by porosity, as well as magnetic and electric fields. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the vibrational characteristics of FGP-GPL-MEE plates.},

  abstract     = {In the current study, authors have studied the heat transfer through ternary hybrid nanofluid (THNF) between the gap of a disk and cone, where both are co-rotating with regard to the other. The authors have developed a mathematical model of THNF flow inside a gap between a cone and a disk with the effects of magnetic field, Hall effects, and radiation parameters. The unique aspect of this study is the implementation of a powerful artificial neural network (ANN) that exhibits improved robustness and accurate predictive performance for the Nusselt number at the surface of both the cone and disk. Through the use of proper similarity transformations, the model equations are transformed into a collection of nonlinear ODEs. Using MATLAB and an inbuilt bvp4c function, these equations are numerically solved. The main objective of this research is to examine the impacts of cone and disk rotation within the co-rotation system. The heat transfer rate is seen to be higher at the surface of the disk. It is followed from the analysis of the ANN model that the regression value for each case varies between 0.99574 and 1, and in many cases, it is exactly equal to 1. In addition, the mean square error (MSE) for every dataset is notably very close to zero. The effect of the angle of the conical gap is also one of the noteworthy subjects due to the significance of its effects in several engineering sector applications.},

In this paper, we modify the two-sided preconditioning by multiplying the left-sided and the right-sided preconditioners together as a single-sided preconditioner. Such a single-sided preconditioner essentially derives from approximating the spatial matrix with a fast diagonalizable matrix and keeping the temporal matrix unchanged. Clearly, the matrix-vector multiplication of the single-sided preconditioning is faster to compute than that of the two-sided one, since the single-sided preconditioned matrix has a simpler structure. More importantly, we show theoretically that the single-sided preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method has a convergence rate no worse than the two-sided preconditioned one. As a result, the one-sided preconditioned GMRES solver requires less computational time than the two-sided preconditioned GMRES solver in total. Numerical results are reported to show the efficiency of the proposed single-sided preconditioning technique.},

  abstract     = {The Diffusion Peterlin Viscoelastic Fluid (DPVF) model describes the movement of specific incompressible polymeric fluids. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new low-complexity linear-time filter finite element (FE) method for the DPVF model. In order to avoid the value at time t = − Δ t , the proposed time filter method consists of three steps, including a post-processing step. Firstly, a first-order Euler backward nonlinear fully discrete mixed FE scheme is employed to compute the numerical solutions at time t 1 = Δ t . For n ≥ 1 , we obtain the intermediate values ( u ˜ h n + 1 , p ˜ h n + 1 , d ˜ h n + 1 ) in Step II using a fully implicit backward Euler scheme. At the same time level, we proceed with these intermediate values ( u ˜ h n + 1 , p ˜ h n + 1 , d ˜ h n + 1 ) using the linear time filters. The linear time filters step does not significantly increase computational complexity. However, it can enhance temporal convergence accuracy from first order to second order for backward Euler time filter (BE time filter), and from second order to three order for BDF2 time filter. We demonstrate the almost unconditional stability of the scheme. Error estimates for the time filter method are derived and presented. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings and showcase the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The model includes a nonconvex data fidelity term and also a quadratic penalty term that enforces the restored image to be close to a reference image deduced from a Gaussian denoiser. It can be viewed as the adaptive TV regularization of the Regularization by Denoising (RED) approach for multiplicative noise removal. We prove that the model admits a unique minimizer in a suitable function space and provide a fast numerical algorithm based on the alternating direction method with multipliers (ADMM) for it. Different Gaussian denoisers, including the patch-based algorithm BM3D and the learning-based algorithm DnCNN, are considered for the model in numerical experiments.

The isotropic error of the optimized gradient stencil is reduced to 4.1% and 7.5% of the conventional scheme and the typical 4th-order isotropic stencil that is widely used in the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method, while the optimized Laplacian stencil displays the best performance in the Fourier analysis. Then, the optimized stencils are applied to suppress the spurious currents in the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method. The spurious current is reduced to only 7.2% of that calculated by the typical 4th-order isotropic stencil at the reduced temperature 0.6, at which the liquid/gas density ratio is near to 1000. Furthermore, they are adopted to rectify the dendrite directions in the alloy solidification simulations by the phase field method. The angle deviation of dendrite growth is reduced to 15.7% of the conventional scheme.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of nonlinear differential equations has resulted in remarkable progress across various scientific domains, including physics, biology, ecology, and quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, obtaining multiple solutions for nonlinear differential equations can pose considerable challenges, particularly when it is difficult to find suitable initial guesses. To address this issue, we propose a pioneering approach known as the Companion-Based Multilevel Finite Element Method (CBMFEM). This novel technique efficiently and accurately generates multiple initial guesses for solving nonlinear elliptic semi-linear equations containing polynomial nonlinear terms through the use of finite element methods with conforming elements. As a theoretical foundation of CBMFEM, we present an appropriate and new concept of the isolated solution to the nonlinear elliptic equations with multiple solutions. The newly introduced concept is used to establish the inf-sup condition for the linearized equation around the isolated solution. Furthermore, it is crucially used to derive a theoretical error analysis of finite element methods for nonlinear elliptic equations with multiple solutions. A number of numerical results obtained using CBMFEM are then presented and compared with a traditional method. These not only show the CBMFEM&#39;s superiority, but also support our theoretical analysis. Additionally, these results showcase the effectiveness and potential of our proposed method in tackling the challenges associated with multiple solutions in nonlinear differential equations with different types of boundary conditions.},

Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2024] for the Stokes problem. Therein, the velocity space is obtained by enriching the H 1 H1 -conforming Lagrange element space with some H ( div ) H(div) -conforming Raviart–Thomas functions, such that the divergence constraint is satisfied exactly. In these methods arbitrary shape-regular simplicial grids can be used. In the present paper two alternatives for discretizing the convective terms are considered. One variant leads to a scheme that still only involves volume integrals, and the other variant employs upwinding known from DG schemes. Both variants ensure the conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum in some suitable sense. In addition, a pressure-robust and convection-robust velocity error estimate is derived, i.e., the velocity error bound does not depend on the pressure and the constant in the error bound for the kinetic energy does not blow up for small viscosity. After condensation of the enrichment unknowns and all non-constant pressure unknowns, the method can be reduced to a P k − P 0 Pk−P0 -like system for arbitrary velocity polynomial degree k . Numerical studies verify the theoretical findings.},

Our method has the same symbol | ξ | α |ξ|α as the fractional Laplacian ( − Δ ) α 2 (−Δ)α2 at the discrete level, and thus it can be viewed as the exact discrete analogue of the fractional Laplacian. This unique feature distinguishes our method from other existing methods for the fractional Laplacian. Note that our method is different from the Fourier pseudospectral methods in the literature which are usually limited to periodic boundary conditions (see Remark 1.1 ). Numerical analysis shows that our method can achieve a spectral accuracy. The stability and convergence of our method in solving the fractional Poisson equations were analyzed. Our scheme yields a multilevel Toeplitz stiffness matrix, and thus fast algorithms can be developed for efficient matrix-vector multiplications. The computational complexity is O ( 2 N log ⁡ ( 2 N ) ) O(2Nlog⁡(2N)) , and the memory storage is O ( N ) O(N) with N the total number of points.

Initially, the original differential equations are reformulated as corresponding Hamiltonian systems. Subsequently, the semi-discrete schemes are constructed using the sixth-order finite difference formula. The discrete energy method is employed to rigorously prove the energy conservation laws, convergence, and stability of the solutions for the spatial semi-discrete scheme. Next, the time derivatives in the semi-discrete schemes are discretized with the third-order strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta method, then the local truncation error of the finite difference scheme is provided. The accuracy and effectiveness of the constructed schemes, along with the theoretical analysis, are demonstrated through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) is becoming a powerful tool in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and automation of simulations. Currently, in the design of shock-capturing methods, there is still a heavy reliance on the expertise and scientific knowledge of each author, particularly in nonlinear components such as smoothness indicators and weighting functions. ML has the potential to reduce this dependency, since by leveraging large datasets, they can learn intricate patterns and make accurate predictions of these functions. In this work we present a neural network that compute the weighting functions in the WENO5 scheme. The proposed WENO5-NN scheme generalizes well for different resolutions, and in most of the cases tested, it outperforms the classical WENO5-JS scheme.},

In implementation, we split the displacement field into compressional and shear waves by the Helmholtz decomposition. Then we use coordinate transformation, power series expansion based on perturbed parameters and Fourier expansion of corresponding power series coefficients to simplify the original boundary value problem to a successive sequence of one-dimensional boundary value problem. We linearize the inverse problem by eliminating the higher-order terms in the power series expansion; and design a reconstruction algorithm by the explicit relationship between the Fourier coefficients of the boundary function and the total field. In order to obtain better resolution, we also use a nonlinear correction method in the numerical experiments.

Theory Methods Appl. 14, 559–588], a novel MPDE-based approach for constructing a generalisation of these meshes was proposed. Like with most layer-adapted mesh methods, the algorithms in that article depended on detailed derivations of a priori bounds on the SPDE&#39;s solution and its derivatives. In this work we extend that approach so that it instead uses a posteriori computed estimates of the solution. We present detailed algorithms for the efficient implementation of the method, and numerical results for the robust solution of two-parameter reaction-convection-diffusion problems, in one and two dimensions.

The refinement strategy is a two-step process: (a) use the built-in error estimator to mark and isotropically hp -refine elements of the (coarse) mesh to generate a finer mesh; (b) use the reference solution on the finer mesh to compute optimal h - and p -refinements of the selected elements in the coarse mesh.

It serves as the fundamental solution to the heat diffusion equation associated with the discrete graph Laplacian, describing how information flows across graph edges over time by exponentiating the Laplacian eigensystem. This paper focuses on the novel concept of the generalized heat kernel of a network, recently introduced by Kalala Mutombo et al. These authors build upon the k-path Laplacian operator for graphs, pioneered by Estrada et al., to incorporate long-range interactions (LRI) into information transmission across nodes and edges of a network/graph. LRI are handled through the use of Mellin and Laplace transforms. This paper makes a notable contribution by highlighting the practical application of the generalized heat kernel. We achieve this by demonstrating the effectiveness of the generalised heat kernel invariants in object clustering with real data using principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, we investigate how incorporating long-range interactions (LRI) impacts object characterization and clustering, revealing superior results compared to conventional diffusion methods. Through experimentation, we show that object clustering remains achievable even with small values of the Mellin and Laplace parameters, contrasting with the requirement of an infinite value in the absence of LRI.},

  abstract     = {A promising approach to quantify reaction rate parameters is to formulate and solve inverse problems by minimizing the deviation between simulation and measurement. One major challenge may become the non-uniqueness of the recovered parameters due to the ill-posed problem formulation, which requires sophisticated approaches such as regularization. This study investigates the feasibility of using spatially distributed reference data, i.e., concentration distributions of reactive flows, which could be obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), instead of isolated points or integral values to recover reaction rate parameters. We propose a combined framework of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and gradient-based optimization methods, which minimizes the difference between the simulated concentration distribution and a given data set by automatic iterative parameter adjustments. The forward problem is formulated as a coupled system of reaction-advection-diffusion equations (RADE), which is solved by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Therefore, a system of non-linear partial differential equations (PDE) acts as optimization constraints, limiting the possible outcomes of the inverse problem. A benchmark test case using a CFD simulation as reference data confirms the validity of the presented method by successfully identifying up to three a priori set reaction parameters reversely. With it, initial relative errors could be reduced from around 150% to 10 − 3 % 10−3% in 13 optimization steps corresponding to 37 simulations. Even after reducing the accessible reference data from 2D concentration distributions to 1D outflow concentration distribution or by adding noise signals onto the reference data with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 5, our framework successfully recovered the parameters with a relative error of ≈ 1 % ≈1% . Both, the chosen LBM and optimization algorithms are implemented in the open-source library OpenLB.},

  abstract     = {The widely used weakly compressible variant of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method suffers from density and hence pressure oscillations. This is due to the particle Lagrangian nature of the SPH method in combination with weakly compressible assumption, explicit time scheme and that the substitutions of the derivatives in the SPH method are central. There are two common strategies how to suppress these issues. One of them is to use numerical diffusive term which is added to the continuity equation in order to suppress the spurious oscillation of density field. The second option is to describe the particle-particle interaction in terms of Riemann problem and use Riemann solver, which provides numerical dissipation, to handle particle interactions. In our work, we deal with the relation between these two approaches. For the constant reconstruction and for the linear reconstruction we show that the usage of Riemann solvers is due to its intrinsic numerical viscosity equivalent to the usage of diffusive terms based on even derivatives, with the difference that the Riemann solvers lead to a significantly higher diffusivity value then the standard diffusive terms. We also discuss the usage of limiters for cases with the linear reconstruction of the solution. Moreover, for both, the constant and the linear reconstruction, we analyze additional terms resulting from the employed Riemann solver also for the momentum equation. Combining these results we obtain equivalent partial differential equations, which are the result of the usage of the Riemann solver.},

  abstract     = {Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are among the most efficient solvers for linear systems of equations and they are widely used for the solution of problems stemming from the discretization of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). A severe limitation of AMG methods is the dependence on parameters that require to be fine-tuned. In particular, the strong threshold parameter is the most relevant since it stands at the basis of the construction of successively coarser grids needed by the AMG methods. We introduce a novel deep learning algorithm that minimizes the computational cost of the AMG method when used as a finite element solver. We show that our algorithm requires minimal changes to any existing code. The proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) tunes the value of the strong threshold parameter by interpreting the sparse matrix of the linear system as a gray scale image and exploiting a pooling operator to transform it into a small multi-channel image. We experimentally prove that the pooling successfully reduces the computational cost of processing a large sparse matrix and preserves the features needed for the regression task at hand. We train the proposed algorithm on a large dataset containing problems with a strongly heterogeneous diffusion coefficient defined in different three-dimensional geometries and discretized with unstructured grids and linear elasticity problems with a strongly heterogeneous Young&#39;s modulus. When tested on problems with coefficients or geometries not present in the training dataset, our approach reduces the computational time by up to 30%.},

To solve the CH equation in two-dimensional (2D) space on a nonuniform mesh, we consider the linear stabilized splitting (LSS) scheme along with the OSM.

The method relies on a newly developed approach for solving fractional ordinary differential equations (FODEs). To tackle the nonlinearity of the problem, we employ a simple quasi-linearization procedure. Subsequently, the solution is constructed using modified radial basis functions (RBFs), where the FODEs emerge automatically. The temporal domain is discretized using the Müntz polynomial basis, while the spatial domain discretization is achieved through the meshless backward substitution method. By conducting a series of problems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, we verify the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed scheme, and compare the computed results with references from the literature. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the promising accuracy and efficiency of the proposed technique for solving time-fractional BBMB equations.},

FV-RKPM amalgamates the strengths of meshfree methods and finite volume methods, offering benefits such as grid independence, conservation properties, and numerical stability. In this paper, we elaborate on the construction methodology for FV-RKPM, alongside its associated integration strategies.

Secondly, we compare several nonlinear Bidomain solvers in terms of execution time, robustness with respect to the data and parallel scalability. Our findings indicate that Quasi-Newton methods are the best choice for nonlinear Bidomain systems, since they exhibit faster convergence rates compared to standard Newton-Krylov methods, while maintaining robustness and scalability.

The symplectic Runge-Kutta method is then applied to approximate the equivalent system and generate a class of semi-discrete systems with high-order accuracy in the temporal direction. The semi-discrete system is then discretized in space using the fourth-order difference method to obtain a fully-discrete scheme that preserves the original energy and mass.

  abstract     = {Generalized Newtonian fluids are challenging to solve using the standard projection or fractional-step methods which split the diffusion term from the incompressibility constraint during the time integration process. Most of this class numerical methods already suffer from some inconsistencies, even in the Newtonian case, due to unphysical pressure boundary conditions which deteriorate the quality of approximations especially when open boundary conditions are prescribed in the problem under study. The present study proposes an improved viscosity-splitting approach for solving the generalized Newtonian fluids in which the viscosity follows a nonlinear generic rheological law. This method consists of decoupling the convective effects from the incompressibility while keeping a diffusion term in the last step allowing to enforce consistent boundary conditions. We provide a full algorithmic description of the method accounting for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. To evaluate the computational performance of the proposed viscosity-splitting algorithm, we present numerical results for an example with manufactured exact solution and for the benchmark problems of lid-driven cavity flow and flow past a circular cylinder. We also assess the accuracy of the method for an unsteady flow around an arrangement of two cylinders in tandem and comparisons with results obtained using a monolithic approach reveal good general agreement.},

In contrast to Part I, in this paper we focus on two of the most popular elements which do not possess a full tensor-product structure in all four coordinate directions. We note that these elements appear frequently in existing space-time finite element methods. In order to build our finite element spaces, we utilize powerful techniques from the recently developed ‘Finite Element Exterior Calculus’. Subsequently, we translate our results into the well-known language of linear algebra (vectors and matrices) in order to facilitate implementation by scientists and engineers.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of numerical solvers of PDEs depends on the approximation properties of the discretization methods and the conditioning of the resulting linear systems. If applicable, the boundary element methods typically provide better approximation with unknowns limited to the boundary than the Schur complement of the finite element stiffness matrix with respect to the interior variables. Since both matrices correctly approximate the same object, the Steklov-Poincaré operator, it is natural to assume that the matrices corresponding to the same fine boundary discretization are similar. However, this note shows that the distribution of the spectrum of the boundary element stiffness matrix is significantly better conditioned than the finite element Schur complement. The effect of the favorable conditioning of BETI clusters is demonstrated by solving huge problems by H-TBETI-DP and H-TFETI-DP.},

  abstract     = {The Burton-Miller method is widely used to solve the problem of solution non-uniqueness in a conventional boundary element method (CBEM). Although this method is very robust, the hypersingular integral kernel contained in its normal derivative equation increases the computational complexity and reduces the computational accuracy. In this paper, a coupled double boundary Burton-Miller method with unique solutions at full wave numbers is proposed. The aforementioned process is done by replacing the normal integral equation of the Burton-Miller method with the virtual indirect boundary element method (VIBEM) integral equation of combined layer potential and using the equivalent relationship between their coefficient matrices. The proposed method inherits the high-precision advantages of VIBEM and avoids the hypersingular integrals of traditional Burton-Miller methods. In particular, no singular integral is present when the plane element is used for discretization. The numerical results of acoustic radiation and scattering show that the calculation accuracy of the coupled double boundary Burton-Miller method is higher than that of CBEM and the conventional Burton-Miller method. Moreover, the condition number of the coefficient matrix is much lower than that of VIBEM. Lastly, the computation time is less than that of the conventional Burton-Miller method.},

We discretise the problem with the finite element method and we compare different model order reduction techniques: POD–Galerkin and a non–intrusive neural network procedures. We show that the classical POD–Galerkin is more robust and accurate also in transient areas, while the neural network can obtain simulations very quickly though being less precise in the presence of discontinuities in time or parameter domain.

The proposed method involves partitioning the main domain into overlapping subdomains, computing local approximations on each subdomain, and joining them together by PU weights to obtain a global approximation. This approach enhances stability, reduces computational costs, and replaces an ill-conditioned linear system with several small well-conditioned linear systems. To handle the weak singularity near the initial time, a time-graded mesh is used to obtain a non-uniform time-stepping scheme, which increases the temporal convergence rate. The convergence analysis of the method is examined to obtain an error bound for the local approximation. Numerical tests are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The application of immersed boundary methods in static analyses is often impeded by poorly cut elements (small cut elements problem), leading to ill-conditioned linear systems of equations and stability problems. While these concerns may not be paramount in explicit dynamics, a substantial reduction in the critical time step size based on the smallest volume fraction χ of a cut element is observed. This reduction can be so drastic that it renders explicit time integration schemes impractical. To tackle this challenge, we propose the use of a dedicated eigenvalue stabilization (EVS) technique. The EVS-technique serves a dual purpose. Beyond merely improving the condition number of system matrices, it plays a pivotal role in extending the critical time increment, effectively broadening the stability region in explicit dynamics. As a result, our approach enables robust and efficient analyses of high-frequency transient problems using immersed boundary methods. A key advantage of the stabilization method lies in the fact that only element-level operations are required. This is accomplished by computing all eigenvalues of the element matrices and subsequently introducing a stabilization term that mitigates the adverse effects of cutting. Notably, the stabilization of the mass matrix M c Mc of cut elements – especially for high polynomial orders p of the shape functions – leads to a significant raise in the critical time step size Δ t cr Δtcr . To demonstrate the efficiency of our technique, we present two specifically selected dynamic benchmark examples related to wave propagation analysis, where an explicit time integration scheme must be employed to leverage the increase in the critical time step size.},

The solution existence and uniqueness of the history-dependent mixed hemivariational-variational inequality based on a Lagrange multiplier approach are proved. Then, a fully discrete scheme is introduced and studied. The trapezoidal rule is used to approximate the integral in the history-dependent operator. For the spatial discretization, the linear finite elements are used to discretize the displacement field, and dual basis functions are used in the approximation of the Lagrange multiplier. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the displacement and the Lagrange multiplier under appropriate solution regularity assumptions.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a low-cost, penalty parameter-free, and pressure-robust Stokes solver based on the enriched Galerkin (EG) method with a discontinuous velocity enrichment function. The EG method employs the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) formulation to weakly impose the continuity of the velocity function. However, despite its advantage of symmetry, the symmetric IPDG formulation requires a lot of computational effort to choose an optimal penalty parameter and compute different trace terms. To reduce such effort, we replace the derivatives of the velocity function with its weak derivatives computed by the geometric data of elements. Therefore, our modified EG (mEG) method is a penalty parameter-free numerical scheme that has reduced computational complexity and conserves the optimal convergence orders. Moreover, we achieve pressure robustness for the mEG method by employing a velocity reconstruction operator on the load vector on the right-hand side of the discrete system. The theoretical results are confirmed through numerical experiments with two- and three-dimensional examples.},

  abstract     = {In this article we consider the iterative solution of the linear system of equations arising from the discretisation of the poly-energetic linear Boltzmann transport equation using a high-order/ hp –version discontinuous Galerkin finite element approximation in space, angle, and energy. In particular, we develop preconditioned Richardson iterations which may be understood as generalisations of source iteration in the mono-energetic setting, and derive computable a posteriori bounds for the solver error incurred due to inexact linear algebra, measured in a relevant problem-specific norm. We prove that the convergence of the resulting schemes and a posteriori solver error estimates are independent of the mesh size h and polynomial degree p . We also discuss how the poly-energetic Richardson iteration may be employed as a preconditioner for the generalised minimal residual (GMRES) method. Furthermore, we show that standard implementations of GMRES based on minimising the Euclidean norm of the residual vector can be utilized to yield computable a posteriori solver error estimates at each iteration, through judicious selections of left- and right-preconditioners for the original linear system. The effectiveness of poly-energetic source iteration and preconditioned GMRES, as well as their respective a posteriori solver error estimates, is demonstrated through numerical examples arising in the modelling of photon transport. While the convergence of poly-energetic source iteration is independent of h and p , we observe that the number of iterations required to attain convergence when employing GMRES only depends mildly on h and p . Moreover, this latter approach is highly effective in the low energy regime.},

They include the weak formulation, well-posedness and existence of traveling wave solutions connecting two states, when the equations are considered as a variant of a conservation law. Then, the numerical approximation consists of a spectral approximation in space based on Legendre polynomials along with a temporal discretization with strong stability preserving (SSP) property. The convergence of the semidiscrete approximation is proved under suitable regularity conditions on the data. The choice of the temporal discretization is justified in order to guarantee the stability of the full discretization when dealing with nonsmooth initial conditions.

  abstract     = {Methods for stabilising the turbulent cascade of potential enstrophy are analysed and compared for a compatible finite element discretisation of the rotating shallow water equations. These different approaches to upwinding the potential vorticity include the well-known anticipated potential vorticity method (APVM), streamwise upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, and a more recent method where the trial functions are evaluated downstream within the reference element. In all cases the upwinding scheme conserves both potential vorticity and energy, since the antisymmetric structure of the equations is preserved. The APVM leads to a symmetric definite correction to the potential enstrophy that is dissipative and inconsistent. The SUPG scheme introduces a consistent correction to the APVM scheme that acts as a backscatter term ensuring a richer depiction of turbulent dynamics. The downwinded trial function formulation results in the advection of downwind corrections, which analysis and numerical experiments show to be quantitatively similar to the SUPG scheme for a turbulent shear flow. The main difference between the SUPG and downwinded trial function schemes is in the energy conservation and residual errors. If just two nonlinear iterations are applied then the energy conservation errors are improved for the downwinded trial function formulation, reflecting a smaller residual error than for the SUPG scheme. We also present new temporal formulations by which potential enstrophy is exactly integrated across each time level. Results using these formulations are observed to be stable in the absence of any dissipation, despite the aliasing of grid scale turbulence. Using such a formulation and the APVM with a coefficient O ( 100 ) O(100) times smaller that its regular value leads to turbulent spectra that are greatly improved at the grid scale over the SUPG and downwinded trial function formulations with unstable potential enstrophy errors.},

The problem is written in terms of the phase formulation, i.e. the saturation of one phase, the pressure of the second phase and the temperature are primary unknowns. We use a first-order time implicit Euler scheme. The spatial discretization uses a fully coupled fully implicit cell-centered two-point flux approximation scheme where upwinding of the flux across an interface between two control volumes is performed for each fluid phase. Under physically relevant assumptions on the data, we prove the maximum principle for both saturation and temperature. We obtain a priori estimates and we show that the discrete problem is well posed. Also, we exploit various a priori estimates as well as compactness arguments to establish the convergence of the numerical scheme toward the weak solution. The open-source platform DuMu X was employed for the implementation of the developed algorithm based on the above scheme. Numerical result are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of this scheme. The test addresses the evolution in 2D of CO 2 injection into a layered aquifer. The algorithm&#39;s convergence with first order is validated by our numerical results, which support the theoretical results. To our best knowledge, this is the first convergence result of a finite volume scheme in the case of nonisothermal immiscible compressible two-phase flow in porous media.},

  abstract     = {Resource harvesting in inland fisheries during a single fishing season is mathematically modeled based on an extended mean field game played by many anglers. The harvesting rate of each angler depends on that of the others through a mean field interaction. Each angler wants to maximize fishing utility, while resource overexploitation is effectively penalized through incentives for conservation. Anglers&#39; fishing activities are represented by controlled jump processes arising as a unique nonlinearity in the extended mean field game. Solving the extended mean field game reduces to the resolution of a forward-backward system containing a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Fokker–Planck equations coupled through the controlled harvesting rate. The average total visiting time per angler during the fishing season is obtained as a byproduct from the forward-backward system, which is used to investigate the scheme of license fee of inland fisheries. A finite difference method is proposed to numerically compute the forward-backward system based on a Picard iteration. The convergence of the numerical solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is analyzed through discontinuous viscosity solutions. Finally, we specify fish population dynamics based on the unique data of the major inland fishery resource Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis during 2023 in Japan.

We investigate the sensitivity of the solution distance from the target function, in cases with smooth and rough initial data. We employ low, and higher-order polynomials in time and space whenever proper regularity is present. The approximation schemes considered are with and without control constraints, driving efficiently the system to desired states realized using non-linear gradient methods.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a unified mixed finite element framework based on a saddle-point formulation that applies to time-dependent fourth order linear and nonlinear problems with clamped, simply supported, and Cahn-Hilliard type boundary conditions. The classical mixed formulations lead to large matrix systems that demand huge storage and computational time making the schemes expensive, especially for the time-dependent problems. The proposed scheme circumvents this by employing biorthogonal basis functions that lead to sparse and positive-definite systems. The article discusses a mixed finite element method for the biharmonic problem and the time-dependent linear and nonlinear versions of the extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equations equipped with the aforementioned boundary conditions. The wellposedness of the scheme is discussed and a priori error estimates are presented for the semi-discrete and fully discrete finite element schemes. The numerical experiments validate the theoretical estimates derived in the paper.},

  abstract     = {A detailed study of the effect of coarctation on the blood flow of the thoracic aorta was carried out by modeling the interaction between blood and the aortic wall. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were performed on the thoracic aorta geometries of healthy and diseased patients obtained from medical images. The pulsating flow of non-Newtonian blood was set by the boundary condition for the velocity in the form of a periodic physiological wave depending on time. As a result, the parameters of blood flow and vessel deformation were evaluated. It is shown that the velocity value at the site of aortic narrowing increases and falls after the narrowing. In addition, it can be noted that the value of pressure in the healthy aorta was higher than in the aorta with CoA, but at the same time, the pressure in the CoA model increased after the coarctation zone. It was noted that the shear stresses for the two models showed little difference and WSS was overestimated in the diseased aorta. As can be seen from the obtained data, using numerical simulation, important characteristics were determined to assess the influence of the fluid-structure interaction during blood flow in the flexible stenotic thoracic aorta.},

Our proposed approach utilizes Chebyshev cardinal functions in two dimensions to obtain a finite dimensional optimal control problem. This problem is then solved using the Lagrange multipliers method by substituting the expansions of the state and control variables in terms of two-dimensional Chebyshev cardinal functions into the objective function, dynamical system, and initial conditions. The utilization of Chebyshev nodes offers a distinct advantage by effectively mitigating the Runge phenomenon, characterized by the undesirable oscillation and divergence of high-degree polynomial interpolants in close proximity to the interval&#39;s endpoints. We extensively discuss the convergence of our method and evaluate its accuracy using three test problems. Our results demonstrate that this technique provides highly accurate numerical solutions for these types of problems.},

This paper proposes a combination of the Eulerian-Lagrangian method and the meshless method of fundamental solutions to solve the advection-diffusion equation. Moreover, the method was used as an evolution model for the sequential importance resampling particle filter algorithm to reconstruct the time-dependent inlet pollutant concentration in inverse problems.

This model can be seen as a reaction-diffusion problem with a polynomial nonlinearity in the reaction term. The efficiency of various numerical approximations across the entire parameter space is closely related to the regularity of the solution with respect to the parameter. We show that if the coefficients and the right-hand side are analytic or Gevrey class regular with respect to the parameter, the same type of parametric regularity is valid for the solution. The key ingredient of the proof is the combination of the alternative-to-factorial technique from our previous work [1] with a novel argument for the treatment of the power-type nonlinearity in the reaction term. As an application of this abstract result, we obtain rigorous convergence estimates for numerical integration of semilinear reaction-diffusion problems with random coefficients using Gaussian and Quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature.

In this paper we propose a fractional Landweber iteration method to solve a two-dimensional time-fractional inverse heat conduction problem. We give the selection of iterations under both a priori and a posteriori rules, and give the proof of error estimates between the exact solution and its regularization approximation. Further more, numerical results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In experiment, we first calculate the direct problem of the heat conduction problem using the finite difference method; then we add random noise to the data and get the disturbed data; at last we compute the numerical approximate solution of the inverse problem with disturbed data by the proposed method.},

On uniform grid-based node sets, the process of subsampling is simple. However, on node sets with high density variation, the process of coarsening a node set through node elimination is more interesting. A novel method for the subsampling of variable density node sets is presented here. Additionally, two novel node set quality measures are presented to determine the ability of a subsampling method to preserve the quality of an initial node set. The new subsampling method is demonstrated on the test problems of solving the Poisson and Laplace equations by multilevel radial basis function-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) iterations. High-order solutions with robust convergence are achieved in linear time with respect to node set size.},

  abstract     = {As we know that, the parameterized Uzawa (PU) method can be very efficient when used to solve the standard saddle point problem, especially, when we have good and accurate estimation of preconditioned Schur complement matrix. In this paper, by taking full use of the special structure of coefficient matrix arising from complex Helmholtz equations, two types of optimized PU (OPU) methods are discussed theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, the convergence factors of these two OPU methods are less than 0.172, and the optimal result of first OPU method can reach 0.0396 with σ 1 ≥ σ 2 &gt; 0 σ1≥σ2&amp;gt;0 , which is currently the best theoretical result in the literatures. Moreover, the second OPU method has better computational advantages compared with the first OPU method as it avoids the inverse computation of W at each step, indicating the less CPU time will be costed by the second OPU method. In addition, the optimal parameters involved in our algorithms consist of constants, reducing the computational complexity associated with parameter selection. Finally, numerical results are given, not only show the effectiveness of OPU methods, but also confirm the rationality of theoretical analysis.},

We propose a truncated version of rSVD, called trSVD, which yields a stable solution with a reduced condition number in comparison to the non-truncated variant, particularly when manipulating the scale or shape parameter of RBFs. Notably, trSVD exhibits exceptional proficiency in capturing the most significant singular values, enabling the extraction of critical information from the data. When compared to the conventional truncated SVD (tSVD), trSVD achieves comparable accuracy while demonstrating improved efficiency. Furthermore, we explore the potential of trSVD by employing scale parameter strategies, such as leave-one-out cross-validation and effective condition number. Then, we apply trSVD to solve a 2D Poisson equation, thereby showcasing its efficacy in handling partial differential equations. In summary, this study offers an efficient and accurate solver for RBF problems, demonstrating its practical applicability.

The studied wood species incorporates three phases: the air, the lumen or matrix and the fibers. Image processing is preformed on a tomographic acquisition with high resolution of some micrometers. It serves to identify the present phases and generates the morphology mesh. The 2D diamond scheme is employed to discretize Fourier&#39;s model posed on the segmented morphology. The resulting algorithm is validated using an exact solution. Optimal numerical convergence rates of second order are recorded. The thermal conductivity is therefore estimated following the 2D orthotropic directions. An emphasis is set on the impact of the orientation of fibers on this thermal property.},

Moreover, these potentials are used in order to study the mathematical foundation of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) in chiral media. It is proven that the approximation of the sought for solution of the direct scattering problem via the MFS is reduced to the approximation of the known boundary data from appropriately constructed systems of functions for which linear independence and completeness on the surface of the scatterer are proven. An inverse electromagnetic scattering problem is presented and studied in order to obtain information about the geometrical properties of a perfectly conducting scatterer of unknown size embedded in a chiral medium.

The new model is designed to achieve three goals. First, it provides a good approximation to the Richards model over a wide range of time scales. More specifically we show that both models characterize a flow with the same dominant components when the ratio of the horizontal length to the depth of the aquifer is small. Second, the new model accurately describes the velocity field. In particular, it is not based on the Dupuit hypothesis, which is often used in the context of shallow aquifers. This allows the new model to be well accurate even in the presence of wells and in aquifers with variable bedrock. Third, the new model can be viewed as a coupling of numerous 1D vertical Richards problems with a 2D elliptic one. In practice, this coupling is treated numerically using a Picard fixed point scheme, avoiding the need to solve any three-dimensional problem. This results in a significant reduction in computational cost compared to solving the 3D Richards problem directly.},

Distributed sources are strategically positioned directly on the real boundary, centered over disks. The method&#39;s efficiency and simplicity are highlighted by its ability to operate without the need for precise data concerning adjacent points. The dual reciprocity method (DRM) is utilized to approximate the non-homogeneous inertial term. Furthermore, the present formulation investigates several factors that influence the convergence of the proposed method, including the number of collocation points, internal points, the radius of the circular disk, and the time step size. Based on the numerical results, it is evident that the method exhibits remarkable accuracy and efficiency when applied to plane elasticity problems including forced, harmonic, and free analyses.

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient numerical scheme to deal with heat transfer problems in pipe flow with a large length/diameter ratio. The generalized finite difference method (GFDM) is combined with a space stepping algorithm (SSA) for the solution. The SSA divides the solution domain into a number of overlapping sections in the length direction of the pipe. Due to the large Peclet number, the heat transport process is dominated by advection, which allows an approximate boundary condition to be applied at the downstream cross section. The problem is then solved section by section. Using the uniform distributed points, the solution matrix for each section does not change, and only the right hand side needs to be refreshed for the changing boundary conditions. This leads to a highly efficient scheme for problems with a large pipe length. To show the accuracy of the numerical scheme, a problem with available analytical solution is studied. Then the method is applied to problems of single pipe with different pipe wall temperature and flow Reynolds number, and concentric annular pipe. Numerical results confirm the stability and efficiency of the GFDM-SSA. The method can be applied to many real world transient heat transfer problems in which the pipe is heated or cooled along its length with arbitrary wall temperature for heat exchange and other purposes.},

  abstract     = {A novel higher-order multi-scale computational approach for efficient nonlocal gradient elasticity simulation of composite materials is proposed in this paper. Based on the use of decoupling technique, raw fourth-order nonlocal gradient equations with periodically oscillatory coefficients are decoupled as the new second-order multi-scale equations for reducing the continuity requirements when implementing multi-scale simulation. Next, a novel macro-micro coupled multi-scale computational model with higher-order corrected terms is rigorously devised for high-resolution multi-scale and nonlocal analysis of composite materials via multi-scale asymptotic analysis. Then, the local error analysis of higher-order multi-scale solutions in the point-wise sense illustrates that establishing higher-order asymptotic corrected terms plays a vital role in investigating the micromechanical mechanisms. Moreover, a rigorous global error estimation with an explicit rate of higher-order multi-scale solutions is first derived in the energy norm sense. In addition, an efficient multi-scale numerical algorithm is presented to effectively simulate nonlocal gradient elasticity problems of composite materials based on finite element method (FEM). And we also derive the convergence estimation of the proposed numerical algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to gauge the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed higher-order multi-scale method. This paper offers a unified higher-order two-scale computational framework for enabling nonlocal gradient elasticity behavior simulation of composite materials.},

The penalty method is employed to enforce boundary conditions. The error estimate explicitly depends on nodal spacing, number of monomial basis functions, continuity of weight functions, and penalty factors, which provides some practical choices among these key parameters in engineering applications. In addition, we offer guidance on selecting appropriate penalty factors to improve numerical accuracy.

  abstract     = {The present study proposes a novel approach for efficiently solving an anisotropic transient diffusion problem using an enriched finite element method. We develop directional enrichment for the finite elements in the spatial discretization and a fully implicit scheme for the temporal discretization of the governing equations. Within this comprehensive framework, the proposed class of exponential functions as enrichment enhance the approximation of the finite element method by capturing the directional based behaviour of the solution. The incorporation of these enrichment functions leverages a priori knowledge about the anisotropic problem using the partition of unity technique, resulting in significantly improved approximation efficiency while retaining all the advantages of the standard finite element method. Consequently, the proposed approach yields accurate numerical solutions even on coarse meshes and with significantly fewer degrees of freedom compared to the standard finite element methods. Moreover, the choice of mesh coarseness remains independent of the anisotropy in the problem, enabling the use of the same mesh regardless of changes in the anisotropy. Using extensive numerical experiments, we consistently demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in attaining the desired levels of accuracy. Our approach not only provides reliable and precise solutions but also extends the capabilities of the finite element method to effectively address aspects of the heterogeneous anisotropic transient diffusion problems that were previously considered ineffective when using this method.},

  abstract     = {Meshless methods are a type of numerical method used to simulate continuum mechanics problems. These methods have been applied to several types of problems, there are a few works using meshless method focused on dynamic problems, but most works study static loading conditions. The current work aims at using two different meshless methods, the Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM) and the Natural Neighbours RPIM (NNRPIM), in a dynamic problem, specifically forced vibrations. This problem requires time integration, therefore three different time integration methods have also been tested, namely: the Central Difference Method (CDM), the Wilson method, and the Newmark method. The CDM is an explicit method, while the other two are implicit. A discretization study was performed to assess the ideal nodal discretization before the numerical and time integration methods are validated. For the implicit methods, different time step lengths were also tested. In the final example damping was introduced. The results prove the validity of the two meshless methods by having similar results to the Finite Element Method (FEM) using the three distinct time integration methods, different loading conditions, and damping.},

  abstract     = {Efficient solution strategies for wave propagation problems with complex geometries are essential in many engineering fields. Immersed boundary methods simplify mesh generation by embedding the domain of interest into an extended domain that is easy to mesh, introducing the challenge of dealing with cells that intersect the domain boundary. We consider the finite cell method that extends the weak form from the physical into the extended domain, multiplied by a small value, to stabilize badly cut cells. Combined with explicit time integration methods, the presence of finite cells with very little support in the physical domain results in tiny critical time step sizes. While the finite cell stabilization limits how small the critical time step size can become, this limit is still restrictive for many applications. Explicit transient analyses commonly use the spectral element method due to its natural way of obtaining diagonal mass matrices through nodal lumping. The resulting method is very efficient since nodal lumping renders the solution of the equation systems trivial while not reducing the accuracy or the critical time step size. The combination of the spectral element and finite cell methods is called the spectral cell method. Unfortunately, a direct application of nodal lumping in the spectral cell method is impossible due to the special quadrature necessary to treat the discontinuous integrand inside the cut cells. The existing approaches to lump the mass matrices of cut cells significantly reduce the accuracy of the approximation. We analyze an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration method to exploit the advantages of the nodal lumping scheme for uncut cells on one side and the unconditional stability of implicit time integration schemes for cut cells on the other. In this hybrid, immersed Newmark IMEX approach, we use explicit second-order central differences to integrate the uncut degrees of freedom that lead to a diagonal block in the mass matrix and an implicit trapezoidal Newmark method to integrate the remaining degrees of freedom (those supported by at least one cut cell). The immersed Newmark IMEX approach preserves the high-order convergence rates and the geometric flexibility of the finite cell method while retaining the efficiency of the nodal lumping scheme for uncut cells without compromising the critical time step size. We analyze a simple system of spring-coupled masses to highlight some of the essential characteristics of Newmark IMEX time integration. We then solve the scalar wave equation with immersed boundaries on two- and three-dimensional examples with significant geometric complexity to show that our approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art time integration schemes when comparing accuracy and runtime. While we focus on the finite and spectral cell methods, we expect other immersed methods to benefit equally from Newmark IMEX time integration.},

These bases are used in a moving least squares approximation to enrich the smooth polynomial bases of the EFG within the singularity-dominated zone in an intrinsic approach. The novelty of the method is that no a priori knowledge of the analytical singularity order is required to reproduce the singular bases, but they are automatically built during the solution procedure. The diffraction technique has been used to model the discontinuity of the notch tip. The effect of various parameters, including the enriched region size, enrichment factors, nodal distribution and irregularities, has been examined. Validation of the method using available analytical solutions or finite element modeling, revealed that the proposed enrichment is quite effective and accurate for displacement and stress components.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces general methodologies for constructing closed-form solutions to linear constant-coefficient partial differential equations (PDEs) with polynomial right-hand sides in two and three spatial dimensions. Polynomial solutions have recently regained significance in the development of numerical techniques for evaluating volume integral operators and also have potential applications in certain kinds of Trefftz finite element methods. The equations covered in this work include the isotropic and anisotropic Poisson, Helmholtz, Stokes, linearized Navier-Stokes, stationary advection-diffusion, elastostatic equations, as well as the time-harmonic elastodynamic and Maxwell equations. Several solutions to complex PDE systems are obtained by a potential representation and rely on the Helmholtz or Poisson solvers. Some of the cases addressed, namely Stokes flow, Maxwell&#39;s equations and linearized Navier-Stokes equations, naturally incorporate divergence constraints on the solution. This article provides a generic pattern whereby solutions are constructed by leveraging solutions of the lowest-order part of the partial differential operator (PDO). With the exception of anisotropic material tensors, no matrix inversion or linear system solution is required to compute the solutions. This work is accompanied by a freely-available Julia library, ElementaryPDESolutions.jl , which implements the proposed methodology in an efficient and user-friendly format.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript investigates the effect of diabatic imparity on two-dimensional ( 2 - D ) transient fins having naturally obtained non-linear variation of temperature-dependent conductivity. The diabatic imparity arises due to asymmetrical convection coefficient on the surfaces, implemented using different Biot numbers on each respective surface of the fin, which resembles pragmatic industrial applications. The transient solution of 2-D fin has been obtained using a Lattice Boltzmann ( LB ) solver, firstly, the suitability of 2 - D LB formulation is established with the validity of the existing results, and subsequently extending the LB formulation for the present study. The numerical solution is determined under the two types of step-changing boundary conditions at the fin root having (i) heat flow and (ii) temperature . Results have been plotted graphically, and these include instantaneous isotherms , equilibrium isotherms , and threshold iso-temporal lines . Reported results facilitate the fin designer to examine the effect of diabatic imparity on the attainment of steady-state and occurrence of transverse temperature gradient on 2 - D transient fin. The reported results provided are pertinent to the pragmatic application and are seldom reported in the literature. The outcomes of the present investigation are eminently informative to practising engineers and will serve as design monograms.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric analysis is an innovative numerical paradigm with the potential to bridge the gap between Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Engineering. However, constructing analysis-suitable parameterizations from a given boundary representation remains a critical challenge in the isogeometric design-through-analysis pipeline, particularly for computational domains with complex geometries, such as high-genus cases. To tackle this issue, we propose a multi-patch parameterization method for computational domains grounded in the singular structure of cross-fields. Initially, the vector field functions over the computational domain are solved using the boundary element method. The cross-field is then obtained through the one-to-one mapping between the vector field and the cross-field. Subsequently, we acquire the position information and topological connection relations of singularities and streamlines by analyzing the singular structure of the cross-field. Moreover, we introduce a simple and effective method for computing streamlines. We propose a novel segmentation strategy to divide the computational domain into several quadrilateral NURBS sub-patches. Once the multi-patch structure is established, we develop two methods to construct analysis-suitable multi-patch parameterizations. The first method is a direct generalization of the barrier function-based approach, while the second method yields smoother parameterizations by incorporating the interface control points of sub-patches into the optimization model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

The problem is mathematically reduced into Navier-Stokes equations. The Coiflet wavelet homotopy approach, a newly suggested computational technique, is then used to solve these nonlinear partial differential equations with their non-homogeneous boundary conditions. The numerical solutions for streamlines, isotherms, iso-concentrations contours, Nusselt number are carefully determined. The solutions so obtained are analyzed through various plots to demonstrate the effects of several physical parameters such as Reynolds numbers (Re), Richardson number (Ri), Grashof number (Gr), Hartman number (Ha), thermal radiation parameter (N R ), chemical reaction coefficient (K), heat generation/absorption coefficient (Q h ), the angle of inclination of magnetic field ( γ ), slipping parameter ( λ ) and Schmidt number (Sc) and their physical insights are also reported. Rigid comparison of with previous studies shows excellent computational effectiveness of newly proposed method. Additionally, according to the results, our recently proposed approach has superior characteristics and strong nonlinear processing capabilities, which render it more appropriate than the Coiflet wavelet analysis method and the traditional homotopy analysis method for tackling complex nonlinear problems.},

These equations form a critical aspect of modeling trace gas sensors. Like other wave propagation problems, the computational problem must be closed with suitable far-field boundary conditions. Working in a scattered-field formulation, we adapt a nonlocal boundary condition proposed in [2] for the Helmholtz equation to this coupled system. This boundary condition uses a Green&#39;s formula for the true solution on the boundary, giving rise to a nonlocal perturbation of standard transmission boundary conditions. However, the boundary condition is exact and so Galerkin discretization of the resulting problem converges to the restriction of the exact solution to the computational domain. Numerical results demonstrate that accuracy can be obtained on relatively coarse meshes on small computational domains, and the resulting algebraic systems may be solved by GMRES using the local part of the operator as an effective preconditioner. These numerical results taken together combine several advanced techniques, including higher-order finite elements, geometric multigrid in curvilinear geometry, native use of complex arithmetic, and incorporation of nonlocal operators. These are tied together in a high-level simulation using the Firedrake library.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants have recently emerged as alternatives to traditional partial differential equation (PDE) solvers, but little literature has focused on devising accurate numerical integration methods for neural networks (NNs), which is essential for getting accurate solutions. In this work, we propose adaptive quadratures for the accurate integration of neural networks and apply them to loss functions appearing in low-dimensional PDE discretisations. We show that at opposite ends of the spectrum, continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) activation functions enable one to bound the integration error, while smooth activations ease the convergence of the optimisation problem. We strike a balance by considering a CPWL approximation of a smooth activation function. The CPWL activation is used to obtain an adaptive decomposition of the domain into regions where the network is almost linear, and we derive an adaptive global quadrature from this mesh. The loss function is then obtained by evaluating the smooth network (together with other quantities, e.g., the forcing term) at the quadrature points. We propose a method to approximate a class of smooth activations by CPWL functions and show that it has a quadratic convergence rate. We then derive an upper bound for the overall integration error of our proposed adaptive quadrature. The benefits of our quadrature are evaluated on a strong and weak formulation of the Poisson equation in dimensions one and two. Our numerical experiments suggest that compared to Monte-Carlo integration, our adaptive quadrature makes the convergence of NNs quicker and more robust to parameter initialisation while needing significantly fewer integration points and keeping similar training times.},

To this end, a MMV-based Brinkman term is proposed to penalize the velocity in solid area, which can expand the region controlled by the NS flow equilibrium equation from fluid to whole design domain, and can also establish the relationship between design variables and governing equations. Then, a MMV-based optimization model of NS flow is proposed and the design variables are updated by the method of moving asymptotes according to the sensitivity analysis. In benchmark examples, we can precisely track the topology boundary with detailed geometric information without the intuitive geometric judgement error. Also, by means of contrasting the results of proposed method with previous work, the effectiveness and advantages of the MMV method can be confirmed.},

  abstract     = {Coupled multi-physics problems are encountered in countless applications and pose significant numerical challenges. In a broad sense, one can categorise the numerical solution strategies for coupled problems into two classes: monolithic approaches and sequential (also known as split, decoupled, partitioned or segregated) approaches. The monolithic approaches treat the entire problem as one, whereas the sequential approaches are iterative decoupling techniques where the different sub-problems are treated separately. Although the monolithic approaches often offer the most robust solution strategies, they tend to require ad-hoc preconditioners and numerical implementations. Sequential methods, on the other hand, offer the possibility to add and remove equations from the model flexibly and rely on existing black-box solvers for each specific equation. Furthermore, when problems are non-linear, inner iterations need to be performed even in monolithic solvers, making the sequential approaches an even more viable alternative. The cost of running inner iterations to recover the multi-physics coupling could, however, easily become prohibitive. Moreover, the sequential approaches might not converge at all. In this work, we present a general formulation of splitting schemes for continuous operators with arbitrary implicit/explicit splitting, like in standard iterative methods for linear systems. By introducing a generic relaxation operator, we find the conditions for the convergence of the iterative schemes. We show how the relaxation operator can be thought of as a preconditioner and constructed based on an approximate Schur complement. We propose a Schur-based Partial Jacobi relaxation operator to stabilise the coupling and show its effectiveness. Although we mainly focus on scalar-scalar linear problems, most results are easily extended to non-linear and higher-dimensional problems. The schemes presented are not explicitly dependent on any particular discretisation methodologies. Numerical tests (1D and 2D) for two PDE systems, namely the Dual-Porosity model and a Quad-Laplacian operator, are carried out to investigate the practical implications of the theoretical results.},

First, the overset topology problem in partitioned polyhedral meshes is addressed, and then a new interpolation algorithm for generally discontinuous fields is introduced. Then, we describe how the gradient approximation of the Finite Volume (FV) method is utilized in order to construct bounded approximations on values on the direction of discontinuities and enhance the accuracy of the low order Nearest Neighbor value (NNV) algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is quantified and validated in various test cases, together with a comparison with NNV.

  abstract     = {Efficient and precise optimisation methodologies, when applied to improve the real performance of engineering devices, must balance the need to reduce high computational cost and maintain accuracy in the treatment of first principles and physicochemical properties. This is the aim of the time– and parameter–adaptive model order reduction technique presented in this article. In contrast to (standard) pre–processed reduced order models (ROMs), the proposed adaptive strategy presents two principal advantages: (i) it does not require any previous information to derive an accurate ROM, which provides a substantial acceleration of solution calculations, and (ii) the periods of full order model calculations can be further reduced when information needed by the optimisation algorithms to derive ROM updates is provided by the previous simulations. Its implementation within the framework of efficient gradient–like optimisation methods requires a careful analysis of the sensitivities computation in order to resolve certain issues inherent to adaptive ROMs. The proposed technique is applied to the optimisation of the performance of a three–dimensional lithium–ion cell described by the electrochemical pseudo–four–dimensional battery model (p4D model). In particular, the results obtained when maximising the energy delivered by a graphite–NMC811 cell and a graphite–LFP cell demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the method.

  abstract     = {Two key challenges in optimal control include efficiently solving high-dimensional problems and handling optimal control problems with state-dependent running costs. In this paper, we consider a class of optimal control problems whose running costs consist of a quadratic on the control variable and a convex, non-negative, piecewise affine function on the state variable. We provide the analytical solution for this class of optimal control problems as well as a Hopf-type representation formula for the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations. Finally, we propose efficient numerical algorithms based on our Hopf-type representation formula, convex optimization algorithms, and min-plus techniques. We present several high-dimensional numerical examples, which demonstrate that our algorithms overcome the curse of dimensionality. We also describe a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of our numerical solver whose latency scales linearly in the spatial dimension and that achieves approximately a 40 times speedup compared to a parallelized central processing unit (CPU) implementation. Thus, our numerical results demonstrate the promising performance boosts that FPGAs are able to achieve over CPUs. As such, our proposed methods have the potential to serve as a building block for solving more complicated high-dimensional optimal control problems in real-time.},

  abstract     = {A neutrally buoyant circular particle motion in a double lid-driven cavity flow (LDCF) is investigated by immersed moving boundary based lattice Boltzmann method, where the top and bottom walls move with constant velocities. To understand the mechanism of particle motion in double LDCF, the influence of the moving wall velocity ratio u w r uwr , initial position, particle size, and Reynolds number on the trajectory and limit circle of the neutrally buoyant circular particle motion in double LDCF is systematically studied. The results show that the trajectory of the particle is obviously different with different afore impactors. As u w r uwr varies, the limit circle is changed accordingly. The limit circle of the particle motion is insensitive to the initial position with negative moving wall velocity ratio except for the initial location of the particle at the center of the cavity with u w r uwr = -1, where the particle is stationary all the time. When moving wall velocity ratio becomes positive, due to the more complex fluid structure or vortices in cavity, some interesting limit circle modes of particle motion are observed. When particle size increases, the confinement of cavity is enhanced. The limit circle shrinks to the center of the cavity, and it can be greatly changed with different particle size for u w r &gt; 0 uwr&amp;gt;0 . With the increment of Reynolds number, the flow is strengthened, and the influence domain and the strength of the secondary vortices are enhanced, where the limit circle of particle motion is pushed away from the secondary vortices generated in cavity. However, the limit circle mode of particle motion is insensitive to the Reynolds number varied from 500 to 5000.},

To achieve this goal, we assume that curved edges are described by polynomials and we increase the dimension of the virtual element space used in Beirão da Veiga et al. 2019. In the numerical experiments, we compare these two methods.

The numerical implementation of the proposed method can be attributed to a numerical integration problem in element analysis, which is mainly divided into the following two steps: firstly, a bidirectional transformation method based on distance function and complex function is proposed to remove the weak singularities of the fundamental solution in integral equation, which is suitable for the weakly singular integrals of narrow strip discrete elements; secondly, a dual sinh method based on complex poles is developed to remove the influence of the nearly singular integrals in the analysis of the plate structures. With this method, the numerical integration in the integral equation can be accurately evaluated, which ensures the accurate calculation of the thermal physical variables of the plate structures. Several numerical examples are presented and discussed to prove the accuracy and versatility of the presented method. The results show that the presented method has the superiority of dealing with plate structure problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, elliptic control problems with the integral constraint on the gradient of the state and the box constraint on the control are considered. The optimality conditions for the problem are proved. To numerically solve the problem, a finite element duality-based inexact majorized accelerated block coordinate descent (FE-dABCD) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, both the state and the control are discretized by piecewise linear functions. An inexact majorized ABCD algorithm is employed to solve the discretized problem via its dual, which is a multi-block unconstrained convex optimization problem, but the primal variables are also generated in each iteration. Thanks to the inexactness of the FE-dABCD algorithm, the subproblems at each iteration are allowed to be solved inexactly. For the smooth subproblem, we use the preconditioned generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method to solve it. For the two nonsmooth subproblems, one of them has a closed form solution through introducing an appropriate proximal term, and another one is solved by the line search Newton&#39;s method. Based on these efficient strategies, we prove that our proposed FE-dABCD algorithm enjoys O ( 1 k 2 ) O(1k2) iteration complexity. Moreover, to make the algorithm more efficient and further reduce its computation cost, based on the mesh-independence of ABCD method, we propose an FE-dABCD algorithm with a warm-start strategy (wFE-dABCD). Some numerical experiments are done and the numerical results show the efficiency of the FE-dABCD algorithm and wFE-dABCD algorithm.},

In this technique, the temporal fractional derivative is approximated by means of the L 1 L1 scheme on nonuniform mesh, while the spatial derivative is approximated by means of a high-order alternating direction implicit (ADI) compact finite difference scheme. Convergence and stability analysis of the suggested method are investigated. To demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the method, we employ the resulting fully-discrete numerical scheme to solve some numerical examples. The results confirm that the rate of convergence of the proposed method is min ⁡ ( 2 − α , ν α , 2 α + 1 ) min⁡(2−α,να,2α+1) in time, where ν is a grading exponent used for generating graded mesh points, while it is four in space.

In our current study, we introduce an innovative approach aimed at resolving the challenges associated with the convergence analysis of a singularly perturbed convection-diffusion problem that exhibits exponential layers on Bakhvalov-type triangular mesh. Our innovation is characterized by two key elements: Firstly, the flexible application of the Dirichlet boundary condition allows us to establish a connection between the analysis of layer functions and smooth functions along the boundary; secondly, by harnessing the intrinsic characteristics of the interpolation defined on triangular mesh, we transform complex 2-D analysis into more manageable 1-D interpolation error estimates. The innovative approach, combined with the newly proposed interpolation technique, culminates in the establishment of an optimal ε -uniform convergence result.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an isogeometric dual reciprocity boundary element method (IG-DRBEM) is proposed for the time-domain acoustic wave problem in 3D infinite domain. The fundamental solution of the potential problem is used to establish the boundary-domain integral equation, which avoids the problem of solving the coefficient matrix repeatedly at different times. On the one hand, in order to maintain the dimensionality reduction advantages of the boundary element method, the classical dual reciprocity method is used to transform the domain integral into a boundary integral. On the other hand, for purpose of satisfying the boundary conditions at infinite distance accurately, a reliable integral convergence criterion is established by adopting the approximate variation coefficient. Furthermore, the effects of different approximation functions, variation coefficients, time steps, number of interior points and elements on the results are discussed in detail by several typical examples. Numerical results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and good stability even when analyzing geometrically complex dolphin models.},

In this paper, we show that DMD does not provide accurate approximation for datasets describing oscillatory dynamics, like spiral waves, relaxation oscillations and spatio-temporal Turing instability. Inspired by the classical “divide and conquer” approach, we propose a piecewise version of DMD (pDMD) to overcome this problem. The main idea is to split the original dataset in N submatrices and then apply the exact (randomized) DMD method in each subset of the obtained partition. We describe the pDMD algorithm in detail and we introduce some error indicators to evaluate its performance when N is increased. Numerical experiments show that very accurate reconstructions are obtained by pDMD for datasets arising from time snapshots of certain reaction-diffusion PDE systems, like the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, a λ - ω system and the DIB morpho-chemical system for battery modeling. Finally, a discussion about the overall computational load and the future prediction features of the new algorithm is also provided.},

  abstract     = {The Volume of Fluid (VoF) method stands out as a widely utilized tool for capturing interfaces in the numerical simulation of multimaterial fluid flow. Numerous efforts have been invested in enhancing its accuracy and efficiency, including the development of analytic reconstruction methods. Despite these advancements, there exists a continued need for further improvements in the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the VoF method in practical applications. In the conventional VoF method, information from neighboring cells is crucial for computing the normal vector of the interface in each multimaterial cell, requiring data from as many as 26 neighboring cells in 3D VoF methods. This paper introduces a novel VoF method named SVoF, which departs from traditional approaches by eliminating the necessity for information from neighboring cells. In the SVoF method, the data provided for interface reconstruction in each multimaterial cell consists of the volume fractions of fluids in several subcells within the cell itself. Initially, these data are determined by the initial conditions. In MMALE methods, these data can be updated through a closure model for multimaterial cells in each Lagrangian stage and remapped in each subsequent remapping stage. The determination of the normal vector of the linear interface in SVoF is achieved through an optimization procedure. The objective function of this procedure is the sum of the squares of the differences between the given volume fractions and the reconstructed volume fractions of the reference fluid in specific subcells. The optimization procedure is solved using an improved quadratic fit golden section algorithm. Similar to traditional VoF methods, the intercept of the linear interface is calculated by precisely matching the given volume fraction of the reference fluid throughout the entire multimaterial cell. The SVoF method is characterized by its ease of coding and implementation, making it suitable for interface reconstruction in multimaterial cells containing three materials. Building upon the SVoF method, a new cell-centered MMALE method is developed, showcasing robustness. This new MMALE method utilizes Tipton&#39;s pressure relaxation model for the closure of multimaterial cells and leverages the SVoF method for interface reconstruction. Numerical results demonstrate that the SVoF method can precisely reproduce linear interfaces, approaching second-order accuracy, and that this new MMALE method exhibits significant robustness.},

  abstract     = {The advection-diffusion equation (ADE) with variable diffusion coefficient can be written in a flux form to avoid rewriting the diffusion term with a drift. However, for solving the flux-form ADE using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), a double first-order derivative approximation has to be used to approximate the diffusion term, which creates non-physical oscillations at any discontinuities. This is one reason why the flux-form diffusion is rarely used in SPH. To prevent such oscillations, the conditions and causes of them are theoretically analyzed, and a new partial diffusive flux format is proposed. To improve the particle consistency, a corrective particle approximation is applied. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by solving four ADE cases with analytical solutions. The results shown that SPH in partial diffusive flux can fully eliminate the spurious oscillations, and achieve second-order accuracy and second-order uniform convergence for contaminant transport problems with discontinuities. Moreover, compared with the conventional diffusive flux format, the numerical error of the proposed method is reduced by at least one order of magnitude. An encouraging possibility for the application of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics with diffusive flux to the anisotropic dispersion is also provided.},

In this study, we propose a reduced-order Schwarz domain decomposition (ROSDD) method tailored specifically for the convection-diffusion equation. Utilizing the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique, the ROSDD method significantly reduces computational costs by considering only a small number of unknowns. Since the equation typically exhibits convection-dominated behavior, we employ the characteristic finite element discretization scheme. Consequently, we derive optimal a priori error estimates to assess the accuracy of our approach. Finally, we conduct some numerical experiments to validate the superiority of the ROSDD method.},

Some newly proposed methods are also compared with the SPTP iterative method by using the experimental optimal parameters simultaneously, and the SPTP iterative method is still advantageous, from the point of view of iteration step and CPU time.

The variables are searched in composite FE spaces based on polyhedral subdomains, formed by the conglomeration of local shape-regular micro partitions. The two-scale characteristic is expressed in terms of refined discretizations inside the subdomains versus coarser normal components of tensors over their boundaries (traction), with respect to mesh size, polynomial degree, or both. General error estimates are derived and stability is proved for five particular cases, associated with stable single-scale local tetrahedral space settings. Enhanced accuracy rates for displacement and super-convergent divergence of the stress can be obtained. Stress, rotation, and stress symmetry errors keep the same accuracy order determined by the traction discretization. A static condensation procedure is designed for computational implementation. There is a global problem for primary variables at the coarser level, with a drastic reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, solving the traction variable and piecewise polyhedral rigid body motion components of the displacement. The fine details of the solution (secondary variables) are recovered by local Neumann problems in each polyhedron, the traction variable playing the role of boundary data. In this sense, the proposed formulation can be interpreted as an equivalent Multiscale Hybrid Mixed method, derived from a global-local characterization of the exact solution. A numerical example with known smooth solution is simulated to attest convergence properties of the method based on local B D F M BDFM divergence-compatible finite element pairs. Application to a problem with highly heterogeneous material is analyzed for robustness verification.},

The virtual element method employs specific projection operators to establish optimal error estimates with reasonable assumptions regarding the solution&#39;s regularity. The voltage potential of the pulsed electric model through the physical media is approximated by using a fully discrete virtual element approach based on Crank-Nicolson temporal discretization. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the expected order of convergence. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are displayed on interface-independent/dependent background-fitted meshes with small edges and large magnitudes of discontinuities across the interface by these experiments.},

  abstract     = {We present a stochastic method for efficiently computing the solution of time-fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) that model anomalous diffusion problems of the subdiffusive type. After discretizing the fPDE in space, the ensuing system of fractional linear equations is solved resorting to a Monte Carlo evaluation of the corresponding Mittag-Leffler matrix function. This is accomplished through the approximation of the expected value of a suitable multiplicative functional of a stochastic process, which consists of a Markov chain whose sojourn times in every state are Mittag-Leffler distributed. The resulting algorithm is able to calculate the solution at conveniently chosen points in the domain with high efficiency. In addition, we present how to generalize this algorithm in order to compute the complete solution. For several large-scale numerical problems, our method showed remarkable performance in both shared-memory and distributed-memory systems, achieving nearly perfect scalability up to 16 , 384 16,384 CPU cores.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new hybrid numerical approach is presented that couples “ghost cell” based immersed boundary (IB) method with the finite volume lattice Boltzmann method (FVLBM). In the implementation process, the grid cells are classified into three types, i.e., “ f l u i d c e l l fluidcell ”, “ s o l i d c e l l solidcell ” and “ g h o s t c e l l ghostcell ”, where the “ g h o s t c e l l ghostcell ” is the first layer of “ s o l i d c e l l solidcell ” near the “ f l u i d c e l l fluidcell ”. As the wall boundary condition is reflected in the “ g h o s t c e l l ghostcell ”, the high–accuracy reconstruction of variables in it will be the key point of present approach. Then, a FVLBM scheme is used to update the distribution function in the “ f l u i d c e l l fluidcell ”, and a least square interpolation based formulation is derived to construct the distribution functions in it. Further, the bounce–back scheme embedded in the streaming–collision lattice Boltzmann method will be employed as the wall boundary condition. Besides, for the class of moving boundary problems, the construction of the distribution function in the “ f r e s h c e l l freshcell ” is also considered. A number of typical benchmarking incompressible viscous fluid flows over both stationary and moving objects are simulated to justify the present method, using obstacles ranging from a stationary and a translating circular cylinders, a rotationally oscillating cylinder, to two more complex flows around an oscillating cylinder in the stationary fluid and in the free–stream. Besides, the temporal and spatial accuracy also are testified by the simulation of Taylor–Couette flow. The obtained accurate simulation results demonstrate the capability of the present hybrid IB–FVLBM for computer simulations of both stationary and moving boundary problems in the incompressible flow regime.},

Then a Kriging surrogate model is used to approximate the vibration model to improve design optimization efficiency. A starting strategy based on the fitting quality coefficient is proposed to determine when to use the expected improvement (EI) infill criterion during the sequential sampling process. Three widely used correlation functions are dynamically selected during the Kriging modeling process to improve the generalization ability of model. In addition, a hybrid whale optimization algorithm (HWOA) is employed to optimize the Kriging hyperparameters, maximize the mean squared error (MMSE), the Expected Improvement (EI) function, and the Kriging predictor. Finally, a comparison is made with the classical DACE toolbox, the optimization procedure using the MMSE criterion and the standard one-shot Kriging-based optimization procedure. Results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and clearly indicate that the required number of samples for optimization can be effectively reduced when starting to use the EI infill criterion at the fitting quality coefficient larger than 0.85.},

Due to its huge involvement, its accurate solutions become a challenging task among researchers. In this context, this article addresses a novel operational-based scheme to capture the accurate solutions of the fractional-order Allen Cahn model. Firstly, the time derivative is approximated by means of the implicit finite difference method. Then, the space variable is approximated by means of Vieta-Lucas polynomials. Novel operational matrices of fractional-order and positive integer order are developed to replace the spatial derivative terms present in the discussed problem. The anticipated computational scheme converts the fractional-order nonlinear Allen Cahn problem to a system of linear algebraic equations which is easier to tackle. Some problems are considered to validate the accuracy, credibility, and reliability of the present method. An inclusive comparative study is reported which demonstrates that the proposed computational scheme is effective, accurate, and well-matched to find the numerical solutions of the aforementioned problems. Convergence, error bound, and stability of the suggested method is investigated theoretically and numerically. It is also noted that the convergence control parameter in spatial direction is depend more significantly than the convergence control parameter in temporal direction.},

However, numerical stability at high Weber ( We ) and Reynolds ( Re ) numbers seriously restricts its application. In the present work, the pseudopotential multiphase LBM is developed by introducing the entropic stabilizers to the cascaded collision operator, and thus, the numerical stability is effectively enhanced. The relaxation rates for different order moments are all determined by fluid viscosities and the maximum entropy condition instead of being user-defined. Furthermore, the surface tension and contact angle can be adjusted in a wide range, which extends the application of the pseudopotential multiphase model. The accuracy and capability of the present model to simulate the complex multiphase flow are validated by reproducing the droplet impact on the flat or textured superhydrophobic surfaces. In addition, a droplet impact on the superhydrophobic surface at We = 1280 We=1280 and Re = 18000 Re=18000 is simulated, in which the Weber and Reynolds numbers have significantly increased. This strongly demonstrates that the present model can enhance the numerical stability in the simulation of large density ratio multiphase flows at simultaneously high Weber and Reynolds numbers, which means the present model can further extend the pseudopotential multiphase LBM to more realistic scientific and technical applications.},

One particular focus is physics-informed neural networks (PINN), which integrate physical principles into neural networks. This transforms the process of solving PDEs into optimization problems for neural networks. To address a collection of advection-diffusion equations (ADE) in a range of difficult circumstances, this paper proposes a novel network structure. This architecture integrates the solver, a multi-scale deep neural networks (MscaleDNN) utilized in the PINN method, with a hard constraint technique known as HCPINN. This method introduces a revised formulation of the desired solution for ADE by utilizing a loss function that incorporates the residuals of the governing equation and penalizes any deviations from the specified boundary and initial constraints. By surpassing the boundary constraints automatically, this method improves the accuracy and efficiency of the PINN technique. To address the “spectral bias” phenomenon in neural networks, a subnetwork structure of MscaleDNN and a Fourier-induced activation function are incorporated into the HCPINN, resulting in a hybrid approach called SFHCPINN. The effectiveness of SFHCPINN is demonstrated through various numerical experiments involving ADE in different dimensions. The numerical results indicate that SFHCPINN outperforms both standard PINN and its subnetwork version with Fourier feature embedding. It achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency while effectively handling complex boundary conditions and high-frequency scenarios in ADE.},

It can be theoretically proven that both of these iterative methods have a convergence rate of 0.1716, which can even be optimized to reach 0.0396. Additionally, we demonstrate that these two methods avoid the common drawback of many methods in terms of parameter selection, where the parameters often depend on the matrix&#39;s eigenvalues . The convergence rate of 0.1716 can be easily achieved through a single constant setup in the proposed two methods. Furthermore, we also compare the algorithmic complexity of the OPU method, the ODS method, and the latest RSS-like method in each step of the iterative process, which demonstrates that the OPU method and ODS method exhibit advantages in computational storage or calculation complexity. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimized iterative methods and the validity of our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments. The results provide strong empirical support for the efficiency and reliability of these methods.},

  abstract     = {The div-curl system arises in many fields including electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. We are particularly interested in the div-curl problem in 2D multiply-connected domains, as a simplified model of flow around airfoils. In such domains, well-posedness of the problem depends on the prescription of additional line integrals (circulation), apart from standard boundary conditions. We apply the DPG method to the ultraweak formulation of the problem and impose the circulation condition in a constrained minimization framework, which results in a mixed problem. We prove the discrete stability with Brezzi&#39;s theory and demonstrate convergence with numerical experiments in a toroidal domain. We also perform h -adaptive refinements based on the DPG a posteriori error estimator, and obtain much faster convergence rate in the presence of singularity. The method is lastly applied to simulate the non-lifting flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil.},

One attractive feature of DeepONets is their versatility since they do not rely on prior knowledge about the solution structure of a problem and can thus be directly applied to a large class of problems. However, training the parameters of the networks may sometimes be slow. In order to improve on DeepONets for approximating the wave equation, we introduce the Green operator networks (GreenONets), which use the representation of the exact solution to the homogeneous wave equation in term of the Green&#39;s function.

An implicit numerical scheme for a time relaxed level set equation with non-zero right-hand side is used in this paper and solved by a nonlinear fast sweeping method.

The AC equation represents a model for antiphase domain coarsening in a binary mixture. To solve the AC equation on nonuniform grids, the AC equation is split into linear and nonlinear terms applying the operator splitting method. As the first step, the nonlinear term is solved using the separation of variables. Next, the diffusion term is decomposed into linear operators in each space direction. In each direction, we sequentially solve each diffusion equation by applying the implicit Euler method on a nonuniform grid to update the numerical solution. Because the implicit Euler method and analytic solution do not depend on the time step size, the proposed hybrid numerical method for the AC equation on a nonuniform mesh is unconditionally stable. In addition, we prove the proposed scheme satisfies the maximum principle. To verify the superior performance of the proposed method, we conduct numerical simulations such as motion by mean curvature, total energy non-increasing property, the maximum principle and unconditional stability.},

In (Schütz and Seal, 2021) [33] , the authors have introduced a two-derivative method for applications where a clear distinction can be made between stiff (to be treated implicitly) and non-stiff parts (to be treated explicitly); they hence obtained a two-derivative IMEX (implicit/explicit) scheme. In many applications, it is important that the non-stiff part is only treated explicitly. Think, e.g., of applications where the non-stiff part contains all the nonlinearities and should for efficiency reasons hence only be treated explicitly. However, this non-stiff part showed up in the second derivative of the stiff term and was hence treated implicitly as well. In this work, we further develop the algorithm from Schütz and Seal in such a way that the explicit part will be treated explicitly only. We define the algorithm, show that it preserves the asymptotic behavior of certain stiff equations, and investigate it numerically. We found that the modification we make has no negative effect on the convergence behavior of the scheme.},

Optimal order error estimates are proved for the first-order energy of the system&#39;s variables. An important ingredient of the estimates is the control of the coupling terms by a tailored testing strategy. The techniques developed here can be generalized to other families of space-time finite element discretizations and related models. The error estimates are confirmed by numerical experiments, also for higher order piecewise polynomials in space and time.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the multi-parameter time fractional radially symmetric anomalous diffusion model used in porous media with initial singularity is considered. Both the direct numerical solution problem and the multi-parameter identification inverse problem are studied. Given the singularity in the initial time, a stable numerical scheme on nonuniform grid mesh is derived by using the L 2 − 1 σ L2−1σ method. To conduct the multi-parameter inversion problem, a novel hybrid Black Widow Optimization and Cuckoo Search (BWOCS) algorithm is proposed to combine the advantages of both the BWO algorithm and the CS algorithm, in order to improve the convergence speed and to achieve high-accuracy optimal results. Numerical examples are given to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme and parameter inversion algorithm. Results show that the nonuniform grid L 2 − 1 σ L2−1σ scheme is efficient to deal with the time fractional radially symmetric anomalous diffusion problem with initial singularity, and the hybrid BWOCS algorithm has high precision and well convergence speed, compared with both the BWO and CS algorithms, which can be extended to other fractional inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {The non-Fourier heat transfer model has gained significant attention in practical engineering applications, particularly under extreme conditions. However, solving the three-dimensional non-Fourier hyperbolic heat conduction equation remains a challenge. A method for solving the three-dimensional Maxwell-Cattaneo-Vernotte hyperbolic heat conduction equation on unstructured grids is proposed, where the total diffusion term is divided into normal diffusion term and cross diffusion term, and the temperature gradient is solved by reconstruction gradient. The convergence and accuracy of this method are verified by calculating the heat transfer process of a three-dimensional hollow cylinder, and the numerical solutions are found to be consistent with existing analytical solutions. Furthermore, the effects of relaxation time on the non-Fourier heat transfer process in three-dimensional hollow cylinder and complex ceramic part are discussed. Importantly, the method presented in this paper is not influenced by the coordinate system or the shape of the calculated region, providing a theoretical reference for solving complex three-dimensional non-Fourier heat transfer problems.},

  abstract     = {The present work consisted in developing a computational routine for prediction and characterization ignition delay time, pressure, temperature generated and energy released in the combustion process in a shock tube. Mathematical modeling considered the high-pressure region of the shock tube known as the conducted section. The Lazarus code compiler was used to generate the unstructured triangular meshes and to implement the computational routines to simulate the propagation of shock waves inside the shock tube. The mathematical modeling used the geometric parameters of the shock tube of the combustion laboratory of the Federal University of Minas Gerais and was based only on the displacement of the shock wave after the diaphragm rupture. The main objective of the work was the development of computational routines to characterize the shock wave parameters of the ignition delay times of conventional diesel to validate the experimental tests carried out in the shock tube conducted by Santana et al. [3] and compare it with the experimental tests and numerical simulations carried out by other authors available in the literature. A linear regression of the experimental tests conducted by Santana et al. [3] with conventional diesel was performed to obtain the Arrhenius equation for numerical simulation of the ignition delay time of diesel under the following conditions: temperatures from 880 to 1300 K, pressures 24 bar and equivalence ratio 1. The results show good prediction between experimental tests and numerical simulations. Were found delay times ranging from 425 to 1890 μs. Considering all temperature range, the difference between the experimental and simulated test was approximately 15%, this difference also can be explained by the measurement in the shock tube, that the ignition delay time was calculated by the time difference between the passage of the shock wave by the pressure sensor and the start of the ignition detected by the luminosity detection sensor. This work is relevant because it was developed computational routine in open software and the results achieved in the simulation were considered satisfactory, since they are in the same order of magnitude as the results found in the experimental tests carried out by Santana et al. [3] and other works.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel, fully data-driven method for forming reduced order models (ROMs) in complex flow databases that consist of a large number of variables. The algorithm utilizes higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), a modal decomposition method, to identify the main frequencies and associated patterns that govern the flow dynamics. By incorporating various normalization techniques into an iterative process, clusters of variables with similar dynamics are identified, allowing the classification of different instabilities and patterns present in the flow. This method, known as hierarchical HODMD (h-HODMD), has been thoroughly tested in the development of ROMs using three different databases obtained from numerical simulations of a nonpremixed coflow methane flame. The effectiveness of h-HODMD has been demonstrated as it consistently outperforms HODMD in terms of modeling and reconstructing flow dynamics using a reduced number of modes. Additionally, the clusters of variables identified by h-HODMD reveal the algorithm&#39;s ability to group chemical species whose behavior is consistent from a kinetic perspective. h-HODMD allows for the construction of inexpensive reduced dynamical models that can predict flame liftoff, identify the occurrence of local extinction and blowout conditions, and facilitate control purposes.},

  abstract     = {Wall-modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES) is considered to be a powerful method in high Reynolds number wall-bounded fluid dynamics calculations. However, little research on aero-acoustic simulation by lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) combined with LES considering wall model has been found. Moreover, the discussion of the dominant geometric parameters of the wall model, which is dedicated to curved boundary modeling and based on a non-fitted Cartesian mesh, is rarely addressed. This paper proposes a WMLES algorithm based on a hierarchical Cartesian mesh and utilizing LBM, including the treatment of dominant geometric parameters . Firstly, based on the Green&#39;s formula, a strategy for obtaining detection point positions is developed using the mathematical formulas to solve the boundary free parameters, such as the normal direction of the curved surface and the distance from the lattice point to the solid-fluid boundary in the given direction. Secondly, a new wall model adapted to non-fitted Cartesian mesh is proposed to improve the precision of pressure fluctuation calculation. This model applies an interpolation bounce-back (IBB) scheme where slip velocity is estimated by an implicit wall function proposed by Spalart, and the eddy viscosity is reconstructed in the near-wall region. Finally, to enhance the accuracy of pressure fluctuation propagation, an appropriate transition zone treatment method of a multi-domain scheme with spatio-temporal second-order is applied and validated with a point source case. The aforementioned algorithms are implemented in a self-developed LBM code and validated through a three-element airfoil 30P30N benchmark, demonstrating their effectiveness and high accuracy in acoustic calculations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, transitional flow characteristics in gyroidal structures are investigated. For specified flow rates corresponding to a range of Reynolds numbers from 400 to 7000, the pressure drop between inlet and outlet is determined. The experimentally obtained pressure drops are computed numerically with the cumulant lattice Boltzmann method which serves as a solver for the weakly compressible flow. Different grid resolutions are used for the simulations in order to investigate grid convergence. In order to create an accurate geometric representation of the setup, we use a newly developed formalism to describe gyroids with finite thickness based on an implicit volume representation. This representation avoids the expensive and inaccurate triangulation of the gyroid structure. Consequently, it avoids the problems encountered with mesh-based representations by providing a compact, local, and therefore inherently parallel representation for geometric computations such as classification of nodes and the computation of subgrid distances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new error analysis of a class of charge-conservative finite element methods for stationary inductionless magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The methods use the standard inf-sup stable Mini/Taylor–Hood pairs to discretize the velocity and pressure, and the Raviart–Thomas face element for solving the current density. Due to the strong coupling of the system and the pollution of the lower-order Raviart–Thomas face approximation in analysis, the existing analysis is not optimal. In terms of a mixed Poisson projection and the corresponding estimate in negative norms, we establish new and optimal error estimates . In particular, we prove that the method with the lowest-order Raviart–Thomas face element and Mini element provides the optimal accuracy for the velocity in L 2 L2 -norm, and the method with the lowest-order Raviart–Thomas face element and P 2 − P 1 P2−P1 Taylor-Hood element supplies the optimal accuracy for the velocity in H 1 H1 -norm and the pressure in L 2 L2 -norm. Furthermore, we propose a simple recovery technique to obtain a new numerical current density of one order higher accuracy by re-solving a mixed Poisson equation .

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose the application of an enriched Galerkin (EG) method to solve the elastic wave equation in the “displacement pseudo-pressure” mixed form, which is known for being locking-free. Unlike the continuous Galerkin (CG) method and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the EG method is based on the weak form of the DG method, and the enriched space combines a continuous piecewise linear vector-valued function space with some discontinuous piecewise linear functions. Specifically, we employ the enriched space to discretize the displacement, while the pseudo-pressure is discretized using the P 0 P0 element space. As a result, compared to the DG method, the EG method significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we adopt a more general θ -scheme for time discretization , which behaves as an implicit scheme for 1 4 ≤ θ ≤ 1 14≤θ≤1 and as an explicit scheme for 0 ≤ θ &lt; 1 4 0≤θ&amp;lt;14 . We establish error estimates for both the semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes. The accuracy of the proposed method is validated through numerical examples , which not only confirm the theoretical analysis but also provide simulations of elastic wave propagation .},

The primary objective is to analyze the complex dynamics of neuronal systems in a discrete setting. Through the application of central manifold and normal form analysis, it has been demonstrated that the system is capable of undergoing Neimark-Sacker and flip bifurcations even in the absence of diffusion. Additionally, when influenced by diffusion, the system can manifest pure Turing instability, Neimark-Sacker-Turing instability, and Flip-Turing instability. In the numerical simulation section, the path from bifurcation to chaos is explored by calculating the maximum Lyapunov exponent and drawing the bifurcation diagram. The interconversion between various Turing instabilities is simulated by varying the values of the time step and the self-diffusion coefficient. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complexity of neural network systems.},

The cost function gradient of OCP for 3D UPDECT is analyzed based on a Hamiltonian costate system.

  abstract     = {We present an application of stable finite element (FE) approximations of convection-diffusion initial boundary value problems (IBVPs) using a weighted least squares FE method , the automatic variationally stable finite element (AVS-FE) method [1] . The transient convection-diffusion problem leads to issues in classical FE methods as the differential operator can be considered a singular perturbation in both space and time. The stability property of the AVS-FE method, allows us significant flexibility in the construction of FE approximations in both space and time. Thus, in this paper, we take two distinct approaches to the FE discretization of the convection-diffusion problem: i ) considering a space-time approach in which the temporal discretization is established using finite elements, and i i ) ii) a method of lines approach in which we employ the AVS-FE method in space whereas the temporal domain is discretized using the generalized- α method. We also consider another space-time technique in which the temporal direction is partitioned, thereby leading to finite space-time “slices” in an attempt to reduce the computational cost of the space-time discretizations. We present numerical verifications for these approaches, including numerical asymptotic convergence studies highlighting optimal convergence properties . Furthermore, in the spirit of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method by Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] , the AVS-FE method also leads to readily available a posteriori error estimates through a Riesz representer of the residual of the AVS-FE approximations. Hence, the norm of the resulting local restrictions of these estimates serves as error indicators in both space and time for which we present multiple numerical verifications in mesh adaptive strategies.},

This expression is suitable for NCDEs and Navier-Stokes equations and can be easily extended to higher order form. In this paper, we mainly construct the discrete Hermite moments based MRT-LB (HMRT-LB) model for NCDEs. Different from the previous Hermite moment LB model, the collision matrix of the present model consists of a block-weighted orthogonal Hermite matrix with d 0 d0 . By the direct Taylor expansion, our model is recovered to NCDEs macroscopically. Then, we analyze the choice of order of EDF and the influence of d 0 d0 on the stability region of the model. At the same time, we also give the changes of the stable region of the model with different d 0 d0 when EDF is taken as a higher order form. Finally, the influence of different orders of EDF and d 0 d0 on stability is simulated by numerical experiments, and the numerical results are in agreement with the analytical results.},

Motivated by immiscible fluids duct flow framework in the filtration of hydrocarbon materials, the objective of this manuscript is to present the numerical study of three immiscible fluids namely, copper oxide-ethylene glycol (CuO-EG) water nano, Saffman dusty, and plain Newtonian fluids in the horizontal channel. For the formulation of the mathematical model, the dusty fluid is positioned between the immiscible layers of the nanofluid and Newtonian fluid. The interface between the immiscible fluids is continuous and non-deformable in nature. The flow is driven by an externally time-dependent pressure gradient. The novel radial basis function pseudospectral (RBFPS) method is employed to solve the governed partial differential equations, and the resulting outcomes are compared with cubic B-spline differential quadrature and finite difference method. The impact of several crucial fluid parameters, comprising the volume percentage of CuO nanoparticles, the dust particle concentration parameter, and various others on velocity profiles, are presented graphically. It is observed that despite being present only in the lower zone, the CuO nanoparticles have an impact on the flow velocities in other zones also. The fluid and particle velocities decrease as the volume fraction of CuO increases.},

  abstract     = {This work describes a formulation for the treatment of submerged rigid solids within the framework of the finite volume method . The proposal consists in considering the solid as a porous region and the hydrodynamic forces that arise from the Darcy terms. The methodology is implemented in an open code that allows large-scale calculations. In the present work, we present the methodology and its verification using cases of study, to demonstrate spatio-temporal numerical convergence and the accuracy of the imposition of boundary conditions. For this purpose, cases that have an analytical solution are analyzed, such as the Pouiseuille flow, the first and second Stokes problems , and immersed walls that move with imposed movement generating different pressures between both faces. A moving cylinder analysis is shown to validate the numerical technique in comparison with cases reported in the literature. The analysis leads to stability conditions against external parameters such as permeability. The ability of the method to represent moving walls and immersed bodies with imposed movement is established.},

  abstract     = {The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is a semi-analytical numerical approach based on the scaled boundary coordinates. Recently, the method which uses interpolations in both the circumferential and radial directions has also been developed based on the scaled boundary representation. However, the stress fields are always discontinuous within the S-elements by both the original SBFEM and the latter method. In this paper, a new class of quadrilateral elements with interior smoothness is constructed by extending the B-net method based on the area coordinates into the S-net method based on the scaled boundary coordinates. In the S-net method, the Bernstein bases are separately applied to discretize both circumferential and radial directions in each sub-triangle of an S-element (or quadrilateral element), and the smoothness conditions between adjacent triangles can be simply represented in the form of linear equations. Then, by using the S-net method, we obtain a new class of quadrilateral elements with interior smoothness and high-order completeness. The shape functions or interpolation bases can be obtained explicitly and determined by the same interpolation nodes of the S-element as the original SBFEM. Some numerical tests also show that the proposed elements can obtain good results.},

  abstract     = {To numerically simulate the acoustic propagation in fluids, a third-order compact finite volume method (FVM) that is suitable for three-dimensional (3D) hybrid unstructured grids is developed. It is used to solve the linear Euler equations (LEEs). Furthermore, the corresponding linear lattice Boltzmann flux solver (LBFS) is constructed. The conservative form of LEEs is discretized according to the third-order Gaussian quadrature rules. Based on the stencils only involving the neighboring cells of the control volume, high-order polynomials are constructed. By ensuring that the variables and their derivatives are conserved in the stencil, the unknown coefficients are determined using the least-square method. To satisfy the moment relations, the distribution function expression is determined by solving the equation system. Finally, the mesoscopic flux calculation scheme for LEEs is constructed based on the derived lattice model. The proposed high-order FVM is suitable for 3D hybrid unstructured grids, which makes it highly adaptable. It makes the selection of stencils and disposal of ghost cells simple due to its compact characteristics. Moreover, the proposed FVM extends the application of LBFS from traditional fluid equations to 3D LEEs. Therefore, the proposed flux solver has the advantages of Boltzmann-based flux schemes. The proposed FVM is used to simulate 3D acoustic propagations and is validated through several numerical cases.},

Inspired by the vanishing viscosity method , a Laplacian regularized eikonal equation is solved and the Soner boundary condition is applied to the boundary of the domain to avoid a non-viscosity solution. As the regularization parameter depending on a characteristic length of the discretized domain is reduced, a corresponding numerical solution is calculated. A convergence to the viscosity solution is verified numerically as the characteristic length becomes smaller and the regularization parameter accordingly becomes smaller. From the numerical experiments, the second experimental order of convergence in the L 1 L1 norm error is confirmed for smooth solutions. Compared to solve a time-dependent form of the eikonal equation, the Laplacian regularized eikonal equation has the advantage of reducing computational cost dramatically when a more significant number of cells is used or a region of interest is far away from the given objects. The implementation of parallel computing using domain decomposition with 1-ring face neighborhood structure can be done straightforwardly by a standard cell-centered finite volume code .},

For the two-phase Navier-Stokes equations, we introduce both conservative and nonconservative ALE weak formulations in the 2d meridian half-plane. Piecewise linear parametric elements are employed for discretizing the moving interface, which is then coupled to a moving finite element approximation of the bulk equations. This leads to a variety of ALE methods, which enjoy either an equidistribution property or unconditional stability. Furthermore, we adapt these introduced methods with the help of suitable time-weighted discrete normals, so that the volume of the two phases is exactly preserved on the discrete level.

  abstract     = {We propose a hybrid Finite Volume (FV) - Spectral Element Method (SEM) for modeling aeroacoustic phenomena based on the Lighthill&#39;s acoustic analogy . First the fluid solution is computed employing a FV method . Then, the sound source term is projected onto the acoustic grid and the inhomogeneous Lighthill&#39;s wave equation is solved employing the SEM. The novel projection method computes offline the intersections between the acoustic and the fluid grids in order to preserve the accuracy. The proposed intersection algorithm is shown to be robust, scalable and able to efficiently compute the geometric intersection of arbitrary polyhedral elements. We then analyze the properties of the projection error, showing that if the fluid grid is fine enough we are able to exploit the accuracy of the acoustic solver and we numerically assess the obtained theoretical estimates. Finally, we address two relevant aeroacoustic benchmarks, namely the corotating vortex pair and the noise induced by a laminar flow around a squared cylinder, to demonstrate in practice the effectiveness of the projection method when dealing with high order solvers. The flow computations are performed with OpenFOAM [50] , an open-source finite volume library, while the inhomogeneous Lighthill&#39;s wave equation is solved with SPEED [34] , an open-source spectral element library.},

  abstract     = {To exactly describe lubrication problems modeling micro-scale influence in rough lubricated contact is unavoidable. In this study a novel computational scheme for lubricated problem is presented based on two-scale homogenization method, which facilitates solving the two-scale problem. Homogenization model of mass fluxes is implemented at the micro-scale domain, and represents the influence of surface topography . A linearization method is developed to derive finite derivatives of mass fluxes at the micro-scale domain defined by scale separation. The key strength of the proposed procedure is the finite difference derivative coupling which represents the lubricated problem inclusive of the effect of surface topography. The effectiveness of the proposed multiscale scheme is validated by comparing with the deterministic method. The numerical results show that increasing topography amplitude can improve the performance of journal bearing in terms of load carrying capacity and friction coefficient .},

In the context of moving meshes, a major advantage of the virtual element approach is the ease with which nodes can be inserted on mesh edges. Demonstrations of node insertion techniques are presented to show that moving polygonal meshes can be simply adapted for situations where a boundary encounters a solid object or another moving boundary, without reduction in degree of accuracy.},

This partitioned scheme can result in non-conforming meshes at the solid-fluid interface, especially when the fluid and the structure meshes contain elements of different characteristic sizes. In this context, a mesh-interpolation technique is required to transmit the nodal information from one mesh to the other. This paper focuses on comparing radial basis functions and k-nearest neighbours interpolations on fluid-structure interaction test cases. Indeed, those are fast and flexible techniques requiring no topological information other than relative distances between nodes, allowing a straightforward transfer of nodal data between non-conforming meshes. This feature is particularly favourable in the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), where remeshing procedures result in significant changes of the finite element discretisation at the fluid-structure interface. Accordingly, our contribution compares the interpolations in a PFEM/FEM partitioned scheme, using 2D and 3D benchmark problems.},

The stable Stokes pair are integrated to facilitate the proof of the inf-sup condition. The comprehensive convergence error estimates for all the variables are explored for the Stokes equations and linear elasticity problem. In particular, we explicitly track the dependence of the error estimates on the physical parameters and illustrate the locking-free property of the proposed scheme, which is non-trivial under the proposed formulation. The judicious balancing of the mixed formulation and the equivalent primal formulation enable us to achieve the robust error estimates for the linear elasticity problem.

  abstract     = {A viscoelastic Timoshenko micro-beam is investigated using micropolar viscoelasticity theory. The governing equations are derived by applying the principle of virtual displacements, and can be used in a variety of problems. The equations are then reduced to the special case of a homogeneous uniform beam and solved for quasi-static elastic and viscoelastic cases. The viscoelastic material is modeled via standard linear solid model. For the elastic case, a closed-form solution is reached, but for the viscoelastic case, the inverse Laplace transform is calculated numerically by utilizing De Hoog&#39;s algorithm. It is shown that the proposed model can capture the size effects , and converges to the classical Timoshenko beam if the beam is thick enough. The model also converges to the micropolar Euler-Bernoulli model if the thickness of the beam is small. The role of distributed couple stress is also investigated in this paper. The results indicate that in a cantilever beam , the distributed couple stress has a high influence on the deflection of the beam, micro-rotation, stress components and couple stress. However, in a beam resting on three supports, it only affects the micro-rotation and the shear stress component in transverse direction ( σ x z σxz ). Further investigation shows an extremum in some of the results over time, illustrating the importance of taking viscoelastic behaviour into account.},

The mechanical degrees of freedom are coupled, through the constitutive equations, with the piezoelectric one considering the linear distribution of the electric potential along the piezoelectric face&#39;s thickness. In order to subdue shear and thickness locking, the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method as well as the Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) method are adopted. Bonding the external faces of shell structures with piezofaces accentuates the smart aspect of solid shells. The middle part of the structure is made of a Functionally Graded Material (FGM) with distributed pores along the thickness. The formulated finite element model is implemented to investigate the effects of some parameters on the bending response of solid shells such as the impact of various configurations of porous FGM, the power law index of FGM and some geometrical parameters of solid shell structures.},

In particular, we present unified hp -HDG formulations for abstract one-field and two-field structures and prove their well-posedness. In order to handle non-conforming interfaces we simply take advantage of HDG built-in mortar structures. With split-type mortars and the approximation space of trace, a numerical flux can be derived via Godunov approach and be naturally employed without any additional treatment. As a consequence, the proposed formulations are parameter-free. We perform several numerical experiments for time-independent and linear PDEs including elliptic, hyperbolic, and mixed-type to verify the proposed unified hp -formulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of hp -adaptation. Two adaptivity criteria are considered: one is based on a simple and fast error indicator, while the other is rigorous but more expensive using an adjoint-based error estimate. The numerical results show that these two approaches are comparable in terms of convergence rate even for problems with strong gradients, discontinuities, and singularities.},

  abstract     = {A new strategy is presented for the construction of high-order spatial discretisations extracted from a lower-order basic discretisation . The key consideration is that any spatial discretisation of a derivative of a solution can be expressed as the exact differentiation of a corresponding ‘filtered’ solution. Hence, each numerical discretisation method may be directly linked to a unique spatial filter , expressing the truncation error of the basic method. By approximately deconvolving the implied filter of the basic numerical discretisation an augmented high-order method can be obtained. In fact, adopting a deconvolution of the implied filter of suitable higher order enables the formulation of a new spatial discretisation method of correspondingly higher order. This construction is illustrated for finite difference (FD) discretisation schemes , solving partial differential equations in fluid mechanics. Knowing the implied filter of the basic discretisation, one can derive a corresponding higher order method by approximately eliminating the implied spatial filter to a certain desired order. We use deconvolution to compensate for the implied filter. This corresponds to a ‘sharpening’ of numerical solution features before the application of the basic FD method . The combination will be referred to as Approximate Deconvolution Discretisation (ADD). The accuracy of the deconvolved FD scheme depends on the order of approximation of the deconvolution filter. We present the ‘sharpening’ of several well-known FD operators for first- and second-order derivatives and quantify the achieved accuracy in terms of the modified wavenumber spectrum. Examples include high-order extensions up to new schemes with spectral accuracy. The practicality of the deconvolved FD schemes is illustrated in various ways: (i) by investigation of exactly solvable advection and diffusion problems , (ii) by tracking the evolution of the numerical solution to the Taylor-Green vortex problem and (iii) by showing that ADD yields spectral accuracy for the Burgers equation and for double-jet flow of an incompressible fluid .},

The new partition of unity functions in the overlapping element are cubic polynomials . Therefore, low-order polynomials can be utilized to augment local approximation space without the linear dependence problem. Moreover, the original polynomial approximation spaces are further enriched by the harmonic trigonometric functions without introducing additional rank deficiencies in the system matrices . Thus, the presented enriched overlapping finite element method (EOFEM) provides very precise eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes by using a very coarse mesh. However, the shape functions in the presented EOFEM do not possess the Kronecker delta function property. Hence, a conforming method that modifies the shape functions rather than the variational principle is proposed to impose the essential boundary conditions . Several numerical examples in two dimensions are then investigated to elaborate on the performance of the presented EOFEM in modal analyses. Besides, a block-diagonal lumped mass matrix is presented and further extended to the structure vibration analysis by incorporating the explicit time integration method. It is proven that the enriched overlapping element is computationally more efficient than the quadratic finite element and the original overlapping element.},

This has a wide range of applications in geophysics, such as the attenuation of seismic waves in fluid-saturated solids and frequency-dependent phenomena in porous media. Therefore, the development of an efficient numerical method for the equation is of both theoretical and practical importance. Recently, local randomized neural networks with discontinuous Galerkin (LRNN-DG) methods have been introduced in [21] to solve elliptic and parabolic equations . Numerical examples suggest that LRNN-DG can achieve high accuracy, and can handle time-dependent problems naturally and efficiently by using a space-time framework. In this paper, we develop LRNN-DG methods for solving the diffusive-viscous wave equation and present numerical experiments with several cases. The numerical results show that the proposed methods can solve the diffusive-viscous wave equation more accurately with less computing costs than traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Efficient solution of the Vlasov equation , which can be up to six-dimensional, is key to the simulation of many difficult problems in plasma physics. The discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) finite element methodology provides a framework for the development of stable (in the sense of Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi conditions) finite element formulations, with built-in mechanisms for adaptivity. While DPG has been studied extensively in the context of steady-state problems and to a lesser extent with space-time discretizations of transient problems, relatively little attention has been paid to time-marching approaches. In the present work, we study a first application of time-marching DPG to the Vlasov equation, using backward Euler for a Vlasov-Poisson discretization . We demonstrate adaptive mesh refinement for two problems: the two-stream instability problem, and a cold diode problem. We believe the present work is novel both in its application of unstructured adaptive mesh refinement (as opposed to block-structured adaptivity, which has been studied previously) in the context of Vlasov-Poisson, as well as in its application of DPG to the Vlasov-Poisson system. We also discuss extensive additions to the Camellia library in support of both the present formulation as well as extensions to higher dimensions , Maxwell equations , and space-time formulations.},

  abstract     = {Processes described by the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation often arise in heterogeneous media. Of particular interest is the case of layered or otherwise composite media exhibiting many layers or other intricate geometric complexity. Numerical models for processes in these types of media are generally accompanied by a significant computational cost due to the large number of grid nodes required to capture the detail of the heterogeneous domain. An approach addressing this issue involves obtaining approximate solutions on a coarse grid comprised of a small number of nodes and reconstructing a solution on a fine grid comprising a large number of nodes. In this paper, we discuss a projection-based framework for coarse-to-fine-grid approximation methods, which is used to derive a dual-grid mapping method. We initially utilise an interpolation-based mapping, and then consider a new discretisation-based adaptive mapping defined through the solution of coupled problems on subsets of the fine grid. With our new adaptive dual-grid mapping method, we are able to accurately approximate complex solutions on very coarse grids and reconstruct much finer scale approximations on fine grids. Code implementing the developed methods is provided and also applied to several test cases, where accuracy and significantly reduced computational cost are demonstrated in comparison to a numerical solution applied directly on the fine grid.},

  abstract     = {As a powerful tool to investigate turbulent flows laden with finite-size particles, the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM)&#39;s capability to contribute to a particle-resolved simulation of particle-laden homogeneous shear turbulence (HST) has yet to be realized. To capture the turbulence-particle interactions more accurately, the interpolated-bounce-back schemes combined with the momentum-exchange method that possesses second-order accuracy are adopted to treat the no-slip condition on particle surfaces and compute the hydrodynamic force/torque. However, this choice brings extra difficulties in enforcing the shear periodic boundaries due to the absence of fluid information in solid regions. The present study resolves these difficulties by designing a scheme to construct the distribution functions in the particle gaps based on the lubrication theory and an algorithm for the “refilling” process near the shear periodic boundaries. With these developments, a direct numerical simulation of particle-laden HST is achieved with LBM. The turbulence modulation effects induced by particles are briefly discussed.},

  abstract     = {Agglomeration-based strategies are important both within adaptive refinement algorithms and to construct scalable multilevel algebraic solvers. In order to automatically perform agglomeration of polygonal grids, we propose the use of Machine Learning (ML) strategies, that can naturally exploit geometrical information about the mesh in order to preserve the grid quality, enhancing performance of numerical methods and reducing the overall computational cost. In particular, we employ the k-means clustering algorithm and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to partition the connectivity graph of a computational mesh. Moreover, GNNs have high online inference speed and the advantage to process naturally and simultaneously both the graph structure of mesh and the geometrical information, such as the areas of the elements or their barycentric coordinates. These techniques are compared with METIS, a standard algorithm for graph partitioning, which is meant to process only the graph information of the mesh. We demonstrate that performance in terms of quality metrics is enhanced for ML strategies. Such models also show a good degree of generalization when applied to more complex geometries, such as brain MRI scans, and the capability of preserving the quality of the grid. The effectiveness of these strategies is demonstrated also when applied to MultiGrid (MG) solvers in a Polygonal Discontinuous Galerkin (PolyDG) framework. In the considered experiments, GNNs show overall the best performance in terms of inference speed, accuracy and flexibility of the approach.},

  abstract     = {To investigate the fluid surfactant material on three-dimensional objects, we herein develop a simple and practical model based on phase-field method and design its efficient algorithm. The binary fluids and surfactant are represented by two order parameters. The fluid evolution is governed by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. To achieve high-performance computation, a linear semi-implicit scheme with stabilizers is proposed for the phase-field type equations in time. The projection method with pressure correction is used to decouple the velocity and the pressure. Based on the closest-point type embedded narrow domain method and a simple pseudo-Neumann boundary treatment, the calculation on curved surface is extended into a narrow band region including the surface. The surface spatial operators are approximately replaced by the standard spatial operators. In the three-dimensional narrow band, the finite difference method is used to discretize the equations on staggered grids. The mass compensation and vector projection techniques are designed to obtain physically meaningful solutions. In each time iteration , the proposed algorithm is efficient to implement. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method is capable to simulate surfactant-laden phase separation, fluid instabilities, and coarsening dynamics with variable mobility on various surfaces.},

We discuss when such measures supported in an interval are convex and demonstrate how convexity is preserved under multiplication by certain multipliers and under the intertwining product. A key message to be delivered from this work is: any integrable function f on the interval with a polynomial expansion that has relatively fast absolute convergence, can be decomposed into a non-unique pair of positive convex interval probabilities ( f + , f − ) ∈ E λ ′ × E λ ′ (f+,f−)∈Eλ′×Eλ′ up to normalization, in the sense that f = f + − f − f=f+−f− , where E λ ′ Eλ′ is a class of convex functions. Consequently not only the study of an interval distribution is reduced to the study of the properties of class E λ ′ Eλ′ , but also the discontinuous probabilistic Galerkin schemes can be simplified. As concrete examples the decomposition of polynomials and truncated normal distribution are computed and graphically illustrated. Such interval measures lead to localized spherical probability measures, and as a convex expression of probability measure is a Jensen type inequality for spherical random variables. Based on the spherical information entropy models, one dependent on the domain partition and the other not, we propose three minimization formulations for the probabilistic finite element method, including one that mixes the least-squares and entropy models.},

  abstract     = {Fluid flow control problems play a crucial role in various industrial applications. The optimal control of the Navier-Stokes equations poses a significant challenge. By employing Oseen&#39;s approximation to linearize the problem, we encounter a series of large sparse structured linear systems . These coefficient matrices exhibit a two-by-two block structure with square blocks. Leveraging this block structure, we exploit matrix splitting preconditioners . Theoretical analysis indicates that the real parts of all eigenvalues of preconditioned matrix are equal to 1/2. A large number of eigenvalues are clustered in ( 1 ± i ) / 2 (1±i)/2 . The imaginary part of the eigenvalues is bounded explicitly. The eigenvalue distribution predicts the fast convergence of Krylov subspace methods . To avoid solving the saddle point subsystems in the preconditioning procedure, we propose a practical variant of the preconditioner. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that if the approximation is sufficiently close to Schur complement , the eigenvalues of the modified preconditioned matrix will lie within a circle centered at the original eigenvalues with a radius less than 1. This implies that the modified preconditioner exhibits excellent performance in terms of preconditioning. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the generalized minimal residual method, when combined with the proposed preconditioners, proves to be an efficient and effective solution for Oseen&#39;s control optimization with a variable viscosity coefficient. The number of iterations required by the preconditioned methods remains unaffected by the mesh size used in finite element discretization and only marginally depends on the regularization parameter .},

Then a weakly coupled nonlinear diffusion system is developed for simultaneous restoration and binarization of degraded document images. In this diffusion system, the first equation is used to estimate background component and the second equation is responsible for the foreground component. The restored and binarized images are finally obtained by the estimated background and foreground components, respectively. Two coupled diffusion equations are solved alternately by explicit finite differencing. The proposed model is tested on some degraded document images that represent five types of typical degradations including bleed-through, complex background, page stains, stamps and smeared ink, and is compared with eight closely related models for degraded document binarization, qualitatively and quantitatively. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed model has shown promising results in terms of restoration and binarization of degrade document images.},

Fictitious elements, continuous extensions and the nonlinear two-point flux idea can all be inherited from the triangular case. Therefore, the monotonicity of the scheme is easily proved only by the assembling of some triangles&#39; element stiff matrices. Thirdly, the agreeable adaptability for distorted grids is completely borned. The strict convexity restriction on the grids can also be removed, the concave or severely distorted polygonal (such as quadrilateral) grids are transformed as the convex and general regular triangles.

  abstract     = {Fractional vector calculus is the building block of the fractional partial differential equations that model non-local or long-range phenomena, e.g., anomalous diffusion , fractional electromagnetism, and fractional advection-dispersion. In this work, we reformulate a type of fractional vector calculus that uses Caputo fractional partial derivatives and discretize this reformulation using discrete exterior calculus on a cubical complex in the structure-preserving way, meaning that the continuous-level properties curl α grad α = 0 curlαgradα=0 and div α curl α = 0 divαcurlα=0 hold exactly on the discrete level. We discuss important properties of our fractional discrete exterior derivatives and verify their second-order convergence in the root mean square error numerically. Our proposed discretization has the potential to provide accurate and stable numerical solutions to fractional partial differential equations and exactly preserve fundamental physics laws on the discrete level regardless of the mesh size .},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) architectures have been recently explored to accelerate hemodynamics simulations by leveraging mathematical models for blood flow and empirical data. In this paper, a variable separated physics-informed neural networks based on adaptive weighted loss functions (AW-vsPINN) is developed for blood flow model in arteries. In particular, sub-neural networks are proposed to separately predict the unknown scalar state variables by sharing the same input layer. The AW-vsPINN adaptively adjusts the weights of loss terms by the minmax algorithm, which will be updated synchronously along with the network parameters and can balance the contributions of different loss terms during training. The two-stage optimization is implemented to train the neural networks. Specifically, the Adam optimizer is iterated for initial steps with the learning rate generated by the inverse time decay scheduler, and then the L-BFGS optimizer continues to train until the loss converges. Numerical results illustrate that the AW-vsPINN can remarkably improve prediction accuracy and enhance the ability of generalization compared to the conventional PINN. The proposed AW-vsPINN framework has high potential in predicting the blood flow information in cardiovascular disease.},

This paper examines the prediction of bending characteristics of the Euler-Bernoulli beam using Moore-Gibson-Thompson (MGT) thermoelasticity theory in conjunction with nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT). The coupled equations for dimensionless deflection and temperature change with ramp-type heating boundary conditions are formulated and solved using the Laplace transform method and the wavelet approximation method. The stiffness softening and hardening effects due to nonlocal and length-scale parameters are assessed, and their discrepancies are discussed. Findings further reveal that the impact of the thermal relaxation parameter on deflection and temperature is negligible. Moreover, the different aspect ratios of the beam&#39;s structure depict the prominently behavior of structural simulations in bending.},

The supercloseness and superconvergence estimates of order O ( h 2 + τ 2 ) O(h2+τ2) in H 1 H1 norm are derived without the restriction between the time step τ and the mesh size h . Firstly, a time discrete system is established to split the error into two parts - the temporal error and spatial error, and the regularity of the solution of the time discrete system is deduced with the help of mathematical induction . Then the numerical solution is bounded in L ∞ L∞ norm by the spatial error which leads to the above unconditional supercloseness property, and the global superconvergence result is deduced through interpolation post-processing technique. Lastly, two numerical examples are provided to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and to show the big advantage of the proposed MFDSD method over the Galerkin FEM.},

In this work, we derive a rainfall weather derivative price model, based in the assumption that the rainfall dynamics follows a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To calculate the price of the option we arrive at a two dimensional time dependent partial differential equation, where the spatial variables are the rainfall index and the total rainfall. Appropriate boundary conditions are suggested and they differ from the boundaries presented in literature in similar contexts. To compute the approximate solutions of the partial differential equation, we propose an explicit numerical method in order to deal efficiently with the different choices of the coefficients involved in the equation, that depend on the rainfall defice (or excess) and on the precipitation (amount of rain). Being an explicit numerical method, it will be conditionally stable and we discuss the stability region of the numerical method and its order of convergence. In the end we examine two test cases where the parameters of the model presented are estimated based on precipitation data.},

We solve one- and two-dimensional problems whose solutions are smooth, singular, and/or exhibit strong gradients.
