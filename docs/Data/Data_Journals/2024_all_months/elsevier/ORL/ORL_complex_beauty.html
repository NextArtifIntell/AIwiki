It is well-known that BASTA / ASTA holds in the framework of a discrete-time process with an imbedded arrival process without regard to scheduling rules. However, when scheduling rules are invoked, it is not always clear whether arrivals see time averages as asserted by the general theory. We resolve this issue so that BASTA / ASTA holds regardless of the scheduling rule at play.},

  abstract     = {Consider a LCFS-PR M / G / 1 queue and assume that at time t = 0 , there are n + 1 customers c 1 , c 2 , . . . , c n + 1 who arrived in that order. In addition, at time t = 0 there is an additional customer c with service requirement x &gt; 0 who makes an admission request. At time t = 0 , the system&#39;s manager should decide whether to let c join the system or not. To this end, the manager wants to evaluate the externalities generated by c , i.e., the additional waiting time that c 1 , c 2 , … , c n + 1 will suffer as a consequence of the admission of c . We assume that at the decision epoch the manager knows only n , x , the remaining service time of c n + 1 (who was getting service just before c had made his admission request) and the total workload at t = 0 . In a previous work by Jacobovic, Levering and Boxma (2023), it was shown that the manager can compute the expected externalities (i.e., the natural predictor for the externalities value) but not their variance (i.e., the conventional measure of the predictor&#39;s accuracy). Motivated by this problem, in the current work, we study a convex piecewise-linear program which yields the spectrum of variance values which are consistent with the manager&#39;s information.},

This integration often uses Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations to represent the chosen ML model, that is often an Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their widespread use. However, ANNs frequently contain a large number of parameters, resulting in MIP formulations impractical to solve. In this paper we showcase the effectiveness of a ANN pruning, when applied to models prior to their integration into MIPs. We discuss why pruning is more suitable in this context than other ML compression techniques, and we highlight the potential of appropriate pruning strategies via experiments on MIPs used to construct adversarial examples to ANNs. Our results demonstrate that pruning offers remarkable reductions in solution times without hindering the quality of the final decision, enabling the resolution of previously unsolvable instances.},

As an application, we propose a Newton–Raphson algorithm on the log price that converges rapidly for all price ranges when using a new lower bound as an initial guess. Our new algorithm is a better alternative to the widely used naive Newton–Raphson algorithm, whose convergence is slow for extreme option prices.},

While the properties that ensure the global stability of these chains are well studied, their establishment often relies on the fulfillment of a certain splitting condition. We address the challenges of verifying the splitting condition by introducing simple, applicable conditions that ensure global stability. The simplicity of these conditions is demonstrated through various examples including autoregressive processes, portfolio allocation problems and resource allocation dynamics.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a risk probability minimization problem for finite horizon partially observable semi-Markov decision processes, which are the fairly most general models for stochastic dynamic systems. In contrast to the expected discounted and average criteria, the optimality investigated in this paper is to minimize the probability that the accumulated rewards do not reach a prescribed profit level at the finite terminal stage. First, the state space is augmented as the joint conditional distribution of the current unobserved state and the remaining profit goal. We introduce a class of policies depending on observable histories and a class of Markov policies including observable process with the joint conditional distribution. Then under mild assumptions, we prove that the value function is the unique solution to the optimality equation for the probability criterion by using iteration techniques. The existence of ( ϵ -)optimal Markov policy for this problem is established. Finally, we use a bandit problem with the probability criterion to demonstrate our main results in which an effective algorithm and the corresponding numerical calculation are given for the semi-Markov model. Moreover, for the case of reduction to the discrete-time Markov model, we derive a concise solution.},

While this principle is generally applicable, it is often only taught for problems with finite or countable state spaces in order to sidestep measure-theoretic complexities. Therefore, it cannot be applied to classic models such as inventory management and dynamic pricing models that have continuous state spaces, and students may not be aware of the possible challenges involved in studying dynamic programming models with general state spaces. To address this, we provide conditions and a self-contained simple proof that establish when the principle of optimality for discounted dynamic programming is valid. These conditions shed light on the difficulties that may arise in the general state space case. We provide examples from the literature that include the relatively involved case of universally measurable dynamic programming and the simple case of finite dynamic programming where our main result can be applied to show that the principle of optimality holds.},

We present two cases for which primal separation is solvable in polynomial time.

A polyhedral study for the 1-DCNDP is conducted, and new aggregated inequalities are provided for the 2-DCNDP. The computational experiments show that the 2-DCNDP with aggregated inequalities outperforms the one with disaggregated inequalities for graphs with a density of at least 0.5%. We also study the strategic vaccine allocation problem as a real-world application of the DCNDP and conduct a set of computational experiments on a simulated contact network of NL.

While QCQPs are NP-hard in general, they admit a natural convex relaxation via the standard semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation. In this paper we study when the convex hull of the epigraph of a QCQP coincides with the projected epigraph of the SDP relaxation. We present a sufficient condition for convex hull exactness and show that this condition is further necessary under an additional geometric assumption. The sufficient condition is based on geometric properties of Γ, the cone of convex Lagrange multipliers, and its relatives Γ 1 Γ1 and Γ ∘ Γ∘ .},

We call this problem the Minimum Sudoku Clue Problem (MSCP). We formulate MSCP as a binary bilevel linear program, present a class of globally valid inequalities, and provide a computational study on 50 MSCP instances of 9 by 9 Sudoku grids. Using a general bilevel solver, we solve 95% of instances to optimality, and show that the solution process benefits from the addition of a moderate amount of inequalities.

  abstract     = {The random consideration set choice model is a recently proposed choice model that can capture the stochastic choice behavior of consumers. One advantage of the random consideration set choice model is that it can accommodate some phenomena that cannot be explained by the multinomial logit model . In this paper, we prove revenue bounds when the attention probabilities and preference order over products change for the random consideration set model. The bounds proposed can be used to control revenue differences when consumers&#39; preference over product changes and can be useful for settings like online assortment optimization with a non-stationary environment.},

  abstract     = {In many service systems, the staffing decisions must be made before the arrival rate is known with certainty. Thus, it is more appropriate to consider the arrival rate as a random variable at the time of the staffing decision. Motivated by this observation, we study the staffing problem in a service system modeled as an Erlang-A queue facing a random arrival rate. For linear staffing costs, linear waiting costs, and a cost per customer abandonment, we propose a policy that is based on modifying the well-known square-root safety staffing policy to explicitly account for the randomness in the arrival rate. Our primary contribution is to show that our proposed policy is “universally optimal”, i.e., irrespective of the magnitude of randomness in the arrival rate, the optimality gap between our proposed policy and the exact optimal policy remains bounded as the system size grows large. This is important because earlier performance guarantees for Erlang-A queues either (1) are not universal and offer performance guarantees that depend on the magnitude of uncertainty in the arrival rate or (2) are universal but assume a deterministic arrival rate. The practical relevance of this provable robustness is that our proposed policy is a “one-size-fits-all” as it is guaranteed to perform well for all levels of arrival rate uncertainty.},

We restrict ourselves to the important case when P is a 0/1-polytope. Schulz and Weismantel showed that no more than O ( n log 2 ⁡ n ‖ c ‖ ∞ ) O(nlog2⁡n‖c‖∞) calls to an augmentation oracle are required. This upper bound can be improved to O ( n log 2 ⁡ ‖ c ‖ ∞ ) O(nlog2⁡‖c‖∞) using the early-stopping policy proposed in 2018 by Le Bodic, Pavelka, Pfetsch, and Pokutta. Considering both the maximum ratio augmentation variant of the method as well as its approximate version, we show that these upper bounds are essentially tight by maximizing over a n -dimensional simplex with vectors c such that ‖ c ‖ ∞ ‖c‖∞ is either n or 2 n 2n .},

Decision problems for these systems are high-dimensional Markov decision processes (MDPs) and are thus notoriously difficult to solve. We present a decomposition result that reduces such an MDP to two-dimensional MDPs, enabling structural analyses and computations. Leveraging this decomposition, we (i) show that pooling data can lead to significant cost reductions compared to not pooling, and (ii) prove that the optimal policy for the condition-based maintenance problem is a control limit policy, while for the spare parts management problem, it is an order-up-to level policy, both dependent on the pooled data.},

Inspired by the celebrated LASSO regression and its recent variant partially egalitarian LASSO (PELASSO) developed in [1] in the context of the forecast combinations problem in econometrics in [1] , we regularize the mean-variance portfolio optimization of Markowitz by adding two regularizing terms that essentially zero out portfolio weights of some of the assets in the portfolio and select and shrink portfolio weights of the remaining assets towards equal weights to hedge against parameter estimation risk. We solve our PEPS formulations by applying Gurobi 9.0 mixed integer optimization (MIO) solver that allow us to tackle large-scale portfolio problems. We test our PEPS portfolios against an array of classical portfolio optimization strategies on a number of datasets in the US equity markets. The PEPS portfolios exhibit the highest out-of-sample Sharpe ratios in all instances considered.},

  abstract     = {We provide faster algorithms for approximating the optimal transport distance, e.g. earth mover&#39;s distance, between two discrete probability distributions on n elements. We present two algorithms which compute couplings between marginal distributions with an expected transportation cost that is within an additive ϵ of optimal in time O ˜ ( n 2 / ϵ ) O˜(n2/ϵ) ; one algorithm is straightforward to parallelize and implementable in depth O ˜ ( 1 / ϵ ) O˜(1/ϵ) . Further, we show that additional improvements on our results must be coupled with breakthroughs in algorithmic graph theory.},

  abstract     = {We consider the clustering aggregation problem in which we are given a set of clusterings and want to find an aggregated clustering which minimizes the sum of mismatches to the input clusterings. In the binary case (each clustering is a bipartition) this problem was known to be NP-hard under Turing reductions. We strengthen this result by providing a polynomial-time many-one reduction. Our result also implies that no 2 o ( n ) ⋅ | I ′ | O ( 1 ) 2o(n)⋅|I′|O(1) -time algorithm exists that solves any given clustering instance I ′ I′ with n elements, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. On the positive side, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of input clusterings.},
