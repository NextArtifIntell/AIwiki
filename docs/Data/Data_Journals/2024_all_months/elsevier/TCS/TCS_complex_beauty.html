  abstract     = {The gathering of mobile agents in the presence of Byzantine faults is first studied by Dieudonné et al. Authors provide a polynomial time algorithm handling any number of weak Byzantine agents in the presence of at least one good agent considering start-up delays, i.e., the good agents may not wake up at the same time. Hirose et al. [1] come up with an algorithm considering start-up delays that use a strong team of at least 4 f 2 + 8 f + 4 many good agents but runs much faster than that of Dieudonné et al. Later, Hirose et al. [2] provided another polynomial time algorithm for gathering in the presence of at least 7 f + 7 good agents. This algorithm works considering start-up delay and achieves simultaneous termination. However, this algorithm depends on the length of the largest ID in the system. We, in this work, provide an algorithm considering start-up delays of the good agents, reducing the number of good agents w.r.t. [1] to f 2 + 4 f + 9 , and good agents achieve simultaneous termination. Our algorithm runs faster than [2] when the ID range of the good agents is significantly smaller in comparison to the ID range of all the agents. We also provide a much faster O ( n 2 ) time algorithm for trees using 3 f + 2 agents handling start-up delays and guaranteeing simultaneous termination on a restricted ID range.},

  abstract     = {An automata network is a finite assembly of interconnected entities endowed with a set of local maps defined over a common finite alphabet. These relationships are represented through an interaction graph. Together with the local functions, an assignment known as an update scheme directs the evolution of the network by updating specific subsets of entities at discrete time steps. Despite the scrutiny of interaction graphs and update schemes, their profound impact on automata network dynamics remains largely open. This work investigates the intricate interplay between these aspects, with a focus on how update schemes can counterbalance constraints stemming from symmetric local interactions. This paper is the third of a series about intrinsic universality, a notion that assesses both dynamical and computational complexity, encompassing transient behaviors, attractors, and prediction or reachability problems. We consider four update modes—parallel, block-sequential, local clocks, and general periodic— along with several families of symmetric signed conjunctive boolean networks defined by local constraints on signs. Our main result is to show a diagonal complexity leap in this two-dimensional landscape: the stronger the local constraints the higher the level of asynchrony required to obtain intrinsic universality or increase in complexity. We also show how in some cases asynchronism allows to simulate directed interactions from undirected ones with the same local rules.},

Letting Σ be the alphabet of allowed characters, and letting η and ϒ be the longest string length and sum of all string lengths in P ∪ F , respectively, we show that NPCS is fixed-parameter tractable in | P | with time complexity O ( 2 | P | ⋅ ϒ ⋅ | Σ | ⋅ ( | P | + η ) ( | x | + 1 ) ) . Additionally, we consider a generalization of the NPCS problem in which we allow for constraints based on the membership of substrings in regular languages. In particular, we introduce a problem we denote String Editing under Substring in Language Constraints (StrEdit-SILC), where provided a wildcard-free string x ∈ Σ ⁎ , a finite set of regular languages R = { L 1 , L 2 , … } , and a regular language L F , the objective is to find a minimum cost set of mutation, insertion, and deletion edit operations Q that suffice to convert the input string x into a string x ′ ∈ Σ ⁎ , where no substring has membership in L F , and ∀ L i ∈ R , there exists a substring in L i . Here, letting Ψ and ϖ be the sum of all regular expression lengths and longest regular expression length for languages in R ∪ { L F } , respectively, and letting C m i d ∈ N be the maximum cost of an edit operation, we show that StrEdit-SILC is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to Ψ, having time complexity O ( 2 Ψ ⋅ | x | ⋅ ( ϖ ⋅ | Σ | + C m i d ) ) .

  abstract     = {This paper studies the message complexity of authenticated Byzantine agreement (BA) in synchronous, fully-connected distributed networks under an honest majority. We focus on the so-called implicit Byzantine agreement problem where each node starts with an input value and at the end a non-empty subset of the honest nodes should agree on a common input value by satisfying the BA properties (i.e., there can be undecided nodes) 3 . We show that a sublinear (in n , number of nodes) message complexity BA protocol under honest majority is possible in the standard PKI model when the nodes have access to an unbiased global coin and hash function. In particular, we present a randomized Byzantine agreement algorithm which, with high probability achieves implicit agreement, uses O ˜ ( n ) messages, and runs in O ˜ ( 1 ) rounds while tolerating ( 1 / 2 − ϵ ) n Byzantine nodes for any fixed ϵ &gt; 0 , the notation O ˜ hides a O ( polylog n ) factor 4 . The algorithm requires standard cryptographic setup PKI and hash function with a static Byzantine adversary. The algorithm works in the CONGEST model and each node does not need to know the identity of its neighbors, i.e., works in the K T 0 model. The message complexity (and also the time complexity) of our algorithm is optimal up to a polylog n factor, as we show a Ω ( n ) lower bound on the message complexity. We further extend the result to Byzantine subset agreement, where a non-empty subset of nodes should agree on a common value. Lastly, we analyze several relevant results that follow from the construction of the main result. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sublinear message complexity result of Byzantine agreement. A quadratic message lower bound is known for any deterministic BA protocol (due to Dolev-Reischuk [JACM 1985]). The existing randomized BA protocols have at least quadratic message complexity in the honest majority setting. Our result shows the power of a global coin in achieving significant improvement over the existing results. It can be viewed as a step towards understanding the message complexity of randomized Byzantine agreement in distributed networks with PKI.},

  abstract     = {The multivalued consensus problem is a fundamental issue in fault-tolerant distributed computing. It encompasses a wide range of agreement problems where processes must unanimously decide on a specific value v ∈ V , with | V | ≥ 2 . Existing solutions that handle process crash failures simplify the multivalued consensus problem by reducing it to the binary consensus problem. Examples of such solutions include Mostéfaoui-Raynal-Tronel [IPL 2000] and Zhang-Chen [IPL 2009]. In this work, we aim to design an even more reliable solution by leveraging the concept of self-stabilization , which provides a strong form of fault tolerance. Self-stabilizing algorithms can recover from transient faults, which represent any deviation from the system&#39;s intended behavior (as long as the algorithm code remains intact) in addition to process and communication failures. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first self-stabilizing algorithm for multivalued consensus in asynchronous message-passing systems susceptible to process failures and transient faults. Our solution uses, at most, n concurrent invocations of binary consensus. This is another way we advance state-of-the-art solutions compared to previous non-self-stabilizing ones. For example, Mostéfaoui-Raynal-Tronel&#39;s solution requires an unbounded number of sequential invocations of binary consensus.},

In contrast, we present a linear-time algorithm that computes the edge open packing number of a tree. We also resolve two problems posed in the seminal paper (Chelladurai et al. (2022) [5] ).

In this paper, the solvability of the APF problem on a continuous circle is discussed for a swarm of oblivious and silent robots without chirality under a semi-synchronous scheduler. Firstly a class of configurations (the initial placements of the robots on the circle) called Formable Configuration ( FC ) has been provided which is necessary to solve the APF problem on a continuous circle. Then considering the initial configuration to be an FC , a deterministic and distributed algorithm has been provided that solves the APF problem for n robots on a continuous circle of fixed radius within O ( n ) epochs without collision, where an epoch is considered to be a time interval in which all robots are activated at least once.},

  abstract     = {The Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT 3.5 have created a new era of automatic code generation. However, the existing research primarily focuses on generating simple code based on datasets (such as HumanEval, etc.). Most of approaches pay less attention to complex and practical code generation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new approach called “Xd-CodeGen” which can be used to generate large scale Java code. This approach is composed of four phases: requirement analysis, modeling, code generation, and code verification. In the requirement analysis phase, ChatGPT 3.5 is utilized to decompose and restate user requirements. To do so, a knowledge graph is developed to describe entities and their relationship in detail. Further, Propositional Projection Temporal Logic (PPTL) formulas are employed to define the properties of requirements.

An approximate algorithm to construct MMPR models based on ( ϵ , δ ) -estimator, and mathematical proofs of the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm are introduced. This paper empirically implements the method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and it&#39;s shown to have comparable performance to existing regression methods in many cases, while it takes almost the shortest time to provide a regression model with high prediction accuracy.},

Let v ∈ Q d be a rational vector, ( T 1 , T 2 … , T m ) a list of d × d rational matrices, S ∈ Q h × d a rational matrix not necessarily square and k a parameter. The goal is to compute the number of ways one can choose k matrices T i 1 , T i 2 , … , T i k from the list such that S T i k ⋯ T i 1 v = 0 ∈ Q h .

As a consequence, computing the k -th homotopy group of a d -dimensional 1-connected topological space for d &gt; 3 is # W [ 2 ] -hard for parameter k . We also discuss a decision version of the problem and its several modifications for which we show W [ 1 ] / W [ 2 ] -hardness. This is in contrast to the parameterized k -sum problem, which is only W [ 1 ] -hard (Abboud-Lewi-Williams, ESA&#39;14). In addition, we show that the decision version of the problem without parameter is an undecidable problem, and we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for matrices of bounded size over finite fields, parameterized by the matrix dimensions and the order of the field.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic programming combines general computer programming, statistical inference, and formal semantics to help systems make decisions when facing uncertainty. Probabilistic programs are ubiquitous, including having a significant impact on machine intelligence. While many probabilistic algorithms have been used in practice in different domains, their automated verification based on formal semantics is still a relatively new research area. In the last two decades, it has attracted much interest. Many challenges, however, remain. The work presented in this paper, probabilistic unifying relations (ProbURel), takes a step towards our vision to tackle these challenges. Our work is based on Hehner&#39;s predicative probabilistic programming, but there are several obstacles to the broader adoption of his work. Our contributions here include (1) the formalisation of its syntax and semantics by introducing an Iverson bracket notation to separate relations from arithmetic; (2) the formalisation of relations using Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) and probabilities outside the brackets using summation over the topological space of the real numbers; (3) the constructive semantics for probabilistic loops using Kleene&#39;s fixed-point theorem; (4) the enrichment of its semantics from distributions to subdistributions and superdistributions to deal with the constructive semantics; (5) the unique fixed-point theorem to simplify the reasoning about probabilistic loops; and (6) the mechanisation of our theory in Isabelle/UTP, an implementation of UTP in Isabelle/HOL, for automated reasoning using theorem proving. We demonstrate our work with six examples, including problems in robot localisation, classification in machine learning, and the termination of probabilistic loops.},

  abstract     = {A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices of the graph such that every edge has at least one endpoint in it. In this work, we study Weighted Vertex Cover with solution size as a parameter. Formally, in the ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover problem, given a graph G , an integer k , a positive rational W , and a weight function w : V ( G ) → Q + , the question is whether G has a vertex cover of size at most k of weight at most W , with k being the parameter. An ( a , b ) -bi-criteria approximation algorithm for ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover either produces a vertex cover S such that | S | ≤ a k and w ( S ) ≤ b W , or decides that there is no vertex cover of size at most k of weight at most W . We obtain the following results. • A simple ( 2 , 2 ) -bi-criteria approximation algorithm for ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover in polynomial time by modifying the standard LP -rounding algorithm. • A simple exact parameterized algorithm for ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover running in O ⁎ ( 1.4656 k ) time 1 . • A ( 1 + ϵ , 2 ) -approximation algorithm for ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover running in O ⁎ ( 1.4656 ( 1 − ϵ ) k ) time. • A ( 1.5 , 1.5 ) -approximation algorithm for ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover running in O ⁎ ( 1.414 k ) time. • A ( 2 − δ , 2 − δ ) -approximation algorithm for ( k , W ) - Vertex Cover running in O ⁎ ( ∑ i = δ k ( 1 − 2 δ ) 1 + 2 δ δ k ( 1 − 2 δ ) 2 δ ( δ k + i δ k − 2 i δ 1 − 2 δ ) ) time for any δ &lt; 0.5 . For example, for ( 1.75 , 1.75 ) and ( 1.9 , 1.9 ) -approximation algorithms, we get running times of O ⁎ ( 1.272 k ) and O ⁎ ( 1.151 k ) respectively. Our algorithms (expectedly) do not improve upon the running times of the existing algorithms for the unweighted version of Vertex Cover . When compared to algorithms for the weighted version, our algorithms are the first ones to the best of our knowledge which work with arbitrary weights, and they perform well when the solution size is much smaller than the total weight of the desired solution.},

In case of graphs, a feasible solution can be quickly reached, while in case of hypergraphs Deza et al. (2018) proved that the problem is NP-hard even in the simple case of 3-uniform ones. This result opened a new research line consisting in the detection of instances for which a solution can be computed in polynomial time. In this work we deal with 3-uniform hypergraphs, and we study them from a different perspective, exploiting a connection of these objects with partially ordered sets. More precisely, we introduce a simple partially ordered set, whose ideals are in bijection with a subclass of 3-uniform hypergraphs. We completely characterize their degree sequences in case of principal ideals (here a simple fast reconstruction strategy follows), and we furthermore carry on a complete analysis of those degree sequences related to the ideals with two generators. We also consider unique hypergraphs in D e x t , i.e., those hypergraphs that do not share their degree sequence with other non-isomorphic ones. We show that uniqueness holds in case of hypergraphs associated to principal ideals, and we provide some examples of hypergraphs in D e x t where this property is lost.},

We propose a novel approach for computing the fastest waypoint trajectory in intersections using graph search in a discretized space-time graph that produces collision-free paths with variable vehicle speeds that comply with traffic rules and vehicle dynamical constraints. To assist our planner algorithm in decentralized scenarios, we also propose a multi-agent protocol architecture for vehicle coordination for trajectory planning using a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network. The trajectories generated allow a much higher evacuation rate and congestion threshold, with lower O ( N ) algorithm runtime compared to the state of the art conflict detection graph platoon path planning method, even for large scenarios with vehicle arrival rate of 1 / s and thousands of vehicles.},

System-level diagnosis theory, which originates from the testing of VLSI and Wafer, aims to identify faulty processors in these systems by means of analyzing the test results among the processors, while diagnosability as well as diagnosis accuracy are two important indices. The probabilistic fault diagnostic strategy seeks to correctly diagnose processors with high probability under the assumption that each processor has a certain failing probability. In this work, based on the probabilistic diagnosis algorithm with consideration of fault clustering, we specialize in the local diagnostic capability to establish the probability that any processor in a discrete status is diagnosed correctly. Subsequently, we investigate the global performance evaluation of multiprocessor systems under various significant fault distributions including Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution and Binomial distribution. In addition, we directly apply our results to the data center network H S D C HSDC and ( n , k ) (n,k) -star network. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the established results, which reveal the relationship between the accuracy of correct diagnosis and regulatory parameters.},

This problem generalizes the Traveling Salesman problem and, therefore, is hard to approximate in general. On the practical side, it models a collaborative less-than-truckload problem with pickup and delivery locations. Using an algorithm for the Survivable Network Design problem and T -joins, we obtain a 3-approximation for the metric case, improving on the previous best 4-approximation. Furthermore, we present an (11/9)-approximation for the particular case of the Steiner Multicycle in which each edge weight is 1 or 2. This algorithm can be adapted to obtain a (7/6)-approximation when every terminal set contains at least four vertices.

If D ( u ) &lt; D ( v ) D(u)&amp;lt;D(v) for every dimension D of Γ, but there is no path from u to v , we have a falsely implied path (fip) . Minimizing the number of fips is an important theoretical and practical problem. Computing 2-dimensional weak dominance drawings with minimum number of fips is NP-hard. We show that this problem is FPT parameterized by the dimension d and the modular width mw . A key ingredient of our proof is the Compaction Lemma , where we show an interesting property of any weak dominance drawing of G with the minimum number of fips. This FPT result in weak dominance, which is interesting by itself because the fip-minimization problem is NP-hard, is used to prove our main contributions. Computing the dominance dimension of G , that is, the minimum number of dimensions d for which G has a d -dimensional dominance drawing (a weak dominance drawing with 0 fips), is a well-known NP-hard problem.

  abstract     = {Symbolic heaps, which are a restricted class of separation logic formulas, with inductive definitions are a suitable language in automated verification systems for memory-manipulating programs. In this context, some related problems, e.g., the entailment problem, have been studied theoretically. In addition, several solvers for the entailment problem based on the proof-search algorithm in cyclic-proof systems, which are proof systems in sequent calculus style with cyclic structure, have been proposed. However, the cut-elimination property generally does not hold for cyclic-proof systems of symbolic heaps with inductive definitions, which means that searching for a cut-free proof is insufficient. In other words, we hope to find a reasonable proof-search algorithm considering the cut rule or we give up on obtaining a complete proof-search procedure. This paper investigates this issue and demonstrates a limit to the challenge of the restrictions on the cut rule in a cyclic-proof system for symbolic heaps. We propose a restricted cut rule, referred to as the presumable cut, which is a relaxed variant of the analytic cut, in which the cut formula must be a subformula of the bottom sequent. This paper demonstrates that the provability of the cyclic-proof system for symbolic heaps becomes strictly weaker by restricting the cut rule to the presumable cut.},

  abstract     = {Partial key exposure attacks pose a significant threat to RSA-type cryptosystems. These attacks factorize the RSA modulus by utilizing partial knowledge of the decryption exponent, which is typically revealed by side-channel attacks, cold boot attacks, etc. Such partial information is often located in non-consecutive blocks. However, the majority of the proposed attacks on Prime Power RSA have only considered a single unexposed block. Meanwhile, related attacks are incapable of being expanded to multiple unexposed blocks or achieving optimal results. In this paper, we propose partial key exposure attacks on Prime Power RSA modulus N = p r q l N=prql with n unknown blocks, where n ≥ 2 n≥2 . We reduce this extended attack to solving multivariate linear modular equations and apply lattice-based approaches, including Herrmann-May&#39;s method (ASIACRYPT&#39;08), Takayasu-Kunihiro&#39;s method (ACISP&#39;13), and Lu-Zhang-Peng-Lin&#39;s method (ASIACRYPT&#39;15), to solve them. Furthermore, we improve Lu et al.&#39;s method by adding helpful polynomials and removing unhelpful polynomials to construct a better lattice basis. We also extend Lu et al.&#39;s method by introducing a new parameter to make the lattice basis construction more flexible. Our improved and extended methods can be used for attacks when l = 1 l=1 and l ≥ 1 l≥1 , respectively. These new attacks require less partial information than previous methods. For example, in the case where n = 2 n=2 , we reduce the amount of partial information needed from 80.7% to 77.8% when r = 2 , l = 1 r=2,l=1 , and from 64.0% to 44.9% when r = 3 , l = 2 r=3,l=2 .},

In this paper, a new clustering algorithm is proposed, which not only considers the distance of users&#39; properties but also considers users&#39; social influence. Social influence can be further divided into mutual influence and self influence. With mutual influence, we can deal with users&#39; interests and measure their similarities by introducing areas and activities, thus better weighing the influence between them in an indirect way. Separately, we formulate a new propagation model, PR-Threshold++, by merging the PageRank algorithm and Linear Threshold model, to model the self influence. Based on that, we design a novel similarity by exploiting users&#39; distance, mutual influence, and self influence. Finally, we adjust K-medoids according to our similarity and use real-world datasets to evaluate their performance in intensive simulations.},

The observer does not need to see the entire boundary of an obstacle. The tour is not allowed to intersect the interior of any region (i.e., the regions are obstacles and therefore out of bounds). The problem exhibits similarity to both the Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods ( TSPN ) and the External Watchman Route Problem ( EWRP ). We distinguish two variants: the range of visibility is either limited to a bounding rectangle, or unlimited. We obtain the following results: (I) Given a family of n disjoint convex bodies in the plane, computing a shortest observation route does not admit a ( c log ⁡ n ) (clog⁡n) -approximation unless P = NP P=NP for an absolute constant c &gt; 0 c&amp;gt;0 . (This holds for both limited and unlimited vision.) (II) Given a family of disjoint convex bodies in the plane, computing a shortest external watchman route is NP NP -hard. (This holds for both limited and unlimited vision; and even for families of axis-aligned squares.) (III) Given a family of n disjoint fat convex polygons in the plane, an observation tour whose length is at most O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) times the optimal can be computed in polynomial time. (This holds for limited vision.) (IV) For every n ≥ 5 n≥5 , there exists a convex polygon with n sides and all angles obtuse such that its perimeter is not a shortest external watchman route.

Rubinstein and Singla [31] developed a notion of combinatorial prophet inequalities in order to generalize the standard prophet inequality setting to combinatorial valuation functions such as submodular and subadditive functions. For non-negative submodular functions they demonstrated a constant factor prophet inequality for matroid constraints. Along the way they showed a variant of the correlation gap for non-negative submodular functions. In this paper we revisit their notion of correlation gap as well as the standard notion of correlation gap and prove much tighter and cleaner bounds. Via these bounds and other insights we obtain substantially improved constant factor combinatorial prophet inequalities for both monotone and non-monotone submodular functions over any constraint that admits an Online Contention Resolution Scheme. In addition to improved bounds we describe efficient polynomial-time algorithms that achieve these bounds.},

Each source and each sink are given supply representing the number of evacuees and demand representing the maximum number of acceptable evacuees, respectively. Each edge is given capacity and transit time . Here, the capacity of an edge bounds the rate at which evacuees can enter the edge per unit time, and the transit time represents the time which evacuees take to travel across the edge. The evacuation completion time is the minimum time at which each evacuee can arrive at one of the evacuation facilities. Given a dynamic flow network without sinks, once sinks are located on some nodes or edges, the evacuation completion time for this sink location is determined. We then consider the problem of locating sinks to minimize the evacuation completion time, called the sink location problem . The problems have been given polynomial-time algorithms only for limited networks such as paths [1] , [2] , [3] , cycles [1] , and trees [4] , [5] , [6] , but no polynomial-time algorithms are known for more complex network classes.

Given an n × n n×n matrix D of nonnegative integers, interpreted as inter-vertex distances, find an n -vertex weighted or unweighted graph G realizing D , i.e., whose inter-vertex distances satisfy d i s t G ( i , j ) = D i , j distG(i,j)=Di,j for every 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n 1≤i&amp;lt;j≤n , or decide that no such realizing graph exists. The problem was studied for general weighted and unweighted graphs, as well as for cases where the realizing graph is restricted to a specific family of graphs (e.g., trees or bipartite graphs). An extension of Distance Realization that was studied in the past is where each entry in the matrix D may contain a range of consecutive permissible values. We refer to this extension as Range Distance Realization (or Range-DR ). Restricting each range to at most k values yields the problem k - Range Distance Realization (or k - Range-DR ). The current paper introduces a new extension of Distance Realization , in which each entry D i , j Di,j of the matrix may contain an arbitrary set of acceptable values for the distance between i and j , for every 1 ≤ i &lt; j ≤ n 1≤i&amp;lt;j≤n . We refer to this extension as Set Distance Realization ( Set-DR ), and to the restricted problem where each entry may contain at most k values as k - Set Distance Realization (or k - Set-DR ). We first show that 2- Range-DR is NP-hard for unweighted graphs (implying the same for 2- Set-DR ). Next we prove that 2- Set-DR is NP-hard for unweighted and weighted trees. Finally, we explore Set-DR where the realization is restricted to the families of stars, paths, cycles, or caterpillars. For the weighted case, our positive results are that there exist polynomial time algorithms for the 2- Set-DR problem on stars, paths and cycles, and for the 1- Set-DR problem on caterpillars. On the hardness side, we prove that 6- Set-DR is NP-hard for stars and 5- Set-DR is NP-hard for paths, cycles and caterpillars. For the unweighted case, our results are the same, except for the case of unweighted stars, for which k - Set-DR is polynomially solvable for any k .},

For a general pattern v we show that the maximal length of a monochromatic arithmetic progression of difference d is at most linear in d .

  abstract     = {Online social networks have emerged as pivotal platforms where users not only interact but also influence each other&#39;s decisions and preferences. As these networks grow in complexity, understanding and leveraging influence dynamics within networks have become essential, particularly for businesses and marketers. Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) in online social networks has garnered significant interest, focusing on maximizing influence spread among multiple entities. However, recent research on CIM often overlooks the differences in user preferences, which realistically impact the propagation of competitive influence. To address this issue, we introduce the User-Driven Competitive Linear Threshold (UDCLT) model. This model takes into account user preference differences for two distinct brands within the identical product category, thereby formulating the User-Driven Competitive Influence Maximization (UDCIM) problem. Based on community structure, we introduce a novel measure, namely Topology Importance (TI), to assess a node&#39;s potential influence within a social network by considering its connections within and across communities. To resolve the UDCIM problem effectively, we develop a novel two-phase algorithm, the Community-based Dual Influence Assessment (CDIA) algorithm, which integrates Topology Importance and Dual Influence to identify seed nodes. Various experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets, illustrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the CDIA algorithm in addressing the UDCIM problem.},

This concept lies at the heart of the network creation games, where the central problem is to understand the structure of the resulting equilibrium graphs, and in particular, how well they globally minimize the diameter. In this sense, in 2013 Alon et al. showed an upper bound of 2 O ( log ⁡ n ) 2O(log⁡n) on the diameter of sum basic equilibria, and they also proved that if a sum basic equilibrium graph is a tree, then it has diameter at most 2. In this paper, we prove that the upper bound of 2 also holds for bipartite graphs and even for some non-bipartite classes like block graphs and cactus graphs.},

  abstract     = {Almost all of computer science is concerned with transformations of information in the form of strings. We initiate the study of a neglected transformation type, namely transformations between probability distributions. We begin by examining the deceivingly simple-looking case of Bernoulli distributions and procedures to transform them. A p -coin is a coin that, whenever tossed, lands heads up with probability p and tails up with probability 1 − p 1−p . A neat trick due to von Neumann allows us to simulate a 1/2-coin with any p -coin for an arbitrary unknown p ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) p∈(0,1) . We show how to apply this trick to simulate a q -coin for an arbitrary computable q ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) q∈(0,1) . In contrast, it is impossible to simulate a q -coin with a noncomputable q . More generally, we are interested in what transformations between probability distributions are feasible. Is it possible to simulate a p / 2 p/2 -coin with a p -coin for unknown p ? How about 2 p or p 2 p2 ? We attempt to characterize the feasible transformations. For example, we show how to transform a p -coin into an f ( p ) f(p) -coin where any finite number of pairs ( p i , f ( p i ) ) (pi,f(pi)) of non-zero, non-one probabilities is prescribed, and that it is impossible to do the same for an infinite number of pairs. We also examine which probability distributions are feasible to approximate to arbitrary precision, showing that this is impossible for discontinuous ones but feasible for most but not all remaining ones.},

Our goal is to find efficient algorithms to characterise these geometric structures and their properties. We are interested in a fundamental structure of discrete geometry, the arithmetic hyperplanes, and more particularly in their connectedness. Many works have studied a connectedness defined from the neighbourhood by faces and have allowed to observe a percolation phenomenon. These studies have also allowed to decide the connectedness of a plane in an efficient way. We propose an extension of these results in the case of connectivity defined from general neighbourhoods. Beyond the new concepts that this extension requires, the main contribution of the paper lies in the use of analysis to solve this arithmetic problem and in the design of an algorithm that decides the general connectedness problem. The study of the thickness of connectedness as a function reveals discontinuities at each rational point. However, a much more regular underlying structure appears in the irrational case. Thus, the consideration of irrational vectors allows a simpler approach to the connectedness of arithmetic hyperplanes.},

To increase our understanding of the relationship between the two problems, we perform a complexity study for the Maximum Matching Cut problem, which is to determine a largest matching cut in a graph. Our results yield full dichotomies of Maximum Matching Cut for graphs of bounded diameter, bounded radius and H -free graphs. A disconnected perfect matching of a graph G is a perfect matching that contains a matching cut of G . We also show how our new techniques can be used for finding a disconnected perfect matching with a largest matching cut for special graph classes. In this way we can prove that the decision problem Disconnected Perfect Matching is polynomial-time solvable for ( P 6 + s P 2 ) (P6+sP2) -free graphs for every s ≥ 0 s≥0 , extending a known result for P 5 P5 -free graphs (Bouquet and Picouleau, 2020).},

The formalization leverages Mazurkiewicz traces to define legal sequences of operations and ensure both Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) and Pipleline Consistency (PC). The paper presents a generic algorithm that implements this novel class of distributed objects both in a crash and Byzantine setting.

We explore the parameterized complexity of computing such solutions. We focus on the well-studied notions of social welfare (WO) and Pareto optimality (PO), alongside the recently proposed notions of group-welfare optimality (GWO) and utility-vector optimality (UVO), both of which lie between WO and PO. Firstly, we focus on the fundamental case where k = 2 k=2 with r red agents and b blue agents. We show that all solution-notions we consider are intractable even when b = 1 b=1 and that they do not admit any FPT algorithm when parameterized by r and b , unless FPT = W [ 1 ] FPT=W[1] . In addition, we show that WO and GWO remain intractable even on cubic graphs. We complement these negative results with an FPT algorithm parameterized by r , b r,b and the maximum degree of the graph. For the general case with k ≥ 2 k≥2 types of agents, we prove that for any of the notions we consider the problem remains hard when parameterized by k for a large family of graphs that includes trees. We accompany these negative results with an XP algorithm parameterized by k and the treewidth of the graph.},

However, if one or more robots crash at a single location, all non-crashed robots must eventually gather at that location. The SUIG problem was first introduced for robots operating in a two-dimensional continuous Euclidean space, with most solutions relying on the ability of robots to move a prescribed (real) distance at each time instant. In this paper, we investigate the SUIG problem for robots operating in a discrete universe (i.e., a graph) where they can only move one unit of distance (i.e., to an adjacent node) at each time instant. Specifically, we focus on line-shaped networks and characterize the solvability of the SUIG problem for oblivious robots without multiplicity detection.},

  abstract     = {The multi-type Moran process is an evolutionary process on a connected graph G in which each vertex has one of k types and, in each step, a vertex v is chosen to reproduce its type to one of its neighbours. The probability of a vertex v being chosen for reproduction is proportional to the fitness of the type of v . So far, the literature was almost solely concerned with the 2-type Moran process in which each vertex is either healthy (type 0) or a mutant (type 1), and the main problem of interest has been the (approximate) computation of the so-called fixation probability , i.e., the probability that eventually all vertices are mutants. In this work we initiate the study of approximating fixation probabilities in the multi-type Moran process on general graphs. Our main result is an FPTRAS (fixed-parameter tractable randomised approximation scheme) for computing the fixation probability of the dominant mutation; the parameter is the number of types and their fitnesses. In the course of our studies we also provide novel upper bounds on the expected absorption time , i.e., the time that it takes the multi-type Moran process to reach a state in which each vertex has the same type.},

However, we show that transducer difference sets result in Chomsky-like classes of languages that are different than the classes resulting from equality sets. We also consider the following word problem: given transducers s , t s,t and input w , tell whether the output sets s ( w ) s(w) and t ( w ) t(w) are different. In general the problem is PSPACE -complete, but it becomes NP -complete when at least one of the given transducers has finite outputs.

This paper is the second of a series about intrinsic universality, i.e. the ability for a family of AN to simulate arbitrary AN. We develop a proof technique to establish intrinsic simulation and universality results which is suitable to deal with families of symmetric networks where connections are non-oriented. It is based on an operation of glueing of networks, which allows to produce complex orbits in large networks from compatible pseudo-orbits in small networks. As an illustration, we give a short proof that the family of networks where each node obeys the rule of the ‘game of life’ cellular automaton is strongly universal. In the third paper of the series, we heavily rely on this proof technique to show intrinsic universality results of various families with particular update schedules.},

The current paper takes into consideration different topologies for the Shuffle Exchange Network (SEN) in order to attain optimal data transfer among such scenarios. SEN topologies are a key feature in connecting several processors and implementing the data transfer among them where a single processor fails to handle the load. The study hereby reports in the performance, reliability, and cost analysis of these topologies. These topologies, some of which are advocated to have better performance in many studies, include replicated networks. Our research demystifies claims made in earlier papers that replicated networks have inflated reliability and higher costs due to their additional links. Researchers are therefore guided on accurate performance data that will lead them to make optimum choices of SEN topologies for targeted applications. These findings further highlight that the trade-offs between reliability and cost must be carefully considered during network design so as to arrive at better results for big data communication and computation in parallel and distributed systems. This work provides important insights into the correct evaluation of SEN topologies, helping to correct the misleading facts and to have better network selection for various real-time application realizations.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns two-player alternating play combinatorial games (Conway 1976) in the normal-play convention, i.e. last move wins. Specifically, we study impartial vector subtraction games on tuples of nonnegative integers (Golomb 1966), with finite subtraction sets. In case of two move rulesets we find a complete solution, via a certain P P -to- P P principle (where P P means that the previous player wins). Namely x ∈ P x∈P if and only if x + a + b ∈ P x+a+b∈P , where a and b are the two move options. Flammenkamp (1997) observed that, already in one dimension, rulesets with three moves can be hard to analyze, and still today his related conjecture remains open. Here, we solve instances of rulesets with three moves in two dimensions, and conjecture that they all have regular outcomes. Through several computer visualizations of outcomes of multi-move two-dimensional rulesets, we observe that they tend to partition the game board into periodic mosaics on very few regions/segments, which can depend on the number of moves in a ruleset. For example, we have found a five-move ruleset with an outcome segmentation into six semi-infinite slices. In this spirit, we develop a coloring automaton that generalizes the P P -to- P P principle. Given an initial set of colored positions, it quickly paints the P P -positions in segments of the game board. Moreover, we prove that two-dimensional rulesets have row/column eventually periodic outcomes. We pose open problems on the generic hardness of two-dimensional rulesets; several regularity conjectures are provided, but we also conjecture that not all rulesets have regular outcomes.},

A simple binary search strategy allows the starting player find the opponent&#39;s character by asking 5 questions only, when the opponent is honest. Real-life observations show that in more realistic scenarios, the game is played against adversaries that do not strictly follow the rules, e.g., kids. Such players might decide to answer all questions at once, answer only part of the questions as they do not know the answers to all, and even lie occasionally. We devise strategies for such scenarios using techniques from error-correcting and erasure codes. This connects to a recent line of work on search problems on graphs and trees with unreliable auxiliary information, and could be of independent interest.},

We proceed to explore the coincidence problem for counting independent sets and matchings in graphs, matroid bases, order ideals and linear extensions in posets, permutation patterns, and the Kronecker coefficients.

The suffix tree of a text string T of length n has O ( n ) O(n) nodes and edges, and the string label of each edge is encoded by a pair of positions in T . Thus, even after the tree is built, the input string T needs to be kept stored and random access to T is still needed. The linear-size suffix tries ( LSTs ), proposed by Crochemore et al. [Linear-size suffix tries, TCS 638:171-178, 2016], are a “stand-alone” alternative to the suffix trees. Namely, the LST of an input text string T of length n occupies O ( n ) O(n) total space, and supports pattern matching and other tasks with the same efficiency as the suffix tree without the need to store the input text string T . Crochemore et al. proposed an offline algorithm which transforms the suffix tree of T into the LST of T in O ( n log ⁡ σ ) O(nlog⁡σ) time and O ( n ) O(n) space, where σ is the alphabet size. In this paper, we present two types of online algorithms which “directly” construct the LST, from right to left, and from left to right, without constructing the suffix tree as an intermediate structure. Both algorithms construct the LST incrementally when a new symbol is read, and do not access the previously read symbols. Both of the right-to-left construction algorithm and the left-to-right construction algorithm work in O ( n log ⁡ σ ) O(nlog⁡σ) time and O ( n ) O(n) space.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we formulate a notion of diagnosability for labeled weighted automata over a class of dioids which admit both positive and negative numbers as well as vectors. The weights can represent diverse physical meanings such as time elapsing and position deviations. We also develop an original tool called concurrent composition to verify diagnosability for such automata. These results are fundamentally new compared with the existing ones in the literature. In a little more detail, diagnosability is characterized for a labeled weighted automaton A D p ADp over a special dioid D p Dp called progressive , which can represent diverse physical meanings such as time elapsing and position deviations. In a progressive dioid, the canonical order is total, there is at least one eventually dominant element, there is no zero divisor, and the cancellative law is satisfied, where the functionality of an eventually dominant element t is to make every nonzero element a arbitrarily large by multiplying a by t for sufficiently many times. A notion of diagnosability is formulated for A D p ADp . By developing a notion of concurrent composition , a necessary and sufficient condition is given for diagnosability of automaton A D p ADp . It is proven that the problem of computing the concurrent composition for an automaton A Q _ AQ_ is NP NP -complete, then the problem of verifying diagnosability of A Q _ AQ_ is proven to be coNP coNP -complete, where the NP NP -hardness and coNP coNP -hardness results even hold for deterministic, deadlock-free, and divergence-free automaton A N _ AN_ , where Q _ Q_ and N _ N_ are the max-plus dioids having elements in Q ∪ { − ∞ } Q∪{−∞} and N ∪ { − ∞ } N∪{−∞} , respectively.

  abstract     = {We introduce a generalization of “Solo Chess”, a single-player variant of the game that can be played on chess.com. The standard version of the game is played on a regular 8 × 8 chessboard by a single player, with only white pieces, using the following rules: every move must capture a piece, no piece may capture more than 2 times, and if there is a King on the board, it must be the final piece. The goal is to clear the board, i.e., make a sequence of captures after which only one piece is left. We generalize this game to unbounded boards with n pieces, each of which have a given number of captures that they are permitted to make. We show that Generalized Solo Chess is NP -complete, even when it is played by only rooks that have at most two captures remaining. It also turns out to be NP -complete even when every piece is a queen with exactly two captures remaining in the initial configuration. In contrast, we show that solvable instances of Generalized Solo Chess can be completely characterized when the game is: a) played by rooks on a one-dimensional board, and b) played by pawns with two captures left on a 2D board. Inspired by Generalized Solo Chess , we also introduce the Graph Capture Game , which involves clearing a graph of tokens via captures along edges. This game subsumes Generalized Solo Chess played by knights. We show that the Graph Capture Game is NP -complete for undirected graphs and DAGs.},

  abstract     = {We study financial systems from a game-theoretic standpoint. A financial system is represented by a network, where nodes correspond to banks, and directed labeled edges correspond to debt contracts between them. The existence of cycles in the network indicates that a payment of a bank to one of its lenders might affect the bank&#39;s incoming payments. So, if a bank cannot fully repay its debt, then the exact payments it makes to each of its lenders can affect the cash inflow back to itself. We naturally assume that the banks are interested in their financial well-being (utility) which is aligned with the amount of incoming payments they receive from the network. This defines a game among the banks, that can be seen as utility-maximizing agents who strategize over their payments. We introduce a class of financial network games that arise under some natural payment strategies called priority-proportional payments. We compute valid payment profiles for fixed payment strategies and we investigate existence and (in)efficiency of equilibrium strategies, under different variations of the game that capture several financial aspects that commonly arise in practice. We conclude with examining the computational complexity of a variety of related problems.},

Our defense makes use of resource burning (RB)—the verifiable expenditure of network resources—where the issuer of a request incurs some RB cost. Our algorithm, Depth Charge , charges RB costs for operations based on the depth of the appropriate object in the list that the object hashes to in the table. By appropriately setting the RB costs, our algorithm mitigates the impact of an attacker on the hash table&#39;s performance. In particular, in the presence of a significant attack, our algorithm incurs a cost which is asymptotically less that the attacker&#39;s cost.},

  abstract     = {We consider search by mobile agents for a hidden, idle target, placed on the infinite line. Feasible solutions are agent trajectories in which all agents reach the target sooner or later. A special feature of our problem is that the agents are p -faulty, meaning that every attempt to change direction is an independent Bernoulli trial with known probability p , where p is the probability that a turn fails. We are looking for agent trajectories that minimize the worst-case expected termination time, relative to the distance of the hidden target to the origin (competitive analysis). Hence, searching with one 0-faulty agent is the celebrated linear search (cow-path) problem that admits optimal 9 and 4.59112 competitive ratios, with deterministic and randomized algorithms, respectively. First, we study linear search with one deterministic p -faulty agent, i.e., with no access to random oracles, p ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) p∈(0,1/2) . For this problem, we provide trajectories that leverage the probabilistic faults into an algorithmic advantage. Our strongest result pertains to a search algorithm (deterministic, aside from the adversarial probabilistic faults) which, as p → 0 p→0 , has optimal performance 4.59112 + ϵ 4.59112+ϵ , up to the additive term ϵ that can be arbitrarily small. Additionally, it has performance less than 9 for p ≤ 0.390388 p≤0.390388 . When p → 1 / 2 p→1/2 , our algorithm has performance Θ ( 1 / ( 1 − 2 p ) ) Θ(1/(1−2p)) , which we also show is optimal up to a constant factor. Second, we consider linear search with two p -faulty agents, p ∈ ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) p∈(0,1/2) , for which we provide three algorithms of different advantages, all with a bounded competitive ratio even as p → 1 / 2 p→1/2 . Indeed, for this problem, we show how the agents can simulate the trajectory of any 0-faulty agent (deterministic or randomized), independently of the underlying communication model. As a result, searching with two agents allows for a solution with a competitive ratio of 9 + ϵ 9+ϵ (which we show can be achieved with arbitrarily high concentration) or a competitive ratio of 4.59112 + ϵ 4.59112+ϵ . Our final contribution is a novel algorithm for searching with two p -faulty agents that achieves a competitive ratio 3 + 4 p ( 1 − p ) 3+4p(1−p) , in expectation and with arbitrarily high concentration.},

At the same time, we develop a new transformation from a bounded separable one-key IPFE scheme towards an unbounded IPFE scheme.

However, in practice, the objective function may not be monotonically submodular. While greedy algorithms have strong theoretical guarantees for maximizing submodular functions, their performance is barely guaranteed for non-submodular functions. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the problem of maximizing non-monotone non-submodular functions under knapsack constraints based on the problem of infectious diseases and provides a more sophisticated analysis through the idea of segmentation. Since our definition characterizes the function more elaborately, a better bound, i.e., a tighter approximation guarantee, is achieved.

It asserts that any finite-state automaton can be broken down into a collection, a cascade , of automata of two simple types ( reset and permutation ) that, combined, simulate the original automaton. In this paper we show how the cascade product operation and the related decomposition are particularly well-suited for the class of Wheeler automata. In these automata, recently introduced in the context of data compression, states are ordered and transitions map state-intervals to state-intervals. First, we prove that Wheeler DFAs are closed under cascade products in an efficient way: the cascade product of two Wheeler automata is still a Wheeler automaton and has always a number of states which is at most the sum (after removing unreachable states) of the number of states of the two input automata, a result that cannot be achieved for general (even counter-free) automata. Second, we prove that each Wheeler automaton can be decomposed into a cascade of a linear number of reset blocks. Crucially, our line of reasoning avoids the necessity of using full KRDT and proves our results directly by an inductive argument.},

  abstract     = {Self-stabilizing protocols enable distributed systems to recover correct behavior starting from any arbitrary configuration. In particular, when processors communicate by message passing and the communication links are unbounded, fake messages may be placed in communication links by an adversary. When the number of such fake messages is unknown, self-stabilization may require huge resources: We investigate the possibility of resource-efficient self-stabilizing protocols in this context. Specifically, we present self-stabilizing protocols for ( Δ + 1 ) (Δ+1) -coloring and maximal independent set construction in any n -node graph, under the asynchronous message-passing model. The problems of ( Δ + 1 ) (Δ+1) -coloring and maximal independent set construction are widely regarded as benchmark problems for evaluating local algorithms. Our protocols offer many desirable features. They are deterministic, converge in O ( k Δ n 2 log ⁡ n ) O(kΔn2log⁡n) message exchanges, where k is the (unknown) initial number of (possibly corrupted) messages in a communication link. They use messages of O ( log ⁡ log ⁡ n + log ⁡ Δ ) O(log⁡log⁡n+log⁡Δ) bits with a memory of O ( Δ log ⁡ Δ + log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) O(Δlog⁡Δ+log⁡log⁡n) bits at each node. The resource consumption of our protocols is thus almost oblivious to the number of nodes, enabling scalability. Moreover, a striking property of our protocols is that the nodes do not need to know the number, or any bound on the number of messages initially present in each communication link of the initial (potentially corrupted) network configuration. This permits our protocols to handle any future network with unknown message capacity communication links. A key building block of our coloring and maximal independent set schemes is an algorithm to obtain an acyclic orientation of graph edges, that is of independent interest, and can serve as a useful tool for solving other tasks in this challenging setting.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental question in computational geometry is for a set of input points in the Euclidean space, that is subject to discrete changes (insertion/deletion of points at each time step), whether it is possible to maintain an exact/approximate minimum weight perfect matching and/or bottleneck matching (a perfect matching that minimizes the length of the longest matched edge), in sublinear update time. In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative for points on a real line and for points in the plane with a bounded geometric spread. For a set P of n points on a line, we show that there exists a dynamic algorithm that maintains an exact bottleneck matching of P and supports insertion and deletion in O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) time. Moreover, we show that a modified version of this algorithm maintains an exact minimum-weight perfect matching with O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) update (insertion and deletion) time. Next, for a set P of n points in the plane, we show that a ( 6 2 62 )-factor approximate bottleneck matching of P k Pk , at each time step k , can be maintained in O ( log ⁡ Δ ) O(log⁡Δ) amortized time per insertion and O ( log ⁡ Δ + | P k | ) O(log⁡Δ+|Pk|) amortized time per deletion, where Δ is the geometric spread of P (the ratio between the diameter of P and the distance between the closest pair of points in P ).},

  abstract     = {Quantum finite automata (QFAs) have been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we define and systematically study quantum Büchi automata (QBAs) over infinite words to model the long-term behavior of quantum systems, which extend QFAs. We introduce the classes of ω -languages recognized by QBAs in probable, almost sure, strict and non-strict threshold semantics. Several pumping lemmas and closure properties for QBAs are proved. Some decision problems for QBAs are investigated. In particular, we show that there are surprisingly only at most four substantially different classes of ω -languages recognized by QBAs (out of uncountably infinite). The relationship between classical ω -languages and QBAs is clarified using our pumping lemmas. We also find an ω -language recognized by QBAs under the almost sure semantics, which is not ω -context-free.},

  abstract     = {In the Power Vertex Cover (PVC) problem introduced in [1] as a generalization of the well-known Vertex Cover , we are allowed to specify costs for covering edges in a graph individually. Namely, two (nonnegative) weights, w ( u , v ) and w ( v , u ) w(u,v) and w(v,u) , are associated with each edge { u , v } ∈ E {u,v}∈E of an input graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , and to cover an edge { u , v } {u,v} , it is required to assign “power” p ∈ R + V p∈R+V on vertices of G such that either p ( u ) ≥ w ( u , v ) p(u)≥w(u,v) or p ( v ) ≥ w ( v , u ) p(v)≥w(v,u) . The objective is to minimize the total power assigned on V , ∑ v ∈ V p ( v ) ∑v∈Vp(v) , while covering all the edges of G by p . The node-deletion problem for a graph property π is the problem of computing a minimum vertex subset C ⊆ V C⊆V in a given graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , such that the graph satisfies π when all the vertices in C are removed from G . In this paper we consider node-deletion problems extended with the “covering-by-power” condition as in PVC, and present a unified approach for effectively approximating them. The node-deletion problems considered are Partial Vertex Cover (PartVC) , Bounded Degree Deletion (BDD) , and Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) , each corresponding to graph properties π = “the graph has at most | E | − k |E|−k edges”, π = “vertex degree of v is no larger than b ( v ) b(v) ”, and π = “the graph is acyclic”, respectively. After reducing these problems to the Submodular Set Cover (SSC) problem, we conduct an extended analysis of the approximability of these problems in the new setting of power covering by applying some of the existing techniques for approximating SSC. It will be shown that 1) PPartVC can be approximated within a factor of 2, 2) PBDD for b ∈ Z + V b∈Z+V within max ⁡ { 2 , 1 + b max } max⁡{2,1+bmax} , where b max = max v ∈ V ⁡ b ( v ) bmax=maxv∈V⁡b(v) , or within 2 + log ⁡ b max 2+log⁡bmax (for b max ≥ 1 bmax≥1 ) by a combination of the greedy SSC algorithm and the local ratio method extended for power node-deletion problems, and 3) PFVS within 2, resulting in each of these bounds matching the best one known for the corresponding original problem.},

In this paper, we focus on the reversibility of one-dimensional finite CA under reflective boundary conditions (RBC). We present two algorithms for deciding the reversibility of one-dimensional CA under RBC. Both algorithms work for not only linear rules but also non-linear rules. The first algorithm is to determine what we call the “strict reversibility” of CA. The second algorithm is to compute what we call the “reversibility function” of CA. Reversibility functions are proved to be periodic. Based on the algorithms, we list some experiment results of one-dimensional CA under RBC and analyse some features of this family of CA.},

It is difficult to construct even-variable balanced RSBFs with optimal algebraic immunity in the study on RSBFs. Recently, Mesnager et al. proposed the first and only construction of balanced RSBFs with optimal algebraic immunity for arbitrary even variables (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 89 (1) (2021) 1-17). The nonlinearity of their functions is not high. In this paper, we develop further research based on their construction and present a fresh design of n -variable balanced RSBFs with optimal algebraic immunity for arbitrary even n . Our functions have higher nonlinearity compared to their functions. Furthermore, the algebraic degree and fast algebraic immunity of our functions are not less than n − 2 n−2 for n not bigger than 16.},

  abstract     = {A suffix tree is a fundamental data structure for string processing and information retrieval, however, its structure is still not well understood. The suffix trees reverse engineering problem , which its research aims at reducing this gap, is the following. Given an ordered rooted tree T with unlabeled edges, determine whether there exists a string w such that the unlabeled-edges suffix tree of w is isomorphic to T . Previous studies on this problem consider the relaxation of having the suffix links as well as assume a binary alphabet. This paper is the first to consider the suffix tree detection problem , in which the relaxation of having suffix links as input is removed. We study suffix tree detection on two scenarios that are interesting per se. We provide a suffix tree detection algorithm for general alphabet periodic strings . Given an ordered tree T with n leaves, our detection algorithm takes O(n+|Σ|p) -time, where p is the unknown in advance length of a period that repeats at least 3 times in a string S having a suffix tree structure identical to T , if such S exists. Therefore, it is a polynomial time algorithm if p is a constant and a linear time algorithm if, in addition, the alphabet has a sub-linear size. We also show some necessary (but insufficient) conditions for binary alphabet general strings suffix tree detection. By this we take another step towards understanding suffix trees structure.},

Here, we present a detailed study of 21 finite-size elementary cellular automata with a fully asynchronous updating and periodic boundary conditions. We estimate their degree of reversibility by counting the number of recurrent configurations as a function of the size of the automaton (number of cells). We show that these rules exhibit various qualitative behaviours: some rules show a “strong reversibility” with a number of recurrent configurations that grows exponentially, while other rules have a “weak reversibility” with a linear growth. We also analyse the structure of the communication graph and report various scaling relations for the number of recurrent communication classes. We identify the cases where the divisibility of the size by 2 or 3 introduces some discontinuities in the behaviour. This study completes the characterisation of the 256 elementary cellular automata with regard to their recurrence properties.},

  abstract     = {Block elimination distance is a parameter on graphs that measures the distance of the biconnected components of a graph from a given class of graphs. When the indicated graph class is the class of edgeless graphs, we call the parameter block treedepth . In this paper, we introduce a vertex and an edge coloring that can serve as alternative definitions for block treedepth. Moreover, we make a connection between block treedepth and graph searching games by introducing two versions of the cops and robbers game and a min-max theorem for the block treedepth of a graph. Finally, we prove that the Block Treedepth problem has a cubic kernel when parameterized by vertex cover number.},

Bond percolation is studied in parallel computing and network science to understand the resilience of distributed systems to random link failure and the spread of information in networks through unreliable links. Moreover, the full-bond percolation is equivalent to the Reed-Frost process , a network version of SIR epidemic spreading. We consider one-dimensional power-law small-world graphs with parameter α obtained as the union of a cycle with additional long-range random edges: each pair of nodes { u , v } {u,v} at distance L on the cycle is connected by a long-range edge { u , v } {u,v} , with probability proportional to 1 / L α 1/Lα . Our analysis determines three phases for the percolation subgraph G p Gp of the small-world graph, depending on the value of α .},

It measures the network&#39;s ability to maintain communication and operational continuity even in the face of failures. However, the traditional connectivity can not effectively reflect the fault tolerance ability of the network when failures occur in a clustered or block-like manner in the actual environment. To address this limitation, cluster connectivity and super cluster connectivity were proposed.

Spiking neural P systems synthesise the connections that exist between neurons in the human brain, using pulses as a form of transmission of information. Usually, when a spiking neural P system is defined to solve any problem, it is checked in several cases to know if it works for them. But this methodology is not sufficient to verify if the system always works in a correct way. In this work, we introduce a methodology to look for characteristics in computations of spiking neural P systems that can be used to formally verify that the model works as it is intended.},

Then, our algorithm outputs a polygon that is an ϵ -sketch, for ϵ = 8 λ ϵ=8λ , in the sense that every point on the shape boundary is within distance ϵ of the output polygon. Moreover, our costs are asymptotically optimal in two key criteria for the robots: total distance traveled and total amount of rotation. Additionally, we implement our algorithm, and illustrate its output on some specific shapes.},

  abstract     = {The problem of two-sided matching markets is well-studied in computer science and economics, owing to its diverse applications across numerous domains. Since market participants are usually uncertain about their preferences in various online matching platforms, an emerging line of research is dedicated to the online setting where one-side participants (players) learn their unknown preferences through multiple rounds of interactions with the other side (arms). Sankararaman et al. [23] provide an Ω ( N log ⁡ ( T ) Δ 2 + K log ⁡ ( T ) Δ ) Ω(Nlog⁡(T)Δ2+Klog⁡(T)Δ) regret lower bound for this problem under serial dictatorship assumption, where N is the number of players, K ( ≥ N ) K(≥N) is the number of arms, Δ is the minimum reward gap across players and arms, and T is the time horizon. Serial dictatorship assumes arms have the same preferences, which is common in reality when one side participants have a unified evaluation standard. Recently, the work of Kong and Li [10] proposes the ET-GS algorithm and achieves an O ( K log ⁡ ( T ) Δ 2 ) O(Klog⁡(T)Δ2) regret upper bound, which is the best upper bound attained so far. Nonetheless, a gap between the lower and upper bounds, ranging from N to K , persists. It remains unclear whether the lower bound or the upper bound needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose a multi-level successive selection algorithm that obtains an O ( N log ⁡ ( T ) Δ 2 + K log ⁡ ( T ) Δ ) O(Nlog⁡(T)Δ2+Klog⁡(T)Δ) regret bound when the market satisfies serial dictatorship. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an algorithm that matches the lower bound in the problem of matching markets with bandits.},

  abstract     = {The support of a flow x in a network is the subdigraph induced by the arcs uv for which x ( u v ) &gt; 0 x(uv)&amp;gt;0 . We discuss a number of results on flows in networks where we put certain restrictions on structure of the support of the flow. Many of these problems are NP-hard because they generalize linkage problems for digraphs. For example deciding whether a network N = ( D , s , t , c ) N=(D,s,t,c) has a maximum flow x such that the maximum out-degree of the support D x Dx of x is at most 2 is NP-complete as it contains the 2-linkage problem as a very special case. Another problem which is NP-complete for the same reason is that of computing the maximum flow we can send from s to t along p paths (called a maximum p -path-flow ) in N N . Baier et al. (2005) gave a polynomial time algorithm which finds a p -path-flow x whose value is at least 2 3 23 of the value of a optimum p -path-flow when p ∈ { 2 , 3 } p∈{2,3} , and at least 1 2 12 when p ≥ 4 p≥4 . When p = 2 p=2 , they show that this is best possible unless P=NP. We show for each p ≥ 2 p≥2 that the value of a maximum p -path-flow cannot be approximated by any ratio larger than 9 11 911 , unless P=NP. We also consider a variant of the problem where the p paths must be disjoint. For this problem, we give an algorithm which gets within a factor 1 H ( p ) 1H(p) of the optimum solution, where H ( p ) H(p) is the p &#39;th harmonic number ( H ( p ) ∼ ln ⁡ ( p ) H(p)∼ln⁡(p) ). We show that in the case where the network is acyclic, we can find such a maximum p -path-flow in polynomial time for every p . We determine the complexity of a number of related problems concerning the structure of flows. For the special case of acyclic digraphs, some of the results we obtain are in some sense best possible.},

It derives inspiration from the intricate structure and functional attributes exhibited by biological cell membranes. This exposition is dedicated to an in-depth exploration of spiking neural P systems ( SN P systems), meticulously crafted to emulate the intricate signaling and interaction phenomena between cellular entities. Nevertheless, conventional spiking neural P systems confront inherent constraints pertaining to their excitation rules, which hinder their applicability to real-world challenges. In pursuit of overcoming these limitations, we introduce a novel paradigm encompassing the dynamic thresholds, synaptic weights, and the integration of multiple channels within synapses. This innovative framework culminates in the dynamic threshold spiking neural P systems with weights of synapses and multiple channels in synapses ( DSNP - WM systems). It is noteworthy that DSNP - WM systems demonstrate Turing universality, effectively functioning as versatile entities capable of both number generation and acceptance, in addition to performing intricate computations. Importantly, these systems showcase the efficiency in tackling challenges posed by semi-uniform solutions, exemplified by the Subsets Sum problem—a fundamental member of the NP-complete problem class, which employs a nondeterministic approach.},

  abstract     = {Resistance distance has been studied extensively in the past years, with the majority of previous studies devoted to undirected networks, in spite of the fact that various realistic networks are directed. Although several generalizations of resistance distance on directed graphs have been proposed, they either have no physical interpretation or are not a metric. In this paper, we first extend the definition of resistance distance to strongly connected directed graphs based on random walks and show that the two-node resistance distance on directed graphs is a metric. Then, we introduce the Laplacian matrix for directed graphs that subsumes the Laplacian matrix of undirected graphs as a particular case, and use its pseudoinverse to express the two-node resistance distance, and many other relevant quantities derived from resistance distances. Moreover, we define the resistance distance between a vertex and a vertex group on directed graphs and further define a problem of optimally selecting a group of fixed number of nodes, such that their resistance distance is minimized. Since this combinatorial optimization problem is NP-hard, we present a greedy algorithm with a proved approximation ratio, and conduct experiments on model and realistic networks to validate the performance of this approximation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In the study of temporal graphs, only paths respecting the flow of time are relevant. In this context, many concepts of walk disjointness have been proposed over the years and the validity of Menger&#39;s Theorem, as well as the complexity of related problems, have been investigated. Menger&#39;s Theorem states that the maximum number of vertex/edge disjoint paths between two vertices equals the minimum number of vertices/edges required to disconnect them. This paper introduces and investigates a type of disjointness that is only time-dependent. Two walks are said to be snapshot disjoint if they do not use edges active in the same snapshot. The related paths and cut problems are then defined and proved to be W[1]-hard and XP-time solvable when parameterized by the solution size. Additionally, in the light of the definition of Mengerian graphs given by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Kumar in their seminal paper (STOC&#39;2000), we define a snapshot Mengerian graph as a graph G for which there is no time labeling for its edges where Menger&#39;s Theorem does not hold in the context of snapshot disjointness. We then characterize Mengerian graphs in terms of forbidden structures and provide a polynomial-time recognition algorithm. All our proofs work on the strict and the non-strict cases. Finally, we also present results about problems defined by similar types of disjointness, namely, multiedge disjointness and departure time disjointness.},

  abstract     = {For a fixed positive integer d ≥ 2 d≥2 , a distance-d independent set (DdIS) of a graph is a vertex-subset whose distance between any two members is at least d . Imagine that there is a token placed on each member of a D d IS. Two D d ISs are adjacent under Token Sliding ( TS TS ) if one can be obtained from the other by moving a token from one vertex to one of its unoccupied adjacent vertices. Under Token Jumping ( TJ TJ ), the target vertex needs not to be adjacent to the original one. The Distance- d Independent Set Reconfiguration (D d ISR) problem under TS / TJ TS/TJ asks if there is a corresponding sequence of adjacent D d ISs that transforms one given D d IS into another. The problem for d = 2 d=2 , also known as the Independent Set Reconfiguration problem, has been well-studied in the literature and its computational complexity on several graph classes has been known. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of D d ISR on different graphs under TS TS and TJ TJ for any fixed d ≥ 3 d≥3 . On chordal graphs, we show that D d ISR under TJ TJ is in P when d is even and PSPACE -complete when d is odd. On split graphs, there is an interesting complexity dichotomy: D d ISR is PSPACE -complete for d = 2 d=2 but in P for d = 3 d=3 under TS TS , while under TJ TJ it is in P for d = 2 d=2 but PSPACE -complete for d = 3 d=3 . Additionally, certain well-known hardness results for d = 2 d=2 on perfect graphs and planar graphs of maximum degree three and bounded bandwidth can be extended for d ≥ 3 d≥3 .},

When only the stream constructor is allowed in equations, only periodic streams can be represented, and the structures of periodic streams and infinite regular trees are isomorphic. Therefore, one can use the theory of regular trees to get a sound and complete procedure to decide whether two equational systems are equivalent, that is, define the same streams. However, such an isomorphism no longer exists if one allows other operators in equations; in particular, there exist systems of equations which have the same unique solution as streams, but not as regular trees. Hence, equality of regular trees becomes stronger then equality of streams, with a negative impact on termination of functions whose definition is based on the equivalence of the representation of streams as finitary equational systems. To overcome this problem, we provide a weaker definition of equivalence, and prove its soundness and relative completeness. This definition is coinductive, hence non-algorithmic. However, we show that it can be turned into an equivalent inductive procedure.},

HDW enables an individual/organization to generate cryptographic keys and subsequently ease the key management problems (e.g., backup and recovery). Since the first HDW algorithm in 2012, HDW has gradually shown its fit for many promising use cases, such as Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies, global key revocation in FIDO2 standard. In order to achieve all the features (i.e., deterministic derivation, master public key and hierarchy) and the security (i.e., safety of cryptocurrencies and privacy protection of users) requirements for HDW, Yin et al. (ESORICS 2022) conceptualized Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet supporting Stealth Address (HDWSA), and gave a provably secure construction from the standard Computational Diffie-Hellman Assumption. Unfortunately, the construction is not quantum-resistant. In this work, we propose the first HDWSA construction from lattices to fill this gap, we provide the security proof for the construction in the random oracle model (ROM) based on hard problems over lattices. Compared with existing works, to the best of our knowledge, our construction not only captures all the HDW features and security properties, but also provides the potential quantum resistance.},

Our notion of pebble-depth satisfies the four fundamental properties of depth: i.e. deep sequences exist, trivial sequences are not deep, random sequences are not deep, and the existence of a slow growth law type result. We also compare pebble-depth to other depth notions based on finite-state transducers, pushdown compressors, and the Lempel-Ziv 78 compression algorithm. We first demonstrate how there exists a normal pebble-deep sequence even though there is no normal finite-state-deep sequence. We next build a sequence that has a pebble-depth level of roughly 1, a pushdown-depth level of roughly 1/2 and a finite-state-depth level of roughly 0.

With rrFE, we are able to produce cryptographic keys for our cryptosystems from fuzzy sources, like biometrics, physical unclonable functions, etc. There are rrFE schemes from the DDH, LWE and LPN assumptions. However there is no rrFE scheme from isogeny-based assumptions up to now. In this paper, we construct the first rrFE from isogeny. To obtain such an rrFE, we propose a new framework for constructing rrFE with a core technical tool, named Enhanced Effective Group Action (EEGA). EEGA is built upon the basic Effective Group Action (EGA), and is equipped with a sampling algorithm and a derivation algorithm. With such an EEGA, the same random input can be derived to produce different pseudo-random and unpredictable outputs. The EEGA, together with other routine building blocks like secure sketch and extractor, leverages an FE to achieve reusability and robustness. We construct EEGA based on CSI-FiSh, which admits the first rrFE scheme from isogeny. Besides, we also propose another two EEGA instantiations from the DDH assumption, and this provides another approach to DDH-based rrFE, which may be of independent interest.},

In detail, first, heuristic functions are designed to guide the searching of bugs more effectively, which exploits information extracted from invariants and rulesets, to improve the calculation of a distance between two states.

In this paper, we propose an orthogonal abstraction technique that works on the level of the individual instances of bit-vector operations. In particular, we compute only several bits of the operation result, which may be sufficient to decide the satisfiability of the formula.

It allows to send verifiably encrypted messages satisfying certain requirements to certified members of a group, while keeping the anonymity of the receivers. Similar to the tracing mechanism in group signatures, the receiver of any ciphertext can be identified by an opening authority - should the needs arise. The primitive of GE is motivated by a number of interesting privacy-preserving applications, including the filtering of encrypted emails sent to certified members of an organization. This paper aims to improve the state-of-affairs of GE systems. Our first contribution is the formalization of fully dynamic group encryption ( FDGE ) - a GE system simultaneously supporting dynamic user enrolments and user revocations. The latter functionality for GE has not been considered so far. As a second contribution, we realize the message filtering feature for GE based on a list of t -bit keywords and 2 commonly used policies: “permissive” - accept the message if it contains at least one of the keywords as a substring; “prohibitive” - accept the message if all of its t -bit substrings are at Hamming distance at least d from all keywords, for d ≥ 1 d≥1 . This feature so far has not been substantially addressed in existing instantiations of GE based on DCR, DDH, pairing-based and lattice-based assumptions. Our third contribution is the first instantiation of GE under code-based assumptions. The scheme is more efficient than the lattice-based construction of Libert et al. (Asiacrypt&#39;16) - which, prior to our work, is the only known instantiation of GE under post-quantum assumptions. Our scheme supports the 2 suggested policies for message filtering, and in the random oracle model, it satisfies the stringent security notions for FDGE that we put forward.},

  abstract     = {A trigraph is a graph where each pair of vertices is labelled either 0 (a non-arc), 1 (an arc) or ⋆ (both an arc and a non-arc). In a series of papers, Hell and co-authors (see for instance [P. Hell, 2014 [21] ]) proposed to study the complexity of homomorphisms from graphs to trigraphs, called Matrix Partition Problems , where arcs and non-arcs can be both mapped to ⋆-arcs, while a non-arc cannot be mapped to an arc, and vice-versa. Even though Matrix Partition Problems are generalisations of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) , they share with them the property of being “intrinsically” combinatorial. So, the question of a possible P-time vs NP-complete dichotomy is a very natural one and was raised in Hell et al.&#39;s papers. We propose a generalisation of Matrix Partition Problems to relational structures and study them with respect to the question of a dichotomy. We first show that trigraph homomorphisms and Matrix Partition Problems are P-time equivalent, and then prove that one can also restrict (with respect to having a dichotomy) to relational structures with a single relation. Failing in proving that Matrix Partition Problems on directed graphs are not P-time equivalent to Matrix Partitions on relational structures, we give some evidence that it might be unlikely by formalising the reductions used in the case of CSPs and by showing that such reductions cannot work for the case of Matrix Partition Problems. We then turn our attention to Matrix Partition problems that can be described by finite sets of (induced-subgraph) obstructions. We show, in particular, that any such problem has finitely many minimal obstructions if and only if it has finite duality. We conclude by showing that on trees (seen as trigraphs) it is NP-complete to decide whether a given tree has a homomorphism to another input trigraph. The latter shows a notable difference on tractability between CSP and Matrix Partition Problems as it is well-known that CSP is tractable on the class of trees.},

Our translations generalize constructions for Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), a less expressive specification language than LDL. In classical constructions, LTL formulas are first translated to alternating very weak Büchi automata (AVAs)—automata that have only singleton strongly connected components (SCCs); these AVAs are then handled by efficient disambiguation procedures. However, general AWAs can have larger SCCs, which complicates disambiguation. Currently, the only available disambiguation procedure has to go through an intermediate construction of nondeterministic Büchi automata (NBAs), which would incur an exponential blow-up of its own. We introduce a translation from general AWAs to UBAs with a singly exponential blow-up, which also immediately provides a singly exponential translation from LDL to UBAs. Interestingly, the complexity of our translation is smaller than the best known disambiguation algorithm for NBAs (broadly ( 0.53 n ) n (0.53n)n vs. ( 0.76 n ) n (0.76n)n ), while the input of our construction can be exponentially more succinct.},

In this paper, we consider nimber-preserving reductions among impartial games, which enhance the winnability-preserving reductions in traditional computational characterizations of combinatorial games. We prove that Generalized Geography is complete for the natural class, I P IP , of polynomially-short impartial rulesets, under polynomial-time nimber-preserving reductions. We refer to this notion of completeness as Sprague-Grundy-completeness . In contrast, we also show that not every PSPACE-complete ruleset in I P IP is Sprague-Grundy-complete for I P IP . By viewing every impartial game as an encoding of its nimber—a succinct game secret richer than its winnability alone—our technical result establishes the following striking cryptography-inspired homomorphic theorem: Despite the PSPACE-completeness of nimber computation for I P IP , there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to construct, for any pair of games G 1 , G 2 G1,G2 in I P IP , a Generalized Geography game G satisfying: nimber ( G ) = nimber ( G 1 ) ⊕ nimber ( G 2 ) . nimber(G)=nimber(G1)⊕nimber(G2).},

Previous research has shown that Edge Triangle Packing has a kernel of ( 3 + ϵ ) k (3+ϵ)k vertices, while Edge Triangle Covering has a kernel of 6 k vertices. In this paper, we show that the two problems allow kernels of 3 k vertices, improving all previous results. A significant contribution of our work is the utilization of a novel discharging method for analyzing kernel size, which exhibits potential for analyzing other kernel algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the RSA-polynomial problem, a cryptographic hard problem that has been recently proposed and studied in, along with its various applications. We revisit this problem and conduct a refined analysis to address an ambiguous condition that was previously introduced in the context of RSA-polynomial based semiprime factorization. By deriving an accurate attack condition, we are able to identify weak cases of the RSA-polynomial problem and expand the vulnerable bound. To facilitate this, we propose two optimized factoring attacks that leverage improved lattice-based theorems for solving bivariate integer polynomials of a specific form. The validity and effectiveness of our proposed factoring attacks are verified through both theoretical analysis and experimental results. Additionally, we examine the RSA-polynomial based commitment scheme and identify deficiencies that compromise its reliability. To address the limitations, we propose enhancements to the commitment phase of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Reaction systems are a computational model originally introduced to formalize the interactions between biochemical reactions that are the basis of the functioning of the living cell. Subsets of reactions of a reaction system define result functions which leads to a concept of functional equivalence. This equivalence in turn induces a functional cover relation on the reactions of a reaction system which captures redundancies in the system. In this paper, the functional cover relation is transferred to functional equivalence classes of sets of reactions. We introduce so-called atoms as building blocks of reactions. Atoms provide a characterization of functional equivalence classes of sets of reactions and are used to prove that the functional cover relation on functional equivalence classes of sets of reactions is a lattice.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we use the repeated-games framework to design and analyze a master-worker (MW) mechanism, where a master repeatedly outsources computational tasks to workers in exchange for payment. Previous work on MW models assumes that all workers are perfectly rational and aim to maximize their expected utility. Perfect rationality is a strong behavioral assumption because it requires that all workers follow the prescribed equilibrium. Such a model may be unrealistic in a practical setting, where some agents are not perfectly rational and may deviate from the equilibrium for short-term gains. Since the correctness of these MW protocols relies on workers following the equilibrium strategies, they are not robust against such deviations. We augment the game-theoretical MW model with the presence of such bounded-rational players or deviators . In particular, we show how to design a repeated-games based MW Verifiable Crowd Computing mechanism that incentivizes the rational workers (or followers ) to effectively punish such deviators through the use of terminal payments. We show that the master can use terminal payments to obtain correct answers to computational problems even in this more general model. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations that show that our mechanism outperforms related approaches.},

The ENPSs model has been proven to be Turing universal and the theoretical effort was focused on minimizing various descriptional complexity parameters. In this paper, we explore the minimum number of enzymatic rules needed to achieve universality in ENPSs, specifically focusing on the all-parallel derivation mode where all applicable rules are applied at the same time. We show that in the case of a linear restriction for production functions, the universality can be obtained using 21 enzymatic rules, substantially improving previously known results. If production functions are allowed to be polynomials of degree 2, we show that a single enzymatic rule is sufficient to achieve universality. To obtain these results, a new proof method is introduced based on the translation of ENPSs to systems of conditional recurrences.},

  abstract     = {We tackle the (classic) problem of minimizing (non)deterministic finite automata. The algorithm we put forward has the peculiarity of being incremental, i.e. , the minimization proceeds by successive iterations, each producing a partially minimized automaton language-equivalent to the input one. Our algorithm builds upon Almeida et al. from 2014, fixing a minor mistake and generalizing it to the nondeterministic case. It relies on a colouring procedure of a graph associated to the automaton, keeping track of partial information. After dealing with the deterministic case, we extend this idea to the bisimulation-minimization of nondeterministic automata. The algorithms for both the deterministic and the nondeterministic cases run in time O ( n m ) O(nm) for an automaton with n states and m transitions. The complexity for the deterministic case matches the complexity claimed by Almeida et al.. The nondeterministic case improves the fastest known incremental algorithm for this problem. We conclude introducing and using a notion of signature of a state, whose aim is to exploit pre-computed information potentially available, to speed-up the process. A signature is used to produce an initial partition of the automaton&#39;s states and can be easily integrated in both the incremental and the non-incremental algorithm.},

We prove that s - Club and s - Clique are NP -hard even restricted to graphs of degeneracy ≤3 whenever s ≥ 3 s≥3 , and to graphs of degeneracy ≤2 whenever s ≥ 5 s≥5 , which is a strictly stronger result than its W[1] -hardness parameterized by the degeneracy. Concerning γ - Complete Subgraph , we prove that it is W [1]-hard parameterized both by the degeneracy, implying the W[1] -hardness parameterized by the number of vertices in the γ -complete-subgraph, and by the number of elements outside the γ -complete subgraph.},

To render this domain more accessible, we propose a natural way to extend the known univariate EDAs to this setting. Different from a naïve reduction to the binary case, our approach avoids additional constraints. Since understanding genetic drift is crucial for an optimal parameter choice, we extend the known quantitative analysis of genetic drift to EDAs for multi-valued, categorical variables. Roughly speaking, when the variables take r different values, the time for genetic drift to become significant is r times shorter than in the binary case. Consequently, the update strength of the probabilistic model has to be chosen r times lower now. To investigate how desired model updates take place in this framework, we undertake a mathematical runtime analysis on the r -valued LeadingOnes problem. We prove that with the right parameters, the multi-valued UMDA solves this problem efficiently in O ( r ln ⁡ ( r ) 2 n 2 ln ⁡ ( n ) ) O(rln⁡(r)2n2ln⁡(n)) function evaluations. This bound is nearly tight as our lower bound Ω ( r ln ⁡ ( r ) n 2 ln ⁡ ( n ) ) Ω(rln⁡(r)n2ln⁡(n)) shows. Overall, our work shows that our good understanding of binary EDAs naturally extends to the multi-valued setting, and it gives advice on how to set the main parameters of multi-values EDAs.},

In this paper, we study the problem through the lens of mechanism design and incorporate the features of multi-party learning in our setting. First, each agent&#39;s valuation has externalities that depend on others&#39; types and actions. Second, each agent can only misreport a type lower than his true type, but not the other way round. We provide the optimal truthful mechanism in the separable utility setting, as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for truthful mechanisms in general cases.

  abstract     = {Effectively balancing traffic in datacenter networks is a crucial operational goal. Most existing load balancing approaches are handcrafted to the structure of the network and/or network workloads. Thus, new load balancing strategies are required if the underlying network conditions change, e.g., due to hard or grey failures, network topology evolution, or workload shifts. While we can theoretically derive the optimal load balancing strategy by solving an optimization problem given certain traffic and topology conditions, these problems take too much time to solve and makes the derived solution stale to deploy. In this paper, we describe a load balancing scheme Learned Load Balancing (LLB), which is a general approach to finding an optimal load balancing strategy for a given network topology and workload, and is fast enough in practice to deploy the inferred strategies. LLB uses deep supervised learning techniques to learn how to handle different traffic patterns and topology changes, and adapts to any failures in the underlying network. LLB leverages emerging trends in network telemetry, programmable switching, and “smart” NICs. Our experiments show that LLB performs well under failures and can be expanded to more complex, multi-layered network topologies. We also prototype neural network inference on smartNICs to demonstrate the workability of LLB.},

  abstract     = {Given a set X of species, a phylogenetic tree is an unrooted binary tree whose leaves are bijectively labelled by X . Such trees can be used to show the way species evolve over time. One way of understanding how topologically different two phylogenetic trees are, is to construct a minimum-size agreement forest: a partition of X into the smallest number of blocks, such that the blocks induce homeomorphic, non-overlapping subtrees in both trees. This is called a maximum agreement forest. This comparison yields insight into commonalities and differences in the evolution of X across the two trees. Computing a maximum agreement forest is NP-hard [8] . In this work we study the problem on caterpillars, which are path-like phylogenetic trees. We will demonstrate that, even if we restrict the input to this highly restricted subclass, the problem remains NP-hard and is in fact APX-hard. Furthermore we show that for caterpillars two standard reduction rules well known in the literature yield a tight kernel of size at most 7 k , compared to 15 k for general trees [11] . Finally we demonstrate that we can determine if two caterpillars have an agreement forest with at most k blocks in ⁎ O ⁎ ( 2.49 k ) O⁎(2.49k) time, compared to ⁎ O ⁎ ( 3 k ) O⁎(3k) for general trees [4] , where ⁎ O ⁎ ( . ) O⁎(.) suppresses polynomial factors.},

  abstract     = {One of the most fundamental method for comparing two given strings A and B is the longest common subsequence (LCS), where the task is to find (the length) of an LCS of A and B . In this paper, we deal with the STR-IC-LCS 1 problem which is one of the constrained LCS problems proposed by Chen and Chao [J. Comb. Optim, 2011]. A string Z is said to be an STR-IC-LCS of three given strings A , B , and P , if Z is a longest string satisfying that (1) Z includes P as a substring and (2) Z is a common subsequence of A and B . We present three efficient algorithms for this problem: First, we begin with a space-efficient solution which computes the length of an STR-IC-LCS in O ( n 2 ) O(n2) time and O ( ( ℓ + 1 ) ( n − ℓ + 1 ) ) O((ℓ+1)(n−ℓ+1)) space, where ℓ is the length of an LCS of A and B of length n . When ℓ = O ( 1 ) ℓ=O(1) or n − ℓ = O ( 1 ) n−ℓ=O(1) , then this algorithm uses only linear O ( n ) O(n) space. Second, we present a faster algorithm that works in O ( n r / log ⁡ r + n ( n − ℓ + 1 ) ) O(nr/log⁡r+n(n−ℓ+1)) time, where r is the length of P , while retaining the O ( ( ℓ + 1 ) ( n − ℓ + 1 ) ) O((ℓ+1)(n−ℓ+1)) space efficiency. Third, we give an alternative algorithm that runs in O ( n r / log ⁡ r + n ( n − ℓ ′ + 1 ) ) O(nr/log⁡r+n(n−ℓ′+1)) time with O ( ( ℓ ′ + 1 ) ( n − ℓ ′ + 1 ) ) O((ℓ′+1)(n−ℓ′+1)) space, where ℓ ′ ℓ′ denotes the STR-IC-LCS length for input strings A , B , and P .},

In this paper, we focus on studying this problem via the notion of CA intrinsic simulation. We say that automaton A A is simulated by B B if each space-time diagram of A A can be, after suitable transformations, reproduced by B B . We study affine automata – i.e., automata whose local rules are affine mappings of vector spaces. This broad class contains the well-studied cases of linear automata. The main result of this paper shows that (almost) every automaton affine over a finite field F p Fp can only simulate affine automata over F p Fp . We discuss how this general result implies, and widely surpasses, limitations of linear and additive automata previously proved in the literature. We provide a formalization of the simulation notions into algebraic language and discuss how this opens a new path to showing negative results about the computational power of cellular automata using deeper algebraic theorems.},

It is a two-level protocol, which supports unbounded message transmission . It can be useful in several settings, from the standard sender-receiver setting, to unreliable multicast and broadcast communication in networks with resource-constrained devices. The key ideas underlying our design are mainly three: the hash-chaining method, some techniques used in MAC-based authentication protocols for multicast communication, and the use of the Guy Fawkes signatures. To our knowledge, our protocol is the first one that solves the unbounded number of message transmission issue in unreliable settings. It does not lose efficiency and introduces only a constant-size overhead in message transmission, compared to solutions assuming a bounded number of message transmissions. We rigorously model the adversarial setting and show that our protocol satisfies the definition, leveraging on standard assumptions. Apart from the technical contribution, along the line, we also point out the relevance of ideas and techniques developed in the past in the area of efficient authentication, in order to provide new authentication schemes, ready for the post-quantum world.},

Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are compact data structures for various types of data and useful for solving optimization and enumeration problems. This study proposes enumeration algorithms for five intersection graph classes, which admit O ( n ) O(n) -bit string representations for their member graphs. Our algorithm for each class enumerates all unlabeled graphs with n vertices over BDDs representing the binary strings in time polynomial in n . Moreover, our algorithms are extended so that it enumerates those with constraints on the maximum (bi)clique size and/or the number of edges.},

Depending on the family of the components, different picture (2D) language families are obtained: e.g., the well-known tiling-system recognizable languages are the alphabetic projection of the crossword of local (regular) languages. We investigate the effect of the RCC operation especially when the components are context-free, also with application of an alphabetic projection. The resulting 2D families are compared with others defined in the past. The classical characterization of context-free languages, known as Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem, is extended to the crosswords in this way: the projection of a context-free crossword is equivalent to the projection of the intersection of a 2D Dyck language and the crossword of strictly locally testable language. The definition of 2D Dyck language relies on a new more flexible so-called Cartesian RCC operation on Dyck languages. The proof involves the version of the Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem that is non-erasing and uses a grammar-independent alphabet.},

  abstract     = {In fair division problems, we are given a set S of m items and a set N of n agents with individual preferences, and the goal is to find an allocation of items among agents so that each agent finds the allocation fair. There are several established fairness concepts and envy-freeness is one of the most extensively studied ones. However envy-free allocations do not always exist when items are indivisible and this has motivated relaxations of envy-freeness: envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) are two well-studied relaxations. We consider the problem of finding EF1 and EFX allocations for utility functions that are not necessarily monotone, and propose four possible extensions of different strength to this setting. In particular, we present a polynomial time algorithm for finding an EF1 allocation for two agents with arbitrary utility functions. An example is given showing that EFX allocations need not exist for two agents with non-monotone, non-additive, identical utility functions. However, when all agents have monotone (not necessarily additive) identical utility functions, we give a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that always finds an EFX allocation of chores. As a step toward understanding the general case, we discuss two subclasses of utility functions: Boolean utilities that are { 0 , + 1 } {0,+1} -valued functions, and negative Boolean utilities that are { 0 , − 1 } {0,−1} -valued functions. For the latter, we give a polynomial time algorithm that finds an EFX allocation when the utility functions are identical.},

First, the problem is formulated as a univariate constrained non-convex minimization problem, where prior information of the coefficients of the polynomial can be embedded by selecting proper weights. Then, an iteratively reweighted algorithm is designed to solve the obtained problem, and also the convergence and rate of convergence are uniformly demonstrated for all q in ( 0 , 2 ] (0,2] . Since all the existing methods for computing the nearest polynomial to multiple given polynomials with a given zero are limited to the real case, we ingeniously extend the results to the complex case.

  abstract     = {Herein, we discuss the existence of overlapping edge unfoldings for convex regular-faced polyhedra. Horiyama and Shoji showed that there are no overlapping edge unfoldings for all platonic solids and five of the Archimedean solids. The remaining five Archimedean solids were found to have edge unfoldings that overlap. In this study, we propose a method called rotational unfolding to find an overlapping edge unfolding of a polyhedron. We show that all the edge unfoldings of an icosidodecahedron, a rhombitruncated cuboctahedron, an n -gonal Archimedean prism ( 3 ≤ n ≤ 23 3≤n≤23 ), an m -gonal Archimedean antiprism ( 3 ≤ m ≤ 11 3≤m≤11 ), and 48 types of Johnson solids do not overlap. Our algorithm finds overlapping edge unfoldings for the snub cube, and 44 types of Johnson solids. We present analytic proof that an overlapping edge unfolding exists in an n -gonal Archimedean prism ( n ≥ 24 n≥24 ), and an m -gonal Archimedean antiprism ( m ≥ 12 m≥12 ). Our results prove the existence of overlapping edge unfoldings for convex regular-faced polyhedra.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a model for studying energy efficient algorithms by extending the well-studied comparison model. In our model, the result of a comparison is determined based on two parameters: (i) the energy used to perform a comparison, and (ii) the absolute difference between the two values being compared – thus introducing an energy-accuracy trade-off. This model also extends the ideas presented by Geissmann and Penna [SOFSEM 2018] and Funke et al. [Comput. Geom. 2005] wherein they use two distinct types of comparisons namely low and full-energy (cheap and expensive) comparisons, by introducing multiple types of comparisons. In this extension, the accuracy of a comparison becomes a function of the energy used. We consider the fundamental problems of (i) sorting (ii) selection (iii) searching, and design efficient algorithms for these problems in the new model. We also present lower bounds on the energy usage for some of these problems, showing that some of our algorithms are asymptotically optimal with respect to the energy usage.},

Using such a discretization, we can use Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm for computing the shortest path in the geometric graph obtained. This will lead us to two approximation algorithms for solving the Weighted Region Problem. For a given parameter ε ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , the first discretization scheme provides an approximate path that is ( 1 + 0.428 ε ) times better than the approximation given by Aleksandrov et al. (2005) [5] .

The mixture of functional types and session types has proven to be a challenge for type equivalence formulation: whereas functional type equivalence is often inductive and presented as a system of derivation rules, session type equivalence is often coinductive and usually presented as a bisimulation. We propose a unifying approach that handles the equivalence of functional and higher-order context-free session types together in the form of a system of rules generating a coinductively defined relation. Decidability of type equivalence is obtained via reduction to bisimulation for simple grammars, for which practical algorithms are known. To bridge the gap between types and simple grammars, we introduce a language of types with canonical names instead of bindings (which we call c-types), and propose a notion of canonical renaming to translate types to c-types.},

We fill this gap by introducing a new canonical automaton that we call the maximized prime átomaton, and study its properties.

We focus on a special class of irreflexive signed graphs, namely those in which the unicoloured edges form a spanning path or cycle, which we call separable signed graphs. We classify the complexity of list homomorphisms to these separable signed graphs; we believe that these signed graphs will play an important role for the general resolution of the irreflexive case. We also relate our results to a conjecture of Kim and Siggers concerning the special case of semi-balanced irreflexive signed graphs; we have proved the conjecture in another paper, and the present results add structural information to that topic.},

  abstract     = {Self-stabilization is a general paradigm that characterizes the ability of a distributed system to recover from transient faults. Since its introduction by Dijkstra in 1974, self-stabilization has been successfully applied to efficiently solve many networking tasks. However, most of the literature focuses on bidirectional networks. Now, in today&#39;s networks such as WSNs, some communication channels may be one-way only. Considering such network topologies, a.k.a. directed graphs, makes self-stabilization more complicated, and sometimes even impossible. In this paper, we investigate the gap in terms of requirements and efficiency when considering a directed graph instead of an undirected one as network topology for a self-stabilizing algorithm. Our case study is a variant of a synchronous unison algorithm proposed by Arora et al.; the synchronous unison being a clock synchronization problem.},

Here we define and study two closely related tools on a directed graph: directed emulators and automatic relations. A directed emulator morphism essentially encapsulates at the graph-theoretic level an epimorphism onto the minimal deterministic automaton. An automatic relation is the graph-theoretic version of the Myhill-Nerode relation. We show that an automatic relation determines a directed emulator morphism and respectively, a directed emulator morphism determines an automatic relation up to isomorphism. Consider the set S of all directed emulators of the underlying directed graph of the minimal deterministic automaton for L . We prove that the genus of L is min G ∈ S g ( G ) minG∈Sg(G) . We also consider the more restrictive notion of directed cover and prove that the genus of L is reached in the class of directed covers of the underlying directed graph of the minimal deterministic automaton for L . This stands in sharp contrast to undirected emulators and undirected covers which we also consider. Finally we prove that if the problem of determining the minimal genus of a directed emulator of a directed graph has a solution then the problem of determining the minimal genus of an undirected emulator of an undirected graph has a solution.},

In applications like Dijkstra&#39;s single source shortest path algorithm and Prim-Jarník&#39;s minimum spanning tree algorithm, the key of an item can decrease over time. Usually this is handled by either using a priority queue supporting the deletion of an arbitrary item or a dedicated DecreaseKey operation, or by inserting the same item multiple times but with decreasing keys. In this paper we study what happens if the keys associated with the items in a priority queue can decrease over time without informing the priority queue, and how such a priority queue can be used in Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm. We show that binary heaps with bottom-up insertions fail to report items with unchanged keys in correct order, while binary heaps with top-down insertions report items with unchanged keys in correct order. Furthermore, we show that skew heaps, leftist heaps, and priority queues based on linking the roots of heap-ordered trees, like pairing heaps, binomial queues and Fibonacci heaps, work correctly with decreasing keys without any modifications. Finally, we show that the post-order heap by Harvey and Zatloukal, a variant of a binary heap with amortized constant time insertions and amortized logarithmic time deletions, works correctly with decreasing keys and is a strong contender for an implicit priority queue supporting decreasing keys in practice.},

  abstract     = {A Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) scheme can authenticate a client if the client is able to provide the possession factor (like biometric feature, smart card) and the knowledge factor (like password, secret key) simultaneously. With only one factor, it is hard for an adversary to impersonate the client to pass the authentication, and thus 2FA provides better security than single-factor authentication schemes. However, as far as we know, all existing 2FA schemes do not consider the leakage of server&#39;s database, and their authenticity may fail when the database is also compromised (in addition to one factor). Considering numerous reports of database leakage in the real world, it seems imminent to study and design 2FA schemes resilient to database leakage. In this paper, we formalize security models for 2FA schemes by taking database leakage into account. Our security models consider malicious adversaries who can obtain both the client&#39;s one authentication factor and the server&#39;s database, and have two requirements, authenticity and zero-knowledge . Authenticity ensures that such malicious adversaries cannot impersonate the client to pass the authentication, while zero-knowledge guarantees that such malicious adversaries obtain no information about the client&#39;s the other factor. Zero-knowledge is especially important for biometric features (like faces, fingerprints), which are inherent to human beings and can hardly be changed. Then we propose a biometric-based 2FA scheme with biometric feature and secret key serving as the two authentication factors. Our 2FA scheme has three rounds, and we prove its authenticity and zero-knowledge under database leakage in the random oracle model. Notably, our construction makes a novel use of a recent technical advance called robust property-preserving hashing (Boyle et al., ITCS 2019) together with fully homomorphic encryption, to recognize or discern clients by their biometric samplings in a homomorphic and secure way.},

  abstract     = {In a non-zero inner product encryption (NIPE) scheme, ciphertexts and keys are associated with vectors from an inner-product space. Decryption of a ciphertext for x → x→ is allowed by a key for y → y→ if and only if the inner product 〈 x → , y → 〉 ≠ 0 〈x→,y→〉≠0 . Existing constructions of NIPE assume the length of the vectors are fixed apriori. We present the first constructions of unbounded non-zero inner product encryption (UNIPE) with constant sized keys. Unbounded here refers to the size of vectors not being pre-fixed during setup. Both constructions, based on bilinear maps, are proven selectively secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption. Our constructions are obtained by transforming the unbounded inner product functional encryption (IPFE) schemes of Dufour-Sans and Pointcheval (ACNS 2019), one in the strict domain setting and the other in the permissive domain setting. Interestingly, in the latter case, we prove security from DBDH, a static assumption while the original IPFE scheme relied on an interactive parameterised assumption. In terms of efficiency, features of the IPFE constructions are retained after transformation to NIPE. Notably, the public key and decryption keys have constant size.},

[ISC 2010] initialized the study of a variant of this problem called the Entropic LWE problem, where the LWE secret is generated from a distribution with a certain min-entropy. Brakerski and Döttling recently further extended the study in this field, and first proved the hardness of the Entropic LWE problem with unbounded secret [Eurocrypt 2020], then gave a similar result for the Entropic Ring-LWE problem [TCC 2020]. In this work, we systematically study the hardness of the Entropic Module-LWE problem. Adapting the “lossiness approach” to the module setting, we give lower entropy bounds for the secret distributions that guarantee the hardness of the Entropic Module-LWE problem in both search and decision cases, where results are divided into two settings: bounded and unbounded norm. We also present that our search entropy lower bound in the unbounded case is essentially tight. An application of our bounded result is to deduce the hardness for the Binary Module-LWE problem. One of our central techniques is a new generalized leftover hash lemma over rings, which might be of independent interest.},

The idea behind Ambainis&#39; algorithm is to first reduce the problem to the promised version in which x is promised to contain at most one colliding pair, and then design an algorithm A A requiring O ( N 2 / 3 ) O(N2/3) queries based on quantum walk search for the promise problem. However, A A is probabilistic and may fail to give the right answer. We thus, in this work, design a deterministic quantum algorithm for the promise problem which never errs and requires O ( N 2 / 3 ) O(N2/3) queries. This algorithm is proved optimal. Technically, we modify the quantum walk search operator on quasi-Johnson graph to have arbitrary phases, and then use Jordan&#39;s lemma as the analyzing tool to reduce the quantum walk search operator to the generalized Grover&#39;s operator. This allows us to utilize the recently proposed fixed-axis-rotation (FXR) method for deterministic quantum search, and hence achieve 100% success.},

  abstract     = {Matrix grammars are one of the first approaches ever proposed in regulated rewriting, prescribing that rules have to be applied in a certain order. In traditional regulated rewriting, the most interesting case shows up when all rules are context-free. Typical descriptional complexity measures incorporate the number of nonterminals or the length, i.e., the number of rules per matrix. When viewing matrices as program fragments, it becomes natural to consider additional applicability conditions for such matrices. Here, we focus on forbidding sets, i.e., a matrix is applicable to a sentential form w only if none of the words in its forbidding set occurs as a subword in w . This gives rise to further natural descriptional complexity measures: How long could words in forbidding sets be? How many words could be in any forbidding set? How many matrices contain non-empty forbidding contexts? As context-free grammars with forbidding sets are known as generalized forbidding grammars, we call this variant of matrix grammars also generalized forbidding. In this paper, we attempt to answer the four questions above while studying the computational completeness of generalized forbidding matrix grammars. In the course of our studies, we also define several new normal forms for type-0 grammars that might be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Functional graphs (FGs) model the graph structures used to analyse the behaviour of functions from a discrete set to itself. In turn, such functions are used to study real complex phenomena evolving in time. As the systems involved can be quite large, it is interesting to decompose and factorise them into several subgraphs acting together. Polynomial equations over functional graphs provide a formal way to represent this decomposition and factorisation mechanism, and solving them validates or invalidates hypotheses on their decomposability. The current solution method breaks down a single equation into a series of basic equations of the form A × X = B A×X=B (with A , X , and B being FGs) to identify the possible solutions. However, it is able to consider just FGs made of cycles only. This work proposes an algorithm for solving these basic equations for general connected FGs. By exploiting a connection with the cancellation problem, we prove that the upper bound to the number of solutions is closely related to the size of the cycle in the coefficient A of the equation. The cancellation problem is also involved in the main algorithms provided by the paper. We introduce a polynomial-time semi-decision algorithm able to provide constraints that a potential solution will have to satisfy if it exists. Then, exploiting the ideas introduced in the first algorithm, we introduce a second exponential-time algorithm capable of finding all solutions by integrating several ‘hacks’ that try to keep the exponential as tight as possible.},

  abstract     = {Approximating the roots of a holomorphic function in an input box is a fundamental problem in many domains. Most algorithms in the literature for solving this problem are conditional, i.e., they make some simplifying assumptions, such as, all the roots are simple or there are no roots on the boundary of the input box, or the underlying machine model is Real RAM. Root clustering is a generalization of the root approximation problem that allows for errors in the computation and makes no assumption on the multiplicity of the roots. An unconditional algorithm for computing a root clustering of a holomorphic function was given by Yap, Sagraloff and Sharma in 2013 [36] . They proposed a subdivision based algorithm using effective predicates based on Pellet&#39;s test while avoiding any comparison with zeros (using soft zero comparisons instead). In this paper, we analyze the running time of their algorithm. We use the continuous amortization framework to derive an upper bound on the size of the subdivision tree. We specialize this bound to the case of polynomials and some simple transcendental functions such as exponential and trigonometric sine. We show that the algorithm takes exponential time even for these simple functions, unlike the case of polynomials. We also derive a bound on the bit-precision used by the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result for holomorphic functions. We introduce new geometric parameters, such as the relative growth of the function on the input box, for analyzing the algorithm. Thus, our estimates naturally generalize the known results, i.e., for the case of polynomials.},

Generalizing an idea from [6] , we investigate a characterization of UMU formulas by whether they allow transformation into a MU formula by adding literals and/or clauses. It can be shown that simplicity in constructing of such extensions correlates with the degree of intertwining of the MU subformulas. For UMU formulas, however, we can give only extensions that have an exponential size in the worst case.

  abstract     = {Attribute-based memory Updates ( in short) is an interaction mechanism recently introduced for adapting the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) programming paradigm to distributed reactive systems, such as autonomic and smart IoT device ensembles. In this model, an event (e.g., an input from a sensor, or a device state update) can trigger an ECA rule, whose execution can cause the state update of (possibly) many remote devices at once; the latter are selected “on the fly” by means of predicates over their state, without the need of a central coordinating entity. However, the combination of different systems may yield unexpected interactions, e.g., when a new device is added to an existing secure system, potentially hindering the security of the whole ensemble of devices. This can be critical in the IoT, where smart devices are more and more pervasive in our daily life. In this paper, we consider the problem of ensuring security and safety requirements for systems (and, in turn, for IoT devices). The first are a form of noninterference, as they correspond to avoid forbidden information flows (e.g., information flows violating confidentiality); while the second are a form of non-interaction, as they correspond to avoid unintended executions (e.g., leading to erroneous/unsafe states). In order to formally model these requirements, we introduce suitable behavioral equivalences for . These equivalences are generalizations of hiding bisimilarity , i.e., a kind of weak bisimilarity where we can compare systems up to actions at different levels of security. Leveraging these behavioral equivalences, we propose (syntactic) sufficient conditions guaranteeing the requirements and, then, effective algorithms for statically verifying such conditions.},

  abstract     = {A set of words, also called a language, is letter-balanced if the number of occurrences of each letter only depends on the length of the word, up to a constant. Similarly, a language is factor-balanced if the difference of the number of occurrences of any given factor in words of the same length is bounded. The most prominent example of a letter-balanced but not factor-balanced language is given by the Thue–Morse sequence. We establish connections between the two notions, in particular for languages given by substitutions and, more generally, by sequences of substitutions. We show that the two notions essentially coincide when the sequence of substitutions is proper. For the class of Thue–Morse–Sturmian languages, we give a full characterisation of factor-balancedness.},

In this paper, we continue this research line, extend these games to other graph convexities, and obtain winning strategies and complexity results. Among them, we obtain winning strategies for general convex geometries and winning strategies for trees from the Sprague-Grundy theory on impartial games. We also obtain the first PSPACE-hardness results on convexity games, by proving that the normal play and the misère play of the impartial hull game on the geodesic convexity is PSPACE-complete even in graphs with diameter two.},

  abstract     = {Finite dynamical systems (FDSs) are commonly used to model systems with a finite number of states that evolve deterministically and at discrete time steps. Considered up to isomorphism, those correspond to functional graphs. As such, FDSs have a sum and product operation, which correspond to the direct sum and direct product of their respective graphs; the collection of FDSs endowed with these operations then forms a semiring. The algebraic structure of the product of FDSs is particularly interesting. For instance, an FDS can be factorised if and only if it is composed of two sub-systems running in parallel. In this work, we further the understanding of the factorisation, division, and root finding problems for FDSs. Firstly, an FDS A is cancellative if one can divide by it unambiguously, i.e. A X = A Y AX=AY implies X = Y X=Y . We prove that an FDS A is cancellative if and only if it has a fixed point. Secondly, we prove that if an FDS A has a k -th root (i.e. B such that B k = A Bk=A ), then it is unique. Thirdly, unlike integers, the monoid of FDS product does not have unique factorisation into irreducibles. We instead exhibit a large class of monoids of FDSs with unique factorisation. To obtain our main results, we introduce the unrolling of an FDS, which can be viewed as a space-time expansion of the system. This allows us to work with (possibly infinite) trees, where the product is easier to handle than its counterpart for FDSs.},

  abstract     = {Ring signature and group signature are two major cryptographic primitives providing users anonymity and authentication simultaneously. While both primitives enable any user to sign messages as a member of a set of users, the feature of ring signature is that a signer can choose a group in an ad-hoc manner, which is called a ring, by itself. Conversely, in group signature, a group membership is managed by some trusted third party, which is called a group manager, and an (appropriate) accountability is provided for the group manager to identify illegal anonymous signers. Accountable ring signature (ARS) is a cryptographic primitive combining the features of ring signature and group signature. ARS allows signers to choose their groups (rings) in an ad-hoc manner, and at the same time, maintain accountability by forcing them to select a designated opener who can identify them. In this paper, we propose the first ARS scheme with O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) signature size in the standard model (without depending on the random oracle methodology), where n is the size of a ring. More precisely, we propose a new generic construction of ARS based on (standard) signature, (standard) public key encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system, somewhere perfectly binding hash function, and public key encryption with non-interactive opening. All building blocks for our ARS scheme can be obtained under the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption over bilinear groups.},

In the fair k -center problem, we are given a set X of points in a metric space and a parameter k ∈ Z + k∈Z+ , where the points in X are divided into several groups, and each point is assigned a color to denote which group it is in. The goal is to partition X into k clusters such that the number of cluster centers with each color is equal to a given value, and the k -center problem objective is minimized. In this paper, we consider the fair k -center problem with outliers and capacity constraints, denoted as the fair k -center with outliers (F k CO) problem and the capacitated fair k -center (CF k C) problem, respectively. The outliers constraints allow up to z outliers to be discarded when computing the objective function, while the capacity constraints require that each cluster has size no more than L . In this paper, we design an Fixed-Parameter Tractability (FPT) approximation algorithm and a polynomial approximation algorithm for the above two problems. In particular, our algorithms give ( 1 + ϵ ) (1+ϵ) -approximations with FPT time for the F k CO and CF k C problems in doubling metric space. Moreover, we also propose a 3-approximation algorithm in polynomial time for the F k CO problem with some reasonable assumptions.},

In this article, we adopt a slightly different interpretation of tipsiness of the cop and robber where we assume that in any round of the game there are four possible outcomes: a sober cop move, a sober robber move, a tipsy (uniformly random) move by the cop, and a tipsy (uniformly random) move by the robber. We study this tipsy cop and tipsy robber game on the infinite grid graph and on certain families of infinite trees including δ -regular trees and δ -regular trees rooted to a Δ-regular tree, where Δ ≥ δ Δ≥δ . Our main results analyze strategies for the cop and robber on these graphs. We conclude with some directions for further study.},

We study the case where robots move along a graph based on a square lattice and we formally define the Molecular Pattern Formation (MPF) problem, where a specific configuration of robots assembled into molecules must be reached. As a preliminary general result, we provide a necessary condition for its solvability. Then, we actually show that dealing with molecules can resolve in some cases the symmetry breaking issue on grids where otherwise robots cannot. Finally, we introduce an interesting case study, representative of the MPF problem, in which the molecules can be formed by the set of the seven tetrominoes (aka Tetris blocks). We provide a complete characterization of this specific problem, providing a distributed algorithm able to form a molecular pattern whenever the necessary condition for the solvability of MPF is verified.},

  abstract     = {A dominating set S of graph G is called an r-grouped dominating set if S can be partitioned into S 1 , S 2 , … , S k S1,S2,…,Sk such that the size of each unit S i Si is r and the subgraph of G induced by S i Si is connected. The concept of r -grouped dominating sets generalizes several well-studied variants of dominating sets with requirements for connected component sizes, such as the ordinary dominating sets ( r = 1 r=1 ), paired dominating sets ( r = 2 r=2 ), and connected dominating sets ( r is arbitrary and k = 1 k=1 ). In this paper, we investigate the computational complexity of r -Grouped Dominating Set , which is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has an r -grouped dominating set with at most k units. For general r , r -Grouped Dominating Set is hard to solve in various senses because the hardness of the connected dominating set is inherited. We thus focus on the case in which r is a constant or a parameter, but we see that r -Grouped Dominating Set for every fixed r &gt; 0 r&amp;gt;0 is still hard to solve. From the observations about the hardness, we consider the parameterized complexity concerning well-studied graph structural parameters. We first see that r -Grouped Dominating Set is fixed-parameter tractable for r and treewidth, which is derived from the fact that the condition of r -grouped domination for a constant r can be represented as monadic second-order logic ( MSO 2 MSO2 ). This fixed-parameter tractability is good news, but the running time is not practical. We then design an ⁎ O ⁎ ( min ⁡ { ( 2 τ ( r + 1 ) ) τ , ( 2 τ ) 2 τ } ) O⁎(min⁡{(2τ(r+1))τ,(2τ)2τ}) -time algorithm for general r ≥ 2 r≥2 , where τ is the twin cover number, which is a parameter between vertex cover number and clique-width. For paired dominating set and trio dominating set, i.e., r ∈ { 2 , 3 } r∈{2,3} , we can speed up the algorithm, whose running time becomes ⁎ O ⁎ ( ( r + 1 ) τ ) O⁎((r+1)τ) . We further argue the relationship between FPT results and graph parameters, which draws the parameterized complexity landscape of r -Grouped Dominating Set .},

Nowadays such devices are usually defined such that every push operation pushes exactly one additional symbol on the pushdown store and, in addition, stationary moves are not allowed so that the devices work in real time. Here, we relax this strong definition and consider IDPDAs that may push more than one symbol in one step (push-IDPDA) or may perform stationary moves (stat-IDPDA). We study the computational power of the extended variants both in the deterministic and nondeterministic case, we investigate several decidability questions for the new automata classes, and we obtain interesting representations by inverse homomorphisms. Namely, every (1) deterministic, (2) real-time deterministic, and (3) nondeterministic context-free language can be characterized as the inverse homomorphic image of a language accepted by a (1) stat-IDPDA, (2) push-IDPDA, and (3) nondeterministic push-IDPDA.},

The weakly toll interval of a set S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) , denoted by I ( S ) I(S) , is formed by S and the vertices belonging to some weakly toll walk between two vertices of S . Set S is weakly toll convex if I ( S ) = S I(S)=S . The weakly toll convex hull of S , denote by H ( S ) H(S) , is the minimum weakly toll convex set containing S . The weakly toll interval number of G is the minimum cardinality of a set S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) such that I ( S ) = V ( G ) I(S)=V(G) ; and the weakly toll hull number of G is the minimum cardinality of a set S ⊆ V ( G ) S⊆V(G) such that H ( S ) = V ( G ) H(S)=V(G) . In this work, we show how to compute the weakly toll interval and the weakly toll hull numbers of a graph in polynomial time. In contrast, we show that determining the weakly toll convexity number of a graph G (the size of a maximum weakly toll convex set different from V ( G ) V(G) ) is NP -hard.},

For 2 ≤ k ≤ 5 2≤k≤5 , faster Monte-Carlo algorithms do exist, running in O ( n 1 − 1 / k ) O(n1−1/k) rounds, based on upper bounding the number of messages to be forwarded, and aborting search sub-routines for which this number exceeds certain thresholds. We investigate the possible extension of these threshold-based algorithms, for the detection of larger cycles. We first show that, for every k ≥ 6 k≥6 , there exists an infinite family of graphs containing a 2 k -cycle for which any threshold-based algorithm fails to detect that cycle. Hence, in particular, neither C 12 C12 -freeness nor C 14 C14 -freeness can be decided by threshold-based algorithms. Nevertheless, we show that { C 12 , C 14 } {C12,C14} -freeness can still be decided by a threshold-based algorithm, running in O ( n 1 − 1 / 7 ) = O ( n 0.857 … ) O(n1−1/7)=O(n0.857…) rounds, which is faster than using the generic algorithm, which would run in O ( n 1 − 1 / 22 ) ≃ O ( n 0.954 … ) O(n1−1/22)≃O(n0.954…) rounds. Moreover, we exhibit an infinite collection of families of cycles such that threshold-based algorithms can decide F F -freeness for every F F in this collection.},

Inner product encryption ( IPE ) is a promising cryptographic primitive that facilitates access control over outsourced encrypted data by restricting decryption capability via an inner product relation. Most of the existing IPE s are built assuming a priori bound on the length of attribute vectors associated with the plane data. A situation may occur when adding new attributes is essential due to upgradation. Thus it is desirable to construct IPE with variable length attribute vectors instead of fixing the length at the setup phase. Such IPE s are more flexible while encrypting data and consequently have more real-life applications. In the following, we make our contributions:},

WD0L systems operate under a control that is inspired by the well-known phenomenon of Watson-Crick complementarity of the double helix of DNA. Depending on a trigger, the standard D0L rewriting step is applied either to the string or to its complementary string. In this paper, we examine extended networks of standard Watson-Crick D0L systems (ENSWD0L systems) with a variant of incomplete communication. An NWD0L system is a finite set of WD0L systems defined over a common DNA-like alphabet and operating in a synchronized manner. After rewriting their own strings in the WD0L manner, they communicate copies of certain generated strings (the so-called good strings) to the other nodes. In some previous papers, it was shown that ENSWD0L systems are computationally complete, and their computational power does not change if the communicated string is a non-empty prefix (non-empty suffix) of the generated string. We strengthen the previous results, namely we show that ENSWD0L systems are computationally complete even if the communicated string is an arbitrary substring of the generated string.},

While the existing works in this domain have primarily considered a threshold adversarial model where the adversary can corrupt any subset of up to t parties, very little attention has been paid to the non-threshold adversarial model. In the latter model, the corruption capacity of the adversary is characterized by an adversary structure Z Z , which enumerates all possible subsets of potentially corrupt parties and where the adversary can select any one subset from Z Z for corruption. While the optimal resilience for ABA against threshold adversaries is t &lt; n / 3 t&amp;lt;n/3 , against non-threshold adversaries one can design an ABA protocol, provided Z Z satisfies the Q ( 3 ) Q(3) condition; i.e. if the union of no three subsets from Z Z covers all the n parties. We present the first almost-surely terminating ABA protocol against Q ( 3 ) Q(3) adversary structures. Previously, almost-surely terminating ABA protocol is known with non-optimal resilience where Z Z satisfies the Q ( 4 ) Q(4) condition; i.e. if the union of no four subsets from Z Z covers all the n parties. To design our protocol, we present a shunning asynchronous verifiable secret-sharing (SAVSS) scheme for Q ( 3 ) Q(3) adversary structures, which is of independent interest.},

Next, it is shown that the languages defined by trellis automata (one-way real-time cellular automata) are not closed under either operation, but are closed under GF(2)-concatenation with regular languages; the context-free languages and their linear and unambiguous variants are not closed under GF(2)-concatenation with a two-element set, nor under GF(2)-star; the LR( k ) languages are closed under GF(2)-concatenation with a regular set on the right, but not on the left.},

Grid intersection graphs are the intersection graphs of axis-parallel line segments in which two vertical (similarly, two horizontal) segments cannot intersect. We say that a (not necessarily axis-parallel) straight line ℓ stabs a segment s , if s intersects ℓ . A graph G is a stabbable grid intersection graph ( ) if there is a grid intersection representation of G in which the same line stabs all its segments.

Specifically, we show that if D D is a semi-uniform distribution over Z q m × n Zqm×n (namely, D D can be publicly derived from and has a “small difference” to the uniform distribution over Z q m × n Zqm×n ), then for appropriate choices of ( S , χ ) (S,χ) , the problem ( D , S , χ , m ) - LWE n , q (D,S,χ,m)-LWEn,q is hard under the standard LWE assumption. Moreover, we also show that the semi-uniform MLWE problem is hard under the standard MLWE assumption.

Thirdly, we obtain an IND-CCA2 secure public key encryption scheme by converting our one-way secure public key encryption scheme under the hardness assumption of the RSD Dual Problem. In terms of efficiency, our scheme has a smaller public key size by taking advantage of the block circulant structure. For 128-bit security, the public key size of our proposal is 13% of Lau-Tan&#39;s cryptosystem (in the rank metric), and 19% of BIKE (in the Hamming metric).

The processes of AC have a layered structure of ambients that enable us to describe not only mobile processes but also real entities such as networks, factories and freight systems in which synchronization between objects is crucial. For example, a container must be brought out from a container yard just after the container ship reached the terminal. While such a protocol can be described using the primitives (in, out, open) of AC, the protocol is easily corrupted due to the phenomenon called “grave interference”, which led us to design SAC. The following advantages for using SAC are that we can describe synchronized actions of objects without grave interference and expressions for such synchronized actions can be simpler than using AC. We give an example of SAC processes for stacking containers in constrained shipping order, e.g., in ascending order, the execution sequences of which can be used to improve the efficiency of the reinforcement learning method we are currently developing.},

  abstract     = {The Simon&#39;s congruence problem is to determine whether or not two strings have the same set of subsequences of length no greater than a given integer, and the problem can be answered in linear time. We consider the Simon&#39;s congruence pattern matching problem that looks for all substrings of a text that are congruent to a pattern under the Simon&#39;s congruence. We propose a linear time algorithm by reusing results from previous computations with the help of new data structures called X-trees and Y-trees. Moreover, we investigate several variants of the problem such as identifying the shortest substring or subsequence of the text that is congruent to the pattern under the Simon&#39;s congruence, or finding frequent matchings. We design efficient algorithms for these problems. We conclude the paper with two open problems: finding the longest congruent subsequence and optimizing the pattern matching problem.},

Puzzle and Dragons (PAD) combines the three-elimination game-play of Candy Crush Saga and the 15-puzzle.

  abstract     = {Combinatorial auctions (CAs) offer the flexibility for bidders to articulate complex preferences when competing for multiple assets. However, the behavior of bidders under different payment rules is often unclear. Our research explores the relationship between core constraints and several core-selecting payment rules. Specifically, we examine the natural and desirable property of payment rules of being non-decreasing , which ensures that bidding higher does not lead to lower payments. Earlier studies revealed that the VCG-nearest payment method – a commonly employed payment rule – fails to adhere to this principle even for single-minded CAs. We establish that when a single effective core constraint exists, the payment maintains the non-decreasing property in single-minded CAs. To identify auctions where such a constraint is present, we introduce a novel framework using conflict graphs to represent single-minded CAs and establish sufficient conditions for the existence of single effective core constraints. We proceed with an analysis of the implications on bidder behavior, demonstrating that there is no overbidding in any Nash equilibrium when considering non-decreasing core-selecting payment rules. Our study concludes by establishing the non-decreasing nature of two additional payment rules, namely the proxy and proportional payment rules, for single-minded CAs.},

A graph family G G is near optimal colourable if there is a constant number c such that every graph G ∈ G G∈G satisfies χ ( G ) ≤ max ⁡ { c , ω ( G ) } χ(G)≤max⁡{c,ω(G)} , where χ ( G ) χ(G) and ω ( G ) ω(G) are the chromatic number and clique number of G , respectively. The near optimal colourable graph families together with the Lovász theta function are useful for the study of the colouring problems for hereditary graph families. We investigate the near optimal colourability for ( H 1 , H 2 H1,H2 )-free graphs. Our main result is an almost complete characterisation for the near optimal colourability for ( H 1 , H 2 H1,H2 )-free graphs with two exceptional cases, one of which is the celebrated Gyárfás conjecture. As an application of our results, we show that the colouring problem for ( 2 K 2 , P 4 ∨ K n 2K2,P4∨Kn )-free graphs is polynomial time solvable, which solves an open problem in Dabrowski and Paulusma (2018) [6] .},

The control-flow model offers benefits to applications in which the movement of shared objects is costly due to their sizes and security purposes. In this paper, we study the ordered scheduling problem of committing dependent transactions according to their predefined priorities in this model. The considered problem naturally arises in areas, such as loop parallelization and state-machine-based computing, where producing executions equivalent to a priority order is needed to satisfy certain properties. Specifically, we study ordered scheduling considering two performance metrics fundamental to any distributed system: (i) execution time - total time to commit all the transactions and (ii) communication cost - the total distance traversed in accessing required shared objects. We design scheduling algorithms that are individually or simultaneously efficient for both the metrics and rigorously evaluate them through several benchmarks on random and grid graphs, validating their efficiency. To our best knowledge, this is the first study of ordered scheduling in the control-flow model of distributed transaction execution.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing is an emerging promising computing paradigm, which can significantly reduce the service latency by moving computing and storage demands to the edge of the network. Resource-constrained edge servers may fail to process multiple tasks simultaneously when several time-delay-sensitive and computationally demanding tasks are offloaded to only one edge server, and results in some issues such as high task processing costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel idea by dividing one task into several sub-tasks via the dependencies within the task and then offloading the sub-tasks to other edge servers in light of high concurrency for synchronization to minimize the total cost of task processing. To address the challenge of task dependencies and adaptation to dynamic scenes, we propose a Multi-Task Dependency Offloading Algorithm (MTDOA) based on deep reinforcement learning. The task offloading decision is modeled as a Markov decision process, and then a graph attention network is applied to extract the dependency information of different tasks, while LSTM and DQN are combined to deal with sequential problems. The simulation results show that the proposed MTDOA has better convergence ability compared with the baseline algorithms.},

In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate three hybrid quantum k -Means algorithms, exploiting different degrees of parallelism. Indeed, each algorithm incrementally leverages quantum parallelism to reduce the complexity of the cluster assignment step up to a constant cost. In particular, we exploit quantum phenomena to speed up the computation of distances. The core idea is that the computation of distances between records and centroids can be executed simultaneously, thus saving time, especially for big datasets. We show that our hybrid quantum k-Means algorithms are theoretically faster than the classical algorithm, while experiments suggest that it is possible to obtain comparable clustering results.},

  abstract     = {In the multicast communication scenario, compared with broadcast encryption, broadcast signcryption or multi-receiver signcryption has additional ability to authenticate the source of the message. With the enhanced awareness of privacy preservation, ordinary users pay more attention to the identity leakage in the communication process. The primitive of anonymous broadcast signcryption has been proposed to solve this problem, which provides additional anonymity compared with the existing broadcast signcryption. However, most anonymous broadcast signcryption schemes only ensure the sender&#39;s identity concealment but ignore the anonymity of the receiver set. In this paper, we present a fully anonymous identity-based broadcast signcryption scheme, which meets insider unforgeability, outsider confidentiality, identity concealment of sender and full anonymity of the receiver set. In addition, our scheme has two further desirable characteristics. One is public verifiability which means any third party can verify the validity of the message source without knowing the private key provided by the receiver. The other is statelessness which means the user does not need to update the private key due to the join or revocation of other users. Moreover, our scheme has constant-size public parameters and private key as well as constant decryption complexity, which makes the scheme more suitable for deployment in devices with limited storage or low computing power such as IoT devices.},

Here, objects from R R arrive one by one. The objective of the problem is to maintain a hitting set of the minimum cardinality by taking irrevocable decisions. In this paper, we consider the problem when objects are unit balls or unit hypercubes in R d Rd , and the points from Z d Zd are used for hitting them. First, we address the case when objects are unit intervals in R R and present an optimal deterministic algorithm with competitive ratio of 2. Then, we consider the case when objects are unit balls. For hitting unit balls in R 2 R2 and R 3 R3 , we present 4 and 14-competitive deterministic algorithms, respectively. On the other hand, for hitting unit balls in R d Rd , we propose an O ( d 4 ) O(d4) -competitive deterministic algorithm, and we demonstrate that, for d &lt; 4 d&amp;lt;4 , the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at least d + 1 d+1 . In the end, we explore the case where objects are unit hypercubes. For hitting unit hypercubes in R 2 R2 and R 3 R3 , we obtain 4 and 8-competitive deterministic algorithms, respectively. For hitting unit hypercubes in R d Rd ( d ≥ 3 d≥3 ), we present an O ( d 2 ) O(d2) -competitive randomized algorithm. Furthermore, we prove that the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm for the problem is at least d + 1 d+1 for any d ∈ N d∈N .},

  abstract     = {For a simple graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) without any isolated vertex, a co-secure dominating set S of G satisfies two properties, (i) S is a dominating set of G , (ii) for every vertex v ∈ S v∈S , there exists a vertex u ∈ V ∖ S u∈V∖S such that u v ∈ E uv∈E and ( S ∖ { v } ) ∪ { u } (S∖{v})∪{u} is a dominating set of G . The minimum cardinality of a co-secure dominating set of G is called the co-secure domination number of G and is denoted by γ c s ( G ) γcs(G) . The Co-secure Domination problem is to find a co-secure dominating set of a graph G of cardinality γ c s ( G ) γcs(G) . The decision version of the problem is known to be NP-complete for bipartite, planar, and split graphs. On the other hand, it is also known that the Co-secure Domination problem is efficiently solvable for proper interval graphs and cographs. In an effort to reduce the complexity gap of the Co-secure Domination problem, in this paper, we work on various important graph classes. We show that the decision version of the problem remains NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs and for some subclasses of bipartite graphs, namely, chordal bipartite graphs, star-convex bipartite graphs, and comb-convex bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we give an efficient algorithm to compute the co-secure domination number of chain graphs, which is an important subclass of bipartite graphs. In addition, we show that the problem is linear-time solvable for bounded tree-width graphs and bounded clique-width graphs. Further, we establish that the computational complexity of this problem differs from that of the classical domination problem.},

  abstract     = {Diagnosability is an important indicator to measure the reliability of multiprocessor systems. If we focus on the status of a particular node, instead of doing global diagnosis, Hsu and Tan introduced the concept of local diagnosis and proposed an extended star structure to diagnose a node under the comparison model. Usually, there is a gap between the local diagnosability and the lower bound guaranteed by the extended star structure mentioned above. In this paper, we propose a new testing structure and a corresponding diagnosis algorithm to diagnose a node under the comparison model and better evaluate the local diagnosability. The local diagnosability of a node is upper bounded by its degree in the system. If the local diagnosability of each node equals to its degree in the system, then we say this system has the strong local diagnosability property. Based on the new structure, we provide two sufficient conditions for a multiprocessor system to have the strong local diagnosability property. As applications, we show that the n -dimensional star graph S n Sn and pancake graph P n Pn with faulty links have the strong local diagnosability property no matter how many edges are faulty, provided that each node connects to at least three fault-free links. Moreover, we show that S n Sn and P n Pn keep the strong local diagnosability property even if they have up to 3 n − 12 3n−12 faulty links, assuming that each node connects to at least two fault-free links. Simulations are presented to show the performance of our tree structure.},

  abstract     = {Consider a variant of Tetris played on a board of width w and infinite height, where the pieces are axis-aligned rectangles of arbitrary integer dimensions, the pieces can only be moved before letting them drop, and a row does not disappear once it is full. Suppose we want to follow a greedy strategy: let each rectangle fall where it will end up the lowest given the current state of the board. To do so, we want a data structure which can always suggest a greedy move. In other words, we want a data structure which maintains a set of O ( n ) O(n) rectangles, supports queries which return where to drop the rectangle, and updates which insert a rectangle dropped at a certain position and return the height of the highest point in the updated set of rectangles. We show via a reduction from the Multiphase problem [Pătraşcu, 2010] that on a board of width w = Θ ( n ) w=Θ(n) , if the OMv conjecture [Henzinger et al., 2015] is true, then both operations cannot be supported in time O ( n 1 / 2 − ϵ ) O(n1/2−ϵ) simultaneously. The reduction also implies polynomial bounds from the 3-SUM conjecture and the APSP conjecture. On the other hand, we show that there is a data structure supporting both operations in O ( n 1 / 2 log 3 / 2 ⁡ n ) O(n1/2log3/2⁡n) time on boards of width n O ( 1 ) nO(1) , matching the lower bound up to an n o ( 1 ) no(1) factor.},

We show that the problem admits an XP algorithm and is W[1]-hard parameterized by k . Moreover, within the running time, we can identify agents that should hide its items and can construct an ordering in which agents should pick items into its bundles to get a desired allocation. Besides this problem, we also consider the existence and verification versions of this problem. In the existence problem, we are given a social network, valuations, a budget, and the goal is to find an allocation without envy. In the verification problem, we are additionally given an allocation, and the goal is to determine if the allocation satisfies the required property.},

The objective of the MDSP is to find conflict-free schedules for each drone such that the total profit gained is maximum subject to the battery constraint of the drones. This paper proposes an optimal pseudo-polynomial algorithm and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the single drone delivery scheduling problem (SDSP). Also, we propose two approximation algorithms of factor 1 3 13 for the MDSP with some constraints on the number of drones. We formulate the problem for the heterogeneous case, where the drones have non-identical battery capacities, and propose a 1 6 ρ 16ρ -approximation algorithm, where ρ is the ratio between the minimum and maximum battery capacity of the drones.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic networks are a complex subject. Not only do they inherit the complexity of static networks (as a particular case); they are also sensitive to definitional subtleties that are a frequent source of confusion and incomparability of results in the literature. In this paper, we take a step back and examine three such aspects in more details, exploring their impact in a systematic way; namely, whether the temporal paths are required to be strict (i.e., the times along a path must increasing, not just be non-decreasing), whether the time labeling is proper (two adjacent edges cannot be present at the same time) and whether the time labeling is simple (an edge can have only one presence time). In particular, we investigate how different combinations of these features impact the expressivity of the graph in terms of reachability. Our results imply a hierarchy of expressivity for the resulting settings, shedding light on the loss of generality that one is making when considering either combination. Some settings are more general than expected; in particular, proper temporal graphs turn out to be as expressive as general temporal graphs where non-strict paths are allowed. Also, we show that the simplest setting, that of happy temporal graphs (i.e., both proper and simple) remains expressive enough to emulate the reachability of general temporal graphs in a certain (restricted but useful) sense. Furthermore, this setting is advocated as a target of choice for proving negative results. We illustrate this by strengthening two known results to happy graphs (namely, the inexistence of sparse spanners, and the hardness of computing temporal components). Overall, we hope that this article can be seen as a guide for choosing between different settings of temporal graphs, while being aware of the way these choices affect generality.},

A vector belongs to the α -core ( 0≤α≤1 ) if it recovers at least α -fraction of the total cost of the game when no deviating coalition is better off. In this paper, we show that the 34 -core of edge cover games is always non-empty and a vector in the 34 -core can be computed efficiently. We also show that 34 is the best constant ratio for the approximate core of edge cover games, as it is the reciprocal of the integrality gap for edge cover problems.},

In this paper, we introduce a more stringent notion of robust online analog computation, called Absolute Functional Robustness (AFR), for the CRNs that stabilize the concentration values of some output species to the result of one function of the input species concentrations, while allowing arbitrary perturbations for intermediate and output species throughout the attraction basin. We prove that the set of real functions stabilized by a CRN with mass action law kinetics is precisely the set of real algebraic functions. Based on this result, we present a compiler which takes as input any algebraic function (defined by one polynomial and one point for selecting one branch of the algebraic curve defined by the polynomial) and generates an abstract CRN to stabilize it. Furthermore, we provide error bounds to estimate and control the error of an unperturbed system, under the assumption that the environment inputs are driven by k -Lipschitz functions.},

  abstract     = {A directed graph where there is exactly one edge between every pair of vertices is called a tournament . Finding the “best” set of vertices of a tournament is a well-studied problem in social choice theory. A tournament solution takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the input tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best set of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given only implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such scenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some tournament solution) by “querying” as few edges as possible. We, in this paper, precisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an oracle access to the edges of a tournament T , find f ( T ) by querying as few edges as possible, for a tournament solution f . We first study some popular tournament solutions and show that any deterministic algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater set, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the top cycle must query Ω ( n 2 ) edges in the worst case. We also show similar lower bounds on the expected query complexity of these tournament solutions by any randomized algorithm. On the positive side, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results by proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at most k , then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by querying O ( n k + n log ⁡ ( n k ) log ⁡ ( k k − 1 ) ) edges only.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the edge searching problem and the fast searching problem with constraints on some vertices. The edge searching problem was introduced by Megiddo et al. (1988) [15] , in which a group of searchers want to capture an invisible robber. The fast searching problem was introduced by Dyer et al. (2008) [8] . One constraint we consider for these two searching models is that a subset of vertices, called start vertices, are initially occupied by searchers. We want to find the minimum number of additional searchers to capture the robber. Another constraint is that there are some vertices, called halt vertices, which have to be occupied by searchers at the end of the searching process . For the edge searching on a tree containing only start vertices, we propose an O ( n log ⁡ n ) O(nlog⁡n) -time algorithm for computing the edge search number, where n is the number of vertices. For the edge searching on a tree with start vertices and halt vertices, we give an O ( n 2 ) O(n2) -time algorithm to compute the edge search number. For the fast searching on a tree that contains only start vertices, we present a linear-time algorithm for computing the fast search number. For the fast searching on a tree with n vertices that contains s start vertices and h halt vertices, we propose an O ( ( s + h ) n ) O((s+h)n) -time algorithm to compute the fast search number. For the edge searching (respectively, fast searching) with only halt vertices, we reduce the problem to the edge searching (respectively, fast searching) with start vertices.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we mainly study a game of locating two homogeneous facilities on a circle to serve a set of strategic agents, where two facilities have a minimum distance requirement. The goal of each agent is to maximize or minimize the total distance to the facilities with respect to the facility type. If the facilities are obnoxious, then each agent aims at maximizing the total distance, which is coined as utility of the agent. If the facilities are favorite, each agent would like to minimize the total distance, which is commonly referred to as cost of the agent. A mechanism outputs two facility locations satisfying the distance requirement, given the locations reported by all the agents. If the mechanism can guarantee that no agent benefits from misreporting her location unilaterally, then it is strategyproof. Our goal is to design strategyproof mechanisms ensuring good approximation ratios with respect to the following objectives: maximizing the total utility, minimizing the total cost, maximizing the minimum utility and minimizing the maximum cost. The model was first proposed by Duan et al. (2019) [1] , where strategyproof mechanisms on a (bounded) line network are presented. A nice connection between the obnoxious facility location game and the favorite one is established firstly. Specifically, we can derive, for the favorite facility location game, a strategyproof mechanism f ˆ fˆ (called the antipodal mechanism) from a strategyproof mechanism f for the obnoxious facility location game, by outputting the antipodal facilities of f , and vice versa. Thus, we first discuss the obnoxious facility location game. For maximizing the minimum utility, we devise an optimal strategyproof mechanism. For maximizing the total utility, a strategyproof mechanism with an approximation ratio of 2 − 2 d 2−2d is illustrated, where d is the distance requirement. Then we study the corresponding antipodal mechanisms for the favorite location game. For minimizing the maximum cost, the antipodal mechanism is optimal as well. For minimizing the total cost, the antipodal mechanism is 1 2 d − 12d− approximation. Additionally, we revisit the setting on the line network and improve the previous result in [2] .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce and study a new scoring game on graphs called smash and grab . In this game, two players, called Left and Right, take turns removing a vertex of the graph as well as all of its neighbours that become isolated by this removal. For each player and each of their turns, they score the number of vertices that were removed on their turn. The game ends when there are no more vertices remaining, and the player with the highest final score wins. We denote by L s ( G ) Ls(G) the difference between Left and Right&#39;s final scores in G when Left starts and both players play optimally (they both aim to maximise their scores). We mainly study this parameter for different graph classes. We notably prove that L s ( F ) ≥ 0 Ls(F)≥0 for any forest F ( i.e. , the first player cannot lose). We then use this result to compute the exact value of L s ( G ) Ls(G) for particular forests such as unions of paths and subdivided stars. The result in paths then solves the case of a unique cycle. Finally, we prove that, for a generalisation of the game, computing the score is PSPACE -complete.},

  abstract     = {Code-based group signature is an important research topic in recent years. Since the pioneering work by Alamélou et al.(WCC 2015), several other schemes have been proposed to provide improvements in security, efficiency and functionality. However, most existing constructions work only in the static setting where the group population is fixed at the setup phase. Only a few schemes address partially dynamic, which can realize only one of users enrollment or revocation. In this work, we provide an efficient code-based fully dynamic group signature (FDGS) scheme, i.e., users have flexibility when joining and leaving the group. Specifically, to upgrade the scheme into a fully dynamic group signature, we first add a dynamic ingredient into the static 2-RNSD Merkle-tree accumulator (ASIACRYPT 2019), then create a simple rule and utilize the Stern-like zero-knowledge protocol to handle users enrollment and revocation efficiently (i.e., without resetting the whole tree). Moreover, our solution is the first exploration of code-based FDGS with constant signature size.},

It consists, given an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , a set of m + 1 m+1 mappings C 1 , C 2 , … , C m , D : V × N → Z C1,C2,…,Cm,D:V×N→Z , a set of m integers K 1 , K 2 , … , K m ∈ Z K1,K2,…,Km∈Z and a positive integer ℓ , in the search of a forest ( T 1 , T 2 , … , T ℓ ) (T1,T2,…,Tℓ) containing ℓ node-disjoint trees of G . Along with K j Kj , the mapping C j Cj defines a constraint that should be satisfied by the trees of the forest. For each tree T i Ti , it associates each node v of V to the score C j ( v , d T i ( v ) ) Cj(v,dTi(v)) where d T i ( v ) dTi(v) is the degree of v in T i Ti (possibly 0 if the node is not in T i Ti ). The sum ∑ v ∈ V C j ( v , d T i ( v ) ) ∑v∈VCj(v,dTi(v)) should not exceed K j Kj . In addition, the forest should minimize ∑ i = 1 ℓ ∑ v ∈ V D ( v , d T i ( v ) ) ∑i=1ℓ∑v∈VD(v,dTi(v)) . We proceed to a parameterized analysis of the MTDW problem with regard to four parameters that are the number of constraints m , the value ℓ , the treewidth of the input graph G and Δ, the minimum degree above which all the constraints and D are constant (for every 〚 〛 j ∈ 〚 1 , m 〛 j∈〚1,m〛 , v ∈ V v∈V and d ≥ Δ d≥Δ , C j ( v , d ) = C j ( v , Δ ) Cj(v,d)=Cj(v,Δ) , and D ( v , d ) = D ( v , Δ ) D(v,d)=D(v,Δ) ). For this problem, we provide a first dichotomy P versus NP -hard depending whether the previous parameters are fixed to be constant or not and a second dichotomy FPT versus W[1] -hard depending whether each of these parameters is constant, considered as a parameter, or disregard. As a side effect, we obtained parameterized algorithms, previously undescribed, for problems such that Budget Steiner Tree problem with Profits , Minimum Branch Vertices , Generalized branch vertices , or k -Bottleneck Steiner Tree .},

Further, when each subset contains at most t points where t ≥ 3 t≥3 , and the intervals are disjoint, we prove that the problem is NP - Hard , and we provide two constant factor approximation algorithms for this problem. We also study the problem from the parameterized complexity perspective. If the intervals are disjoint, then we prove that the problem is in FPT when parameterized by the size of the solution.

  abstract     = {Modern distributed systems are becoming pervasive and increasingly provided with adaptation, (self-)reconfiguration and mobility capability. On one side, to face the challenges of the highly dynamic environments where they are deployed. On the other side, to keep production/maintenance costs down. Therein lies the increasing demand for formal models encompassing all of these aspects (besides concurrency). Hardly any of the classical formalisms like Petri Nets , Automata , and Process Algebra , even though powerful, permits designers to easily specify dynamic structural changes to systems and evaluate their impact on system behaviour . That has led to several extensions of classical formal models (e.g., the Pi calculus or the Nets-within-Nets paradigm) rarely accompanied by suitable analysis techniques. A recent formalization of a class of Rewritable Place-Transition Nets (RwPT) in Maude has proved potentially convenient to specify dynamically reconfigurable systems . Concerning analogous proposals, the RwPT formalism provides more abstraction/flexibility in modelling and efficiency in analysis. Nevertheless, its ability to scale the size of distributed systems built of several similar (nested) components is limited. This paper presents a compositional approach to define large RwPT models in a typical algebraic way and to exploit the modular structure of models during the analysis: Symmetries are implicitly captured by composite node-labelling (reflecting the model&#39;s hierarchical structure) that is preserved by net rewrites. A distributed, gracefully degrading production system is used as a case study . Experimental evidence points out the dramatic impact of the approach against a non-modular one and the advantages over alternative techniques. Even if the emphasis is on state-space-based verification, the paper shows the convenience of combining it with structural analysis, which is typical of Petri nets as well. For that purpose, rewrite-rule abstractions are given in the form of guidelines.},

  abstract     = {The Offensive Alliance problem has been studied extensively during the last twenty years. A set S ⊆ V S⊆V of vertices is an offensive alliance in an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) if each v ∈ N ( S ) v∈N(S) has at least as many neighbors in S as it has neighbors (including itself) not in S . We study the classical and parameterized complexity of the Offensive Alliance problem, where the aim is to find a minimum size offensive alliance. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity by showing that (1) the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a wide range of fairly restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback vertex set number, treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth of the input graph; this puts it among the few problems that are FPT when parameterized by solution size but not when parameterized by treewidth (unless FPT=W[1]), (2) the problem cannot be solved in time ⁎ O ⁎ ( 2 o ( k log ⁡ k ) ) O⁎(2o(klog⁡k)) where k is the solution size, unless ETH fails, (3) it does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by solution size and vertex cover of the input graph. On the positive side we prove that (4) it can be solved in time ⁎ O ⁎ ( vc ( G ) O ( vc ( G ) ) ) O⁎(vc(G)O(vc(G))) where vc ( G ) vc(G) is the vertex cover number of the input graph. (5) it admits an FPT algorithm when parameterized by vertex integrity of input graph. In terms of classical complexity, we prove that (6) the problem cannot be solved in time 2 o ( n ) 2o(n) even when restricted to bipartite graphs , unless ETH fails, (7) it cannot be solved in time 2 o ( n ) 2o(n) even when restricted to apex graphs, unless ETH fails. We also prove that (8) it is NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite, chordal, split and circle graphs .},

  abstract     = {The Hospitals/Residents problem (HR) is a many-to-one matching problem whose solution concept is stability. It is widely used in assignment systems such as assigning medical students (residents) to hospitals. To resolve imbalance in the number of residents assigned to hospitals, an extension called HR with regional caps (HRRC) was introduced. In this problem, a positive integer (called a regional cap) is associated with a subset of hospitals (called a region), and the total number of residents assigned to hospitals in a region must be at most its regional cap. Kamada and Kojima [1] , [2] defined strong stability for HRRC and demonstrated that a strongly stable matching does not necessarily exist. Recently, Aziz et al. [3] proved that the problem of determining if a strongly stable matching exists is NP-complete in general. In this paper, we refine Aziz et al.&#39;s result by investigating the computational complexity of the problem in terms of the length of preference lists, the size of regions, and whether or not regions can overlap, and completely classify tractable and intractable cases.},

  abstract     = {Fair division of indivisible resources is a fundamental problem in many disciplines, including computer science, economy, operations research , etc. The existence of PMMS allocations of goods is a major open problem in fair division, even for additive valuations. At the state of the art, there is no identified setting where PMMS allocations are deemed impossible, and the known existing results regarding their existence are limited to highly constrained settings. In this paper, we provide an algorithm for computing a PMMS allocation for identical variant. We also use the algorithm to find the PMMS allocations for 3 agents in line graphs . Moreover, we show that a 4 5 45 -PMMS allocation can be computed in polynomial time when agents agree on the ordinal ranking of the goods. A quantitative gauge for assessing the impact on social welfare is known as the price of fairness , which quantifies the maximum possible reduction in social welfare due to the imposition of fairness constraints . Originally explored in the context of divisible goods, the concept of the price of fairness continues to be a pivotal metric for evaluating the effect of fairness considerations on overall social welfare. Consequently, we study the efficiency decrease under PMMS allocations and prove a tight upper bound on the price of PMMS allocations.},

  abstract     = {Guerraoui proposed an indulgent solution for the binary consensus problem. Namely, he showed that an arbitrary behavior of the failure detector never violates safety requirements even if it compromises liveness. Consensus implementations are often used in a repeated manner. Dutta and Guerraoui proposed a zero-degrading solution, i.e., during system runs in which the failure detector behaves perfectly, a node failure during one consensus instance has no impact on the performance of future instances. Our study, which focuses on indulgent zero-degrading binary consensus, aims at the design of an even more robust communication abstraction. We do so through the lenses of self-stabilization —a very strong notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to node and communication failures, self-stabilizing algorithms can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary transient faults ; these faults represent any violation of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate (as long as the algorithm code stays intact). This work proposes the first, to the best of our knowledge, self-stabilizing algorithm for indulgent zero-degrading binary consensus for time-free message-passing systems prone to detectable process failures. The proposed algorithm recovers within a finite time after the occurrence of the last arbitrary transient fault. Since the proposed solution uses an Ω failure detector, we also present the first, to the best of our knowledge, self-stabilizing asynchronous Ω failure detector, which is a variation on the one by Mostéfaoui, Mourgaya, and Raynal.},

  abstract     = {We consider a natural problem dealing with weighted packet selection across a rechargeable link, which e.g., finds applications in cryptocurrency networks. The capacity of a link ( u , v ) (u,v) is determined by how many nodes u and v allocate for this link. Specifically, the input is a finite ordered sequence of packets that arrive in both directions along a link. Given ( u , v ) (u,v) and a packet of weight x going from u to v , node u can either accept or reject the packet. If u accepts the packet, the capacity on link ( u , v ) (u,v) decreases by x . Correspondingly, v &#39;s capacity on ( u , v ) (u,v) increases by x . If a node rejects the packet, this will entail a cost affinely linear in the weight of the packet. A link is “rechargeable” in the sense that the total capacity of the link has to remain constant, but the allocation of capacity at the ends of the link can depend arbitrarily on the nodes&#39; decisions. The goal is to minimise the sum of the capacity injected into the link and the cost of rejecting packets. We show that the problem is NP-hard, but can be approximated efficiently with a ratio of ( 1 + ε ) ⋅ ( 1 + 3 ) (1+ε)⋅(1+3) for some arbitrary ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 .},

  abstract     = {The identity of a physical entity in a network is traditionally defined by some secret knowledge, personal possession, or (biometric) property. What if no such unique property exists or can be defined “safely”, for example, in the interest of anonymity ? In this work, we study the problem of defining an identity for an entity u under the constraint that there is no subjective property that u carries by itself, or in other words, any property that u has, may also be likewise present in another entity v . In the absence of an intrinsic property of u to define its identity, we thus consider the possibility of an “extrinsically defined identity” via the connections that u maintains to other entities. Letting u ∈ V u∈V be part of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) , we study the question of whether the links that u has to its neighbors lend themselves to uniquely distinguish u from all other nodes v in the graph. A practical instance of this setting appears in symmetric cryptography , if we assume an edge between two nodes u , v u,v if and only if u and v share a common secret. A single shared secret known by u is, in symmetric cryptography, also known to some other entity v . However, is the set of all secrets that u has likewise known to another node v in a network? If not, we can implement end-to-end authentication without shared secrets and exclusively using symmetric cryptography. This concept is here reviewed as peer-authentication . It works in a graph class that we call Unique-Neighborhood Network (UNN) , which has been introduced in prior literature for the purpose of emulating public-key digital signatures with symmetric cryptography only. Our findings suggest that some networks naturally grow into UNNs, but even if not, we can efficiently identify substructures that allow to pin down a node&#39;s identity based on its “friend-nodes” in a graph.},

In membrane computing, the study of language generating/accepting power of a computing model is essential for understanding its capabilities and limitations, while the language generating/accepting power of NPT systems remains open. In this work, a language hierarchy for NPT systems is established by considering polynomials of degree one as production functions. Specifically, if each production function is a variable with a positive integer coefficient , the NPT systems characterize regular languages. If each production function is a variable with an integer coefficient , the languages generated by the NPT systems are no more than context-sensitive. Further, the NPT systems generate all recursively enumerable languages if each production function is a linear combination of no more than two variables and each term of a production function is a variable with an integer coefficient. The results show that the language generating power of NPT systems is closely related to the number of variables and the range of coefficients in production functions.},

  abstract     = {A conjecture of Berge predicts that every bridgeless cubic graph can have its edges covered with at most five perfect matchings . If the graph in question has no 3-edge-colouring, then at least four perfect matchings are necessary. It was proved by Esperet and Mazzuoccolo (2014) [3] that it is NP-complete to decide whether four perfect matchings are enough to cover the edges of a bridgeless cubic graph. A disadvantage of the proof (noted by the authors) is that the constructed graphs have 2-cuts. In this paper we show that small cuts can be altogether avoided and that the problem remains NP-complete even for nontrivial snarks – that is, cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with no 3-edge-colouring. As a by-product, we provide a rich family of nontrivial snarks that cannot be covered with four perfect matchings. The methods rely on the theory of tetrahedral flows developed in Máčajová and Škoviera (2021) [9] .},

The center observes a partial signal, representing part of the player&#39;s true consumption, which is generated from a publicly known distribution. The player can report any value that does not contradict the signal and the center issues a payment based on the reported information. Such problems find application in net metering billing in the electricity market, where a customer&#39;s actual consumption of the electricity network is masked and complete verification is impractical. When the underlying true value is relatively constant, we propose a penalty mechanism that elicits truthful self-reports. Namely, besides charging the player the reported value, the mechanism charges a penalty proportional to her inconsistent reports. We show how fear of uncertainty in the future incentivizes the player to be truthful today. For Bernoulli distributions , we give the complete analysis and optimal strategies given any penalty. Since complete truthfulness is not possible for continuous distributions, we give approximate truthful results by a reduction from Bernoulli distributions . We also extend our mechanism to a multi-player cost-sharing setting and give equilibrium results.},

The general position achievement/avoidance game is played on a graph G by players A and B who alternately select vertices of G . A selection of a vertex by a player is a legal move if it has not been selected before and the set of selected vertices so far forms a general position set of G . The player who picks the last vertex is the winner in the general position achievement game and is the loser in the avoidance game. In this paper, we prove that the general position achievement/avoidance games are PSPACE-complete even on graphs with diameter at most 4. For this, we prove that the misère play of the classical Node Kayles game is also PSPACE-complete. As positive results, we obtain linear time algorithms to decide the winning player of the general position avoidance game in rook&#39;s graphs, grids, cylinders, and lexicographic products with complete second factors.},

  abstract     = {Frequent pattern mining is a relevant method to analyse structured data, like sequences, trees or graphs. It consists in identifying characteristic substructures of a dataset. This paper deals with a new type of patterns for tree data: common subtrees with identical label distribution. Their detection is far from obvious since the underlying isomorphism problem is graph isomorphism complete. An elaborated search algorithm is developed and analysed from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Based on this, the enumeration of patterns is performed through a new lossless compression scheme for trees, called DAG-RW, whose complexity is investigated as well. The method shows very good properties, both in terms of computation times and analysis of real datasets from the literature. Compared to other substructures like topological subtrees and labelled subtrees for which the isomorphism problem is linear, the patterns found provide a more parsimonious representation of the data.},

  abstract     = {Functional Encryption (FE) has been extensively studied in the recent years, mainly focusing on the feasibility of constructing FE for general functionalities, as well as some realizations for restricted functionalities of practical interest, such as inner-product. However, little consideration has been given to the issue of key leakage on FE. The property of FE that allows multiple users to obtain the same functional keys from the holder of the master secret key raises an important problem: if some users leak their keys or collude to create a pirate decoder, how can we identify at least one of those users, given some information about the compromised keys or the pirate decoder? Moreover, how do we disable the decryption capabilities of those users (i.e. traitors)? Two recent works have offered potential solutions to the above traitor scenario. However, the two solutions satisfy weaker notions of security and traceability, can only tolerate bounded collusions (i.e., there is an a priori bound on the number of keys the pirate decoder obtains), or can only handle a polynomially large universe of possible identities. In this paper, we study trace-and-revoke mechanism on FE and provide the first construction of trace-and-revoke FE that supports arbitrary identities, is both fully collusion resistant and fully anonymous. Our construction relies on a generic transformation from revocable predicate functional encryption with broadcast (RPFE with broadcast, which is an extension of revocable predicate encryption with broadcast proposed by Kim and J. Wu at ASIACRYPT&#39;2020) to trace-and-revoke FE. Since this construction admits a generic construction of trace-and-revoke inner-product FE (IPFE), we instantiate the trace-and-revoke IPFE from the well-studied Learning with Errors (LWE). This is achieved by proposing a new LWE-based attribute-based IPFE (ABIPFE) scheme to instantiate RPFE with broadcast.},

  abstract     = {Descriptive complexity provides intrinsic, i.e. machine-independent , characterizations of the main complexity classes. On the other hand, logic can be useful for designing programs in a natural declarative way. This is especially important for parallel computation models such as cellular automata , since designing parallel programs is considered a difficult task. This paper establishes three logical characterizations of the three classical complexity classes modeling minimal time, called real-time , of one-dimensional cellular automata according to their canonical variations: unidirectional or bidirectional communication, input word given in a parallel or sequential way. Our three logics are natural restrictions of existential second-order Horn logic with built-in successor and predecessor functions. These logics correspond exactly to the three ways of deciding a language on a square grid circuit of side n according to one of the three natural locations of an input word of length n : along a side of the grid, on the diagonal that contains the output cell – placed on the vertex (n,n) of the square grid–, or on the diagonal opposite to the output cell. The key ingredient to our results is a normalization method that transforms a formula from one of our three logics into an equivalent normalized formula that closely mimics a grid circuit. Then, we extend our logics by allowing a limited use of negation on hypotheses like in Stratified Datalog . By revisiting in detail a number of representative classical problems - recognition of the set of primes by Fisher&#39;s algorithm, Dyck language recognition, Firing Squad Synchronization problem, etc. - we show that this extension makes easier programming and we prove that it does not change the real-time complexity of our logics. Finally, based on our experience in expressing these representative problems in logic, we argue that our logics are high-level programming languages: they make it possible to express in a natural, complete and synthetic way the algorithms of the literature, based on signals – and even to design new inductive algorithms –, and to translate them automatically into cellular automata of the same complexity.},

  abstract     = {Interconnection networks are key component of parallel and distributed systems . As the network scale increases, the growing number of link failures becomes inevitable. Therefore, how to enhance the fault tolerance of the network has become a research issue in parallel and distributed systems. Recently, two new metrics based on edge partition in networks have been introduced, called matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity. Existing research indicates that they significantly enhance the fault tolerance of alternating group networks and star networks compared to other indicators such as g -component edge connectivity and g -extra edge connectivity. In this work, we consider the matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity of the n -dimensional balanced hypercube B H n BHn , a class of networks with vertex transitivity and edge transitivity, and theoretically demonstrate their high fault tolerance in B H n BHn . Furthermore, through numerical simulation, it is observed that the matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity of B H n BHn are greater than the g -component edge connectivity and g -extra edge connectivity of B H n BHn , which implies that (conditional) matroidal connectivity can further improve B H n BHn &#39; fault tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Eden, Feige, and Feldman explored the concept of the max-min greedy matching problem , which can be conceived as a game played between an algorithm and an adversary . Both parties are presented with a bipartite graph consisting of items and players. Initially, the algorithm selects a priority order for the items, while the adversary, in turn, chooses a priority order for the players based on the algorithm&#39;s choice. These priority orders are then utilized in a greedy process to establish a matching between the items and players. During the process, when it is a player&#39;s turn, they select the highest priority item from their remaining available neighbors. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize the size of the resulting matching, while the adversary&#39;s goal is to minimize its size. Previous studies have demonstrated that the algorithm can employ a polynomial-time strategy to achieve a competitive ratio greater than 1 2 12 . In this research, we present evidence that, from the adversary&#39;s standpoint, approximating the adversarial order minimum matching problem with a ratio better than 6 5 65 is NP-hard, assuming the small set expansion (SSE) hypothesis. Conversely, we introduce a fractional variant of the problem and analyze the interaction between the algorithm and the adversary when either or both parties are allowed to utilize fractional permutations . Notably, we discover that if the algorithm solely employs integral item permutations, then an optimal response from the adversary can also involve integral player permutations. Additionally, we establish that, in the fractional variant, the algorithm can adopt a round-robin strategy to achieve a competitive ratio of at least 1 − 1 / e 1−1/e for input graphs with a sufficiently large granularity parameter m . Furthermore, we demonstrate that the analysis for the round-robin strategy is tight even for regular graphs .},

  abstract     = {ECDSA is a standardized signature scheme and is widely used in many fields. However, most two-party ECDSA require a complicated multi-party computation technique to compute the multiplication of many shared secrets and necessitate expensive zero-knowledge proofs to deal with malicious adversaries . In this paper, we propose a simple yet fast two-party signing protocol based on ECDSA security, whose signing operation of each party is similar to the original ECDSA signing algorithm. Our protocol can enjoy the same efficiency as ECDSA and upgrades the existing ECDSA application to two-party scenario friendly. For this purpose, we first introduce a variant of ECDSA called combinatorial ECDSA, which is as secure as the standard ECDSA and can be easily divided into two parts. Then, we devise a two-party signing protocol without complicated multi-party computation from the combinatorial ECDSA and give the security proof based on ECDSA. Compared with the state-of-the-art two-party ECDSA, the signing result of each party in our protocol maintains the structure of ECDSA signature, which can be verified easily and avoids expensive zero-knowledge proofs. Last, we conduct an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the performance of our combinatorial ECDSA and two-party signature is similar to ECDSA and the experimental results show that our proposed schemes are practical.},

For the problem of testing monotone permutation ( 1 , 2 , ⋯ , K ) (1,2,⋯,K) , [2] improved the ( log ⁡ n ) O ( K 2 ) (log⁡n)O(K2) non-adaptive query complexity of [1] to O ( ( log ⁡ n ) ⌊ log 2 ⁡ K ⌋ ) O((log⁡n)⌊log2⁡K⌋) . Further, [3] proposed an adaptive algorithm with O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) query complexity. However, no progress has yet been made on the problem of testing ( 1 , 3 , 2 ) (1,3,2) -freeness. In this work, we present an adaptive algorithm for testing ( 1 , 3 , 2 ) (1,3,2) -freeness.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of computing routing schemes in the HYBRID HYBRID model of distributed computing where nodes have access to two fundamentally different communication modes. In this problem nodes have to compute small labels and routing tables that allow for efficient routing of messages in the local network, which typically offers the majority of the throughput. Recent work has shown that using the HYBRID HYBRID model admits a significant speed-up compared to what would be possible if either communication mode were used in isolation. Nonetheless, if general graphs are used as the input graph the computation of routing schemes still takes polynomial rounds in the HYBRID HYBRID model. We bypass this lower bound by restricting the local graph to unit-disc-graphs and solve the problem deterministically with running time O ( | H | 2 + log ⁡ n ) O(|H|2+log⁡n) , label size O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) , and size of routing tables O ( | H | 2 ⋅ log ⁡ n ) O(|H|2⋅log⁡n) where | H | |H| is the number of “radio holes” in the network. Our work builds on recent work by Coy et al., who obtain this result in the much simpler setting where the input graph has no radio holes. We develop new techniques to achieve this, including a decomposition of the local graph into path-convex regions, where each region contains a shortest path for any pair of nodes in it.},

Based on these new models, the input/output complexity is deeply studied. We discuss the relationship between input/output complexity and the other complexity measures such as time complexity and parameterized complexity, which is not considered by former researchers. We also define the external access trace complexity, which reflects the physical behavior of magnetic disks and gives a theoretical evidence of IO-efficient algorithms.

Meanwhile, Parikh matrices are useful tools and well established in the study of subword occurrences. In this work, we propose two ways of counting subword occurrences in circular words. We then extend the idea of Parikh matrices to the context of circular words and investigate this extension. Motivated by the word inference problem, we study ambiguity in the identification of a circular word by its Parikh matrix. Accordingly, two rewriting rules are developed to generate ternary circular words which share the same Parikh matrix.},

The current best approximation ratio is 4.675 for this problem with 1-fairness violation, which was proposed by Bercea et al. [APPROX-RANDOM&#39;2019]. To our best knowledge, there is no available approximation algorithm for this problem without any fairness violation in doubling metrics. In this paper, we consider the fair k -median problem in doubling metrics and general metrics. We provide the first QPTAS for the fair k -median problem based on the hierarchical decomposition and dynamic programming process in doubling metrics. For applying a dynamic programming process to solve this problem, the distances from portals to facilities cannot be directly enumerated since each client may not be assigned to its closest open facility. To overcome the difficulties caused by the fairness constraints , we construct an auxiliary graph and use minimum weighted perfect matching to get the cost between the portals of each block and the ones in its children. In order to satisfy the fairness constraints, we bound the fairness constraints of each open facility in the leaves of the split-tree based on the relation between the subproblem and the subproblems of its children. To obtain the assignment of the given instance and remove the fairness violation, we construct a new b -value min-cost max-flow model based on the set of open facilities. For the fair k -median problem in general metrics, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with ratio O ( log ⁡ k ) O(log⁡k) . Our approximation algorithm for the fair k -median problem in doubling metrics is the first result for the corresponding problem without any fairness violation in doubling metrics.},

  abstract     = {Land use and land cover change (LUCC) modeling is crucial to urban planning and policy making. A well-used and effective paradigm for LUCC is the ANN-CA model which employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to calculate a transition probability over each land cell from various driving factors, and then uses a cellular automaton (CA) to evolve all cells consecutively to update their land usage and coverage according to the estimated probability distribution. This paper focuses on the effect of delays or perturbations possibly taking place between land cells on the LUCC modeling. To this end, a new ANN-CA model is proposed which adopts an asynchronous communicating cellular automaton (ACCA), rather than the conventional synchronous CA. Especially, the ACCA allows every cell to communicate with its neighbors independently at random times via a specific protocol, which offers a natural way to include stochastic delays in exchanging the current land usages between cells. As a result, every change of a cell&#39;s land use in the ACCA may not affect its neighbors immediately, but is subject to delays that might play an important role in modeling the practical LUCC. Numerical analysis of the new model are carried out over three regions of Chongqing city, China with different scales: Yongchuan District, Sanjiao Town, and Huangguashan Village, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ANN-ACCA model can achieve a higher accuracy for LUCC simulation as compared to conventional ANN-CA models.},

  abstract     = {Given a collection of red and blue mobile agents located on two grid rows, we seek to move all the blue agents to the far left side and all the red agents to the far right side, thus physically sorting them according to color. The agents all start on the bottom row. They move simultaneously at discrete time steps and must not collide. Our goal is to design a centralized algorithm that controls the agents so as to sort them in the least number of time steps. We derive an exact lower bound on the amount of time any algorithm requires to sort a given initial configuration of agents. We find an instance optimal algorithm that provably matches this lower bound, attaining the best possible sorting time for any initial configuration . Surprisingly, we find that whenever the leftmost agent is red and the rightmost agent is blue, a straightforward decentralized and local sensing-based algorithm is at most 1 time step slower than the centralized instance-optimal algorithm.},

Charikar and Wirth showed that the problem admits an Ω ( 1 / lg ⁡ n ) Ω(1/lg⁡n) approximation via semidefinite programming , and Alon, Makarychev, Makarychev, and Naor [STOC&#39;05] showed that the same approach yields an Ω ( 1 ) Ω(1) approximation when A corresponds to a graph of bounded chromatic number . Both these results rely on solving the semidefinite relaxation of MaxQP , whose currently best running time is O ˜ ( n 1.5 ⋅ min ⁡ { N , n 1.5 } ) O˜(n1.5⋅min⁡{N,n1.5}) , where N is the number of nonzero entries in A and O ˜ O˜ ignores polylogarithmic factors. In this sequel, we abandon the semidefinite approach and design purely combinatorial approximation algorithms for special cases of MaxQP where A is sparse ( i.e. , has O ( n ) O(n) nonzero entries). Our algorithms are superior to the semidefinite approach in terms of running time, yet are still competitive in terms of their approximation guarantees. More specifically, we show that:},

  abstract     = {The priority model was introduced to capture “greedy-like” algorithms. Motivated by the success of advice complexity in the area of online algorithms , the fixed priority model was extended to include advice, and a reduction-based framework was developed for proving lower bounds on the amount of advice required to achieve certain approximation ratios in this rather powerful model. To capture most of the algorithms that are considered greedy-like, the even stronger model of adaptive priority algorithms is needed. We extend the adaptive priority model to include advice. We modify the reduction-based framework from the fixed priority case to work with the more powerful adaptive priority algorithms, simplifying the proof of correctness and strengthening all previous lower bounds by a factor of two in the process. As evidence that adding advice to adaptive priority algorithms extends both adaptive priority algorithms and online algorithms with advice, we present a purely combinatorial adaptive priority algorithm with advice for Minimum Vertex Cover on triangle-free graphs of maximum degree three. Our algorithm achieves optimality and uses at most 7 n / 22 7n/22 bits of advice. No adaptive priority algorithm without advice can achieve optimality without advice, and we prove that an online algorithm with advice needs more than 7 n / 22 7n/22 bits of advice to reach optimality. We show connections between exact algorithms and priority algorithms with advice. The branching in branch-and-reduce algorithms can be seen as trying all possible advice strings, and all priority algorithms with advice that achieve optimality define corresponding exact algorithms, priority exact algorithms . Lower bounds on advice-based adaptive algorithms imply lower bounds on running times of exact algorithms designed in this way.},

  abstract     = {The rendezvous task calls for two mobile agents , starting from different nodes of a network modeled as a graph to meet at the same node. Agents have different labels which are integers from a set { 1 , … , L } {1,…,L} . They wake up at possibly different times and move in synchronous rounds. In each round, an agent can either stay idle or move to an adjacent node. We consider deterministic rendezvous algorithms. The time of such an algorithm is the number of rounds since the wakeup of the earlier agent till the meeting. In most of the literature concerning rendezvous in graphs, the graph is finite and the time of rendezvous depends on its size. This approach is impractical for very large graphs and impossible for infinite graphs. For such graphs it is natural to design rendezvous algorithms whose time depends on the initial distance D between the agents. In this paper we adopt this approach and consider rendezvous in infinite trees. All our algorithms work in finite trees as well. Our main goal is to study the impact of orientation of a tree on the time of rendezvous. We first design a rendezvous algorithm working for unoriented regular trees, whose time is in O ( z ( D ) log ⁡ L ) O(z(D)log⁡L) , where z ( D ) z(D) is the size of the ball of radius D , i.e., the number of nodes at distance at most D from a given node. The algorithm works for arbitrary delay between waking times of agents and does not require any initial information about parameters L or D . Its disadvantage is its complexity: z ( D ) z(D) is exponential in D for any degree d &gt; 2 d&amp;gt;2 of the tree. We prove that this high complexity is inevitable: Ω ( z ( D ) ) Ω(z(D)) turns out to be a lower bound on rendezvous time in unoriented regular trees, even for simultaneous start and even when agents know L and D . Then we turn attention to oriented trees. While for arbitrary delay between waking times of agents the lower bound Ω ( z ( D ) ) Ω(z(D)) still holds, for simultaneous start the time of rendezvous can be dramatically shortened. We show that if agents know either a polynomial upper bound on L or a linear upper bound on D , then rendezvous can be accomplished in oriented trees in time O ( D log ⁡ L ) O(Dlog⁡L) , which is optimal. If no such extra knowledge is available, a significant speedup is still possible: in this case we design an algorithm working in time O ( D 2 + log 2 ⁡ L ) O(D2+log2⁡L) .},

In the past decades , a series of algorithms have been proposed for this problem. However, most of the state-of-the-art algorithms are randomized. There remain non-negligible gaps with respect to approximation ratios between deterministic and randomized algorithms in submodular maximization. In this paper, we propose deterministic algorithms with improved approximation ratios for non-monotone submodular maximization. Specifically, for the matroid constraint, we provide a deterministic 0.283 − o ( 1 ) 0.283−o(1) approximation algorithm , while the previous best deterministic algorithm only achieves a 1/4 approximation ratio. For the knapsack constraint, we provide a deterministic 1/4 approximation algorithm, while the previous best deterministic algorithm only achieves a 1/6 approximation ratio. For the linear packing constraints with large widths, we provide a deterministic 1 / 6 − ϵ 1/6−ϵ approximation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no deterministic approximation algorithm for the constraints.},

We propose two silent self-stabilizing asynchronous distributed algorithms to find a 2-MDS. In both algorithms, we assume the weakly fair distributed daemon and that the processes have unique identifiers. The first one is for the general networks. The time complexity is O ( n H ) O(nH) rounds, and the space complexity is O ( Δ log ⁡ n ) O(Δlog⁡n) bits per process, where n is the number of processes, H is the diameter of the network, and Δ is the maximum degree . The second one is for the networks of girth at least 7. The girth is the length of the shortest cycles in the network. The time complexity is O ( n H ) O(nH) rounds, and the space complexity is O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) bits per process.},

It is a classic NP-hard problem, and various algorithms have been suggested for it. In this paper, we start with a basic algorithm for solving the problem. Using a probabilistic idea, we use it to develop an improved algorithm. The algorithm is greedy; at each step it adds to the cover a vertex such that the expected cover size, if we continue randomly after this step, is minimal. We study the new algorithm theoretically and empirically, and run simulations to compare its performance to that of some algorithms of a similar nature.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is a fundamental problem with a wide range of applications. In this paper, we study a balanced version of the well-known k -center clustering problem, where the objective is to select k centers from a given set of points, and assign to each center at most L of the input points, so as to minimize the maximum distance from a point to the center to which it is assigned. We assume soft capacities, where points are allowed to be selected as center more than once. Motivated by applications involving massive datasets , we study the problem in the massively parallel computation (MPC) and streaming models. In particular, we present a two-round MPC algorithm for the balanced k -center problem, achieving an approximation factor of 5 α + 2 5α+2 , where α is the approximation factor of the corresponding sequential algorithm. This substantially improves the currently best approximation factor of 32 α , available for the problem. We show that the approximation factor of our algorithm can be further improved to 5 + ε 5+ε in all spaces with bounded doubling dimension, including the Euclidean space . We also consider the balanced k -center problem in the streaming model, and present a constant-factor streaming algorithm in any metric space using O ( k n ε ) O(knε) memory, and a factor 5 + ε 5+ε streaming algorithm using O ( k polylog n ) O(kpolylogn) memory in doubling metrics.},

  abstract     = {The skin microbiome plays an important role in the maintenance of a healthy skin. It is an ecosystem, composed of several species, competing for resources and interacting with the skin cells. Imbalance in the cutaneous microbiome, also called dysbiosis, has been correlated with several skin conditions, including acne and atopic dermatitis. Generally, dysbiosis is linked to colonization of the skin by a population of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. Treatments consisting in non-specific elimination of cutaneous microflora have shown conflicting results. In this article, we introduce a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations , with 2 types of bacteria populations (skin commensals and opportunistic pathogens) and including the production of antimicrobial peptides to study the mechanisms driving the dominance of one population over the other. By using published experimental data , assumed to correspond to the observation of stable states in our model, we reduce the number of parameters of the model from 13 to 5. We then use a formal specification in quantitative temporal logic to calibrate our model by global parameter optimization and perform sensitivity analyses. On the time scale of 2 days of the experiments, the model predicts that certain changes of the environment, like the elevation of skin surface pH, create favorable conditions for the emergence and colonization of the skin by the opportunistic pathogen population, while the production of human AMPs has non-linear effect on the balance between pathogens and commensals. Surprisingly, simulations on longer time scales reveal that the equilibrium reached around 2 days can in fact be a quasi-stable state followed by the reaching of a reversed stable state after 12 days or more. We analyze the conditions of quasi-stability observed in this model using tropical algebraic methods, and show their non-generic character in contrast to slow-fast systems. These conditions are then generalized to a large class of population dynamics models over any number of species.},

This is a counterpart to the token jumping model of the combinatorial reconfiguration problems in the context of block puzzles. We investigate some variants of jumping block puzzles, which are based on actual puzzles, and a natural model from the viewpoint of combinatorial reconfiguration, and determine their computational complexities. More precisely, we investigate two generalizations of two actual puzzles which are called Flip Over puzzles and Flying Block puzzles and one natural model of jumping block puzzles from the viewpoint of combinatorial reconfiguration. We prove that they are PSPACE-complete in general. We also prove the NP-completeness of these puzzles in some restricted cases, and we give polynomial-time algorithms for some restricted cases.},

Many variants of the classical puzzle have been posed, such as allowing more than 3 pegs, and adding restrictions on the possible moves between the pegs. It is natural to view the pegs and allowed moves by means of a graph. The pegs are represented by the vertices of the graph, and the allowed moves by the edges. For each n , this graph yields a graph on the set of all legal configurations of n disks. Thus, the questions about the original puzzle may be reformulated as questions about connectivity and shortest paths in the graph of all configurations. Moreover, it was shown that classical Hanoi graphs are related to several interesting and useful structures such as the Sierpiński gasket and Gray codes, and thus several properties of these graphs were studied, including Hamiltonicity and planarity . In this paper we study these properties, and several others – chromatic number , clique number, and girth – for general Hanoi graphs.},

We study the energy expenditure associated with the computations of deterministic and quantum finite automata. We show that regular languages can be classified according to the intrinsic energy requirements on the recognizing automaton as a function of input length, and prove upper and lower bounds . We also provide a classification in terms of the maximum obligatory thermodynamic cost associated by any step during the recognition of different regular languages. We prove that zero-error quantum finite automata have no advantage over their classical deterministic counterparts in terms of this “peak load” criterion. We demonstrate languages for which “error can be traded for energy”, i.e. whose zero-error recognition is associated with computation steps having provably bigger obligatory energy cost when compared to their bounded-error recognition by real-time finite-memory quantum devices .},

The input to our problem is a bipartite graph G = ( A ∪ B , E ) G=(A∪B,E) , where each vertex in A ∪ B A∪B specifies a strict preference ordering over its neighbours. Each vertex has an upper quota denoting the maximum number of vertices that can be assigned to it. In addition, each vertex has a lower quota denoting the minimum number of vertices that need to be assigned to it. In the many-to-many setting with two-sided lower quotas, informally, a critical matching is a matching which fulfils vertex lower quotas to the maximum possible extent. This is a natural generalization of the definition of critical matching in the one-to-one setting considered by Kavitha (FSTTCS 2021). In this work, our goal is to find a popular matching in the set of critical matchings. A matching is popular in a given set of matchings if it remains undefeated in a head-to-head election with any matching in that set. Here, vertices cast votes between pairs of matchings. We show that there always exists a matching that is popular in the set of critical matchings. We present an efficient algorithm to compute such a matching of the largest size.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the energy complexity of distributed graph problems in multi-hop radio networks, where the energy cost of an algorithm is measured by the maximum number of awake rounds of a vertex. Recent works revealed that some problems, such as broadcast, breadth-first search, and maximal matching , can be solved with energy-efficient algorithms that consume only poly log ⁡ n polylog⁡n energy. However, there exist some problems, such as computing the diameter of the graph, that require Ω ( n ) Ω(n) energy to solve. To improve energy efficiency for these problems, we focus on a special graph class: bounded-genus graphs. We present algorithms for computing the exact diameter, the exact global minimum cut size, and a ( 1 ± ϵ ) (1±ϵ) -approximate s - t minimum cut size with O ˜ ( n ) O˜(n) energy for bounded-genus graphs. Our approach is based on a generic framework that divides the vertex set into high-degree and low-degree parts and leverages the structural properties of bounded-genus graphs to control the number of certain connected components in the subgraph induced by the low-degree part.},

However, all prior O ( 1 ) O(1) -round algorithms for maximal fractional matching use arbitrarily fine-grained fractional values . In particular, none of them is able to find a half-integral solution, using only values from { 0 , 1 2 , 1 } {0,12,1} . We show that the use of fine-grained fractional values is necessary, and moreover we give a complete characterization on exactly how small values are needed: if we consider maximal fractional matching in graphs of maximum degree Δ = 2 d Δ=2d , and any distributed graph algorithm with round complexity T ( Δ ) T(Δ) that only depends on Δ and is independent of n , we show that the algorithm has to use fractional values with a denominator at least 2 d 2d . We give a new algorithm that shows that this is also sufficient.},

Different from the selfish bin packing problem proposed by Bilò in 2006, where the items are astute to minimize their shared proportional cost in a bin, we consider the case that items are into the utility defined as the load of bin it is packed in and, a unilateral moving may incur punishment. We define and consider several kinds of punishment, which can be roughly classified into two types: the punishment according to the behavior and the punishment based on the result. For both types we present the tight bound for Price of Anarchy (PoA) under the objective of minimizing the number of bins used. The results proved show that punishment does not always work, a punishment based on the result can be viewed as a delicate designed threat in advance which could perform much better, with an approximate 1.48 upper bound comparing to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {We revisit a classical crossword filling puzzle which already appeared in Garey&amp; Jonhson&#39;s book. We are given a grid with n vertical and horizontal slots and a dictionary with m words. We are asked to place words from the dictionary in the slots so that shared cells are consistent. We attempt to pinpoint the source of intractability of this problem by carefully taking into account the structure of the grid graph, which contains a vertex for each slot and an edge if two slots intersect . Our main approach is to consider the case where this graph has a tree-like structure. Unfortunately, if we impose the common rule that words cannot be reused, we discover that the problem remains NP-hard under very severe structural restrictions, namely, if the grid graph is a union of stars and the alphabet has size 2, or the grid graph is a matching (so the crossword is a collection of disjoint crosses) and the alphabet has size 3. The problem does become slightly more tractable if word reuse is allowed, as we obtain an m tw mtw algorithm in this case, where tw is the treewidth of the grid graph. However, even in this case, we show that our algorithm cannot be improved to obtain fixed-parameter tractability. More strongly, we show that under the ETH the problem cannot be solved in time m o ( k ) mo(k) , where k is the number of horizontal slots of the instance (which trivially bounds tw ). Motivated by these mostly negative results, we also consider the much more restricted case where the problem is parameterized by the number of slots n . Here, we show that the problem does become FPT (if the alphabet has constant size), but the parameter dependence is exponential in n 2 n2 . We show that this dependence is also justified: the existence of an algorithm with running time 2 o ( n 2 ) 2o(n2) , even for binary alphabet , would contradict the randomized ETH. After that, we consider an optimization version of the problem, where we seek to place as many words on the grid as possible. Here it is easy to obtain a 1 2 12 -approximation, even on weighted instances, simply by considering only horizontal or only vertical slots. We show that this trivial algorithm is also likely to be optimal, as obtaining a better approximation ratio in polynomial time would contradict the Unique Games Conjecture. The latter two results apply whether word reuse is allowed or not. Finally, we present some special cases where the problem is decidable in polynomial time . In particular, we present three reductions, one to 2- SAT , the second to Maximum Matching and the third to Exact Matching .},

New general results are first given for this universe, by transposing the notions of mean and temperature derived from non-scoring combinatorial games. Such results are then applied to Influence to refine the case of unions of segments started by Duchêne et al. [5] . The computational complexity of the score of the game is also solved and proved to be PSPACE -complete. We finally focus on some specific cases of Influence when the graph is bipartite, by giving explicit strategies and bounds on the optimal score on structures like grids, hypercubes or tori.},

The max-flow problem in a network with unit capacities is equivalent to the arc-disjoint paths problem. Moreover, the max-flow and min-cut problems form a strongly dual pair. We relax the disjointedness requirement on the paths, allowing them to be almost disjoint, meaning they may share up to one arc. The resulting almost disjoint paths problem (ADP) asks for k s - t -paths such that any two of them are almost disjoint. The separating by forbidden pairs problem (SFP) is the corresponding dual problem and calls for a set of k arc pairs such that every s - t -path contains both arcs of at least one such pair. In this paper, we explore these two problems, showing that they have an unbounded duality gap in general and analyzing their complexity. We prove that ADP is NP -complete when k is part of the input and that SFP is Σ 2 P Σ2P -complete, even for acyclic graphs. Furthermore, we efficiently solve ADP when k ≤ 2 k≤2 is fixed and present a polynomial time algorithm based on dynamic programming for ADP when k is constant.},

In this problem, the stream consists of m clauses that are disjunctions of literals drawn from n Boolean variables. The objective is to find an assignment to the variables that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses. Chou et al. (FOCS 2020) showed that Ω ( n ) Ω(n) space is necessary to yield a 2 / 2 + ε 2/2+ε approximation of the optimum value; they also presented an algorithm that yields a 2 / 2 − ε 2/2−ε approximation of the optimum value using O ( ε − 2 log ⁡ n ) O(ε−2log⁡n) space. In this paper, we not only focus on approximating the optimum value, but also on obtaining the corresponding Boolean assignment using sublinear o ( m n ) o(mn) space. We present randomized single-pass algorithms that w.h.p. 1 yield: We also consider the related minimum satisfiability problem (Min-SAT), introduced by Kohli et al. (SIAM J. Discrete Math. 1994), that asks to find an assignment that minimizes the number of satisfied clauses. For this problem, we give a O ˜ ( n 2 / ε 2 ) O˜(n2/ε2) space algorithm, which is sublinear when m = ω ( n ) m=ω(n) , that yields an α + ε α+ε approximation where α is the approximation guarantee of the offline algorithm. If each variable appears in at most f clauses, we show that a 2 f n 2fn approximation using O ˜ ( n ) O˜(n) space is possible. Finally, for the Max-AND-SAT problem where clauses are conjunctions of literals, we show that any single-pass algorithm that approximates the optimal value up to a factor better than 1/2 with success probability at least 2/3 must use Ω ( m n ) Ω(mn) space.},

(2022) [14] developed the Elastic Founder Graph ( EFG ) representing an alignment of m sequences of length n , drawn from alphabet Σ plus the special gap character: the paths spell the original sequences or their recombination . By enforcing the semi-repeat-free property, the EFG admits a polynomial-space index for linear-time pattern matching, breaking through the conditional lower bounds on indexing labeled graphs (Equi et al. [13] ). In this work, we improve the space of the EFG index answering pattern matching queries in linear time, from linear in the length of all strings spelled by three consecutive node labels, to linear in the size of the edge labels. Then, we develop linear-time construction algorithms optimizing for different metrics: we improve the existing linearithmic construction algorithms to O ( m n ) O(mn) , by solving the novel exclusive ancestor set problem on trees; we propose, for the simplified gapless setting, an O ( m n ) O(mn) -time solution minimizing the maximum block height, that we generalize by substituting block height with prefix-aware height . Finally, to show the versatility of the framework, we develop a BWT-based EFG index and study how to encode and perform document listing queries on a set of paths of the graphs, reporting which paths present a given pattern as a substring. We propose the EFG framework as an improved and enhanced version of the framework for the gapless setting, along with construction methods that are valid in any setting concerned with the segmentation of aligned sequences.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the Differentially Private Empirical Risk Minimization (DP-ERM) problem, considering both convex and non-convex loss functions. For cases where DP-ERM involves smooth (strongly) convex loss functions with or without non-smooth regularization , we propose several novel methods. These methods achieve (near) optimal expected excess risks (i.e., utility bounds) while reducing the gradient complexity compared to existing approaches. When dealing with DP-ERM and smooth convex loss functions in high dimensions , we introduce an algorithm that achieves a superior upper bound with lower gradient complexity than previous solutions. In the second part of the paper, for DP-ERM with non-convex loss functions, we explore both low and high dimensional spaces. In the low dimensional case with a non-smooth regularizer, we extend an existing approach by measuring the utility using the ℓ 2 ℓ2 norm of the projected gradient. Furthermore, we introduce a novel error bound measurement, transitioning from empirical risk to population risk by employing the expected ℓ 2 ℓ2 norm of the gradient. For the high dimensional case, we demonstrate that by measuring utility with the Frank-Wolfe gap, we can bound the utility using the Gaussian Width of the constraint set, instead of the dimensionality ( p ) of the underlying space. We also show that the advantages of this approach can be achieved by measuring the ℓ 2 ℓ2 norm of the projected gradient. Finally, we reveal that the utility of certain special non-convex loss functions can be reduced to a level (depending only on log ⁡ p log⁡p ) similar to that of convex loss functions.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes apertures of size 2 2 k 22k for hexagonal grids together with their indexing scheme, where k may be any positive integer. Hexagonal grid can be represented by an ideal I ( 2 + ω ) I(2+ω) of a unit-ring Z ( ω ) Z(ω) of Eisenstein integers, where, for the set Z Z of integers and the cube root ω ω of 1, Z ( ω ) Z(ω) denotes { a + b ω | a , b ∈ Z } {a+bω|a,b∈Z} , and, for any λ ∈ Z ( ω ) λ∈Z(ω) , I ( λ ) I(λ) denotes an ideal { κ λ | κ ∈ Z ( ω ) } {κλ|κ∈Z(ω)} of Z ( ω ) Z(ω) . We show that a factor ring I ( 2 + ω ) / I ( 2 k ( 2 + ω ) ) I(2+ω)/I(2k(2+ω)) represents an aperture 2 2 k 22k hexagonal grid, and prove that it is isomorphic to a factor ring Z ( ω ) / I ( 2 k ) Z(ω)/I(2k) . The latter represents a trigonal grid in a rhombus-shaped aperture with its edge length 2 k 2k , where we can address each of its 2 2 k 22k grid points as i + j ω i+jω using two k -bit positive binary integers. We show that each grid point α = a + b ω α=a+bω in I ( 2 + ω ) / I ( 2 k ( 2 + ω ) ) I(2+ω)/I(2k(2+ω)) can be indexed by the address of its isomorphic image in Z ( ω ) / I ( 2 k ) Z(ω)/I(2k) , and that this index is identical to the pair of the k -bit 2′s complements of a a and b b . Based on these findings, we clarify how indices may change for different resolutions, how to define the hierarchical indexing, how to geometrically interpret algebraic operations on indices, and, as one of the applications, how the quantization of trajectories of 10 6 106 ∼ 10 7 107 mobile objects on hexagonal grids may reduce the communication capacity required for their quasi-real-time simultaneous monitoring and sharing through the Internet. We also show how our indexing scheme can be applied to the design of DGGSs (Discrete Global Grid Systems) that cover the entire Earth&#39;s surface and 3D regular grids.},

More specifically, given two string s , s ′ ∈ { 0 , 1 } n s,s′∈{0,1}n satisfying the above constraints, for any x ∈ { 0 , 1 } n x∈{0,1}n the max inner product oracle O m a x ( x ) Omax(x) returns the max value between s ⋅ x s⋅x and s ′ ⋅ x s′⋅x , and the sub-set oracle O s u b ( x ) Osub(x) indicates whether the index set of the 1s in x is a subset of that in s or s ′ s′ . We present an exact quantum algorithm consuming O ( 1 ) O(1) queries to the max inner product oracle for identifying the pair { s , s ′ } {s,s′} , and prove that any randomized algorithm requires Ω ( n / log 2 ⁡ n ) Ω(n/log2⁡n) queries.

We propose a M -Threshold Decrease Algorithm that uses a compensation constant M from a special decomposition h ( x ) = f ( x ) − g ( x ) h(x)=f(x)−g(x) , which achieves a 1 − e − δ − ϵ 1−e−δ−ϵ approximation guarantee.

This implies that there is a valid δ such that 1 − e − δ − ϵ &gt; 0 1−e−δ−ϵ&amp;gt;0 . To accelerate the algorithm, we employ a random subset to replace the ground set and propose a Random M -Threshold Decrease Algorithm, where δ ( ϵ ) = ϵ r max s ∈ Ω ⁡ h ( χ s | 0 ) 2 n k max s ∈ Ω ⁡ g ( χ s | 0 ) + [ k ( n − r ) + ϵ r ] max s ∈ Ω ⁡ h ( χ s | 0 ) δ(ϵ)=ϵrmaxs∈Ω⁡h(χs|0)2nkmaxs∈Ω⁡g(χs|0)+[k(n−r)+ϵr]maxs∈Ω⁡h(χs|0) with r being the size of the random subset and n being the size of the ground set. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, based on the DR-ratio γ d γd and the DS decomposition, the M -Threshold Decrease Algorithm is also suitable for solving the monotone non-DR-submodular maximization problem, achieving a 1 − e − γ d δ − O ( ϵ ) 1−e−γdδ−O(ϵ) approximation guarantee. Because γ d γd is a challenging metric to calculate, we refine the M -Threshold Decrease Algorithm, which can return an estimate of γ d γd . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a single factor approximation ratio has been proposed for the nonmonotone DR-submodular maximization problem (possibly negative) subject to cardinality constraints.},

As a fundamental problem in large-scale parallel and distributed systems , connectivity and diagnosability, especially g -extra connectivity and g -extra conditional diagnosability, have been widely followed. This work proposes a new class of recursive networks including the BCube—conditional recursive match networks (CRMNs). To explore the reliability of CRMNs, we get the g -extra connectivity and g -extra conditional diagnosability of CRMNs under the PMC model and the MM* model for 0 ≤ g ≤ 3 0≤g≤3 and g = 2 m + 1 − 1 g=2m+1−1 ( m ≥ 0 ) (m≥0) . And these results can not only be applied to the BCube, but also be used to directly obtain the corresponding g -extra connectivity and g -extra conditional diagnosability of some other networks except the BCube. In addition, we put forward the conjectures as regards the g -extra connectivity and g -extra conditional diagnosability of CRMNs with g &gt; 0 g&amp;gt;0 .},

  abstract     = {Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs as well as succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) are playing a central role in both theory and application of cryptography. Simulation extractable for SNARKs is considered a necessary security requirement by most applications which prevents the protocol from malleable attacks. However, a trusted party is required to generate the common reference string (CRS) for SNARKs which can be quite problematic in real applications. Recently, the subvertible and updatable CRS model has been proposed to relax the trust in the CRS generation procedure. In this paper, we propose two generic compilers that can achieve simulation extractable in the updatable CRS model. By using an efficient updatable verifiable random function defined in this paper which may be of independent interest, we show that our compiler can lift the updatable knowledge soundness of the underlying SNARKs to achieve updatable simulation extractability. We extend our results by proposing another compiler that can lift a NIZK that has an even weaker security notion called updatable soundness to achieve updatable simulation extractability. We instantiate our compilers and compare them to other related works. This shows that our efficient compilers can be used in various applications.},

A particular feature of our model is that the value of an agent for an item in some round depends on the number of rounds in which the item has been used by the agent in the past. We present a set of positive and negative results about the efficiency and fairness of repeated matchings. For example, when items are goods, an adaptation of the well-studied fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) can be satisfied under certain conditions. Furthermore, it is intractable to achieve fairness and (approximate) efficiency simultaneously, even though they are achievable separately. For mixed items, which can be goods for some agents and chores for others, we propose and study a new notion of fairness that we call swap envy-freeness (swapEF).},
