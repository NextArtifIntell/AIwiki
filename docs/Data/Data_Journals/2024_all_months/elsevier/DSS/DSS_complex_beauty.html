  abstract     = {Companies increasingly combine multiple media outlets when launching advertising campaigns. This study employs causal forest to examine the effects of complex multimedia campaigns. The model effectively corrects for selection bias, automatically identifies informative consumer features, and performs automated data-driven consumer segmentation based on the consumer features identified. We analyze a large dataset involving around seven million consumers and four thousand covariates, and provide empirical evidence on the nonlinear effect of repeated ad exposures in the multimedia context, how such effect varies across consumer groups, and the contingent existence of multimedia synergy. We demonstrate that negligence of the selection bias and heterogeneity across segments results in suboptimal conversions and a waste of advertising resources. The analysis procedure that we propose can facilitate decision making for complex advertising campaigns to improve their effectiveness.},

Although previous studies have explored the impact of emotional expression in chatbots, there is a lack of understanding regarding the precise effects of different emotional cues. In this study, we drew upon social presence theory to investigate how different emotional cues conveyed by recommendation chatbots affect perceived humanness, social interactivity, and social presence. We conducted a series of scenario-based online experiments to shed light on these dynamics. We found that all three emotional cues (text, emoticons, and images) employed by chatbots can increase perceived humanness and social interactivity. Social presence appears to be an underlying mechanism for these positive relationships. We also observed two-way interactions for any pair of emotional cues and a three-way interaction for all three emotional cues. Ultimately, to elicit the most favorable customer perception, we propose that a mode of emotional expression using either text or emoticons alone is most appropriate. These findings deepen our understanding of the impact of emotional expressions in chatbots and offer novel insights into how to deploy chatbots in customer service.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel decision support system (DSS) to address the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP). The solution decomposes the NP-complete UCTP into two sub-problems, allowing a structured approach to addressing the complexities inherent in the UCTP process. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to integrate academic year course schedule planning and instructor assignment, accommodating various constraints to meet student demands. The model optimizes the number of course sections and strategically schedules instructors, aiming to reduce the number of new and distinct courses assigned to them. Historical data from an academic department encompassing multiple disciplines, including Computer Information Systems, Business Management, and Business Analytics, at a large public university in the U.S. is used to develop the model, and the results are compared with the actual course schedule and instructor assignment. The results demonstrate that the proposed DSS would result in a 14 % reduction in the number of course sections offered, translating to approximately $130,000 in annual savings. Additionally, it could significantly reduce the number of new courses assigned to instructors by up to 81 % and the number of distinct course sections assigned to them by 29 %.},

However, the effectiveness of the approach depends critically on the compatibility of clustering methods and algorithms with the specific data characteristics. This study, based on a comprehensive review of 87 articles employing taxonomy-based clustering in IS research, reveals a notable mismatch between the chosen clustering algorithms and the nature of the data, particularly in the context of archetype development from taxonomy-based data. To address these methodological inconsistencies, we introduce a set of clustering guidelines tailored to the unique requirements of archetype development from taxonomy-based data. These guidelines are informed by a computational study involving seven identified datasets from the taxonomy-building literature, ensuring their practical applicability and scientific relevance. Our guidelines are designed to enhance the robustness and scientific validity of insights and decisions derived from taxonomy-based clustering. By improving the methodological rigor of clustering methods, our research addresses a critical mismatch in current practices and contributes to enhancing the quality of decision-making informed by taxonomy-based analysis in IS research.},

  abstract     = {Efficient team formation is critical to human resource management, particularly as large enterprise organizations continue to flatten and are increasingly driven by projects. Efficiently scheduling internal departments and reducing employee scheduling costs are essential objectives. This paper addresses the challenge of extracting employees from the existing network who possess the necessary skills to meet project requirements while minimizing the disruption to the original department network. To tackle this problem, we model the organization as a graph, where each employee is a node, and edges represent communication between them. We formulate team formation as a combinatorial optimization problem on the graph. We first innovatively design the employee replacement and organizational measures for changing structures on the graph. To overcome the complexity of team formation under vast organizational structures and resource constraints, we propose the Graph Combinatorial Optimization DQN framework. This novel approach combines reinforcement learning and graph neural networks. By leveraging graph neural networks, we learn employee representations based on their basic information, skills, and communication patterns with other employees. Furthermore, during testing, we enable the agent to continuously improve its solutions through learning and avoid the pitfall of optimizing early decisions that may hinder the modification of later decisions. This is achieved by incrementally building subsets of solutions. We demonstrate the superiority of the GCO-DQN framework using both the real-world enterprise dataset and a synthetic dataset by comparing GCO-DQN with five state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Life event prediction is an important tool for customer relationship management (CRM), because life events shift customers’ preferences towards different products and services. Existing life event research mainly uses cross-sectional data, whereas in the CRM field, incorporating longitudinal data is increasingly common. Because longitudinal data can capture the dynamics of customer behavior, opportunities arise to benchmark the power of longitudinal customer data for predictions of cross-sectional versus longitudinal life events. Therefore, this study compares statistical and machine learning (SaML) classifiers, such as logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, with long- and short-term memory networks (LSTM), using data represented in both cross-sectional and longitudinal setups for life event prediction. Through a real-life longitudinal customer data set from a European bank, the authors represent the longitudinal data in a cross-sectional data format, using featurization in the form of aggregation. The available data cover 42 end-of-month snapshots for 760,438 unique customers. For marketing decision-making literature, this article (1) introduces three novel life events (i.e., primary, secondary, and rental residence purchases) to life event predictions; (2) offers guidance for how to leverage longitudinal customer data, according to the comparison of various featurization approaches and benchmarking SaML classifiers against LSTM; and (3) clarifies the importance of features and timing for improving marketing decision-making dynamically. The results show that aggregating features over time is preferable as a featurization approach for cross-sectional modeling using SaML classifiers. Furthermore, LSTM can capture behavioral changes over time, unlike SaML classifiers. It also performs significantly better than SaML classifiers on the area under curve and F1 metrics. Insights into the uses of integrated gradients reveal that feature importance changes over time. An integrated gradients method can assist decision-makers in their efforts to plan effective communication with customers in advance, such as by allocating more resources to customers who exhibit high probabilities of a particular life event occurrence.},

Royalty as investment cost negatively affects short-term performance, while royalty and initial price exhibit inverted U-shaped impacts on long-term performance due to their mixed roles of costs and quality signals. Market uncertainty amplifies the impacts of complexity and royalties while diminishing the initial price impact in the long term.

The findings from three experimental studies have shown that perceived credibility explains the positive effect of LSM on review helpfulness.

Nevertheless, recommender systems suffer from the ‘cold-start’ problem, which occurs when no prior information about a new session or a user is available. Many approaches to solving the cold-start problem have been presented in the literature. However, there is still room for improving the performance of recommender systems in the cold-start stage. In this article, we present a novel method to alleviate the cold-start problem in session-based recommender systems. The purpose of this work is to develop a session similarity-based cold-start session alleviation approach for recommendation systems. The developed method uses previous sessions’ contextual and temporal features to find sessions similar to the newly started one. Our results on three different datasets show that, based on the provided Mean Average Precision and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain scores, the Session Similarity-based Framework consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of recommendation relevance and ranking quality across three used datasets. Our approach can be used to address the challenges associated with cold start sessions where no previously interacted items are present.},

Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected for analysis, and simple random sampling was employed for primary data collection. The empirical analysis was conducted using a mixed-method approach. The study identified four ethical principles that guide complex relationships within the metaverse: business benefit evaluation, fairness, explainability, and reliability principles.

  abstract     = {Corporate information systems (IS) functions have become ever closer and more intertwined with firms&#39; marketing functions. Marketing technology and e-commerce implementations require synergy between these functions, which has been reflected in the emergence of researchers and practitioners who can work at the intersection of these disciplines. This article utilizes a systematic literature review to understand this environment and to provide a forward-looking analysis of research at the intersection of IS and marketing. First, a business-focused introduction describes the motivation for the review and puts it into context. This is followed by a bibliographic analysis to select articles at this intersection. A semi-automated content analysis of the selected articles groups them into homogeneous research clusters and further analysis is used to develop cluster themes. This process sheds light on the potential areas of collaboration, offering an in-depth comprehension of their symbiotic relationship. A set of pathways for future research is described based on “collaboration areas” between IS and marketing. These areas, including consumer trust and decision making, social media, online reviews, mobile platforms &amp; apps, and marketing channels, among others, represent the specific areas where marketing and IS overlap and mutually influence each other. Insights are presented on bridging academia and industry and suggestions are proposed for enhancing research at the junction of IS and marketing.},

  abstract     = {Conceptual models are used to help professionals understand complex information systems and solve problems during systems analysis and design. Because single model often do not represent all relevant information, typically multiple models are used in combination. To design effective combinations of models, we propose a systematic approach that uses color highlighting to foreground overlapping concepts between multiple models to help readers identify corresponding information between models. We conducted two empirical studies – an online experiment and an eye-tracking experiment – to evaluate the cognitive efficacy of this approach. Our findings suggest that color highlighting can somewhat improve participants’ domain understanding but not the efficiency of problem-solving. Findings from the eye-tracking study suggest that the use of color can have both beneficial and harmful effects, depending on the extent of overlap.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a growing number of credibility assessment technologies (CATs) have been developed to assist human decision-making processes in evidence-based investigations, such as criminal investigations, financial fraud detection, and insurance claim verification. Despite the widespread adoption of CATs, it remains unclear how CAT and human biases interact during the evidence-collection procedure and affect the fairness of investigation outcomes. To address this gap, we develop a Bayesian framework to model CAT adoption and the iterative collection and interpretation of evidence in investigations. Based on the Bayesian framework, we further conduct simulations to examine how CATs affect investigation fairness with various configurations of evidence effectiveness, CAT effectiveness, human biases, technological biases, and decision stakes. We find that when investigators are unconscious of their own biases, CAT adoption generally increases the fairness of investigation outcomes if the CAT is more effective than evidence and less biased than the investigators. However, the CATs&#39; positive influence on fairness diminishes as humans become aware of their own biases. Our results show that CATs&#39; impact on decision fairness highly depends on various technological, human, and contextual factors. We further discuss the implications for CAT development, evaluation, and adoption based on our findings.},

  abstract     = {While many companies have benefited from online sales as their sole sales channel with the rapid growth of online retailing, this approach has limitations, especially for products that contain non-digital information and require a complementary service to fully attract customers. Sellers of these types of products are actively considering or have already adopted a multichannel strategy, which includes maintaining the existing online channel and opening physical brick-and-mortar stores. To stimulate sales, the service operator may consider offering a product bundle with the product manufacturer by providing subsidies to them. Decisions on product bundling could potentially facilitate or pose barriers to channel expansion. This study employs a game-theoretic model to explore the optimal pricing, multichannel and bundling strategies for a product manufacturer and a service operator who offer the core products with ancillary services in either bundled or non-bundled format. Our equilibrium analysis yields several insights. First, the manufacturer’s offline expansion allows customers who visit in-store to try and inspect the product, which raises not only the offline price but also the manufacturer’s online price. Interestingly, this price increase is more significant for the bundled format compared to the non-bundled format. Second, the bundling strategy influences the manufacturer’s decision to expand into multichannel operations. Specifically, product bundling incentivises multichannel expansion if the newly added physical stores can attract a significant number of new customers, indicating that demand spillover is significant. Conversely, product bundling may deter multichannel expansion if the online hassle cost is moderate.},

Meanwhile, the abundance of information in today&#39;s world also means different pieces of information will increasingly compete for people&#39;s finite attention. When different pieces of information spread together in an online social network, why would some become trendy while others fail to emerge? Existing research either models the diffusion of each piece of information independently, or fails to consider users&#39; inactivity in online social networks. Modeling each piece of information as a meme, this paper addresses this gap by proposing a unified model for the co-diffusion of competing memes simultaneously spreading across an online social network. We are the first to identify a ubiquitous threshold for competing meme. The threshold also functions as an effective predictor that contributes to better performance in determining the outcome of meme competitions. Outcomes from this study have important implications for online campaigns and mobilizations as well as the fight against misinformation.},

While repeated exposures to advertising can capture consumers&#39; attention and stimulate their purchases, it is crucial to recognize that excessive advertising campaigns can cause consumer fatigue, diminished responsiveness, or even irritation. In the present study, our objective is to formulate the optimal advertising policy considering the effect of consumer ad fatigue. By introducing an attenuation factor that accounts for the negative impact of excessive advertising expenditure, we modify the dynamics of goodwill in the classical Nerlove-Arrow model. This modification results in the advertising response function exhibiting an inverted U-shaped curve with respect to the advertising expenditure. Our analysis indicates that when consumers experience ad fatigue, it is advisable for the firm to proportionally reduce its advertising expenditure in all time periods. However, the firm should maintain its original direction of trajectory of optimal advertising expenditure despite the presence of consumer ad fatigue.},

However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of how and when chatbots&#39; emotional expressions improve customer attitudes. Although chatbots&#39; emotional expressions of care and concern may feel inauthentic to customers in the inferential path, which can negatively affects customer attitudes, we propose that the positive effect of the affective reactions path can result in a positive effect on customer attitude based on the dual-path view of Emotions as Social Information (EASI). The relative strengths of the two EASI paths can be moderated, and we explored the moderating effects of rational thinking styles (information processing in EASI) and beliefs in computer emotion (perceived appropriateness in EASI). According to EASI, situation can affect the meaning of emotions, so we conducted experiments in two situations. With chatbot identity disclosure, we found that the chatbot&#39;s emotional expressions reduce customers&#39; perceived authenticity (reflecting the inferential path in EASI) but ultimately improve customer attitudes. Belief in computer emotions and rational thinking style moderated the negative relationship between emotional expressions and authenticity. With chatbot identity non-disclosure, the chatbot&#39;s emotional expressions still improve customer attitudes but with no effect on authenticity. Because there is high likelihood of chatbot identities being discovered by customers, this finding of the moderating effect of perceived humanness on authenticity is highly relevant. Our findings make important contributions to research on computer emotion and service authenticity.},

Traditional single-disease management often fails to address the multifaceted nature of multimorbidity. Network model emerges as a growing field for elucidating the interconnections among multimorbidity. However, the field lacks a standardized method to compute and visually represent of these networks. Given the challenges, this study proposes a three-stage methodology to decipher multimorbidity. First, we integrate the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method with the multimorbidity encapsulation framework to develop the Multimorbidity Risk Network (MRN). Second, we use complex network techniques to identify high-risk patterns within MRN communities. Finally, we apply machine learning techniques to correlate these communities with the biological attributes of patients that have been marginalized in most studies. Our approach advocates a paradigm shift from the conventional focus on single diseases to a holistic, patient-centric approach, providing decision-makers with integrated information technology artifacts for deciphering the multimorbidity.},

Instead of paying for a book, readers pay for each chapter (pay-per-chapter mode) of the ongoing book project. This mode allows readers to pay for as many chapters as they want without taking the risk that the releasing of new chapters might be delayed or stopped. Despite of the dynamics of chapter-by-chapter released of COL products, the fixed pricing strategy (FPS) does not make fully use of the reading data generated by releasing chapters of the ongoing book. We propose a learning-based dynamic pricing strategy (LDPS) that exploits the newly information to maximize cumulative revenue for the publisher. The LDPS captures the ever changing features of readers. It employs the Thompson sampling method to balance the exploration of investigating different prices sufficiently with the exploitation of settling on the optimal price. Taking COL as a case study and implementing our strategy in the context of the aforementioned real-life data set, we show that LDPS outperform several classical strategies such as Greedy, Prior-Free TS and Prior-Given TS, and average revenue of LDPS is increased by 0.5 % average per time-point compared to the publisher&#39;s historical decisions. We also provide some management implications for the COL publisher by analyzing the pricing range of different genres of books and the choice of the exploration threshold parameter.},

However, manual assessments and human error can lead to delays and inconsistencies. This study employs situational awareness theory to develop an automated decision support system, integrating perception, comprehension, and projection components to enhance effectiveness. Specifically, an interpretable principal component analysis (iPCA) combined with machine learning is utilized to forecast CVSS scores using text descriptions from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Different forecasting approaches, including traditional machine learning models, Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and Transformer architectures (ChatGPT) are compared to determine the best performance. The results show that iPCA combined with support vector regression achieves a high performance (R 2 = 98%) in predicting CVSS scores using CVE text descriptions. The results indicate that the variability, length, and details in the vulnerability description contribute to the performance of the transformer model. These findings are consistent across vulnerability descriptions from six companies between 2017 and 2019. The study&#39;s outcomes have the potential to enhance organizations&#39; security posture, improving situational awareness and enabling better managerial decision-making in cybersecurity.},

  abstract     = {The conventional aggregated performance measure (i.e., mean squared error) with respect to the whole dataset would not provide desired safety and quality assurance for each individual prediction made by a machine learning model in risk-sensitive regression problems. In this paper, we propose an informative indicator ℛ x ℛx to quantify model reliability for individual prediction (MRIP) for the purpose of safeguarding the usage of machine learning (ML) models in mission-critical applications. Specifically, we define the reliability of a ML model with respect to its prediction on each individual input x x as the probability of the observed difference between the prediction of ML model and the actual observation falling within a small interval when the input x x varies within a small range subject to a preset distance constraint, namely ℛ x = P y ∗ − y ̂ ∗ ≤ ε x ∗ ∈ B x ℛx=Py∗−ŷ∗≤εx∗∈Bx , where y ∗ y∗ denotes the observed target value for the input x ∗ , x∗, y ̂ ∗ ŷ∗ denotes the model prediction for the input x ∗ x∗ , and x ∗ x∗ is an input in the neighborhood of x x subject to the constraint B x = x ∗ x ∗ − x ≤ δ Bx=x∗x∗−x≤δ . The developed MRIP indicator ℛ x ℛx provides a direct, objective, quantitative, and general-purpose measure of “reliability” or the probability of success of the ML model for each individual prediction by fully exploiting the local information associated with the input x x and ML model. Next, to mitigate the intensive computational effort involved in MRIP estimation, we develop a two-stage ML-based framework to directly learn the relationship between x x and its MRIP ℛ x ℛx , thus enabling to provide the reliability estimate ℛ x ℛx for any unseen input instantly. Thirdly, we propose an information gain-based approach to help determine a threshold value pertaing to ℛ x ℛx in support of decision makings on when to accept or abstain from counting on the ML model prediction. Comprehensive computational experiments and quantitative comparisons with existing methods on a broad range of real-world datasets reveal that the developed ML-based framework for MRIP estimation shows a robust performance in improving the reliability estimate of individual prediction, and the MRIP indicator ℛ x ℛx thus provides an essential layer of safety net when adopting ML models in risk-sensitive environments.},

Current topic modeling techniques, like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are limited in the pre-processing steps and currently require human judgement, increasing analysis time and opportunities for error. The purpose of this research is to allay some of those limitations by introducing new approaches to improve coherence without adding computational complexity and provide an objective method for determining the number of topics within a corpus. First, we identify a requirement for a more robust stop words list and introduce a new dimensionality-reduction heuristic that exploits the number of words within a document to infer importance to word choice. Second, we develop an eigenvalue technique to determine the number of topics within a corpus. Third, we combine all of these techniques into the Zimm Approach, which produces higher quality results than LDA in determining the number of topics within a corpus. The Zimm Approach, when tested against various subsets of the 20newsgroup dataset, produced the correct number of topics in 7 of 9 subsets vs. 0 of 9 using highest coherence value produced by LDA.},

  abstract     = {In today&#39;s digital economy, virtually everything from products and services to political debates and cultural phenomena can spark WOM on social media. Analyzing online WOM poses at least three challenges. First, online WOM typically consists of unstructured data that can transform into myriad variables, necessitating effective dimension reduction. Second, online WOM is often continuous and dynamic, with the potential for rapid, time-varying changes. Third, significant events may trigger symmetric or asymmetric responses across various entities, resulting in “bursty” and intense WOM from multiple sources. To address these challenges, we introduce a new computationally efficient method—multi-view sequential canonical covariance analysis. This method is designed to solve the myriad online WOM conversational dimensions, detect online WOM dynamic trends, and examine the shared online WOM across different entities. This approach not only enhances the capability to swiftly interpret and respond to online WOM data but also shows potential to significantly improve decision-making processes across various contexts. We illustrate the method&#39;s benefits through two empirical examples, demonstrating its potential to provide profound insights into online WOM dynamics and its extensive applicability in both academic research and practical scenarios.},

Prior literature focuses on incentive scheme development for customers&#39; choices of delivery windows and predictive analytics for delivery results, but it is not clear whether the effect of AHD on the appointment date set by customers increases the success rate of AHD. Therefore, we developed an uplift modeling method, PSM-NDML, as a relevant prescriptive analytic tool for AHD on an appointment date, which aims to estimate the causal effect of the by-appointment delivery on the delivery result. PSM-NDML integrates propensity score matching and double machine learning, effectively addressing sample selection bias, low predictive performance, and poor interpretability. Applied to a real-world product delivery dataset of a Chinese logistics company, PSM-NDML achieves superior performance relative to ten other state-of-the-art uplift models in terms of cumulative gain and the Qini coefficient. The predicted responses gained from PSM-NDML are also visually interpreted at the global and local levels, which reveals various managerial insights. In practice, the findings expand managers&#39; understanding of the heterogeneous effects of AHD on appointment dates and provide decision support for logistics companies in the development of home delivery plans.},

  abstract     = {While many online platforms use incentive hierarchies to stimulate consumers to generate more online reviews, the extent to which these hierarchies influence reviewer behavior is not fully understood. This study, drawing on image motivation theory and consumer attention theory, takes a novel approach to investigate whether reviewers strategically adjust their review behavior after reaching higher ranks in a hierarchy. We use data from rank change timestamps on platforms to accurately identify reviewers&#39; ranks when posting reviews and then employ a quasi-natural experimental design for causal inference. Additionally, we use Fisher&#39;s permutation test to explore the different effects at various ranks. The empirical results reveal that reviewers tend to increase their review length and insert more pictures into their reviews after they reach higher ranks. Reviewers at lower ranks tend to submit more extreme ratings upon rank advancement, whereas their higher-ranking counterparts do not demonstrate significant change. Unlike ratings, reviewers tend to consistently increase the sentiment intensity of their expressions in text after reaching higher ranks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the magnitude of changes in reviewing behavior only shows an increasing trend in the early stages of rank progression. These insights contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy of incentive hierarchies and offer practical implications for decision-making by platform managers.},

While there are established standards and recommendations, there is limited empirical research examining the influence of process model layout on model comprehension. To address this research gap, we conducted a controlled eye-tracking experiment with 70 participants comparing different layouts. The experimental results confirm that the visibility of control flow patterns is critical for assisting users with visual processing, particularly attentional allocation, when comprehending process models for both local comprehension tasks and tasks requiring cognitive integration of model components. In models with more directional changes, users’ visual attention is more drawn to irrelevant regions, but comprehension is less affected as long as patterns remain visible. Our findings not only elucidate how cognitive fit between a visual representation and a task can manifest itself and the perceptual benefits it brings, but they can also guide the automated layout of models in tools and complement practical process modeling guidelines.},

Despite the burgeoning research on resilience, few studies have embraced a theoretical lens, particularly from a social network perspective. In addition, most extant resilience studies have not explicitly considered the geographic accessibility prerequisite inherent to tourism and hospitality products. In this study, leveraging the social contagion theory, we present a holistic research framework to investigate the influence of geographic and social proximities, two pivotal social contagion mechanisms, on business resilience. We also delve into moderating factors to discern the conditions under which contagion effects are amplified or attenuated. To validate our theoretical model, we select the restaurant industry as our research context, given its severe impact from COVID-19. Utilizing an extensive dataset from Yelp, encompassing ten U.S. cities varying in sizes and geolocations, our findings indicate that both geographic and social influences exert significant direct effects on resilience. Additionally, these effects exhibit considerable variations contingent upon product attributes, customer characteristics, and geographic factors. Theoretically, we are the first to substantiate the role of social contagion theory in examining resilience, enriching our understanding of the social network mechanism of behavioral contagion among customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also offer valuable practical implications for various stakeholders in supporting their management strategies and decision-making in developing effective plans and preparations, minimizing adverse impacts, and ensuring sustainability in the face of future disruptions.},

Drawing on the insights from the linguistic category model (LCM) and elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we propose that different types (attribute-based and experience-based) of comparative reviews can affect consumers&#39; perceived credibility of online reviews, thus impacting product sales. We analyzed 136,260 reviews on e-commerce platforms to assess these effects and introduced review valence as a boundary condition. Utilizing a combination of pattern discovery, supervised learning techniques, and manual coding, we identified attribute-based and experience-based comparative reviews and subsequently classified them based on positive, neutral, and negative valence. Subsequently, we took the product sales as the dependent variable and applied a two-way fixed effects model . The results indicate that attribute-based comparative reviews exert a more favorable influence on product sales compared to experience-based ones. Additionally, positive comparative reviews, irrespective of their attribute-based or experience-based nature, demonstrate a greater impact than regular positive reviews. However, negative and neutral comparative reviews, only when associated with attribute-based information, exhibit a significant effect. The results highlight the value of different types of comparative reviews and illuminate the moderating role of review valence. Our findings offer new insights and practical guidance for marketers and e-commerce platforms in capitalizing on the important influence of comparative reviews and enhancing the presentation of online reviews.},

We conducted an online experiment to examine the effect of tie strength (strong ties vs. weak ties) on the decision to believe or not believe fake news stories. Participants perceived false stories from weak ties to be more believable than false stories from strong ties (after controlling for the trustworthiness of the sharer). We found that a sharer&#39;s perceived ability to share reliable information plays a significant role in individuals&#39; decision to believe news stories on social media, regardless of whether the source is a strong or weak tie. Interestingly, a sharer&#39;s perceived integrity was found to be important only when the information came from weak ties, while a sharer&#39;s perceived benevolence was not important for either weak or strong ties. These findings show that the perceived integrity of the sharer is a key factor in the decision to believe stories from weak ties, more so than from strong ties. Furthermore, a sharer&#39;s perceived ability to share reliable information is less critical when weak ties share true stories. The impact of weak ties does not stem from the novelty of their information, as we used identical headlines across both study groups. Thus, while the strength of weak ties effect is present in this context, the underlying theoretical mechanism differs from the novelty of information traditionally observed in other settings.},

However, little is known about how physicians can improve their performance in this new environment. Platforms also face challenges in comprehending the competitive mechanisms among physicians, which might hinder them from formulating strategic managerial decisions that foster sustained growth. In this light, we extract medical service-related information from physicians&#39; response behavioral data on a prominent healthcare platform, and empirically investigate the factors affecting physicians&#39; online performance from a competitive perspective as well as the gender differences in these effects. The results indicate that physicians&#39; responses significantly impact their online performance, revealing a competitive relationship between physicians and their colleagues in the same department. Specifically, a fast response time and informative responses are positively correlated with the focal physician&#39;s performance, whereas colleagues&#39; informative responses negatively impact the focal physician&#39;s performance, and this relationship is mediated by the focal physician&#39;s response informativeness. Nevertheless, there is no significant correlation between colleagues&#39; response time and the focal physician&#39;s performance. The results also unveil that gender moderates the effect of response informativeness on the focal physician&#39;s performance. Specifically, colleagues&#39; response informativeness has a more significant impact on male physicians&#39; performance than on female physicians&#39; performance, suggesting a greater propensity for competition among male physicians. Our findings could offer decision support for enhancing physician performance and healthcare platform management.},

  abstract     = {Live streaming has become increasingly popular in recent years. Viewers of live streaming channels can interact with live streamers through various behaviors, such as sending virtual gifts and Danmaku. It is very critical to accurately model such viewers&#39; behaviors, which reflect their interest, for recommending live streaming channels. However, existing studies on live streaming channel recommendation usually model viewers&#39; interaction behaviors through traditional graphs where an edge only connects two nodes, which cannot capture interaction relationships between multi-viewers and multi-channels. In this study, we propose a novel approach to live streaming recommendation based on V iewers&#39; I nteraction B ehavior M odeled by Hyper graphs (VIBM-Hyper). Specifically, VIBM-Hyper first constructs two hypergraphs to model viewers&#39; interaction behaviors, including a channel-oriented behavior hypergraph and a viewer-oriented behavior hypergraph. Then, it employs a hypergraph convolution technique to learn the representations of viewers and live streaming channels, respectively, which are finally used to predict a viewer&#39;s preference for a certain live streaming channel. We analyzed viewers&#39; multiple types of behaviors in live streaming channels and conducted empirical evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of VIBM-Hyper with two real-world datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its superior performance in live streaming channel recommendation in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Eighteen algorithms are systematically evaluated, including state-of-the-art and benchmark methods for identifying overlapping and disjoint groups. Using discussions from five prominent English hacker forums, a comparative analysis examines the influence of the algorithms’ theoretical foundations on community detection. Since ground truths are unattainable for such networks, the study utilizes a multi-metric strategy, incorporating modularity, coverage, performance, and a newly introduced quality measure , Triplet Hub Potential, which quantifies the presence of influential hubs. The findings reveal that while modularity optimization algorithms such as Leiden and Louvain deliver consistent results, neighbor-based expanding techniques tend to provide superior performance. In particular, the Expansion algorithm stood out by uncovering granular hierarchical community structures. The ability to investigate these intimacies is helpful for CTI researchers. Ultimately, we suggest an approach to investigate hacker forums using community detection methods and encourage the future development of algorithms tailored to expose nuances within hacker networks.},

  abstract     = {Although algorithms are increasingly used to support professional tasks and routine decision-making, their opaque nature invites resistance and results in suboptimal use of their advice. Scholars argue for transparency to enhance the acceptability of algorithmic advice. However, current research is limited in understanding how improved transparency enhances the use of algorithmic advice, such as the differences among various aspects of transparency and the underlying mechanism. In this paper, we investigate whether and how different aspects of algorithmic transparency (performance, process, and purpose) enhance the use of algorithmic advice. Drawing on the knowledge-based trust perspective, we examine the mediating roles of trusting beliefs in the relationships between transparency and the use of algorithmic advice. Using the “judge-advisor system” paradigm, we conduct a 2 × 2 × 2 experiment to manipulate the three aspects of transparency and examine their effects on the use of algorithmic advice. We find that performance and process transparency promote the use of algorithmic advice. However, the effect of process transparency gets attenuated when purpose transparency is high. Purpose transparency is only useful when process transparency is low. We also find that while all three aspects of transparency facilitate different trusting beliefs, only competence belief significantly promotes the use of algorithmic advice. It also fully mediates the facilitating effects of performance and process transparency. This study contributes to the emerging research on algorithmic decision support by empirically investigating the effects of transparency on the use of algorithmic advice and identifying the underlying mechanism. The findings also provide practical guidance on how to promote the acceptance of algorithmic advice that is valuable to both individual users and practitioners.},

Accordingly, the approach tailors a genetic algorithm to solve the proposed simulation optimization problem and produce a combination of response actions that optimally block risk propagation at the current stage. To control dynamic propagations timely, this approach allows managers to adjust risk control resources in line with the latest risk states, and become accessible to managers by developing a graphical user interface.

  abstract     = {Information on firms&#39; sustainability often partly resides in unstructured data published, for instance, in annual reports, news, and transcripts of earnings calls. In recent years, researchers and practitioners have started to extract information from these data sources using a broad range of natural language processing (NLP) methods. While there is much to be gained from these endeavors, studies that employ these methods rarely reflect upon the validity and quality of the chosen method—that is, how adequately NLP captures the sustainability information from text. This practice is problematic, as different NLP techniques lead to different results regarding the extraction of information. Hence, the choice of method may affect the outcome of the application and thus the inferences that users draw from their results. In this study, we examine how different types of NLP methods influence the validity and quality of extracted information. In particular, we compare four primary methods, namely (1) dictionary-based techniques, (2) topic modeling approaches, (3) word embeddings , and (4) large language models such as BERT and ChatGPT , and evaluate them on 75,000 manually labeled sentences from 10-K annual reports that serve as the ground truth. Our results show that dictionaries have a large variation in quality, topic models outperform other approaches that do not rely on large language models , and large language models show the strongest performance. In large language models, individual fine-tuning remains crucial. One-shot approaches (i.e., ChatGPT) have lately surpassed earlier approaches when using well-designed prompts and the most recent models.},

Second, we use sentiment analysis to estimate product performance and transfer the results into a product competitive relation network.

We propose a novel framework using these features to predict the chance of success for new games with an accuracy higher than 92%. Further, we investigate important features for prediction and provide model interpretability for practical implementations. We then build a decision support tool that allows video game producers, and associated stakeholders such as investors, to understand how the predictive model decides, predicts, and performs its recommendations.

In study 1, through semi-structured interviews, we establish four key drivers of customer engagement with stock trading apps, and two possible moderators influencing the relationship between customer app engagement and continued usage intention. In study 2, we examine these key drivers by surveying stock trading app users from three different Facebook stock trading communities. The results confirm that the social presence and security features of these apps are significantly associated with consumer stock trading app engagement. We also find that fear of uncertainty and perceived corporate hypocrisy weaken the effect of customer app engagement on continued app usage intention.

We propose a method for summarising predictions of risk over time that produces interpretable components for use in a variety of decision-making processes. The proposed method summarises predictions of risk over time (hazard functions) by approximating them with a parametric smoother. The components of the smoothed approximation can then serve as the basis for decision-making. To demonstrate the proposed summarisation method, we apply it in the specific case of a previously published model for patients discharged from a large teaching hospital on the Gold Coast, Australia. In this context, we describe how the summaries produced by the method could be used to estimate time until a patient reaches a stable, persistent risk level or to stratify patients according to risks of readmission in excess of patient-specific baselines. Our method is anticipated to be valuable in and outside of healthcare for settings where the evolution of risk is important, with specific examples including post-transplantation risk and reinjury risks.},

  abstract     = {Product seeding, defined as the act by which firms send products to selected customers and encourage them to spread word of mouth, is a critical decision support strategy for the success of new products. Using multiple agent-based simulation techniques, we investigated the relative importance of three widely adopted seeding strategies (seeding influentials, early adopters, and random targets) in a competitive market in which products are vertically differentiated in terms of quality and brand strength. We found robust evidence that the finding of an optimal seeding strategy depends on consumers&#39; propensity to spread negative WOM. When negative WOM propensity is low, seeding influentials outperform seeding early adopters or random targets. When negative WOM propensity is high, decision-making about an optimal seeding strategy relies on the relative quality and brand strength of the product and the focal firm&#39;s objective. In particular, if a product&#39;s relative quality is low, seeding early adopters is the optimal seeding strategy in terms of both market share (MS) and net present value (NPV); if the product&#39;s relative quality is equal, seeding early adopters is most effective for increasing MS, while seeding influentials is the best for increasing NPV; and if the product&#39;s relative quality is high, seeding influentials is the optimal strategy, except that for products with strong brand strength and firm aims at maximizing the MS growth.

  abstract     = {Creators have long strived to secure royalties for their works but with little success. In the digital realm, monetization presents an even greater challenge, as traditional digital assets frequently suffer from piracy issues, primarily due to the lack of verifiable ownership. Recently, non-fungible token (NFT), a blockchain-enabled tradable digital asset, has aroused great public attention for its potential to address this long-standing issue. Specifically, NFTs empower creators by enabling them to earn resale royalties from post-primary-sale transactions and by providing verifiable ownership that facilitates consumer trading in a secondary market. In this paper, we employ a two-stage game-theoretic model to examine this innovative business model. Here, an NFT creator makes optimal pricing and royalty rate decisions, while consumers make their purchase and resale decisions accordingly. Our study reveals that the creator inevitably reduces the selling price when a secondary market is introduced, even without imposing royalties. Moreover, contrary to conventional wisdom that NFT-enabled royalties always benefit creators, our research uncovers that the introduction of a secondary market leads to unintended revenue loss for the creator, particularly when most consumers only engage in secondary transactions. Furthermore, we find that the platform&#39;s profitability diminishes with the introduction of a secondary market, especially when most consumers are uninformed and the platform relies primarily on the primary market for commission collection. Finally, we find that the introduction of a secondary market may leave consumers worse off, despite the resale opportunities it offers. Our findings carry crucial managerial implications for platforms, creators, consumers, and policymakers.},

  abstract     = {Online retail platforms encounter numerous challenges, such as cyber-attacks, data breaches, device failures, and operational disruptions. These challenges have intensified in recent years, underscoring the importance of prioritizing resilience for businesses. Unfortunately, conventional cybersecurity methods have proven insufficient in thwarting sophisticated cybercrime tactics. This paper proposes a novel resilience strategy that leverages Explainable Deep Learning technologies and a Blockchain-based consensus protocol strategy. By combining these two approaches, our strategy enables rapid incident detection, explains the features and related vulnerabilities that are used, and enhances decision-making during cyber incidents. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted experiments using NAB datasets, preprocessed and trained the data, and performed an experimental study on real online retail architectures. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in supporting business and operation continuity and creating more efficient cyber resilience strategies that will enhance decision-making capabilities.},

  abstract     = {In an era of growing social activism, companies engaged in socially irresponsible practices are increasingly vulnerable to data breaches, resulting in substantial reputational and financial losses. This study examines how corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) influences a company&#39;s data breach risk. We argue that CSI has an impact on data breach risk by influencing the intentional behaviors of both employees and external hackers. Given that CSI is a broad concept and can take on various forms, we further examine whether some forms of CSI pose a more significant threat than others. Our empirical analysis of data breaches in publicly listed US firms from 2005 to 2017 indicates that compared to the forms of CSI that violate broader social norms (e.g., environmental damages), CSI activities that jeopardize a company&#39;s economic value delivery (e.g., product deficiencies) play a more dominant role in driving data breach risk. Furthermore, we find that corporate social responsibility (CSR) can have a dual impact on moderating the relationship between CSI and data breaches. While CSR often helps mitigate CSI-induced data breach risk, this risk is heightened when both CSR and CSI relate to a firm&#39;s economic value delivery. This study provides critical insights into how companies can navigate complex data breach risk by managing their social performance.},

  abstract     = {Since the Economist magazine heralded blockchain as “the trust machine” in 2015, the blockchain paradigm has experienced crests and falls, including a recent phase of disillusionment due to its failure to meet the high expectations, e.g., to revolutionize record keeping, data management, and workflow, envisioned during its early history. However, despite the waning interest in this technology in some quarters, its deployment has become ever more essential in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs), and other application domains beyond cryptocurrencies. In particular, recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) surrounding Large Language Models (LLM) offer new opportunities for blockchain adoption where trust and reliability become critical. As the blockchain technology transitions from a stage of disillusionment to one of enlightenment, anticipation is building for its mainstream adoption, with focused endeavors towards removing adoption barriers across diverse business contexts, exemplified by studies included in this special issue on Blockchain Technology and Applications . In this paper, we first survey the current state of the blockchain technology and then highlight its potential for enhancing trust and accountability in emerging phenomena such as AI generated content (AIGC).

These communities take various forms, including social networking sites , brand communities, and virtual platforms, where individuals digitally connect and interact. This article suggests that users&#39; perceptions and beliefs about online communities are shaped by multiple selection mechanisms, which significantly influence decision-making processes related to community participation . This article is supported by two studies, with the second study building upon the first. Study 1 retrospectively explores selection mechanisms by drawing from network theory, social capital theory , and motivation theory. Through principal component analysis, these mechanisms are identified and categorized as community selection mechanisms. In Study 2, the focus shifts to examining whether these mechanisms lead to differences in community engagement behaviors. These behaviors encompass intentions to continue participating, knowledge sharing , and electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM). By comparing various communities based on their characteristics, the results reveal that each selection mechanism holds varying degrees of importance in influencing community engagement. For instance, content gratification is a key mechanism for the selection of professional and travel communities, but it lacks significance as a predictor for the game community. These findings not only advance our understanding of community selection mechanisms but also provides valuable insights for businesses looking to optimize their decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {Improving customer repurchase intention constitutes a key activity for maintaining sustainable business performance. Returning customers provide many economic and other benefits to businesses. In contrast, attracting new customers is a process that is associated with high costs. This work proposes a novel counterfactual explanations methodology that utilizes textual data from electronic word of mouth to recommend business changes that can improve customers&#39; repurchase behavior. Counterfactual explanation methods gained considerable attention because their logic aligns with human reasoning and the fact that they can recommend low-cost actions on how to turn an unfavorable outcome into a favorable. Most counterfactual explanation methods however recommend actions that can change the outcome of individual instances (i.e. one customer) rather than a group of instances. Therefore, this work proposes a multi-instance counterfactual explanation method that recommends optimum changes to an organization&#39;s practices/policies that increase repurchase intention for many customers or customer segments. The proposed methodology utilizes topic modeling to extract customer opinions from online reviews&#39; text and use topics as features to train a binary classifier that predicts customer revisit intention. Multi-instance counterfactual explanations are computed for all or different groups of non-revisiting customers, recommending optimum business changes that can increase revisit intention. The proposed methodology is empirically evaluated through a case study on the restaurant revisit problem and compared against a prominent alternative from the literature. The results show that the method has better performance to the alternative method and produces recommendations that are actionable and abide by the customer-repurchase literature.},

The results indicate a significant negative relationship between the facial attractiveness of doctors and the number of visits to their homepage by users. However, this relationship only holds true for male surgeons and female internal medicine doctors, not for female surgeons or male internal medicine doctors. These findings suggest the possible presence of gender-specialty bias in the influence of facial attractiveness on patients&#39; decision-making. To further investigate how facial attractiveness influences users&#39; inclination to choose a particular doctor, we develop our research model drawing upon the stereotype content and social role perspective. Through a laboratory experiment, we found that OHC users&#39; perceptions of doctors&#39; warmth and competence act as mediating factors in the relationship between facial attractiveness and user choice. Additionally, this relationship is influenced by stereotypical gender-specialty fit.},

Echoing this trend, we formulate a new shopping trip recommendation problem, which aims to recommend a shopping trip (i.e., a list of stores) that matches customer preferences and has appropriate trip lengths. To solve this problem, we develop a novel deep learning-enhanced global planning (DeepGP) approach featuring three methodological novelties. First, we introduce a new shopping intensity term based on deep neural networks to capture the variation of trip lengths specific to different shopping contexts. Second, we innovatively formulate the learning and optimization objectives in a consistent form by balancing the shopping choice likelihood and the shopping intensity likelihood, thus resolving the inconsistency issue encountered by prior global planning methods . Third, to overcome the computational challenge caused by the nonlinear shopping intensity term, we design a new exact and efficient solution technique based on piecewise linear transformations . Using a real-world offline shopping dataset, we empirically demonstrate the superior performances of our approach compared to representative benchmarks in offering more accurate and relevant shopping trip recommendations. Through a simulation, we show the capacity of our approach to attract and balance customer traffic in practical deployments. Overall, our research highlights the efficacy of combining shopping choices and shopping intensity in a consistent learning and optimization framework for offline shopping trip recommendations.},

We find that skill contributes significantly towards winnability in five ways. First, contestants performing well in the past do better in the present. Second, gaining more game experiences improves performance. Third, contestants who participated recently, tend to exhibit higher winnability. Fourth, selecting an appropriate contest type enhances winnability. Fifth, the large estimated signal-to-noise ratio indicates that the unobserved skill measured by a non-negative error has a much greater impact on winnability than the regular two-sided random shocks. These results are robust to varying specifications and subsets of data. Decision makers and regulators can use the model presented in the study to distinguish skill-dominant DFS from chance-dominant DFS.},

  abstract     = {Shapley values have become one of the go-to methods to explain complex models to end-users. They provide a model agnostic post-hoc explanation with foundations in game theory: what is the worth of a player (in machine learning, a feature value) in the objective function (the output of the complex machine learning model). One downside is that they always require outputs of the model when some features are missing. These are usually computed by taking the expectation over the missing features. This however introduces a non-trivial choice: do we condition on the unknown features or not? In this paper we examine this question and claim that they represent two different explanations which are valid for different end-users: one that explains the model and one that explains the model combined with the feature dependencies in the data. We propose a new algorithmic approach to combine both explanations, removing the burden of choice and enhancing the explanatory power of Shapley values, and show that it achieves intuitive results on simple problems. We apply our method to two real-world datasets and discuss the explanations. Finally, we demonstrate how our method is either equivalent or superior to state-to-of-art Shapley value implementations while simultaneously allowing for increased insight into the model-data structure.},

  abstract     = {An increasing number of merchants are using online platforms to promote their products; however, much is still unknown about how consumers behave in response to online promotions. This study investigates factors affecting consumers&#39; purchase intentions and purchase behaviors during online promotions. We classify consumers into two categories, one mainly affected by the time pressure of promotion and the other primarily subject to the effect of memory decay. We then propose an analytical model to capture the market demand during an online promotion. Our analytical result indicates that there exist four types of demand patterns during online promotions, i.e., U-shape, inverted U-shape, monotonically increasing, and monotonically decreasing. We subsequently explore factors that can affect the type of demand patterns, such as the product type (nondurable and durable goods), duration of the promotion, discount level, and product category. Our empirical analyses of real-world promotion and sales data from a B2C e-commerce platform validate the analytical results. The type of demand curves depends on the characteristics of the goods and promotions. For instance, the inverted U-shape demand curve appears only for nondurable consumer goods, whereas the U-shape curve exists only for durable consumer goods. Finally, in a series of counterfactual analyses based on the proposed model, we show how revenues change during an online promotion in response to varying parameters of promotions and derive some interesting observations. These findings provide important insights to online retailers and can help them better understand their consumers and optimize their product promotion strategies.},

We propose an ex-ante fraud risk index by adopting an ensemble learning approach and a theoretically grounded framework. Our ensemble learning model systematically examines the fraud process and deals effectively with the unique challenges in the financial fraud setting, which yields superior prediction performance. More importantly, we empirically examine the information content of our estimated ex-ante fraud risk from the perspective of operational efficiency. Our empirical results find that the estimated ex-ante fraud risk is negatively correlated with sustaining operational efficiency. This study redefines fraud detection as an ongoing endeavor rather than a retrospective event, thus enabling managers and stakeholders to reconsider their operation decisions and reshape their entire operation processes accordingly.},

At the course level, the combination of predictive analytics and self-regulation theory can help instructors determine the best study advice and allow learners to better self-regulate and determine how they want to learn. The best performing techniques are often black-box models that favor performance over interpretability and are heavily influenced by course contexts. In this study, we argue that explainable AI has the potential not only to uncover the reasons behind model decisions, but also to reveal their stability across contexts, effectively bridging the gap between predictive and explanatory learning analytics (LA). In contributing to decision support systems research, this study (1) leverages traditional techniques, such as concept drift and performance drift, to investigate the stability of student success prediction models over time; (2) uses Shapley Additive explanations in a novel way to explore the stability of extracted feature importance rankings generated for these models; (3) generates new insights that emerge from stable features across cohorts, enabling teachers to determine study advice. We believe this study makes a strong contribution to education research at large and expands the field of LA by augmenting the interpretability and explainability of prediction algorithms and ensuring their applicability in changing contexts.},

However, studies have rarely investigated the mechanism of irrational consumer behavior at the group level. To investigate the evolution of collective overreaction in dynamic online product diffusion networks, we employed a sequential multiple-methods approach. A conceptual model is constructed to capture the influence of social network dynamic evolution on individual irrationality. An agent-based model (ABM) under different network dynamic growth mechanisms is implemented and verified. The findings revealed the following. In external dynamic growth mechanisms, key opinion consumer (KOC) connection can lead to positive collective overreaction (i.e., the adoption rate of consumer groups spikes). This effect fades as the probability of KOC connection increases and stabilizes as the node change rate decreases. Random connection is prone to negative collective overreaction (i.e., a sudden and sharp decline in the adoption rate of consumer groups), and key opinion leader (KOL) connection exhibits both positive and negative collective overreaction. Increasing the edge change rate increases the frequency of negative collective overreaction in KOL connections. In internal dynamic growth mechanisms, KOL and KOC connections are prone to negative collective overreaction; increasing the edge change rate can reduce the frequency of negative collective overreaction in KOL overreaction, and an appropriate edge change rate can inhibit the emergence of negative collective overreaction in KOC connection. This research contributes to the area of internet product marketing and provides a new basic framework through which to combine psychology and the ABM.},

  abstract     = {Electronic health records (EHRs) are a valuable source of information that can aid in understanding a patient’s health condition and making informed healthcare decisions. However, modelling longitudinal EHRs with heterogeneous information is a challenging task. Although recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are frequently utilized in artificial intelligence (AI) models for capturing longitudinal data , their explanatory capabilities are limited. Predictive clustering stands as the most recent advancement within this domain, offering interpretable indications at the cluster level for predicting disease risk. Nonetheless, the challenge of determining the optimal number of clusters has put a brake on the widespread application of predictive clustering for disease risk prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-parametric predictive clustering-based risk prediction model that integrates the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) with predictive clustering via neural networks . To enhance the model’s interpretability , we integrate attention mechanisms that enable the capture of local-level evidence in addition to the cluster-level evidence provided by predictive clustering. The outcome of this research is the development of a multi-level explainable artificial intelligence (AI) model. We evaluated the proposed model on two real-world datasets and demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing longitudinal EHR information for disease risk prediction. Moreover, the model successfully produced interpretable evidence to bolster its predictions.},

Consequently, this approach mines meaningful team compositions from historical data and guides strategic team formation accordingly. We conduct empirical studies using authentic data from our partner company in the real estate brokerage industry. The findings reveal that teams that adhere to our model&#39;s recommendations achieve an average percentage improvement of 153.1% to 156.5% higher than the benchmark teams, particularly when recruiting one or two members in their actual SE during the post-formation period. We further disclose the mechanism underlying this improvement from the perspective of changes in team compositions.

Effective estimates of at-risk patients can facilitate timely therapeutic interventions and thereby enhance patient outcomes and well-being. We develop a novel, meta-path, attention-based deep learning method to identify at-risk cirrhosis patients. The proposed method integrates complex patient–medication interactions, essential patient–patient and medication–medication links, and the combined effects of medication and comorbidity to support downstream predictions. An empirical test of the proposed method&#39;s predictive utilities, relative to nine existing methods, uses a large sample of real-world cirrhosis patient data. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method can identify at-risk patients more effectively than all the benchmarks. The current research has important implications for clinical decision support and patient management, and it can facilitate patient self-management and treatment compliance too.},

We find a circular interaction between firms&#39; overall ratings and TFP. Additionally, we explore employees&#39; perspectives on compensation and work-life balance. Our results indicate that compensation ratings negatively impact TFP, whereas work-life balance ratings are solely influenced by the lagged self. Finally, we observe that the interaction between Glassdoor firm ratings and TFP varies across industries.

In this paper, we extend hybrid segmented models for customer churn prediction by incorporating powerful models that can capture non-linearities. To ensure the interpretability of such segmented hybrid models, we introduce a novel model-agnostic approach that extends SHAP. We extensively benchmark the proposed methods on 14 customer churn datasets on their predictive performance. The interpretability aspect of the new model-agnostic approach for interpreting hybrid segmented models is illustrated using a case study . Our contributions to decision making literature are threefold. First, we introduce new hybrid segmented models as powerful tools for decision makers to boost predictive performance. Second, we provide insights in the relative predictive performance by an extensive benchmarking study that compares the new hybrid segmented methods with their base models and existing hybrid models. Third, we propose a model-agnostic tool for segmented hybrid models that provide decision makers with a tool to gain insights for any hybrid segmented model and illustrate it on a case study.

  abstract     = {Patient experience surveys have become a key source of evidence for supporting decision-making and continuous quality improvement within healthcare services. To harness free-text feedback collected as part of these surveys for additional insights, text analytics methods are increasingly employed when the data collected is not amenable to traditional qualitative analysis due to volume. However, while text analytics techniques offer good predictive capabilities, they have limited explanatory features often required in formal decision-making contexts, such as programme monitoring or evaluation. To overcome these limitations, this study integrates computational text and predictive modelling as part of a Computational Grounded Theory method to determine the effect of quality gaps in care dimensions and their prioritisation from free-text feedback. The feedback was collected as part of a national survey to support decisions on continuous improvement in Maternity Services in Ireland. Our approach enables (1) operationalising the service quality lexicon in the context of maternity care to explain the effect of quality gaps in care dimensions on overall satisfaction from free-text comments; and (2) extending the service quality lexicon with two organisational and political decision-making concepts: “Salience” and “Valence”, for prioritising perceived quality gaps. These methodological affordances enable the extension of service quality theory to explicitly support the prioritisation of improvement decisions which before now required additional decision frameworks. Results show that tangibles-, process-, and reliability-related care issues have the highest importance in our study context. We also find that hospital contexts partly determine the relative importance of gaps in care dimensions.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive framework for expert-augmented supervised feature selection, addressing pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing aspects of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). As part of pre-processing XAI, we introduce the Probabilistic Solution Generator through the Information Fusion (PSGIF) algorithm, leveraging ensemble techniques to enhance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Balancing explainability and prediction accuracy, we formulate two multi-objective optimization models that empower expert(s) to specify a maximum acceptable sacrifice percentage. This approach enhances explainability by reducing the number of selected features and prioritizing those considered more relevant from the domain expert&#39;s perspective. This contribution aligns with in-processing XAI, incorporating expert opinions into the feature selection process as a multi-objective problem. Traditional feature selection techniques lack the capability to efficiently search the solution space considering our explainability-focused objective function. To overcome this, we leverage the Genetic Algorithm (GA), a powerful metaheuristic algorithm , optimizing its parameters through Bayesian optimization . For post-processing XAI, we present the Posterior Ensemble Algorithm (PEA), estimating the predictive power of features. PEA enables a nuanced comparison between objective and subjective importance, identifying features as underrated, overrated, or appropriately rated. We evaluate the performance of our proposed GAs on 16 publicly available datasets, focusing on prediction accuracy in a single objective setting. Moreover, we test our multi-objective model on a classification dataset to show the applicability and effectiveness of our framework. Overall, this paper provides a holistic and nuanced approach to explainable feature selection, offering decision-makers a comprehensive understanding of feature importance.},

To that end, we construct a valence-based measure of incidental emotion using BERTweet&#39;s sentiment analysis and empirically investigate the association between collective incidental emotion toward the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. stock market. We employ multivariate time series autoregressive models to test the relationship between emotion polarity and stock market returns or trading volumes. The results reveal that societal sentiment toward the pandemic has a significant effect on the returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500. In contrast, the macro-level emotion does not significantly affect the return for NASDAQ 100. The findings also suggest a significant association between incidental emotion and trading volumes. We conduct a battery of sensitivity tests that further support our conjecture. The study underscores the robust role of incidental emotion in investment decision-making, highlighting its significance as a distinctive feature that should be incorporated into financial decision support systems.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of enterprise social media (ESM) allows enterprises to develop employee improvisation ability for effective decision-making in various emergencies. However, it remains unclear how the use of ESM by employees affects their ability to improvise. Based on the job demands-resources model and Kahn&#39;s psychological conditions framework, this study constructs a theoretical model capturing two types of ESM usage—work-related and social-related—and examines their impact on employee improvisation ability. Through the analysis of 307 paired data collected from multi-wave and multi-source questionnaires using Smart-PLS software, the results show that both work-related and social-related ESM use can promote employees&#39; psychological meaningfulness, availability, and safety, thus further stimulating employees&#39; improvisation ability. ESM policies only significantly moderated the effects of work-related ESM use on the three psychological conditions of employees. Moreover, there are significant differences in the intensity of the influence of the two types of ESM uses on the psychological conditions of employees. This study not only enriches and promotes the existing research on ESM usage , psychological conditions, and employee improvisation ability but also helps enterprise management effectively guide employees to use ESM to promote their improvisation ability.},

This paper presents a new web-based Decision Support System for Sectorization (D3S). D3S is designed to solve sectorization problems in various areas, such as school and health districting,planning sales territories and maintenance operations zones, or political districting. Due to its generic design, D3S bridges the gap between sectorization problems and a state-of-the-art decision support tool.

  abstract     = {Pretrained language models (PLMs) are frequently employed in Decision Support Systems (DSSs) due to their strong performance. However, recent studies have revealed that these PLMs can exhibit social biases, leading to unfair decisions that harm vulnerable groups. Sensitive information contained in sentences from training data is the primary source of bias. Previously proposed debiasing methods based on contrastive disentanglement have proven highly effective. In these methods, PLMs can disentangle sensitive information from non-sensitive information in sentence embedding, and then adapts non-sensitive information only for downstream tasks. Such approaches hinge on having good sentence embedding as input. However, recent research found that most non-fine-tuned PLMs such as BERT produce poor sentence embedding. Disentangling based on these embedding will lead to unsatisfactory debiasing results. Taking a finer-grained perspective, we propose PCFR (Prompt and Contrastive-based Fair Representation), a novel disentanglement method integrating prompt and contrastive learning to debias PLMs. We employ prompt learning to represent information as sensitive embedding and subsequently apply contrastive learning to contrast these information embedding rather than the sentence embedding. PCFR encourages similarity among different non-sensitive information embedding and dissimilarity between sensitive and non-sensitive information embedding. We mitigate gender and religion biases in two prominent PLMs, namely BERT and GPT-2. To comprehensively assess debiasing efficacy of PCFR, we employ multiple fairness metrics. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of PCFR compared to representative baseline methods. Additionally, when applied to specific downstream decision tasks, PCFR not only shows strong de-biasing capability but also significantly preserves task performance.},

This gap keeps decision-makers (i.e., firms and policy-makers) in the dark regarding how game escapism affects gameplay, thus hindering effective decision-making. To fill this gap, uses and gratification theory is applied to build a model for explaining the mechanism underlying the influence of game escapism and telepresence on game experience and game use. We collect 1347 online gamer responses with which to test the model. The results indicate that game escapism improves all game experiences, while only enjoyment and concentration increase game use. Moreover, telepresence strengthens the impact of game escapism on enjoyment, concentration, and fantasy. Our findings offer insights for decision-makers, enabling them to leverage game mechanisms to either provide or negate the impact of game escapism, thus changing game use.},

Then we verified the different effects of two host description strategies on each of consumer behaviors based on a panel dataset from Airbnb. Positive description and honest description have a positive impact on room booking and consumer satisfaction respectively. Room price moderates the relationship between host descriptions and consumer behaviors. A highly positive description strategy can promote bookings for high-priced listings but decrease satisfaction. The honest description strategy has a positive effect on the bookings of low-priced listings. This study contributes to tourism literature and property hosts in practice.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews play a crucial role in shaping buyers&#39; purchase decisions. However, previous research has highlighted the existence of self-selection biases among buyers who contribute to reviews, which in turn leads to biased distributions of review ratings. This research aims to explore the further influences of self-selection bias on buyer satisfaction through agent-based modeling, considering two product differentiations: search and experience differentiation, as well as vertical and horizontal differentiation. Our findings reveal that self-selection bias can have varying positive and negative effects on the usefulness of online reviews in suggesting product quality (i.e., review utility) to buyers, thus affecting buyer satisfaction. While self-selection bias tends to decrease review utility in most scenarios, interestingly, it can also increase review utility by enabling a “screening” function of online reviews in addition to its normal “measuring” function. We also find that the varying effects of self-selection bias on buyer satisfaction are contingent upon the type of products under scrutiny and the interaction of different types of self-selection bias. This research makes valuable contributions to the existing literature on online reviews by introducing a novel theory to explain the effects of self-selection bias on buyer satisfaction.},

Recently, a new type of domestic travel has emerged, namely domestic overseas-like travel experiences. These experiences are attractive to travellers who have a preference for exotic locations but no desire to travel internationally. Existing travel recommendation systems were not designed for such applications, nor do they have the relevant ability to recommend domestic overseas-like travel experiences to support travel decision making . To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the development of a recommendation model based on the visual content of photos for domestic overseas-like travel experiences and a prototype application. The application uses the latest advancement in computer vision — the concept model — to learn high-level concepts in an overseas travel destination photo collection to identify similar domestic travel experiences. We demonstrate the usability of the prototype application with a large-scale data set of approximately 479,000 travel photos taken in several countries and evaluate its utility and efficacy through four focus groups with target users.},

In view of the recent Responsible Artificial Intelligence Strategy published by the United States Department of Defense, this research leverages interpretable and explainable machine learning methods to create traceable and equitable models that may be responsibly and reliably governed. These models are used to regress candidates’ average merit assignment selection system scores based on information available for selection and prior to training. More specifically, using data provided by the USAF from 2010 to 2018, this paper develops and analyzes multiple interpretable models based on Gaussian Bayesian networks , as well as multiple black-box models rendered explainable by SHAP values and conformal prediction . A preferred pair of interpretable and explainable models is selected and embedded within a DSS for USAF pilot candidate selection boards: the Air Force Pilot Applicant Selection System. The utilization of this DSS is explored, the analyses it enables are discussed, and relevant USAF policymaking issues are examined.},

Building on formal concept analysis (FCA), the starting point of the present work is that different ways to categorize a given set of objects exist, which depend on the choice of the sets of features used to classify them, and different such sets of features may yield better or worse categorizations, relative to the task at hand. In their turn, the (a priori) choice of a particular set of features over another might be subjective and express a certain epistemic stance (e.g. interests, relevance, preferences) of an agent or a group of agents, namely, their interrogative agenda . In the present paper, we represent interrogative agendas as sets of features, and explore and compare different ways to categorize objects w.r.t. different sets of features (agendas). We first develop a simple unsupervised FCA-based algorithm for outlier detection which uses categorizations arising from different agendas. We then present a supervised meta-learning algorithm to learn suitable (fuzzy) agendas for categorization as sets of features with different weights or masses. We combine this meta-learning algorithm with the unsupervised outlier detection algorithm to obtain a supervised outlier detection algorithm . We show that these algorithms perform at par with commonly used algorithms for outlier detection on commonly used datasets in outlier detection. These algorithms provide both local and global explanations of their results.},

Findings reveal that explainable artificial intelligence enhances transparency, thereby significantly contributing to agile decision-making for improving cyber resilience during supply chain cyberattacks. Moreover, we conduct a post hoc analysis using text analysis to explore the themes present in tweets discussing explainable artificial intelligence in decision support systems. The results indicate a predominantly positive attitude towards explainable artificial intelligence within these systems. Furthermore, the text analysis reveals two main themes that emphasize the importance of transparency, explainability, and interpretability in explainable artificial intelligence.},

What is more, IS increasingly offer to assume the rights and responsibilities for a task not only in response to user prompts (i.e., user-invoked delegation) but also without user prompts (i.e., IS-invoked delegation). Yet, little is known about whether, how, and why users agree to delegation when they are asked by the IS in contrast to when they self-initiate the delegation. Drawing on self-affirmation theory, we investigate user acceptance of IS- versus user-invoked delegation in two complementary online experiments in software development. Our core findings reveal that IS-invoked (vs. user-invoked) delegation increases users&#39; perceived self-threat and thus decreases their willingness to accept delegation. This threatening effect is larger the less (vs. more) the user perceives control after the potential delegation. Taken together, we uncover defensive user responses to IS-invoked delegation. Furthermore, we shed light on the underlying and moderating mechanisms representing the reasons and contextual features that explain and mitigate these defensive measures. These findings have significant implications for IS designers seeking to improve user-IS collaboration and outcomes by employing IS-invoked delegation.},

However, underlying these two cognitive dispositions of reviews, are discrepancies that make it difficult for a helpful review to simultaneously satisfy both of them. To resolve the discrepancies, this present study, drawn on cognitive tuning theory, proposes and validates the intertwining effect of cognitive dispositions (length and readability) and affective dispositions (joy and anger expression) in judging review helpfulness. Based on analysis of heterogeneous hotel review data, our findings indicate joy expression in reviews, decreased the positive impact of review length on review helpfulness, while enhancing the positive impact of review readability on helpfulness. Anger expression in reviews, shows reverse effects, enhancing the positive impact of review length on helpfulness.

Prior studies in answer quality assessment usually focus on ranking candidate answers for the sake of askers but show little value for the answerers. Moreover, existing work employs textural aspects and image quantity to predict answer quality, but semantic information inherent in answer images is rarely considered. To bridge the research gap, we designed an artifact, answer advisor (AA), to help answerers produce well-received answers. Our AA uses an image-text coherence measure that is obtained by integrating topic modeling with a deep learning approach . On a real-world dataset, the proposed measure can reduce the prediction error of answer popularity before the answer is actually posted on the Q&amp;A site by 38.12%.},

However, low-quality comments pose significant challenges for traditional wisdom extraction algorithms, such as prediction polls. Therefore, to extract the wisdom of online crowds effectively, we propose a novel artificial prediction market that can dynamically filter out low-quality comments using the market mechanism. Unlike traditional prediction markets where real human traders participate in contract trading, traders in the proposed market, referred to as artificial human traders, are constructed with posters’ online comments. We constructed artificial human traders using the comment data from the Eastmoney stock forum. Then, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed market in predicting the price movements of the constituent stocks in the Shanghai Stock Exchange 50 Index. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed market excels in extracting the wisdom of crowds from online communities for stock price movement predictions and conducting investment portfolios based on these prediction results. Additionally, to investigate the factors contributing to the superior performance of the proposed artificial prediction market, we compare it with the prediction poll, a well-known opinion aggregation algorithm. The results indicate that the artificial prediction market performs better in assessing the quality of comments compared with the prediction poll.},

However, the impact of VLSPs on purchase intention and underlying mechanisms remains unexplored. Therefore, focusing on VLSPs&#39; technical features is crucial for designing and developing their functionalities. This study addresses the research gaps by developing a theoretical model based on the theory of interactive media effects (TIME) to investigate the influence of VLSPs&#39; technical features on customers&#39; purchase intentions. The technical features of VLSPs are reflected in virtual streamers (anthropomorphism) and virtual live scenes (media richness) levels, respectively. Our results indicate that psychological distance plays a mediating role between anthropomorphism (full mediation) and customer engagement , as well as between media richness (partial mediation) and customer engagement in a survey of 299 VLSP users. Meanwhile, customer engagement is found to have a (full) mediating effect between psychological distance and purchase intention. Besides, we verified the chain mediating role of psychological distance and customer engagement between technical features (anthropomorphism and media richness) and purchase intention. Our research delineates effective technical improvement guidelines for practitioners in the VLSP domain. By elucidating the impact results and mechanisms of VLSPs&#39; technical characteristics on user psychology and behavioral intention, our study offers valuable insights for those involved in VLSP development and implementation.},

Using an exhaustive dataset from TripAdvisor that includes 315,948 reviews and 199,926 managerial responses from 461 hotels spanning from 2011 to 2019, we found that a high level of language style matching between responses and reviews leads to an increase in subsequent online consumer ratings. Notably, the effect of language style matching on future ratings is more pronounced for hotels with poor online review ratings and inferior classes.

A nuanced approach that considers different aspects of these stories (e.g., the presence of inflated claims, suppression of risks associated with the treatment or withholding other essential information) is more appropriate for evaluation. Second, evaluating the quality and completeness of the arguments in the stories is costly and requires expertise in the relevant medical field, which laypeople do not have. To address this problem, in this study, we train different machine learning models on multi-criteria expert evaluations for health news stories about new medical treatments and compare their performance. We then compare the machine learning model evaluations to laypeople evaluations. We find that machine learning models overall outperform laypeople, who have a propensity to overestimate the comprehensiveness of the claims. Our machine learning models employ multi-criteria evaluation, which is different from most previous studies that evaluate news stories on whether they are true or false.

Where existing research has treated these as separate stages, we present an end-to-end integrated decision-making framework to connect these two stages and show that an integrated system would improve performance across diverse measures through improved lane generation and optimization. Our research offers a new design framework for backhaul collaboration that integrates spatial analytics methods into an optimization model, with improvements in financial, environmental, and social benefits . We use fine-grained GPS telematics data collected from two large logistics companies and evaluate potential lanes using spatial analytics techniques .

  abstract     = {The proliferation of mobile technologies have facilitated the popularity of mobile sharing economy (MSE). However, extant literature that used sufficient logic has fallen short in explaining this phenomenon as the findings are insufficient to explain the necessary conditions that activate users&#39; intention and actual usage. The purpose of this study is to identify the enablers (must-have factors) and enhancers (should-have factors) of consumers&#39; intention and actual use of mobile sharing economy. A must-have factor is needed to initialize the effect of independent variables while a should-have factor enhances the effect. Drawing from the extended valence framework, a combined SEM-ANN-NCA analysis is used to examine users&#39; actual adoption of MSE. The application of the “sufficiency logic” and “necessity logic” and the AI and machine learning-based ANN approach enables us to ascertain the linear-nonlinear relationships and the enablers and enhancers in mobile sharing economy. The findings show that mobile ease of use is a sufficient and necessary condition for mobile usefulness while trust is a sufficient and necessary condition for epistemic benefit. Mobile usefulness and trust are the sufficient and necessary conditions for behavioral intention while behavioral intention is the sufficient and necessary condition for actual use. Trust is a sufficient but unnecessary condition for convenience and psychological risk. Epistemic benefit and psychological risk are sufficient but not necessary conditions for behavioral intention. Education is a sufficient but not necessary condition for actual use.

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) connects heterogeneous sensing devices with servers under the support of the network to monitor intelligent communication and real-time data transmission. The system caters well to the needs of medical services and also provides convenience for telemedicine. Many IoT-based solutions have been proposed for medical application scenarios. However, the unpredictable nature of communication links and device failures may lead to challenges in setting effective security policies for controlling these devices. Trust management has emerged as an ideal solution that can implement a dynamic management approach and regulate node connection requests. While centralized architectures require only a central node and relatively few devices, they are not suitable for large-scale medical facilities. In contrast, decentralized approaches based on blockchain technology have recently emerged as feasible solutions for IoT practices. Nevertheless, these decentralized approaches are vulnerable to potential attacks such as defaming honest nodes or improving the trust degrees of malicious nodes, which can compromise trust degrees within the system. This paper designs a blockchain-enabled trust management method for medical services based on the IoT, aiming to prevent malicious nodes from sending false trust levels. The proposed trust assessment model utilizes referees&#39; direct experience and indirect feedback to recommend trustworthy medical services. The presented model provides a certain level of security against various types of attacks including malicious attacks , benevolent attacks, and on-off attacks. Experimental results illustrate that the model is robust and effective.},

  abstract     = {Transaction fees are a crucial revenue source for miners in public and consortium blockchains . However, while public blockchains have additional revenue streams, transaction fees serve as the primary income for miners in consortium blockchains formed by various financial institutions . These miners allocate different levels of computing resources to process transactions and earn corresponding fees. Nonetheless, relying solely on transaction fees can lead to significant volatility and encourage non-standard mining behaviors, thereby posing threats to the blockchain’s security and integrity. Despite previous attempts to mitigate the impact of transaction fees on illicit mining behaviors, a comprehensive solution to this vulnerability is yet to be established. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies to effectively minimize block incentive volatility. Our solution implements a Verkle tree-based storage mechanism to reduce bandwidth consumption. Moreover, to configure the DTS strategies, we evaluate several optimization algorithms and formulate the challenge as a Vehicle Routing Problem . Our experiments conducted using historical transactions from Bitcoin and remittance data from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China reveal that the strategy focusing on time-based transaction incorporation priority, while excluding a designated space for small-fee transactions, as discovered by the gradient-based optimizer algorithm, proves most effective in reducing volatility. Hence, the DTS strategy can sustain stable block incentives irrespective of transaction types or user bidding behavior. Furthermore, the inclusion of higher-fee transactions, often smaller in size, can alleviate propagation delays and the occurrence of forks.},

Using a simple model, we show that the number of miners could be negatively (positively) related to the expected rewards if miners with low-operating costs also have less (more) severe financing constraints. We characterize the possibility of miners with low-operating (high-operating) costs facing less (more) severe financing constraints as large-size (small-size) miners. The empirical evidence supports the model&#39;s large- and small-size miner characterization prediction. The negative association between the number of miners and expected rewards is attributable to Bitcoin&#39;s exchange rate. Collectively, our evidence suggests that even though the Bitcoin system is designed as an egalitarian system, it is likely to evolve into a near-centralized system because of economic forces.},

  abstract     = {In times of rapid and unpredictable developments, companies experience significant volatility in capacity utilization. Virtual capacity exchange platforms help to mitigate this challenge by exchanging capacities with anonymous participants in market-like peer-to-peer networks. However, its efficiency is hindered by behavioral uncertainties, including a lack of inter-organizational trust in other participants. To leverage the potential of such exchange platforms, this paper reports on a Design Science Research project aiming to derive and validate design principles for establishing trust in inter-organizational capacity exchange in two design iterations . Using blockchain technology, we instantiate six design principles into an artifact and perform experimental evaluations to investigate their effect on perceived trust. Our paper contributes to research and practice by identifying and applying prescriptive design knowledge and advancing our understanding of how to design trust-enabling inter-organizational systems. The originality lies within the empirical investigation of how and why different design principle combinations can be established through blockchain technology as one of the promising approaches for establishing trust. In doing this, we also disclose future pathways for IS and blockchain researchers and practitioners.},

There is a lack of evidence regarding herding in blockchain technology in general and its potential effect on blockchain application platforms in particular. In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users&#39; herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users&#39; herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts.},

Meme tourism involves new forms of visit intention, where individuals are motivated to visit a destination by viral memes, and once on location, they recreate and re-enact elements of the meme before sharing the results via social media. Such use of memes in the tourism context – often considered as a casual reflection of individuality, pop culture, and a new way of communicating in social media – raises the question of how to influence and nurture travelers&#39; behaviors and actions during an actual trip. To empirically test the ability of memes to induce specific actions during visits, this study developed an integrated model using affordance as an overarching theoretical framework to provide insights into the actualization of two types of meme affordances – Imitation and Self-presentation – during tourism visits. With survey data collected from individual tourists using a crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), this research found that the relationship between both affordances (imitation and self-presentation) and travel intention was significant. The results of the study offer alternative explanations of the possible psychological influence of memes in inducing physical behaviors, which adds insight to behavioral research fields such as IS. Both the research and the practical implications of the results are discussed.},

Previous studies on FDP have mostly focused on using financial indicators and periodic reports. Compared with periodic reports, current reports disclose major events in a timelier manner. But leveraging the information in current reports involves the critical challenges of capturing the complex semantics and measuring the importance of heterogeneous events. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning method, a user-response-guided deep attention network (URGDAN), to predict financial distress using current reports. In the proposed method, we construct a deep learning architecture to integrate financial indicators, current report texts, and user responses. URGDAN leverages the user responses to current reports to guide the semantic feature representation of the reports, it also identifies event information that has a significant correlation with company financial distress. Empirical evaluation shows that URGDAN significantly improves predictive performance and can accurately determine the importance of different current reports.

Estimating INP competitiveness before sale helps enterprise managers adjust their strategies effectively and in a timely manner to ensure successful INP launches. However, a lack of historical evaluation information challenges the estimation. Given that INPs are updates of existing products, massive user-generated content (UGC) regarding existing products and the new product launch provides an appropriate data source for estimating INPs&#39; competitiveness. Therefore, this study proposes a method for estimating the competitiveness of INP using UGC. First, the INP product attributes are classified as non-updated or updated. For the former, existing products containing the same attribute values are used as references, and their reference values are measured based on the time and price of the first sale. UGC regarding the launch of INPs serves as a data source for the latter. Sentiment analysis is performed on the UGC concerning product attributes to obtain the sentiment tendency and sentiment intensity for constructing an intuitive fuzzy number, which represents INP&#39;s attribute performance. INP&#39;s product performance is estimated by considering attribute weights determined by customer attention. INP&#39;s competitiveness in the market environment is then estimated by comparing its product performance with that of competing products. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a mobile phone , and its effectiveness and applicability are verified.},

We argue that social capital resulting from prior knowledge transfer network interactions impact answer quality. Moreover, we also argue that the relationship between social capital and answer quality is moderated by the complexity of the knowledge transferred. Hence, our models draw from multiple related research streams: online communities, knowledge transfer, social capital, and gamification . These models are empirically tested using data from Stack Overflow (SO), a popular online Q&amp;A community that aids social coding.

Utilizing a unique dataset in a natural experimental setting, this study employed the difference-in-differences method to contrast firms&#39; investment decisions related to IT and cybersecurity in states in which such laws had been enacted and those in states without such laws, both before and after their enactment. We found that firms with different operational experiences react to the enactment of the anti-phishing laws in different ways. We further demonstrate the moderating roles of the industry risk landscape and IT capability. Specifically, firms with high-IT increased investments in both IT and cybersecurity while the risk landscape stimulated investments in cybersecurity only. This suggests that the risk landscape facilitates sensitivity to the immediate risk signaled by enactment of the laws, and IT capability further enables the alignment between IT investments and security objectives.

Moreover, extant literature largely focuses on predictive performance as an evaluation criterion. To find a better balance between predictive performance and interpretability though, the current study investigates the beneficial impact of segmentation-based modelling by benchmarking the logit leaf model (LLM) which is based on LR and decision trees . By a large experimental setup using a real-life credit scoring data set containing 65,536 active customers, we find that LLM is a viable classifier over its constituent parts, i.e., LR and decision trees , and is very competitive to state-of-the-art credit decision making techniques (neural networks, support vector machines , bagging, boosting and random forests) on three evaluation metrics (AUC, top-decile lift and profit). Furthermore, we show its extraordinary interpretability capacities by proposing a new visualization based on the LLM output. In sum, the excellence of the LLM as a classifier for credit decision making problems stems from its ability to combine strong predictive performance with interpretable insights that in turn can inform managerial decisions.},

However, the gap between scientific investigation and practical decision-making poses a significant challenge in achieving sustainability, particularly in endorheic regions. Addressing this challenge requires the translation of scientific outcomes into available decision-making information. In this study, we propose a sustainable decision-making methodology, namely, decision rehearsal, that has four stages: the scientification of decision-making problems, the politicization of scientific knowledge, the translation of scientific findings into decision-making information, and the translation of decision-making information into policy action. Based on this theoretical framework, an ensemble artifact, referred to as the River Basin Sustainable Development Decision Support System (RSDSS), was designed, built and evaluated from a design science research perspective to address a class of sustainability problems in endorheic basins. This system integrates a watershed-integrated model, disaggregated sustainable development goals (SDGs), localized shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), and a sustainability assessment model, which can assist decision- and policy-makers in more deeply understand the impacts of different policy assumptions on the interactions between human and natural systems and watershed sustainability. Some related RSDSS cases are discussed to demonstrate the ability of the RSDSS to resolve complex watershed problems, which implies that the RSDSS can promote sustainable river basin management .},

Inquiries into this subject are crucial to understanding human decision-making processes as in the era of artificial intelligence , algorithms are increasingly being integrated into decision-making. To contribute to this evolving field, this study examines three factors that might play significant roles in enhancing trust in algorithms: familiarity with algorithms, familiarity with tasks, and familiarity with algorithm performance. Drawing upon prior studies, a conceptual model was developed and empirically tested using a scenario study. Data on 327 individuals showed a strong positive association between familiarity with algorithms and trust in algorithms. In contrast, task familiarity appeared to have no significant influence on trust. Trust, in turn, was identified as a key driver of algorithm appreciation. The study also revealed the moderating role of familiarity with algorithm performance in the relationship between familiarity with algorithms and trust in algorithms. Post hoc analysis highlighted that trust fully mediates the relationship between algorithm familiarity and algorithm appreciation. The study underscores the significance of algorithm familiarity and performance transparency in shaping trust in algorithms. The study contributes theoretically by offering important insights about the influences of different forms of familiarity on trust and practically by prescribing practical guidelines to enhance algorithm appreciation.},

Building on signaling theory of portfolios, we examine how the acoustic characteristics of a video creator and the signals of video quantity affect the number of likes a video creator receives and the change in the number of the creator&#39;s followers. Using a longitudinal dataset obtained from Bilibili through automated speech recognition analytics and text analysis approach, econometrics models are employed to test the research model. Findings indicate that loudness variability of a video creator significantly increases the number of likes the creator receives, and exerts a positive effect on the change in the number of the creator&#39;s followers. In contrast, vocal pitch has a significant positive impact on the number of likes but a significant negative impact on the change in the number of followers. Results further suggest that a video creator&#39;s performance varies according to the signals of video quantity, i.e., the number of weekly published videos and the average length of videos. Our results could offer theoretical contributions and practical insights for video creators to enhance their performance by adjusting the acoustic characteristics and the signals of video quantity wisely.},

  abstract     = {Although artificial intelligence (AI) outperforms humans in many tasks, research suggests some consumers are still averse to having AI perform tasks on their behalf. Informed by the literature of customer decision-making process, we propose and show that consumer autonomy is a significant predictor of customers&#39; decision to adopt AI in the purchasing context. Across three experiments, we found that the delegation of purchasing tasks to AI, which restricts choice and decision dimensions of consumers&#39; perceived autonomy, reduces the likelihood of AI adoption. Our results show that the effects of choice and decision autonomy on AI adoption holds even when product choice evaluation is complex. We also found that identity-relevant consumption moderates this relationship, such that it interacts with choice and decision autonomy. Specifically, despite lacking choice and decision autonomy, those who identify strongly with a given activity are more likely to use an AI-enabled app to purchase the product needed to perform this activity. With these insights into when and why consumers are likely to use AI-enabled technology, firms might effectively increase its adoption.},

While many studies have explored this topic in a B2C context, there has been little attention given to the unique features of B2B inside sales. To address this gap, we developed and empirically validated a buyer&#39;s intention to purchase (BIP) model that integrates the B2B purchase decision-making process and buying behavior theories. Using PLS-SEM analysis on data collected from 126 B2B buyers, we found that trust in sellers and connection flexibility are crucial factors in determining buyers&#39; intention to purchase. Specifically, these factors influence the purchase intention via appointment and contact willingness during different phases of the B2B purchase process. Additionally, our multigroup analyses suggest that buyers&#39; demographic and firmographic attributes affect the purchase decision-making process in different ways. By identifying different groups of buyers and their distinctive needs and preferences, our findings inform more effective approaching and selling strategies. This study contributes to both academic and sales practices by providing critical insights into the factors that influence the B2B inside sales process, which ultimately improve sales performance.},

  abstract     = {A central problem in business concerns the optimal allocation of limited resources to a set of available tasks, where the payoff of these tasks is inherently uncertain. Typically, such problems are solved using a classification framework, where task outcomes are predicted given a set of characteristics. Then, resources are allocated to the tasks predicted to be the most likely to succeed. We argue, however, that using classification to address task uncertainty is inherently suboptimal as it does not take into account the available capacity. We present a novel solution that directly optimizes the assignment&#39;s expected profit given limited, stochastic capacity. This is achieved by optimizing a specific instance of the net discounted cumulative gain, a commonly used class of metrics in learning to rank. We demonstrate that our new method achieves higher expected profit and expected precision compared to a classification approach for a wide variety of application areas .},

This obstructs the detection of fake reviews and reviewers. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network-based framework for detecting spammers, who originate fake reviews in discussion forums to capture information from different social network combinations in various subgraphs. These subgraphs include a complete social context graph, homogeneous user–user subgraph, and heterogeneous user–post subgraph. A novel two-stage architecture with focal loss was designed to create a training model. This model can be applied to solve the issue of imbalance data classification . The proposed framework was applied to evaluate a ground truth dataset collected from an actual fraudulent review event on a discussion forum. The experimental results show that this aggregate social context representation method can be effectively applied to detect fake reviewers.},

Facing diverse audiences and intense competition, SMIs who differ in their skills and performance levels struggle with two challenging trade-offs in video production decision: (1) trade-off between reinforcement-seeking (i.e., reinforcing a specialized content style to play it safe) and variation-seeking (i.e., varying content style to leave the comfort zone), and (2) trade-off between early and late strategic action. This study explores the sweet spot of reinforcement- and variation-seeking by proposing a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to maximize SMIs&#39; influence on audiences on SVPs. Leveraging a series of musical videos produced by SMIs, our findings show that low-performing SMIs benefit more from variation-seeking than from reinforcement-seeking. By contrast, the influence of high-performing SMIs on audiences could be maximized by reinforcement- or variation-seeking, depending on the SMI type. High-performing SMIs&#39; variation-seeking (should it be taken) is encouraged earlier than later over a planning horizon.

An extensive dataset was assembled, comprising 4984 product introduction video segments from 768 TikTok livestreaming rooms in China, along with 1.29 million bullet screen comments and 513,551 viewers&#39; information. Employing advanced multimodal data processing technologies, the study extracted anchors&#39; (livestreaming hosts) multimodal emotion features. The empirical findings demonstrate the significant impact of anchors&#39; emotions, encompassing body movements, facial expressions, voices, and conversation contents, on the arousal and valence of group emotions, where the latter exhibit opposing effects on instant order cancellation behavior. This research establishes the paramount roles of anchor and group emotions in viewers&#39; instant order cancellation behaviors, lending credence to the epistemological applicability of emotional contagion theory in the context of LSE.

How to recommend live streams to viewers to improve user experience is the core business problem of live streaming platforms. On such platforms, viewers frequently change live streams to watch in each session for the enjoyment of the watching process. Live interaction along with streaming, which enables broadcasters and viewers to better connect with each other, is a core feature of live streaming and plays important roles in viewers&#39; watching behaviors. How to model the changing process of viewer preference during each watching behavior and capture the influence of live interaction is key for understanding viewer behaviors and making effective recommendations of live streams but has not been well studied in the literature. To address this research gap, we incorporate user behavior theory into data driven modeling method and propose an interaction-aware predictive framework for live stream recommendation. Specifically, we develop a novel threshold-based modeling framework to systematically model viewers&#39; watching behaviors. Guided by the theory of hedonic decline, we further model the process of viewers&#39; preference decline during watching each live stream with consideration of live interactions, shedding light on the roles of different kinds of live interactions on viewers&#39; watching behaviors. Comprehensive experiments conducted on a real-world data set demonstrate that our proposed framework can enhance both watching duration prediction and live stream recommendation.

In Study 1, we mined a large dataset of online reviews from Amazon across different products between 2014 and 2021. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, TextBlob, and Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning analysis, we analyzed this extensive dataset to identify any interaction effect between profanity and subjectivity on the perceived helpfulness of online reviews in the real world. Through an experimental design, Study 2 extended the findings of Study 1 by manipulating the presence (vs. absence) of profanity and the level (high vs. low) of subjectivity in an experimental setting. Study 2 also examined perceived authenticity as a mediator underlying the interactive effect. The results show that the presence (vs. absence) of profanity increased the perceived review helpfulness in the low (but not high) subjectivity condition. Furthermore, the positive effect of profanity on review helpfulness in the low subjectivity condition was mediated by perceived authenticity. The present research is among the first to evaluate if the use of profanity impacts consumers&#39; beliefs regarding whether the review is written by an authentic, genuine, and real person. While previous research suggests that objective language is preferred by consumers, our findings suggest that some subjectivity is important for consumers, especially in the context of online reviews.},

Organizational decision mechanisms aim to minimize the impact of individual fallibility and integrate collective wisdom. In recent years, consensus mechanism has posed a challenge to the traditional hierarchy, but its superiority in different decision scenarios is still unknown. We created decision scenarios based on positions (middle manager or grassroots employee) of the proposer of the innovation project, market volatility , and decision timeliness. Simulation results using Agent Based Modeling indicate the following: If the proposer is a middle manager and decision timeliness is unimportant, consensus in low-density networks is preferred; otherwise, hierarchy is preferred. If the proposer is a grassroots employee, the best-performing mechanism, in order, is consensus in low-density networks, consensus in high-density networks, and hierarchy as the discount interest rate increases. Market volatility drives the advance of the two critical points of the discount interest rate. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid organizational decision mechanism that can balance authority and consensus. It combines the high decision accuracy of consensus with the high decision efficiency of hierarchy, addressing the long decision time in consensus and the information asymmetry and information loss in hierarchy. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid decision mechanism is only slightly inferior to consensus mechanism when market volatility is very low or decision timeliness is unimportant.},

Understanding the state of business ecosystems is an increasingly critical strategic imperative for many decision makers , but it is a resource-intensive activity as relevant information sources are dispersed, often highly unstructured, and not integrated or curated to deliver actionable insights. In this research, we present the design and implementation of an interactive visual analytic system that integrates artificial intelligence and graph visualization techniques to augment decision makers’ understanding of the complex public narrative associated with business ecosystems entities. Our system is driven by a real-time content engine of 100,000+ global data sources including press releases, news articles, industry reports, analyst blogs in multiple languages organized across several domain-specific repositories. Following a user-specified query, the engine extracts both domain-agnostic and domain-specific entities and concepts for each document in the result set. We then model and visualize the resulting data as a dynamic, multipartite network and implement graph pruning algorithms and interactive data controls to enable users to interactively explore and discover the underlying business ecosystem from multiple perspectives. We illustrate and discuss the value of our system using representative use cases. Our study makes multiple contributions to visual decision support theory and practice, including mining unstructured data, constructing and interacting with knowledge graphs, and designing visual analytic tools for ecosystem intelligence.

We undertook a cross-sectional comparative study , which was analyzed using PLS-SEM and fsQCA . Where PLS-SEM provided limited inferential insights about the differences between anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic chatbots, the FsQCA analysis resulted in three configurations of attributes for non-anthropomorphic and two configurations for anthropomorphic chatbots, which lead to higher cognitive absorption.

  abstract     = {The transformation of information flow and shopping experiences on modern digital platforms has significantly shifted. Notably, the integration of low-immersion virtual reality (VR) technology has become a key driver in enhancing the immersive nature of online shopping experiences. The projected exponential growth of the VR market, with anticipated revenue surging from $11.64 billion in 2021 to $227.34 billion by 2029, further underscores the importance of understanding the impact of VR signals on product sales and profitability. Drawing upon signaling theory, this study examines the impact of VR signals on real estate transactions across different price tiers. Our empirical analysis suggests a positive correlation between the integration of low-immersion VR technology and real estate profitability. It is worth noting that this effect varies significantly across the level of real estate prices . Our research highlights the strategic benefits of adopting low-immersion VR technology as a decision support mechanism, enhancing the immersive shopping experience, and improving product profitability. Furthermore, this research also provides perspective on the broader applicability of VR technology in different business sectors, showing a promising future for its role in optimizing consumer experiences.},

  abstract     = {People often make decisions differently, even when faced with the same decision-making scenario and objectives, due to their varying abilities to access, process, and comprehend information relevant to the decisions at hand. To reconcile these differing perspectives and arrive at a unified decision, various approaches such as crowd-sourced systems have been developed to tap into the collective intelligence embodied in the opinions from a group of individuals. The diversity of opinions is both cure and curse for the effective use of crowd-sourced intelligence. To unify crowd-sourced intelligence for a well-informed decision, we propose an algorithmic approach for decision aggregation that accurately quantifies the reliability of information from multiple sources. The key idea behind this approach is to model the propagation of reliability in decisions based on an ensemble of relevance graphs, where the optimization of both the reliability propagation and the graph ensemble are mutually reinforced. The propagated reliability can be used to aggregate intelligence from multiple sources and facilitate decision-making by leveraging various types of inter-correlations of information sources and the subjects of the information. Meanwhile, the optimized graph ensemble can retain the relevance structures with respect to the crowd-sourced intelligence. We evaluate our approach with large-scale data sets, and the results show that, when aggregating analysts’ recommendations in stock markets, our approach not only outperforms alternative methods, but also provides interesting insights into the reliability of the information.},

  abstract     = {During viral pandemics, governments throughout the world face many complicated and important decisions, such as whether and how to implement a shutdown. In response to shutdown measures that are enacted by governments, citizens are then forced to make decisions regarding whether to comply (and stay home) or violate (and leave their residence for non-essential reasons). To the best of our knowledge, these shutdown and compliance interactions between governments and citizens have received limited attention from the scientific community. To address this gap, we start by developing a single-leader multiple-follower game-theoretic model to study the optimal decisions of the government, who wants to minimize her total cost of implementing a shutdown while balancing societal infection risks, and the public, which wants to minimize their total cost of compliance and individual infection risks. In this initial version of the game, the government selects whether or not to implement a shutdown, while the public decides whether to comply with the government’s safety guidelines. We then extend this version of the game by modeling a continuous-choice government, where she can implement a total shutdown, no safety measures at all, or anything between those extremes. We solve both models analytically, resulting in closed-form equilibrium solutions. Using data related to COVID-19, we conduct sensitivity analyses to study how the equilibrium strategies change as the values of the model parameters fluctuate. Our models and analyses offer important and relevant insights into optimal decision making in this setting, and also apply in situations in which infections spread at a rapid rate but may not cause severe illness, such as the case of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. In these scenarios, the models recommend that the government does not implement a shutdown, and instead encourages the public to follow safety measures to avoid infections.},

  abstract     = {Internet technology allows e-tailers to provide installment payment services, allowing consumers to purchase products without immediate payment. In addition, retailers can apply intelligent pricing strategies and provide price-guarantee strategies to encourage consumers to buy in advance. This study uses a dynamic mechanism design to explore the interplay between pricing and financing strategies. Specifically, we combine a consumer credit service with a posterior price guarantee. Online monopolists switch between high and low prices with a certain probability in each period. If the retailer lowers the price during the price-guarantee period, it refunds the difference. Consumers are heterogeneous in their valuations of products and disposable personal income. Our analysis demonstrates that interest-free installments are more profitable when the proportion of consumers with high disposable personal income is low; otherwise, the retailer should provide installment services with a maximal loan interest rate that may increase with consumer valuation heterogeneity. Moreover, adopting price guarantees narrows the use of interest-free installments. Further, the use of installment payments makes the retailer increase the promotion probability and high price and shorten the length of the price-guarantee period when the proportion of consumers with a high disposable personal income is low. We also find that as consumers become more patient, the retailer should reduce the promotion probability and prolong the price-guarantee period.},

  abstract     = {Medical decision making increasingly relies on machine learning algorithms to analyze complex patient data and provide recommendations. However, the lack of interpretability in “black box” models has limited their adoption in clinical practice, which demands transparency and justification. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a recurrent neural network architecture, have shown promise for medical Decision Support Systems (DSS) applications due to their accuracy in modeling time series data , such as physiological signals . However, conventional ESNs suffer from a lack of interpretability, which limits their usefulness for clinical decisions. This study proposes a multi-level framework to optimize both accuracy and interpretability for improved medical decision support. The framework is specifically designed for EEG data, which represents a non-invasive and continuous recording of brain activity . EEG data is ideal for recording information about the internal state of the brain, which is not always translated by perceptible external manifestations. The framework consists of four components: (1) data preprocessing and optimized feature selection utilizing a filter-based feature importance algorithm, (2) ensemble learning via Ensemble ESNs ( E -ESNs) that combines the predictions of multiple ESNs to reduce variance and improve accuracy, (3) Global and Local model explanation techniques to allow users to understand the decision-making process and identify the most influential features for each prediction, and (4) decision-making for presenting diagnoses and recommendations. The framework was evaluated on an EEG dataset for stroke prediction, a valuable use case for informed clinical decisions and resource allocation . The results showed that the framework significantly outperformed baseline related works with an accuracy of 96.5% and provides insights into the E -ESN model&#39;s predictions. This transparency enhances trust and comprehension among healthcare practitioners. These findings suggest that the proposed framework can be a valuable tool for medical DSS applications.},

  abstract     = {Consumers&#39; preservice tipping behavior serves as a window to reflect their economic and social perception and desire for high service quality but is rarely discussed in tipping literature, compared with postservice tipping. The on-demand feature in the online-to-offline context complicates the fulfillment performance and consumers&#39; preservice tipping behavior, including whether to tip (i.e., tip giving) and how much to tip (i.e., tip size). Using data from one of the biggest on-demand supermarket delivery platforms in China, we find that the factors that stimulate consumers&#39; tip-giving behavior do not lead them to tip more. In addition, consumers&#39; current preservice tipping behavior is affected by their current purchase process and also depends on providers&#39; previous fulfillment performance. Moreover, consumers consider the number of items in the order, order weight, and weather conditions when fulfilling the orders when making their tipping decisions. Further, consumers&#39; tip-giving and size decisions vary across their on-demand supermarket delivery shopping frequencies and their income levels. The findings provide implications for on-demand supermarket delivery platforms to understand different types of consumers&#39; preservice tipping behavior that indicates their expectations and perception and thus provide decision support for on-demand supermarket delivery platforms to implement targeted actions accordingly. In this way, on-demand supermarket delivery platforms can improve their service and image to stimulate consumers&#39; actions to motivate employees to improve their service and better benefit the platforms.},

  abstract     = {Drawing on information technology-enabled organizational capabilities theory, we argue that how and when social media use affects marketing performance depending on the mediating role of social customer relationship management (CRM) capability and the moderating role of guanxi . Using a sample of 194 Chinese agricultural firms, we employed a combination of complementary techniques: advanced analysis for composites–structural equation modeling (ADANCO-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). In ADANCO-SEM analysis, we empirically verify the full mediating role of social CRM capability in the association between social media use and marketing performance and identify the condition for this indirect effect (i.e., when the guanxi levels are high). Moreover, guanxi plays a dual moderating role—it exerts a substitution effect when social media is used to build social CRM capability, and it exerts a complementary effect when social CRM capability is leveraged to improve marketing performance. FsQCA analysis further reveals the different configurations of social media use, guanxi, and social CRM capability that can lead to high marketing performance in different firm sizes. The findings complement those from ADANCO-SEM analysis vis-à-vis the conditions for the formation of marketing performance. This study contributes to the emerging literature on the business value of social media by theoretically exploring and empirically validating the mechanisms and boundary conditions by which social media affects marketing performance.},

We propose new multivariate multiple linear regression profile (MMLRP) based schemes to monitor the relationship between customer complaints and identified explanatory variables. Conventional MMLRP-based schemes suffer performance loss with more than five explanatory variables, and the fixed parameters drawn from a historical process are unsuitable for a changing review-generation process. As such, we apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the explanatory variables and incorporate the variability in new review samples.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence , there is an increasing number of industries relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms . But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks , we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task . Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposes an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words. Compared with the existing approaches, our proposed framework is based on the perspective of human psychology with higher credibility and significant theoretical support. In addition, we purposefully design and implement an intuitive visualisation for the framework, instead of complex numerical representations, to improve the explanation comprehensibility for a broader audience.},

Based on a survey of young mobile internet users in China, we show that, first, social trust is positively associated with perceived benefits and perceived algorithmic equity, which are further linked to intention to click recommended items and intention to continuously use ARS (i.e., continuance intention). Second, social trust is negatively related to perceived risks, in turn reducing intention to click. Further, algorithm aversion weakens the negative association between social trust and perceived risk. Our study contributes to the ARS literature from the societal aspect, by validating the importance of social trust, demonstrating the key role of perceived algorithmic equity, and examining the trait of algorithm aversion as a moderator in the formation of algorithm-related perceptions. We also offer key practical suggestions for app developers and policymakers, related to algorithmic equity, transparency, and privacy risk of ARS management and regulation.},

  abstract     = {Users generate tremendous amounts of data on the Internet every day. This so-called user-generated content (UGC) is valuable input for organizations since it may include individual experiences, opinions, and desires with respect to the products and services they offer. To automatically process UGC, automated techniques, typically referred to as Needmining, have been developed. Existing Needmining approaches extract customer needs from UGC by binarily classifying unstructured textual data into need-content and no-need content. However, they are not able to extract the specific needs. We address this research gap by developing a decision support artifact that re-conceptualizes Needmining from a binary classification problem to a token-classification problem to extract specific needs from informative content. To achieve this, we break down customer needs into components, i.e. attributes and characteristics and develop a token classification artifact. The artifact accurately identifies the need-components and, therefore, can identify specific customer needs in user-generated content. We organize and discuss the value of the artifact&#39;s output and further enrich the model with sentiment data to distinguish relevant needs. If applied, the artifact can realize efficiency gains for decisionmakers in the field of product development as it automatically and quickly identifies relevant consumer needs.},

This study addresses a gap in existing research by combining two types of factors affecting purchase behavior: past customer characteristics and current website browsing behavior. This study employs recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) to extract variables of customer characteristics and utilizes graph metrics to comprehensively measure browsing patterns. Based on these variables, this study conducts predictive analysis for purchase behavior and clustering analysis for session-level customer segmentation. Our findings reveal that integrating customer characteristics and browsing patterns significantly enhances purchase prediction and proposes a novel customer segmentation. This study not only provides theoretical and methodological contributions to decision support and e-commerce literature but also offers practical insights for real-time personalized marketing strategies.},

The main contribution of our research is the design of a multimodal analytics framework for product sales prediction in live streaming e-commerce. In the proposed framework, we explore the influence of anchor reputation on product sales and innovatively consider both historical and real-time reputation signals. In addition, to better extract valuable information for real-time signals, we propose an A-tiFSR model to extract features from product text and images and design a fine-grained analysis method to mine danmaku data. We conduct our experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from Douyin live streaming. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the constructed multimodal reputation signals of anchors on product sales prediction. The management implication of our research is that merchants and anchors should pay more attention to their multidimensional reputation. The proposed sales prediction framework can help merchants predict sales more accurately and optimize inventory policy and marketing strategies. This study thus supports the more effective development of live streaming e-commerce markets.},

  abstract     = {Consumers are often uncertain about how a product fits their individual preferences before purchase. To resolve such uncertainty, firms can use fit-revelation activities such as sampling, product demonstration, and virtual showrooms. Recently, there is an emerging trend of combining product sampling with advertising (e.g., Amazon’s sampling-advertising initiative). Empirical research has shown that fit-revelation may enhance or weaken the effect of advertising. We contribute to the literature by developing an analytical model that links these interactions with the firm’s strategic decisions. We find that, interestingly, when fit-revelation enhances the effect of advertising, these two instruments are not necessarily complementary. Our study further characterizes the firm’s strategy space of whether to conduct fit-revelation alone, advertising alone, or both. We show that advertising may reverse the firm’s decision on whether to facilitate fit-revelation. Moreover, how complementarity/substitutability affects the optimal strategy depends on the types of ads. While substitutability denies the optimality of the joint strategy under informative ads, it fails to do so under persuasive ads. On the other hand, complementarity is necessary for the joint strategy to be optimal under informative ads, which is not the case under persuasive ads. Finally, we extend our analysis to targeted fit-revelation/advertising with heterogeneous consumers ex ante, in which case the firm may find it optimal to target low-valuation consumers. Given the latest trends and growing interest in the deployment of joint advertising and sampling, our study offers timely insights for practitioners.},

In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyber-insurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies . Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated.

Such a display may trigger anthropomorphism, the automatic process of attributing human characteristics to a non-human object, but past research suggests that the nature of the product may influence this process. We argue that displaying a product as an animated caricature is more likely to trigger anthropomorphism when the underlying product itself has some human-like features than when the product does not (e.g., appearance, movement, speech, behavior). We tested this form of presentation with a laptop, a camera, and a TV, theorizing that the effects would be stronger for the laptop than either the TV or the camera because the computer has more human-like features. Our results show that participants bid 20% more for a computer when it was presented in the form of an animated caricature compared to when it was presented on a traditional Web page, and as theorized, there were no differences for the TV or camera when presented in this form. Electroencephalogram (EEG) results show that participants engaged in similar cognitive activities for the computer displayed on Web pages and as an animated caricature. However, there was a significant difference in results between the two display formats for the camera and TV, which we interpret as the cognitive conflict that occurs when the animated product display does not fit the underlying nature of the product.},

  abstract     = {Stock trading strategies pose challenging applications of machine learning for significant commercial yields in the finance industry , drawing the attention of both economists and computer scientists. Until now, many researchers have proposed various methods to implement intelligent trading strategy systems that can support decisions regarding stock trading. Some studies have shown that the problem of trading strategies can be successfully addressed by applying hybrid approaches. Motivated by this, we propose a hybrid decision support system for adaptive trading strategies that combines a rule-based system with deep reinforcement learning to self-improve by learning with human expertise. This study overcomes the limitations of previous hybrid models that mainly have focused on optimizing trading decisions and improving forecasting accuracy . The proposed hybrid model combines decision-making information from a rule-based model to enable the agent of reinforcement learning to capture more trading opportunities. In addition, the investor&#39;s available balance states facilitate adaptive learning by interacting with the environment. Moreover, the proposed trading mechanism adjusts the volume size using the policy gradient algorithm&#39;s action probabilities, resulting in improved risk-adjusted returns. The proposed hybrid model has the potential to be a reliable trading system in real-world applications through its ability to adapt to different market scenarios, withstand stressful market conditions, reduce transaction costs, scale to various index funds, and extend the proposed hybrid structure. This study highlights the applicability of more advanced machine learning in financial areas, and we also suggest expanding this approach to adaptive decision-making systems in other fields.},

The platform can operate either as a reseller, setting retail prices, or as a marketplace provider, earning commission fees. The shared information comprises the preferences of the consumers who shop on the platform. With this shared information, the seller can adjust its retail plan according to revealed consumer preferences in each planning cycle. Our analysis revolves around three factors: market variability, the cost of adjusting the retail plan, and the intensity of in-platform competition faced by the seller. Our results indicate that in the reseller setting the platform can be either better off or worse off with information sharing, whereas in the commission fee setting the platform invariably benefits from information sharing. If the platform shares information, it is generally beneficial for consumers in the reseller setting but could be harmful in the commission fee setting. We propose a price ceiling mechanism to incentivize information sharing. Our findings reveal that this price ceiling mechanism is superior to the subsidy mechanism as it yields benefits for all parties – the seller, the platform, and consumers – through information sharing. These results offer valuable insights to e-commerce platforms regarding strategic decisions on information sharing services and contract design to ensure mutual benefits.},

Since assessment is an important and necessary step before prediction, its accuracy could affect the effectiveness of prediction. Therefore, we designed a new three-stage decision support research framework to discuss enterprise financial risk assessment and prediction. First, considering various factors affecting enterprise financial risk, we devised an indicator screening method based on financial risk identification ability to establish the indicator system. Second, the combined weighting method is introduced to assess financial risk. Then game theory is applied to find the optimal allocation coefficient for single methods to improve the accuracy of assessment. Third, owing to highly nonlinear risk factors , the single algorithm could not get satisfactory results; the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) ensemble model is applied to conduct real-value prediction rather than classification. Meanwhile, OPTUNA optimization is introduced for improving LightGBM to establish OPT-LightGBM ensemble model. The empirical results based on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China show that our method can assess enterprise financial risk more accurately than the common method based on whether the enterprise stock is marked as special treatment (ST). Further, compared with the existing prediction models, OPT-LightGBM can improve the efficiency without losing the prediction performance, and has the best overall performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the impact of information technology-based ridesharing platforms on hospitals&#39; emergency department (ED) admissions. Employing a difference-in-differences design, we analyze patient-level data for 42 million ED visits in Florida. We find that the availability of ridesharing positively affects ED arrivals, indicating enhanced accessibility. Our analysis of the heterogeneous impact of ridesharing suggests the most significant effect applies to young, middle-aged, low-income, and non-critical patients. Additionally, we find a significant increase in ED service time for patients with less critical conditions and no change in visit length for critical patients. The rise in ED demand due to ridesharing entry can have two distinct implications. On the one hand, ridesharing entry addresses the access barrier when the patient&#39;s condition is non-critical, but ED usage is necessary. This is a positive impact of ridesharing services availability, especially since it helps low-income communities the most. Therefore, hospitals and ridesharing companies can collaborate to address the healthcare access challenge. On the other hand, ridesharing entry may exacerbate already overcrowded EDs by facilitating non-critical and unnecessary ED usage, which can be an adverse effect. In this case, effective patient triage to identify those with urgent needs may become even more essential after ridesharing entry.},

We validate our modeling framework using a real-world dataset collected from the online retailer Amazon . The experimental results show that the proposed model identifies a set of high-quality textual topics but also interprets its effect on consumer choices based on product-related topics. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed model quantifies the consumer&#39;s preferences.

  abstract     = {Although the effects of managerial responses (MRs) on subsequent customer reviews (CRs) has been explored, we lack a comprehensive theoretical framework to explain the interdependent relationships between previous and subsequent CRs—specifically the dynamic influences of MRs on future CRs. We draw on emotional contagion and regulation theories to develop a heuristic systematic model to explain CR-MR dynamics in online settings. We propose six systematic processing and three heuristic processing routes to delineate the determination and persuasion effects between previous and subsequent consumers&#39; CRs. The systematic routes describe how current customers&#39; compliments, complaints, and emotions influence their current rating scores. The heuristic processing routes describe how previous customers&#39; rating scores and emotions influence current customers&#39; rating scores and emotions. We suggest MR strategies to regulate these effects. The presence and length of MRs defines the numeric heuristic route while the positive-emotion heuristic route is conceptualized through expressions of thanks, sincerity, interaction, and complimenting customers. Expressions of apology, explanation, empathy, and remedy inform the negative-emotion heuristic route. We collect text from customers&#39; reviews and managers&#39; responses from the TripAdvisor website using text-mining techniques and analyze our hypotheses using Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (pooled OLS) and Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) modeling. Our findings not only enrich the theoretical underpinnings of the CR/MR literature, but also provide managerial guidance on how customers&#39; emotional contagion and rating behaviors might be regulated.},

  abstract     = {In the context of information security, the organizational social environment plays an important role in deterring employee violations of the Information Security Policy (ISP). As extant research has not yet determined the role ethical climates may play, this study seeks to understand their influence on employee ISP violations. To this end, we classified ISPs into two major categories: those related to communal information technology (IT) resources in the organization, such as databases or software applications , and those related to connective IT resources, such as email or Internet access. Then, we explored how rules-, performance-, and friendship-oriented organizational ethical climates affect ISP violations. Based on a survey of 177 professionals employed in the United States, we found that rules-oriented and friendship-oriented ethical climates deter ISP violations, whereas a performance-oriented one does not. Moreover, rules- and friendship-oriented ethical climates lead to fewer communal ISP violations, while performance-oriented ethical climates lead to more connectivity ISP violations. These findings underscore the importance of considering the type of IT resources that an ISP aims to protect as well as the ethical climate of an organization in order to better understand the causes of ISP violations.},

  abstract     = {A popular form of modern software development involves co-creation and sharing of digital resources (e.g., API and SDK) by third-party developers in software ecosystems. In doing so, digital resources, software development projects, and developer organizations are networked together and form digital resource clusters (DRCs), which can be closely or loosely related. Management science and innovation research has focused on how organizations use DRCs to innovate their software products and services. However, the network structures of software ecosystems are spatiotemporally complex since digital resources are transitively, heterogeneously, and temporally related. In existing literature, the extent of spatiotemporal complexity has impeded the empirical identification of DRCs. Our research devises a method framework consisting of two steps toward identifying DRCs using machine learning , which we found to be well suited to representing the spatiotemporal characteristics of networked digital resources. First, we devise a spatiotemporal network embedding method that learns and represents temporal, transitive, and heterogeneous networks of software ecosystems. Second, we devise a clustering method that identifies DRCs using the output of our embedding method as input. The performance test experiment results show that our devised method framework is superior to existing conventional methods at identifying DRCs.},

  abstract     = {The expanding availability of data in the financial sector promises to take the performance of machine learning models to a new level. However, given the high business value and confidentiality of credit data, the integration of datasets from multiple institutions for credit scoring modeling may result in privacy leakage . Consequently, in this paper, a horizontal federated learning paradigm is used to protect the local private data of each participant and collaborate to train a powerful shared global model. However, in the collaborative training process, heterogeneous data distributions can result in insufficient learning of the model. To overcome this issue, we propose the federated knowledge transfer (FedKT) method, which exploits the advantages of fine-tuning and knowledge distillation to effectively extract generic and specific knowledge from the early layers and outputs of the global model, respectively, thus improving the learning performance of the local models. We adopt five credit datasets and four performance measures to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can securely utilize credit data from different parties to improve the performance of the credit scoring model . This also supports the potential of our proposed method for further applications in credit scoring.},

  abstract     = {In a world where funding institutions and venture capitalists dominate the digital product development landscape, crowdfunding engages a global crowd to finance visionary ideas and address underrepresented needs. However, despite recognizing the challenges of managing crowd expectations, there is limited understanding of how developers navigate these challenges following the successful funding of their proposals. Drawing on a comparative, longitudinal, and in-depth grounded investigation, this study illuminates the prevalence of &quot;resource adversity&quot; within crowdfunded digital development projects. Resource adversity, characterized by scarcities of critical resources such as funding and human capital , affects crowdfunded development despite substantial support from a large crowd, potentially leading to complex outcomes. While adversity compels developers to seek additional funding and advocate for changes in various project aspects, this perspective departs from resource-centric viewpoints and emphasizes resourceful decisions to proactively establish resilience, resist precarious changes, and facilitate the release of high-quality products and post-adversity benefits. The perspective contributes to the dominant research focus on post-adversity decision-making and restoration by discussing connections across pre-adversity, adversity, and post-adversity stages. By focusing on preparedness and resourcefulness, the decision-making insights expand research on managing resource-limited development while meeting diverse stakeholder expectations. Moreover, the perspective enriches extant understanding of community-based innovation by elucidating how product improvisation, community resource engagement, and bricolage are interrelated and contribute to shaping evolving digital products. The article concludes by discussing practical implications for entrepreneurs and platform owners and by exploring avenues for future research.},

Our results show that daytime imaging and spatial network features have significant predictive value and that a combination of these features gives the best predictive power . In addition, we find that the skewness of poverty rates among adjacent census tracts, not the average, is a significant predictor showing the importance of distribution of poverty around a region.

Second, they ignore that a firm&#39;s attractiveness is heavily influenced by that of its competitors, as they all vie for the same talent. Third, they assume attractiveness remains constant across time. We address all three drawbacks via a methodology that can cluster job titles to identify prevalent talent types, as well as compute and monitor employer attractiveness for each type in a competitive market. Our clustering approach groups job titles based on their lexical similarity, their co-occurrence in professional resumes, and their overlap in terms of the skills that they require. Our work directly informs the decisions of employers trying to recruit in competitive talent markets, as well as of workers trying to identify the best destination for their career.

Our model is unique in its ability to adapt to different physician decision-making styles while continuously monitoring patient progress. We validate our approach using simulated and real data from a major hospital in Tampa Bay. The analysis reveals that dynamic prognostic measures can help balance the competing needs of rapid patient release and neurologic stability. Additionally, our results show variability in physicians&#39; expectations regarding neurological recovery. Counterfactual analyses suggest that implementing this decision model could potentially save up to $27,500 per TBI patient under certain conditions.},

However, SIT has not clarified the mechanism underlying the impact of social identification on engagement, particularly in terms of how strongly identified individuals do inside and outside the group. Without such knowledge, practitioners may mistakenly believe that social identification always enhances clients&#39; commitment and loyalty, showing the practical importance of a better understanding of this issue. Hence, the purpose of this study is to propose two novel components ( external articulation and internal stabilization ) that make up the mechanism underlying the impact of social identification. We modeled this mechanism and used a multiwave design and multianchored scales in collecting three waves of complete and valid responses from 814 online gamers. Structural equation modeling was used to statistically test the model. The results mostly support our model, i.e., both internal stabilization and external articulation are necessary components of this theoretical mechanism. The findings inform game makers that they should ask highly identified players to express both positive and unique features of gaming communities by word-of-mouth. Interestingly, internal stabilization can strengthen the influence of external articulation, particularly regarding the impact of unique image advocation . Game makers should also leverage players&#39; identification to remind them to comply with norms. These means should strengthen players&#39; commitment and therefore their action loyalty. Our study extends SIT by proposing two novel components, external articulation and internal stabilization; future research should explore concepts associated with these two components.},

  abstract     = {Investor sentiment based on social media Word-of-Mouth (WoM) has been shown to be predictive of stock returns under normal market conditions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented impact and uncertainty to the stock market. In this paper, we examine the predictability of social media-based WoM on day-ahead US stock market returns across three phases of the pandemic: pre-COVID, peak-COVID, and recovery. We collect over 24 million stock-related tweets from Twitter across these three periods and employ text-mining methods for feature engineering. We focus on two channels of WoM information, aggregate sentiments, and disaggregated topics, representing investors&#39; overall opinions and discussion patterns about the stock market. We find that, in contrast to normal market conditions, the investor sentiment indices are not significant in predicting market returns during the peak-COVID and recovery periods, while for the pre-COVID period, our findings are consistent with prior studies. To explore the effect of disaggregated latent topics, we propose an ensemble feature selection approach that identifies relevant topics for each of the three periods. We find that adding topic information significantly improves model prediction during the peak-COVID period. Our findings imply that during a global socio-economic disruption and the subsequent recovery, the landscape of financial markets, examined through the lens of social media-based WoM, is different than during normal market conditions. Our findings also suggest that investors who primarily trade on sentiment may wish to leverage machine learning techniques to identify latent topic information, subsequently incorporating such information into their trading decision-making.},

The existing literature focuses textual data on product reviews; however, consumer reviews are not something that companies can directly control, here we argue that textual product descriptions are also important determinants of consumer choice. We construct an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that combines text mining, WaveNet neural networks , multiple regression, and SHAP model to explain the impact of product descriptions on sales forecasting. Using data from nearly 200,000 sales records obtained from a cross-border e-commerce firm, an empirical study showed that the product description presented to customers can influence sales forecasting, and about 44% of the key phrases greatly affect sales forecasting results, the sales forecasting models that added key product description phrases had improved forecasting accuracy. This paper provides explainable results of sales forecasting, which can provide guidance for firms to design product descriptions with reference to the market demand reflected by these phrases, and adding these phrases to product descriptions can help win more customers.},

  abstract     = {Firms frequently introduce a new quality differentiated service to extend or encroach on the original market, such as expert consultations, airlines, and catering, thereby ameliorating the congestion effect incurred by noisy environments and waiting time. Essentially, the original and new services exhibit a two-dimensional differentiation, i.e., quality differentiation and informational differentiation , whereby consumers are informed (uninformed) of the original (new) service’s quality. Using game theory , we investigate a setting wherein the firm can strategically disclose the new service’s quality information and price services to navigate consumers’ beliefs and purchase decisions in different market structures (monopoly extension vs. duopoly encroachment). We find that the congestion effect makes the unprofitable downward extension profitable because it incentivizes the firm to provide multiple services that can segment consumers more efficiently via price discrimination for mitigating congestion costs. Also, the congestion cost enhances (ameliorates) price discrimination (price competition) under monopoly extension (duopoly encroachment). This further explains, when quality differentiation is low and the congestion cost is high, that both vertical line extension and encroachment can yield higher social welfare compared to the original market. Moreover, the low-end entrant’s profit is non-monotonic with quality differentiation, and the intermediate-disclosure strategy is optimal due to the trade-off between quality improvement and price discrimination.},

  abstract     = {Of the many factors affecting supply chain resiliency, visibility can have a profound effect on critical decisions for improving the readiness, response, and recovery from supply chain disruptions. The visibility of tier-1 suppliers gives only a narrow view of the entire picture . This work expands on applying the Nexus Supplier Index [1] using a data-driven approach that deviates from the traditional analysis. It relies on the network topology , leveraging graph centralities. Data collection started with 40 focal companies representing 24 industries , 14 clusters, different sectors, and sizes, generating $1.7 T in revenue and 2.3 M jobs. We collected ∼16,000 data points covering upstream and downstream supply chains, the most extensive application of the NSI reported in the literature. We calculated different node centralities for the focal companies and all companies in their supply networks to increase supply chain visibility to key worldwide companies. We propose improvements for identifying hidden critical suppliers (HCS) within the network that, when combined, provide visibility of depths up to 11 tiers. This work illustrates the results of a partnership between academia with governmental and non-governmental agencies in a data-driven approach to identify critical suppliers hidden in a US state&#39;s leading manufacturers&#39; supply network. From this work, 43 companies were identified as hidden critical suppliers in an initial analysis, of which 35 had no presence in the analyzed state (82%). All of them were contacted for possible future economic development endeavors. It is also important to mention that 15 of the 43 critical suppliers were in semiconductor-related industries (35%). This data was collected in the fall of 2020, before the worldwide semiconductor shortage, illustrating the potential to identify industries with greater supply chain resiliency risk.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews play a crucial role in comprehending user rating behavior and improving personalized recommendations in e-commerce. However, existing review-based recommendation systems ignore the influence of theory-driven and context information. This paper proposes the Deep Learning Recommendation Model with Textual Review and Context (DeepRM-TC), which is built upon a cognitive process-driven approach to improve the quality and interpretability of recommendations. The DeepRM-TC framework mimics the human brain&#39;s cognitive process for predicting user rating behavior. Essentially, the simulation of human cognitive processing is manifested in several aspects of the designed neural network , including treating rating prediction to an attitude question, mapping raw data in latent space as the user&#39;s belief, injecting attention mechanisms for rendering judgment and predicting rating as an answer. Furthermore, we design a three-layer coattention mechanism to adaptively match product information based on users&#39; preferences in various contexts. This mechanism extracts finer-grained interaction information from user–product–context pairs. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. We demonstrate the importance of context information and the three-layer coattention mechanism in enhancing recommendation accuracy through ablation and hierarchic analysis, respectively. Additionally, we further validate the performance of our model through data sparseness analysis, scalability analysis, other datasets, classification analysis , and user study.},

  abstract     = {Express delivery, enabled by automated warehouse systems, offers a competitive advantage to e-commerce retailers by shortening order shipping time. It is a common strategy used to attract customers to maintain customer loyalty and improve customer satisfaction on an electronic commerce platform. Yet promising express delivery may heighten customer expectations, subsequently affecting their post-purchase satisfaction and potentially affecting their rating behavior for the logistics service performance. Using a dataset from an e-commerce platform, we show that orders with an express delivery promise are less likely to be reviewed and are reviewed with a lower rating score compared to orders without an express delivery promise but with the same delivery time. Interestingly, the negative effect persists even if the express order arrives earlier than the promised delivery date. We propose that customers have a preference referencing a higher expectation driven by the promise effect of the express delivery, resulting in a change in rating behavior. We recommend that firms, especially online retailers, should carefully consider anticipated customer expectations and post-purchase reactions when developing an express delivery commitment strategy.},

While previous studies have focused on econometric analysis , few have positioned the mixed treatment problem within the realm of causal machine learning, particularly in uplift modeling. This study proposes a novel uplift modeling technique called weighted doubly robust learning, which uses Shapley-value treatment attribution and doubly robust estimation to control for confounding among different treatments and estimate the pure effect for each treatment. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic dataset and industrial dataset. The results show that our method outperforms most of the current uplift modeling approaches in responsive customer targeting and effective treatment attribution, achieving an area under uplift curve (AUUC) of 0.590 and a Qini-coefficient of 0.080. Our method not only contributes to advancing current causal machine learning methods, but also provides valuable insights for companies in business decision making .},

Drawing from the psychology and computer science literature, we construct features of a customer&#39;s emotion dynamics during a service encounter. Using real-world call center data from a large insurance company, we train an ensemble model with these emotion dynamics features to predict service quality. The model has higher prediction performance than the two benchmark approaches using quality-assurance evaluation and operational indices. Our method for emotion dynamics classification outperforms a host of state-of-the-art time series classification algorithms . We further apply explainable AI methods to identify the most important features of emotion dynamics and show how they are related to service quality. For example, the location where the last emotion episode appears in a service call has a U-shaped relationship to low quality. Finally, to demonstrate utility, we design an IT artifact to automatically measure service quality after service encounters in the call center and use the measure to predict a customer&#39;s referral intention.},

Patients may not adopt doctors&#39; advice because of the problems with how the advice is structured rather than the advice quality. We apply the framework of the integrated model of advice giving (IMA) to investigate the link between advice structure and patients&#39; advice adoption. The IMA suggests that, when advice follows the specific sequence of emotional support , followed by problem analysis, and then by suggested actions, the advice-receivers are more likely to evaluate advice as high quality. Uncertainties exist regarding whether the IMA is applicable in the context of online medical platforms. To address this issue, we empirically examine the impact of advice components and sequence of the components on patients&#39; advice adoption on an online medical platform. We collected 416,817 patient advice-seeking and physician advice-giving records from a leading online medical platform in China. We find that advice components of emotional support and problem analysis have important impacts on patients&#39; advice adoption. Furthermore, when advice follows the sequence of problem analysis followed by suggested actions and then by emotional support, patients are more likely to adopt the advice. Our research expands the research context of the IMA to include online medical platforms.

This study aims to understand (1) what are the factors influencing physician service adoption in OHCs and (2) how do the factors differ in influencing physician service adoption across the two stages. Based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this study identifies information quality and interaction quality as central cues and electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) as peripheral cue in affecting physician service adoption, and proposes comparative hypotheses regarding the relative importance between the central and peripheral cues across the first adoption and post-adoption stages. By using secondary data collected from a popular Chinese OHC, and applying negative binomial regression models and path comparison method, we found that interaction quality with a physician and his/her eWOM positively influence the first adoption of physician services, and the eWOM is the determination factor across both the first adoption and post-adoption stages. In addition, the central cue interaction quality has a stronger impact on the first adoption of physician services than on the post-adoption; the peripheral cue eWOM has a stronger impact on the post-adoption of physician services than on the first adoption.

Human decision-makers deal with more than one machine learning model in several practical situations. Consequently, the importance of understanding how two machine learning models work beyond their prediction performances is key to understanding their behaviour, differences, and likeness. Some attempts have been made to address these problems, for instance, by explaining text classifiers in a time-contrastive fashion. In this paper, we present MERLIN , a novel eXplainable AI approach that provides contrastive explanations of two machine learning models, introducing the concept of model-contrastive explanations. We propose an encoding that allows MERLIN to work with both text and tabular data and with mixed continuous and discrete features. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it on an extensive set of benchmark datasets. MERLIN is also implemented as a python-pip package.},
