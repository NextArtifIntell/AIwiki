  abstract     = {Vehicle being at fault in a crash has extensively been associated with its driver&#39;s behaviors and other human errors for human-driven vehicles (HDV). The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) is expected to eliminate such human errors due to the ability of AVs to communicate with the external environment. However, various reports have documented AVs being at fault in collisions. This study applied text mining and mixed-effects logistic regression (MELR) on crash data involving AVs collected between 2017 and 2022 in California to explore the likelihood of an AV being at fault during a collision. It was found that among 497 crashes, a relatively small percentage (14.29 %) involved AVs being at fault. The text network results revealed patterns of keywords associated with the AVs being at fault. Such patterns include conventional mode of operation, area of impact, and resulting injuries. Furthermore, with about a 93 % prediction accuracy and an 83 % sensitivity score, the MELR results revealed that the likelihood of AVs being at fault increases when they are operated in conventional mode or when disengagement is involved. Moreover, turning, merging, or changing lane movements, unclear weather conditions, and operating on roadways with four or more lanes significantly increased the odds of an AV being at fault during a crash. Conversely, AVs were less likely to be at fault in commercial land use than residential land use, at intersection locations, and when the crash involved a truck. The practical implications of the findings are presented to improve AV operations.},

  abstract     = {With the advancements in human–robot interaction (HRI), robots are now capable of operating in close proximity and engaging in physical interactions with humans (pHRI). Likewise, contact-based pHRI is becoming increasingly common as robots are equipped with a range of sensors to perceive human motions. Despite the presence of surveys exploring various aspects of HRI and pHRI, there is presently a gap in comprehensive studies that collect, organize and relate developments across all aspects of contact-based pHRI. It has become challenging to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the field, thoroughly analyze the aspects that have been covered, and identify areas needing further attention. Hence, the present survey. While it includes key developments in pHRI, a particular focus is placed on contact-based interaction, which has numerous applications in industrial, rehabilitation and medical robotics. Across the literature, a common denominator is the importance to establish a safe, compliant and human intention-oriented interaction. This endeavour encompasses aspects of perception, planning and control, and how they work together to enhance safety and reliability. Notably, the survey highlights the application of data-driven techniques: backed by a growing body of literature demonstrating their effectiveness, approaches like reinforcement learning and learning from demonstration have become key to improving robot perception and decision-making within complex and uncertain pHRI scenarios. This survey also stresses how little attention has yet been dedicated to ethical considerations surrounding pHRI, including the development of contact-based pHRI systems that are appropriate for people and society. As the field is yet in its early stage, these observations may help guide future developments and steer research towards the responsible integration of physically interactive robots into workplaces, public spaces, and elements of private life.},

Kangaroo features high-power linear electric actuators combined with unique serial–parallel hybrid chains, which allow for the positioning of all the leg actuators near the base of the robot to improve the overall mass distribution. To model and analyze such complex nonlinear mechanisms, we employ a constrained formulation that is extended to account for floating-base systems in contact with the environment. A comparison is made to demonstrate the significant improvements achieved with TALOS, another humanoid bipedal robot designed by PAL Robotics, in terms of equivalent Cartesian inertia at the feet and centroidal angular momentum.

Physical consistency of the dynamics parameters ensures a positive definite mass matrix and correct constraint forces. The most common inverse dynamics identification method – the base-parameters – lack physical consistency. This paper proposes an identification method to identify physically consistent dynamics parameters for Delta-like robots while further showing the effects of friction in passive joints. A tailored model to compute the crucial constraint forces appearing in the mechanism based on the identified dynamics parameters is derived. This model is used to additionally consider constraint forces besides actuation torques for time-optimal motion planning of a typical pick and place task.

First, the heuristic function model in the ant colony algorithm is improved, the elite ant search strategy and the adaptive pheromone volatility factor strategy are introduced, and the initial path is searched in realize the motion environment with the help of the improved ant colony algorithm, and the initialized pheromone matrix is constructed. Second, the improved ant colony algorithm and Q-Learning (QL) algorithm are fused by utilizing the similarity between the pheromone matrix in the improved ant colony algorithm and the Q-matrix in the QL algorithm. A heuristic learning evaluation model is designed to dynamically adjust the learning factor and provide guidance for the search path. Additionally, a dynamic adaptive greedy strategy is introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation of the robot in the environment. Finally, the paths are smoothed using third-order Bessel curves to eliminate the problem of excessive steering angles. Through three sets of comparative simulation experiments conducted in Pycharm platform, the effectiveness, superiority, and practicality of the IAC-IQL algorithm were verified. The experimental results demonstrated that the IAC-IQL algorithm integrates the strong search capability of ant colony algorithm and the self-learning characteristics of QL algorithm. SAR robots equipped with the improved IAC-IQL algorithm exhibit significantly enhanced iterative search efficiency in grid simulation environment and image sampling simulation environment. The global path optimization indicators demonstrate high efficiency, and the paths are smoother.},

  abstract     = {Bearings and gears are critical components in modern industry, and cross-domain diagnosis of these elements is of great significance. However, in practical applications, challenges such as insufficient training data and variability between equipment arise. To address this issue, this study proposes an innovative neural network structure, ConvNeXt, and a Multi-Scale Dilated Attention (MSDA) mechanism to improve the accuracy problem caused by inadequate feature extraction. ConvNeXt improves upon traditional convolutional neural networks by introducing a multi-scale attention mechanism to enhance the model&#39;s performance and expressiveness. Through parallel multi-channel convolution operations, ConvNeXt can capture dependencies between different channels and reduce the number of parameters. Meanwhile, the MSDA mechanism allows signals to interact and exchange information at different scales, effectively extracting complex features in one-dimensional signals. Experimental results demonstrate a significant performance improvement in one-dimensional signal processing using ConvNeXt and MSDA, better capturing relationships between global and local features in one-dimensional signals and enhancing model accuracy. The joint application of ConvNeXt and MSDA brings new solutions to one-dimensional signal processing, offering potential opportunities for effective monitoring of critical components in rotating machinery. Experimental results show that this method achieves high diagnostic accuracy in various transfer tasks, with an average accuracy of 94.28%, providing reliable support for bearing fault diagnosis.},

WLVs excel in transportation on unstructured terrain by offering a unique combination of the efficiency of wheels on flat ground and the versatility of legs to tackle obstacles. To enhance the locomotion performance of WLVs on unstructured terrains, this paper presents a novel framework for improving their locomotion through nonlinear programming-based (NLP) trajectory optimization and stability control. The framework optimizes the vehicle’s body and wheel positioning while incorporating terrain information and employs a linear rigid body dynamic model for efficient motion planning. The stability control framework combines feedforward control using ground reaction forces with feedback control through joint PD control and utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to adjust the wheel slip ratio to prevent slip on steep slopes. Experimental validation on the real vehicle with torque-controlled wheels demonstrated the capability of driving over a 1 m height with a 30°slope at an average speed of 0.7 m/s and a maximum speed of 1.03 m/s. Our approach also enables the WLV to overcome obstacles, such as inclines, while dynamically negotiating these challenging terrains.},

However, pre-processing methods are designed to improve the subjective perception of the human eye, which does not necessarily improve the object detection performance and consumes a large amount of computational resources. Therefore, in this paper, we creatively combine these two tasks and propose a Shape-Guided Detection network (SGD) to simultaneously optimize underwater image enhancement and object detection. In the SGD network, we innovatively incorporate the prior shape features as a learnable module embedded in it to fully explore the shape characteristics and structural details of the target object. To ensure that the prior knowledge can be effectively fused into the global network structure, we design a Shape Prior Enhancement module, which aims to realize the deep integration of the prior information with the local details. In order to optimize the stability of model training and enhance its convergence performance, a dual strategy of explicit and implicit constraints is ingeniously proposed in our method. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets and the results show that the combination of our method with different detectors significantly improves the performance. The object detection performance reaches up to 0.491 mAP for optical images and 0.576 mAP for sonar images, and improves the preprocessing speed by 0.1 s.},

  abstract     = {As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking. The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory, particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle, demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) has shown superior performance for mapless navigation tasks. However, it remains limited in unstructured environments that might contain terrains like long corridors and dead corners, which can lead to local minima. This is because most HRL-based mapless navigation methods employ a simplified reward setting and exploration strategy. In this work, we propose a novel reward function for training the high-level (HL) policy, which contains two components: extrinsic reward and intrinsic reward. The extrinsic reward encourages the robot to move towards the target location, while the intrinsic reward is computed based on novelty, episode memory and memory decaying, making the agent capable of accomplishing spontaneous exploration. We also design a novel neural network structure that incorporates an LSTM network to augment the agent with memory and reasoning capabilities. We test our method in unknown environments and specific scenarios prone to the local minimum problem to evaluate the navigation performance and local minimum resolution ability. The results show that our method significantly increases the success rate when compared to advanced RL-based methods, achieving a maximum improvement of nearly 28%. Our method demonstrates effective improvement in addressing the local minimum issue, especially in cases where the baselines fail completely. Additionally, numerous ablation studies consistently confirm the effectiveness of our proposed reward function and neural network structure.},

The informativeness is measured by the reduction in uncertainty in our estimate, evaluated using several Gaussian process-based metrics. We present a convex relaxation for this informative path planning problem, which we can readily solve to obtain a bound on the possible performance. We develop an approximate sequential method where the path is constructed segment by segment through dynamic programming. This involves solving an orienteering problem, with the node reward acting as a surrogate for informativeness, taking the first step, and then repeating the process. The method scales to very large problem instances and achieves performance close to the bound produced by the convex relaxation. We also demonstrate our method’s ability to handle adaptive objectives, multimodal sensing, and multi-agent variations of the informative path planning problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new control strategy for Mobile Manipulator Systems (MMSs) that integrates image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to address operational limitations and safety constraints. The proposed approach based on the concept of control barrier functions (CBFs), provides a solution to address various operational challenges including visibility constraints, manipulator joint limits, predefined system velocity bounds, and system dynamic uncertainties. The proposed control strategy is a two-tiered structure, wherein the first level, a CBF-IBVS controller calculates control commands, taking into account the Field of View (FoV) constraints. By leveraging null space techniques, these commands are transposed to the joint-level configuration of the MMS, while considering system operational limits. Subsequently, in the second level, a CBF velocity controller employed for the entire MMS undertakes the tracking of the commands at the joint level, ensuring compliance with the predefined system’s velocity limitations as well as the safety of the whole combined system dynamics. The proposed control strategy offers superior transient and steady-state responses and heightened resilience to disturbances and modeling uncertainties. Furthermore, due to its low computational complexity, it can be easily implemented on an onboard computing system, facilitating real-time operation. The proposed strategy’s effectiveness is illustrated via simulation outcomes, which reveal enhanced performance and system safety compared to conventional IBVS methods. The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in addressing the challenging operational limitations and safety constraints of mobile manipulator systems, making it suitable for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {With the fast improvement of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL) has been used to automate human tasks in different areas. However, training such agents is difficult and restricted to expert users. Moreover, it is mostly limited to simulation environments due to the high cost and safety concerns of interactions in the real-world. Demonstration Learning is a paradigm in which an agent learns to perform a task by imitating the behavior of an expert shown in demonstrations. Learning from demonstration accelerates the learning process by improving sample efficiency, while also reducing the effort of the programmer. Because the task is learned without interacting with the environment, demonstration learning allows the automation of a wide range of real-world applications such as robotics and healthcare. This paper provides a survey of demonstration learning, where we formally introduce the demonstration problem along with its main challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of the process of learning from demonstrations from the creation of the demonstration data set, to learning methods from demonstrations, and optimization by combining demonstration learning with different machine learning methods. We also review the existing benchmarks and identify their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the paradigm as well as its main applications. Lastly, we discuss the open problems and future research directions of the field.},

The diverse demands of these applications have led to numerous design innovations, growing the MAV landscape substantially. However, such growth has made it challenging to understand the evolution and classification of MAV designs based on their functions and features. We address this challenge by introducing a novel, bio-inspired taxonomic classification framework for MAVs. Our framework spans six hierarchical ranks, each containing a diverse set of categories that classify MAVs from distinct design perspectives. It enables a proper comparison of the MAV designs in the literature, revealing their key similarities and differences. It also helps to trace the evolution of MAVs over time, identifying research trends and potential gaps. Lastly, it offers insights into future MAV design trajectories, providing a complete and clear understanding of the MAV design landscape.},

The novelty of this solution lies in the adjustment approach for the power law . In this work, inspired by features of human hand movements, the overall curvature of non-circular shapes is considered as the shape-dependent criterion for motion planning.

In this paper DewROS2 is presented, a platform for Dew Robotics that comprises entities to monitor the system status and to share it with interested applications. The design and implementation of the platform is presented together with the monitoring entities created. DewROS2 has been deployed on different real devices, including an unmanned aerial vehicle and an industrial router, to move from theory to practice and to analyze the impact of monitoring on robot resources. DewROS2 has also been tested in a search and rescue use case where robots are used to collect and transmit videos to spot signs of humans in trouble. Results in controlled and uncontrolled conditions show that the monitoring nodes do not have a significant impact on the performance while providing important and measurable benefits to the applications. Accurately monitoring of robot resources, for example, allows the search and rescue application to almost double the utilization of the network, therefore collecting video at a much higher resolution.},

To accurately jump in such conditions, we propose a framework using deep reinforcement learning that leverages and augments the complex solution of nonlinear trajectory optimization for quadrupedal jumping. While the standalone optimization limits jumping to take-off from flat ground and requires accurate assumptions of robot dynamics, our proposed approach improves the robustness to allow jumping off of significantly uneven terrain with variable robot dynamical parameters and environmental conditions. Compared with walking and running, the realization of aggressive jumping on hardware necessitates accounting for the motors’ torque-speed relationship as well as the robot’s total power limits. By incorporating these constraints into our learning framework, we successfully deploy our policy sim-to-real without further tuning, fully exploiting the available onboard power supply and motors. We demonstrate robustness to environment noise of foot disturbances of up to 6 cm in height, or 33% of the robot’s nominal standing height, while jumping 2 x the body length in distance.},

  abstract     = {Rhythmic motions are traditionally achieved by developing predetermined paths for the states of the space system to follow. Since these paths are obtained offline, the dynamic behavior fails to adapt to changes in environmental conditions or user command desires. The solution we propose is a new strategy called dynamic shaping, in which the paths are formed online to allow the system to create an orbit with the characteristics we need. Hereupon, this paper focuses on applying this strategy to Dynamics with One Degree of Under-actuation and Impulsive Phenomenon (DSODUIP) to adapt the characteristics of outcomes to be in line with the demands. This research was conducted by leveraging the advantages of virtual holonomic constraints (VHCs) to establish these paths. Therefore, a novel two-level hierarchical control method is designed considering a stability criterion to avoid divergence. At the Low-Level, the controllers stabilize the output of system to follow the VHCs on the system. At the High-Level, the VHCs are modified to shape an orbit with our desired characteristic in the motion. As an illustrative example, the algorithm is implemented to adjust the average angular velocity of a devil stick and the hip velocity of a Three-Link biped robot. Their results vividly demonstrate smooth adjustments and efficient performance in achieving our desired outcomes.},

Firstly, an improved double quintic polynomial planning model considering different motion states and sizes of obstacles is constructed by introducing the lane change transition state to ensure the autonomous vehicle’s driving safety. Secondly, a multi-objective performance function considering various influencing factors is established to improve the driving performances of the autonomous vehicle during lane-changing and overtaking. Finally, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize parameters of the proposed planning model, such as the lane change time, transition speed, and longitudinal displacement, to generate a driveability trajectory that meets the driving safety, comfort, stability, and low emission requirements of the autonomous vehicle during lane-changing and overtaking. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planning model are verified by comparing it with several existing planning models under different driving conditions.},

One of the practical applications of IoRT is swarm robotics, where multiple robots collaborate in a shared workspace to accomplish assigned tasks that may be challenging or impossible for a single robot to conquer. Swarm robots are particularly useful in critical situations, such as post-earthquake scenarios, where they can locate survivors and provide assistance in areas inaccessible to humans. In these life-saving situations, reliable and prompt communication among swarm robots is of utmost importance. To address the need for highly dependable and low-latency communication in swarm robotics, this research introduces a novel hybrid approach called Multi-objective QoS optimization based on Support vector regression and Genetic algorithm (MQSG). The MQSG method consists of two main phases: Parameter Relationship Identification and Parameter Optimization. In the Parameter Relationship Identification phase, the relationship between network inputs (Packet inter-arrival time, Packet size, Transmission power, Distance between sender and receiver) and outputs (quality of service (QoS) parameters) is established using support vector regression. In the parameter optimization phase, a multi-objective function is created based on the obtained relationships from the Parameter Relationship Identification phase. By solving this multi-objective function, optimal values for each QoS parameter are determined, leading to enhanced network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the MQSG method outperforms other similar algorithms in terms of transmission latency, packet delivery rate, and the number of retransmitted packets.},

  abstract     = {In field robotics, particularly in the agricultural sector, precise localization presents a challenge due to the constantly changing nature of the environment. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithms can provide an effective estimation of a robot’s position, but their long-term performance may be impacted by false data associations. Additionally, alternative strategies such as the use of RTK-GPS can also have limitations, such as dependence on external infrastructure. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel stability scan filter. This filter can learn and infer the motion status of objects in the environment, allowing it to identify the most stable objects and use them as landmarks for robust robot localization in a continuously changing environment. The proposed method involves an unsupervised point-wise labelling of LiDAR frames by utilizing temporal observations of the environment, as well as a regression network, called Long-Term Stability Network (LTS-NET) to learn and infer 3D LiDAR points long-term motion status. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the stability scan filter to infer the motion stability of objects on a real agricultural long-term dataset. Results show that by only utilizing points belonging to long-term stable objects, the localization system exhibits reliable and robust localization performance for long-term missions compared to using the entire LiDAR frame points.},

  abstract     = {We describe an adaptive control framework for changing-contact robot manipulation tasks that require the robot to make and break contacts with objects and surfaces. The piecewise continuous interaction dynamics of such tasks make it difficult to construct and use a single dynamics model or control strategy. Also, the nonlinear dynamics during contact changes can damage the robot or the domain objects. Our framework enables the robot to incrementally improve its prediction of contact changes in such tasks, efficiently learn models for the piecewise continuous interaction dynamics, and to provide smooth and accurate trajectory tracking based on a task-space variable impedance controller. We experimentally compare the performance of our framework against that of representative control methods to establish that the adaptive control, prediction, and incremental learning capabilities of our framework are essential to achieve the desired smooth control of changing-contact robot manipulation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Accurate depth estimation from monocular images is critical for various applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. However, achieving high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency is a major challenge, particularly for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present LightDepth , an approach that leverages curriculum learning to estimate depth efficiently while taking into account resource constraints. It modifies the ground truth sparse depth maps from the KITTI dataset by resizing them to 31 extents during training to reduce sparsity and control complexity. The resulting model achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art large models while outperforming them in response time by 71%. Our approach outperforms resource-efficient models regarding depth accuracy (measured by RMSE), achieving a 56% improvement. LightDepth is designed to be fast and resource-efficient, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained devices. It also balances the trade-off between accuracy and resource efficiency.

  abstract     = {A neurochip is a device that reproduces the signal processing mechanisms of brain neurons and calculates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with low power consumption and at high speed. Thus, neurochips are attracting attention from edge robot applications, which suffer from limited battery capacity. This paper aims to achieve deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that acquires SNN policies suitable for neurochip implementation. Since DRL requires a complex function approximation, we focus on conversion techniques from Floating Point NN (FPNN) because it is one of the most feasible SNN techniques. However, DRL requires conversions to SNNs for every policy update to collect the learning samples for a DRL-learning cycle, which updates the FPNN policy and collects the SNN policy samples. Accumulative conversion errors can significantly degrade the performance of the SNN policies. We propose Robust Iterative Value Conversion (RIVC) as a DRL that incorporates conversion error reduction and robustness to conversion errors. To reduce them, FPNN is optimized with the same number of quantization bits as an SNN. The FPNN output is not significantly changed by quantization. To robustify the conversion error, an FPNN policy that is applied with quantization is updated to increase the gap between the probability of selecting the optimal action and other actions. This step prevents unexpected replacements of the policy’s optimal actions. We verified RIVC’s effectiveness on a neurochip-driven robot. The results showed that RIVC consumed 1/15 times less power and increased the calculation speed by five times more than an edge CPU (quad-core ARM Cortex-A72). The previous framework with no countermeasures against conversion errors failed to train the policies. Videos from our experiments are available: https://youtu.be/Q5Z0-BvK1Tc .},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a compound planning algorithm considering both collision detection and obstacle avoidance for intelligent demolition robots working safely in high-radiation environments. Firstly, configurations and kinematics of the intelligent demolition robot are detailed to detect the possible obstacles in its workspace. A collision detection function based on the improved dual vector method is proposed to detect the different distances between the robot and obstacles in three cases: a point and a line segment, two line segments, and a line segment and a geometric shape. This function can also be applied to detect collisions with various obstacles of different shapes reasonably and efficiently. Furthermore, an obstacle avoidance function based on modified gradient projection method considering multi-task transformation is proposed. According to the different distances between the robot and the obstacle, it can be used in three situations: end obstacle avoidance task, end effector operation task, and end trajectory tracking task. This function can be applied to avoid obstacles both in the workspace and on the desired path. Finally, a simulation system is established to verify the collision detection and obstacle avoidance algorithms of the intelligent demolition robot. An experiment was conducted on the intelligent demolition robot. This robot can successfully achieve the expected trajectory with the method described in this article. Results of simulation and experiment demonstrate that obstacles both in workspace and on desired path can be detected and avoided properly.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we developed an upper-limb power-assisted wearable robot designed to reduce the burden of handling repetitive medium- to low-weight loads for daily logistics workers, thereby enhancing their work efficiency and overall safety. This study proposes a practical wearable robot with a well-designed structure for effectively supporting pick-and-place tasks at waist-to-shoulder height by applying a vertical force directly to the wearer’s wrist. The proposed robot features two active joints that are minimal for vertical assistance, resulting in a lightweight and compact structure. It offers six degrees of freedom per arm, including four passive joints, allowing free end-effector movement. Designed to connect only to the wearer’s wrist, the robot’s linkage is positioned along the wearer’s arm, not requiring alignment with the human–robot joint center, making it easy to wear and having a simple structure. This paper presents a method for calculating the joint torque that accounts for the deformation of the robot’s lightweight and slim links. This approach enhances the gravity compensation accuracy, and the proposed method demonstrates a lower RMS error compared to calculations based on the statics of the rigid link model. Experimental results demonstrated that the robot allowed for a wide range of motion and consistently applied an assistive force of 2 kgf per arm, facilitating the handling of objects weighing several kilograms.},

We developed the experimental prototype with a tracked locomotion mechanism weighing 1.2 kg, measuring 212 mm × 294 mm × 131 mm, and capable of carrying a payload of 2 kg. The battery life of the prototype is 3.5 h in standby mode and 1.8 h in moving mode. The prototype is controlled remotely through video transmission in manual mode and can move on both vertical and horizontal surfaces, and transition between them. The prototype has demonstrated the ability to move along a vertical surface, transition from a horizontal to a vertical surface, and recover from an unstable position in the case of a capsize.

This solution is capable of addressing the unique challenges of implementing automation solutions in large parts manufacturing, such as flexibility to manufacture small lot sizes, perception for complex task sequences, and handling parts with large dimensions that cannot be captured in single camera frames. A solution based on one single vision sensor is presented for part type recognition, part localization, process monitoring, and quality inspection. This includes algorithms for these perception functionalities and a closed-loop control framework aimed at zero-defect manufacturing. The task planning and execution architecture is based on Behavior Trees to allow modular and scalable robot task modeling and execution, whereas a knowledge database updated with process monitoring results via a module named event manager serves to prevent the propagation of defects to the following production steps. The proposed approach was tested and validated in a robotic cell for glue dispensing for a case study inspired by the bus and coach sector.

The measured angles are subsequently translated into exoskeleton hand-fingertip positions utilized as the primary inputs. A 3D electrothermal microgripper based tele-micro manipulation system is realized. The displacement of the exoskeleton fingertips is harnessed to govern the actions of the microgripper via an effective position incremental control method. Furthermore, the system&#39;s capabilities are exemplified through intricate micromanipulations performed on soft zebrafish embryos.

  abstract     = {Rational foot-end trajectory planning and control are of great significance for stable-legged walking of heavy-duty multi-legged robots. To achieve a fast, active, and compliant response of the leg actuator to disturbances for improvement of the stability and flexibility of the heavy-duty legged robot system during continuous walking on rough roads, a legged consensus control method (LCC) is proposed. Firstly, the LCC includes a foot-end trajectory planner model for designing the trajectory during the swing phase to ensure that the robot’s feet are always in a safe workspace during legged motion with continuously variable direction. Secondly, LCC constructs a consensus control method for encoding foot-end position and velocity consensus error based on variable topology networks. Six legs are treated as six intelligent agents and divided into two fully connected networks: the swing phase and stance phase, to achieve smooth and consistent motion that satisfies the geometric constraints of the robot. The foot-end agent can switch between swing and stance groups according to the state of the contact with the environment accompanied by the amendment topology, to enhance the robustness of the robot system through fast compliance control of the foot-end kinematics state. Then, the sliding mode control method based on consensus velocity and position error is deduced in LCC. The sliding mode surface is designed to make the three control variables realize stable movement with a consistent state of foot-end in three X , Y , Z X,Y,Z -axis respectively, thereby enhancing the stability of foot-end state and fuselage posture. Finally, simulation and experiments have verified that the proposed LCC can assist legged-robot perform relatively steady legged motion with continuously variable direction on various rugged roads. The body attitude Root Mean Square Error ( R M S E RMSE ) is quickly reduced by 81.0% compared with independent PI control.

The legs are modeled as N-link manipulators, and parallel tracking MPC controllers are implemented to optimize torques. This approach results in improved motion control and comprehensive four-wheel independent steering mechanism maneuvers. The experiments and results demonstrate the practical feasibility and robustness of the proposed control approach, with Pegasus exhibiting stable balancing, precise motion control, and the ability to navigate through challenging paths. Overall, the proposed control architecture provides a promising solution for achieving hybrid locomotion capabilities in quadruped wheel-legged robots.},

  abstract     = {Real time on-ground information is of critical value during any natural disaster such as floods. The disaster response teams require the latest ground information of the flooded areas to effectively plan and execute rescue operations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming a tool to perform quick surveys of larger areas such as flood disasters. In this paper, we propose a method to perform critical area coverage of flood-struck regions using multiple autonomous UAVs. A Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is proposed to learn continuous multi-UAV controls, incorporating a directed exploration strategy for the DDPG’s target actor, which relies on the D-infinity (DINF) algorithm. The DINF water flow estimation technique utilizes surface elevation data to understand and predict the directed discharge of floodwater. Further, we introduce a Path scatter strategy for the multi-UAV system that inhibits the clustered formation of the UAVs over low-elevated regions. The performance of the proposed D3S (DDPG+DINF+Path Scatter) algorithm is evaluated using various performance metrics, such as average cumulative rewards, number of collisions, and UAVs’ spread observed over the environment. In comparison to the baseline algorithms and other prevalent approaches in the literature, the proposed method is found to be better placed as the results highlight a significantly improved performance by D3S across different metrics.},

In this context, robots are tasked with delivering objects in formation while avoiding intra- and inter-formation collisions. This necessitates the development of solutions for multi-robot task allocation, formation generation, rigid formation route planning, and formation coordination. In this paper, we present a cooperative formation object transportation system for heterogeneous multi-robot systems which captures robot dynamics and avoids inter-formation collisions. Accounting for heterogeneous formations expands the applicability of the proposed robotic transport system. For formation generation, we propose an approach based on conflict-based search, which integrates high-level path planning with low-level trajectory optimisation. For heterogeneous formation planning, we present a two-stage iterative trajectory optimisation framework which adheres to the kinematic constraints of our heterogeneous multi-robot system while retaining formation rigidity. For multi-formation coordination, we use a loosely-coupled algorithm which can guarantee collision-free and deadlock-free formation navigation under minimal assumptions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in simulation.},

Thanks to recent improvements in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, and novel methods for automating vehicles, more safe and efficient transport mechanisms have been achieved. Current vehicles are already connected devices, and communications between vehicles, infrastructure and other road users will allow traffic agents to share information and use it to coordinate their actions. The full integration between cooperation, connectivity, and automation technologies entail an important achievement to improve road safety, traffic efficiency and comfort of driving. To approach this goal, the main contributions of this work propose a new distributed mission system based on Advanced Behavioral Points (ABP). That is, based on relevant points inside a plan which store a collection of predefined tasks that operate at the high level layer of an automated and connected vehicle to coordinate behaviors when connecting to critical emplacements like junctions and roundabouts. This approach, which has been tested in the simulation environment of Carla, provide a collaboration stack between the traffic infrastructure and the ego vehicle so as to cope with actual problems such as traffic congestion and road accidents.},

  abstract     = {Many daily tasks exhibit a periodic nature, necessitating that robots possess the ability to execute them either alone or in collaboration with humans. A widely used approach to encode and learn such periodic patterns from human demonstrations is through periodic Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs). Periodic DMPs encode cyclic data independently across multiple dimensions of multi-degree of freedom systems. This method is effective for simple data, like Cartesian or joint position trajectories. However, it cannot account for various geometric constraints imposed by more complex data, such as orientation and stiffness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel periodic DMP formulation that enables the encoding of periodic orientation trajectories and varying stiffness matrices while considering their geometric constraints. Our geometry-aware approach exploits the properties of the Riemannian manifold and Lie group to directly encode such periodic data while respecting its inherent geometric constraints. We initially employed simulation to validate the technical aspects of the proposed method thoroughly. Subsequently, we conducted experiments with two different real-world robots performing daily tasks involving periodic changes in orientation and/or stiffness, i.e., operating a drilling machine using a rotary handle and facilitating collaborative human–robot sawing.},

  abstract     = {In the real world, multi-robot systems need to deal with on-the-fly (runtime) arrivals of new sets of tasks. This entails repeated adjustments of their current task allocations to include the newer ones while also ensuring that the overall performance does not degrade. This paper proposes a decentralized and distributed dynamic task allocation algorithm to handle this issue in a multi-robot scenario. The proposed work provides a conflict-free allocation of a set of tasks constituting a job to robots and minimizes the total execution time . These jobs can comprise multiple independent and/or dependent tasks or a combination thereof, which are injected on-the-fly into a network of robots. The dependent tasks of a job are related by precedence constraints that specify the ordering or dependencies between pairs of tasks. The work also describes a decentralized adaptive energy threshold mechanism for determining whether or not a robot needs to visit a battery stockpile after the execution of a task. Conflicting task selections among the robots in this decentralized set-up are resolved using mobile agents during runtime. Apart from allocating tasks to the robots, these mobile agents exploit the benefits of centralized and decentralized systems and provide an advantage over auction-based task allocation algorithms. The proposed algorithm takes into consideration the energy requirements, both during the task allocation process and actual execution. The proposed algorithm also caters to strategies to deal with delays caused by obstacles and congestion during the actual execution of the tasks. Experiments conducted using Webots , an open-source robot simulator, and Tartarus , a multi-agent platform, authenticate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to other prominent task allocation algorithms in terms of minimization of average waiting time , total task allocation time , total job allocation time , and total execution time of an experiment.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses a novel aerial robot architecture that overcomes the underactuation of conventional multirotor systems without adding dedicated rotor tilting actuators. The proposed system is based on four quadrotors cooperatively carrying a central body to which they are attached through passive universal joints. While conventional parallel axis multirotors are underactuated, the proposed mechanism makes the system overactuated, enabling independent position and orientation control of the main body. This implies that the payload can be carried in the minimum drag orientation, it enables take-off and landing on inclined surfaces and it provides thrust-vectoring capabilities to the system, leading to high control authority. A detailed dynamic model is derived making use of Lagrangian formalism and a hierarchical control law based on such model is proposed to stabilize the system. This control law is designed to ensure good tracking while minimizing power consumption. The proposed control law and the capabilities of the architecture are evaluated in simulation and in outdoor experimental flights, where the aerial robot shows autonomous tracking of the six degrees of freedom (DoF) of the main body, an inherently unfeasible maneuver for conventional underactuated multirotors.},

  abstract     = {The ability of robots to navigate through doors is crucial for their effective operation in indoor environments. Consequently, extensive research has been conducted to develop robots capable of opening specific doors. However, the diverse combinations of door handles and opening directions necessitate a more versatile door opening system for robots to successfully operate in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose a mobile manipulator system that can autonomously open various doors without prior knowledge. By using convolutional neural networks, point cloud extraction techniques, and external force measurements during exploratory motion, we obtained information regarding handle types, poses, and door characteristics. Through two different approaches, adaptive position-force control and deep reinforcement learning, we successfully opened doors without precise trajectory or excessive external force. The adaptive position-force control method involves moving the end-effector in the direction of the door opening while responding compliantly to external forces, ensuring safety and manipulator workspace. Meanwhile, the deep reinforcement learning policy minimizes applied forces and eliminates unnecessary movements, enabling stable operation across doors with different poses and widths. The RL-based approach outperforms the adaptive position-force control method in terms of compensating for external forces, ensuring smooth motion, and achieving efficient speed. It reduces the maximum force required by 3.27 times and improves motion smoothness by 1.82 times. However, the non-learning-based adaptive position-force control method demonstrates more versatility in opening a wider range of doors, encompassing revolute doors with four distinct opening directions and varying widths.},

In this paper, in order to fully understand the obstacle–surmounting ability of the robot, the relationship between the position of the center of gravity and the posture of the front and rear swing arms is analyzed. Based on the motion mechanism of the robot crossing obstacles, the geometric model and the dynamic model are established for the key states in the obstacle crossing process. Based on these models, a multi-objective optimization problem for the maximum obstacle–crossing height and minimum driving torque is established during the obstacle crossing process of the robot, which must meet geometric, slip, and stability constraints. To effectively handle the optimization problem of tracked mobile robots, an improved non–dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elite strategy version II based on adaptive genetic strategy (NSGA-II-AGS) is proposed in this paper. Some meaningful relationships between the objective function and the design variables are obtained through sensitivity analysis. Finally, the robot&#39;s obstacle-crossing ability was verified through virtual simulation and prototype experiments. These excellent performances enable the proposed NSGA-II-AGS to be qualified for dealing with the multi-objective optimization problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel dynamic motion planner designed to provide safe motions in the context of the Smart Autonomous Robot Assistant Surgeon (SARAS) surgical platform. SARAS is a multi-robot autonomous platform designed to execute auxiliary tasks in Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS) with a high degree of autonomy. The development of robotic systems with a high level of autonomy and reliability requires to perceive the workspace and human actions, to contextualize them with the surgical workflow, and, finally, plan and dynamically control the required motions. The autonomous control relies on a multi-level hierarchical Finite State Machine (hFSM) that decides and supervises all robot actions and their transitions. This approach requires multi-granularity decomposition of the surgical procedure and defines different motion profiles to preserve and safely interacts with the patients’ anatomy. The motion planner is developed under the minimally invasive surgery context since it is an extreme use case where the environment is complex, dynamic and unstructured. Moreover, in the SARAS platform the autonomous robots share workspace as well as collaborate with other human-guided robotic instruments. This creates an even more complex working environment and defines a set of hierarchical relationships in which auxiliary instruments have a lower priority. The presented motion planner acts at two levels: Global and Local. The Global Planner generates an initial spline-based trajectory that, defined by a set of Control Points, follows a certain profile determined by the ongoing surgical action and the interaction with the patient’s anatomy. Then, during the execution of the motion, the Local Planner observes the workspace (anatomy and other tools) and applies different virtual potential fields to the control points to dynamically modify their position to avoid potential collisions or tool blocking while maintaining trajectory coherence. At this level, it reactively modifies the trajectory between the tool position and the next control point applying Dynamical Systems based obstacle avoidance. This approach ensures collision free connections between the spline control points. The proposed motion planner is validated in a realistic surgical scenario. The experimental results are analysed from data collected during various Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy surgeries on manikins, performed with the SARAS SOLO-SURGERY platform: the main surgeon teleoperates a daVinci Research Kit and two robotic arms autonomously perform different auxiliary surgical tasks.},

It covers the design process, previous works, main challenges, and field testing. The main objective of the robot is to perform ultrasonic inspection over a heated separator tank while it operates. The metallic surfaces of the structure to be inspected are under constant high temperatures (80 °C–135 °C) when in operation. CRAS presents magnetic wheels as an adhesion method and a perception system able to identify and follow weld beads. The NDT method uses the phased-array ultrasonic technique. This paper approaches and proposes a solution for three challenges due to the high temperature: the loss of robot adhesion, ultrasound signal deformation, and the risk of damaging sensitive equipment such as sensors, cameras, and any electronic component.

The system is based on a continuous variable stiffness wrist. A wrist was created that met the requirements and a combination of active and passive control methods was suggested to insert and regulate forces effectively. The control strategy is based on the Cosserat rod model, with the fundamental concept being calculating the position and orientation of the component using data on the force exerted during contact between the parts and the stiffness of the contact between the shaft and hole components. This process converts the hard assembly into a flexible contact. Compliance is monitored via force and vision sensors, which allows for the shaft-hole assembly operation to be carried out even with attitude alignment problems, resulting in a notable decrease in the precision needed for component alignment. Initially, the camera supplies the first positional data of the shaft component for the robotic system. In addition, the performance of the wrist with variable stiffness is evaluated in terms of stiffness. Additionally, the calculation of relative deformation between components is examined using contact force information. Moreover, a robust active/passive hybrid insertion control technique, which relies on contact force, is proposed. Finally, the shaft-hole assembly task substantiates the necessity for contact force monitoring in the insertion assembly process. This control technique has demonstrated its efficacy in ensuring passive-compliant assembly performance. Furthermore, the variable stiffness wrist has been employed in robotic grinding for surfaces with curved contours to validate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The integration of robotics in nursing is a significant shift in healthcare, driven by the aging global population and the increasing demand for care. Robots in nursing can handle less technical tasks such as patient transport and rehabilitation activities. This support allows caregivers to focus on less strenuous nursing duties and more direct patient care. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) plays an important role in this challenging context. In this research, we present an autonomous hospital transport system based on the ROS 2 framework, focusing on enhancing HRI in the healthcare environment. It encompasses the development of a control architecture for autonomous robot behavior, the implementation of machine learning for emergency detection, and the creation of a user-friendly interface for both patients and staff. The proposed concepts were validated in real-world scenarios in three different hospitals in Germany. This not only demonstrates the practical application of this system but also shares insights and methods, encouraging further advancement in the field of healthcare robotics.},

  abstract     = {Accurate depth information is crucial for autonomous systems to navigate and interact safely with their surroundings. Passive stereo-vision cameras, such as the ZED 2i, obtain depth information through stereo-image analysis and triangulation. The study measures and assesses the true capabilities of the ZED 2i camera in a real indoor office environment. Furthermore, the study provides a standard test setup to reproduce similar benchmarks with different depth cameras. To achieve the set goals, an experiment was devised and carried out in an office environment to determine the camera depth error and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the depth estimates at different distances using four different image resolutions. The results reveal that the depth error has heavy tails, implying that outliers substantially impact accuracy. Hence, depth errors should not be modeled as normally distributed errors. Moreover, only two out of four resolutions provided the capability of acquiring depth data up to 18 m. These insights provide guidelines for understanding the ZED 2i camera&#39;s true capabilities, determining its suitability for different applications and environments, and giving baselines for future tests of other competing sensor units. Furthermore, the study offers a simple, inexpensive, and laboratory space-free, yet effective setup that does not need extensive equipment or complex configurations to facilitate the benchmarking of depth cameras in different working environments.},

  abstract     = {Although industrial robots have been successfully used in a wide spectrum of applications for production automation, they still face challenges for many high precision tasks especially in low-volume high-mix production due to their low absolute positioning accuracy. To respond to such rapidly changing production tasks, an efficient means is required to determine the pose relationship between the robot and the workpiece without human intervention such as teaching the robot. For this purpose, the paper proposes the use of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with an optical tracking system to improve the robot positioning accuracy with a particular focus on the target point tracking of the end-of-arm tool, which is an essential part for many robotic tasks. To this end, a comprehensive kinematic error model is first derived for the end-of-arm tool that accounts for the errors in the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters, the positioning errors of the robot base and the end-of-arm tool installation. Then, by using the optical tracking system, the pose of the end-of-arm tool relative to the workpiece can be determined in an efficient way. Based on the EKF algorithm, the kinematic parameter errors of the system can be estimated online to compensate the positioning error of the target point during the robot movement. Simulation and experimental tests have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed approach utilizes the given trajectory to design a compensation scheme where the kinematic parameter errors of the robot are estimated during the motion and then the positioning error of the end-of-arm tool is compensated at the target point. As a result, this approach can improve the target point accuracy of the robot without continuous feedback to reduce the tracking error along the trajectory in real time. It is easy to implement and suitable for low-volume, high-mix scenarios to determine the pose relationship between the robot and the workpiece without human intervention.},

The odometry estimation module of GLIM employs a combination of fixed-lag smoothing and keyframe-based point cloud matching that makes it possible to deal with a few seconds of completely degenerated range data while efficiently reducing trajectory estimation drift. It also incorporates multi-camera visual feature constraints in a tightly coupled way to further improve the stability and accuracy. The global trajectory optimization module directly minimizes the registration errors between submaps over the entire map. This approach enables us to accurately constrain the relative pose between submaps with a small overlap. Although both the odometry estimation and global trajectory optimization algorithms require much more computation than existing methods, we show that they can be run in real-time due to the careful design of the registration error evaluation algorithm and the entire system to fully leverage GPU parallel processing.},

The simulations considered a square bump-shaped obstacle, and the dimensions of the robot were based on nine simulation cases in a 3D environment. Additionally, a methodology for evaluating these seven criteria is outlined. To streamline the simulation process, Taguchi’s catalog of orthogonal arrays (OAs) was used for the experimental design, specifically L9 OA with four factors and three levels was used. Analysis of means (ANOM) was applied to assess the influence of each design factor on the seven criteria, leveraging the OA orthogonality. Finally, the sensitivity analysis and potential for evaluating general mobile robots in the future are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of robotics technology has driven the growth of robot types and the development of related technologies. As an important aspect of robot research, path planning technology plays an irreplaceable role in practical production and application. Ant colony algorithm has a wide range of applications in robot path planning, but there is also a problem of performance overly relying on initial parameter selection. In order to solve this problem and improve the performance of mobile robot path planning, an improved ant colony algorithm based on firefly algorithm was studied and designed in a two-dimensional environment. In order to further explore the performance of ant colony algorithm in solving robot coordinated path planning problems, an improved ant colony algorithm based on heuristic function was also designed. In a three-dimensional environment, an improved ant colony algorithm based on the improved artificial potential field method was designed. The research results show that the maximum running time of the improved ant colony algorithm based on the firefly algorithm in different grid environments is 819.36 s, 847.01 s, and 811.54 s, respectively. The average running time of the improved ant colony algorithm based on heuristic function in different grid environments is 5.19 s, 5.97 s, and 9.09 s, with average path lengths of 29.90 cm, 31.08 cm, and 37.01 cm, and path length variances of 0.35, 0.87, and 2.21, respectively. The ant colony algorithm based on the improved artificial potential field method has a running time of 1.930 s, 3.182 s, and 4.662 s in different grid environments, and a path length of 29.275 cm, 49.447 cm, and 67.057 cm, respectively. The ant colony algorithm for research and design optimization has good performance. The contribution of the research lies in the design of three path planning methods for mobile robots, including two-dimensional path planning and three-dimensional path planning, which improves the time of path planning and shortens the average path length. The novelty of the research is reflected in the design of a path planning method for mobile robots in two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments, which improves the ant colony algorithm through firefly algorithm and heuristic function, and combines the ant colony algorithm with the improved artificial potential field method. The method designed by the research institute can provide technical support for path planning of mobile robots.},

Departing from traditional reliance on robust discontinuous control strategies prone to chattering and demanding precise uncertainty bounds, our FTC method ensures fixed-time stability, guaranteeing the convergence of attitude tracking errors to zero. Central to our approach is an adaptive algorithm adept at concurrently estimating unknown actuator faults and upper bounds of lumped uncertainties. Moreover, our adaptive schemes accurately estimate the upper bound of the lumped uncertainty term, encompassing model uncertainties, external disturbances, and unmodeled dynamics, thereby eliminating the need for assuming known bounds on uncertainties. Stability analysis under the developed control law is thoroughly performed using the Lyapunov stability theory. Notably, our strategy employs an extended Kalman filter (EKF) observer for state estimation and fault detection, facilitating fault detection through an adaptive threshold technique dynamically adjusted based on real-time mean and variance of the residual signal. Through comprehensive simulation and experimental validations, our proposed methodology demonstrates significant advancements in ensuring safety and reliability in UAVs.},

Through the relationships between the control parameters of the Hopf oscillator, decoupling of the bifurcation parameters is achieved to solve inconsistent output waveform amplitude when the bifurcation parameters are not completely equal. Furthermore, five typical movement modes of biological snake are designed and smooth switch between different locomotion gaits is realized. A control system is constructed based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and a prototype of snake robot is built, and the effectiveness of the proposed CPG model in controlling locomotion gaits was verified through simulations and experiments.

In response to the difficulty of traditional control methods in solving various constraints in the trajectory tracking process of the Upper Limb Rehabilitation Robot (ULRR), this study uses model predictive control to study the trajectory tracking problem of the upper limb rehabilitation robot. Firstly, based on the Lagrangian dynamic model of wearable rehabilitation robots, an extended state space model with pseudo linearization of the system was established. Given the performance indicators and various constraints of the system, a corresponding model predictive controller is designed based on the Laguerre model to ensure system performance while greatly reducing the computational complexity of predictive control. Secondly, the stability of the model predictive controller is demonstrated, and a disturbance observer is introduced into the controller to achieve compensation for slow-varying perturbations; a joint space sliding mode variable is also introduced to achieve simultaneous tracking of the joint’s desired position and desired velocity. Finally, taking a planar two bar robot as an example, comparative simulation verification was conducted on unconstrained joint trajectory tracking and constrained joint trajectory tracking. The simulation results show that the model predictive controller can achieve simultaneous tracking of joint expected trajectory and expected speed while meeting various constraints. It has good effects in improving patient motion control ability and reducing patient fatigue, providing new research ideas and methods for the field of rehabilitation therapy.},

  abstract     = {Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are the most common occupational diseases caused by the prolonged performance of strenuous work, such as manual handling of loads or long-term maintenance of incongruous postures. Different safety protocols are implemented to reduce WMSDs and optimize the working environment, but one of the most promising solutions is using occupational exoskeletons (OEs). However, to truly acknowledge the benefits of OEs and be able to introduce them into daily business use, devices must pass several development and testing stages that determine the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). This review study aims to present an up-to-date collection of the most advanced assessments of exoskeletons for upper and back support, ranging from laboratory real-task simulations to operational scenarios in industrial sites. To identify relevant studies, we conducted comprehensive searches across different electronic databases, i.e., PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Different keywords were used for the literature search, e.g., occupational exoskeleton, industrial exoskeleton, etc. Studies were included if they investigated the assessment of exoskeletons in the laboratory with real tasks or an industrial environment. We identified 45 research articles that fulfilled this selection criterion. Several features are compared and discussed in detail, such as industrial environment, experimental protocol, task performed, and exoskeleton typology. These data allowed us to formulate results that report the correspondence or discrepancy between the number of papers testing exoskeletons and WMSDs in different industrial sectors, the type of assessment performed, and the impact of exoskeletons on workers and industries at different TRLs. Among the results, the incidence of WMSDs in the manufacturing industry is 21.13%, while the adoption of exoskeletons in the same field is the highest with respect to the other industrial fields, at 44.45%. Electromyography (EMG) and Questionnaires were the most evaluated typologies across all development and testing stages (with an incidence of 64% across the selected articles). Additionally, an average reduction of EMG activity was reported, with 24% for Upper Limb and 20% for Back Support. Regarding the subjective assessment reported in the questionnaires, 68% of the studies reported a positive evaluation. Based on these outcomes, this work provides a framework for an effective evaluation process for the OEs to raise TRL with recommendations for future research activities.},

  abstract     = {Online footstep planning is essential for bipedal walking robots, allowing them to walk in the presence of disturbances and sensory noise. Most of the literature on the topic has focused on optimizing the footstep placement while keeping the step timing constant. In this work, we introduce a footstep planner capable of optimizing footstep placement and step time online. The proposed planner, consisting of an Interior Point Optimizer (IPOPT) and an optimizer based on Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method with analytical gradient descent, solves the full dynamics of the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model in real time to optimize for footstep location as well as step timing at the rate of 200 Hz. We show that such asynchronous real-time optimization with the AL method (ARTO-AL) provides the required robustness and speed for successful online footstep planning. Furthermore, ARTO-AL can be extended to plan footsteps in 3D, allowing terrain-aware footstep planning on uneven terrains. Compared to an algorithm with no footstep time adaptation, our proposed ARTO-AL demonstrates increased stability in simulated walking experiments as it can resist pushes on flat ground and on a 10 ° 10° ramp up to 120 N and 100 N respectively. Videos 2 and open-source code 3 are released.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents adaptive and occupancy grid map algorithms for automatic lane change technology, a core technology in autonomous vehicles. The objectives are to improve driver safety and convenience with technology that automatically changes lanes at the request of the driver. The algorithms construct nine grids on the basis of ego vehicles and generate adaptive and occupancy grid maps by using the relative speeds of ego and target vehicles. When a driver requests a lane change, the adaptive grid map reduces the number of cases where the target vehicles may exist around the ego vehicle from 256 to 32, thus decreasing the calculation amount. Therefore, the algorithms are suitable for use in autonomous vehicles that require real-time calculations. An occupancy grid map is formed in accordance with the location of the target vehicles, and whether lane changes are possible is determined. The algorithms generate a virtual simulation environment with the CarMaker and are simulated using Matlab/Simulink. An experiment is conducted in a real driving environment with real vehicles to prove the validity of the algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

While related research primarily focuses on lightweight robots with electric motors and fast actuation, this study uses a forestry vehicle with a complex hydraulic driveline and slow actuation. We simulate the vehicle using multibody dynamics and apply system identification to find an appropriate set of simulation parameters. We then train policies in simulation using various techniques to mitigate the sim-to-real gap, including domain randomization, action delays, and a reward penalty to encourage smooth control. In reality, the policies trained with action delays and a penalty for erratic actions perform nearly at the same level as in simulation. In experiments on level ground, the motion trajectories closely overlap when turning to either side, as well as in a route tracking scenario. When faced with a ramp that requires active use of the suspensions, the simulated and real motions are in close alignment. This shows that the actuator model together with system identification yields a sufficiently accurate model of the actuators. We observe that policies trained without the additional action penalty exhibit fast switching or bang–bang control. These present smooth motions and high performance in simulation but transfer poorly to reality. We find that policies make marginal use of the local height map for perception, showing no indications of predictive planning. However, the strong transfer capabilities entail that further development concerning perception and performance can be largely confined to simulation.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {The recent success of hybrid methods in monocular odometry has led to many attempts to generalize the performance gains to hybrid monocular SLAM. However, most attempts fall short in several respects, with the most prominent issue being the need for two different map representations (local and global maps), with each requiring different, computationally expensive, and often redundant processes to maintain. Moreover, these maps tend to drift with respect to each other, resulting in contradicting pose and scene estimates, and leading to catastrophic failure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that makes use of descriptor sharing to generate a single inverse depth scene representation. This representation can be used locally, queried globally to perform loop closure, and has the ability to re-activate previously observed map points after redundant points are marginalized from the local map, eliminating the need for separate map maintenance processes. The maps generated by our method exhibit no drift between each other, and can be computed at a fraction of the computational cost and memory footprint required by other monocular SLAM systems. Despite the reduced resource requirements, the proposed approach maintains its robustness and accuracy, delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art SLAM methods ( e.g ., LDSO, ORB-SLAM3) on the majority of sequences from well-known datasets like EuRoC, KITTI, and TUM VI.

The uniqueness of SBSFC is that it does not require direct modeling of slosh dynamics. Utilizing just two inertial measurement units (IMUs), the proposed scheme offers an online solution, obviating the need for complex dynamics or high-cost supplementary systems. Central to this work is the design of a control strategy favorable for sloshing suppression, achieved through feedforward reference shaping and disturbance compensation. This means the SBSFC indirectly alleviates and compensates for sloshing effects, rather than directly controlling them as a state variable by relying on pixel-based measurements of sloshing. Key contributions include rapid slosh damping via reference shaping, robust posture stabilization through optimal control, and enhanced disturbance handling with a disturbance observer. These strategies synergistically ensure immediate vibration reduction and long-term stability under real-world conditions. This study is expected to lead to a significant leap forward in commercial food-serving robotics.},

The time series model is introduced to learn the changing patterns of different environmental structures or objects on multiple time scales based on the historical maps and forecast the future maps for long-term navigation. Then, an improved global path planning algorithm is performed based on the time-variant predicted cost maps. During navigation, the current observations are fused with the predicted map through a modified Bayesian filter to reduce the impact of prediction errors, and the updated map is stored for future predictions. We run simulation and conduct several weeks of experiments in multiple scenarios. The results show that our algorithm is effective and robust for long-term navigation in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Transporting large and heavy objects can benefit from Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC), increasing the contribution of robots to our daily tasks and addressing challenges arising from labor shortages. This strategy typically positions the human collaborator as the leader, with the robot assuming the follower role. However, when transporting large objects, the operator’s situational awareness can be compromised as the objects may occlude different parts of the environment, weakening the human leader’s decision-making capacity and leading to failure due to collision. This paper proposes a situational awareness framework for collaborative transportation to face this challenge. The framework integrates a multi-modal haptic-based Obstacle Feedback Module with two units. The first unit consists of a warning module that alerts the operator through a haptic belt with four vibrotactile devices that provide feedback about the location and proximity of the obstacles. The second unit implements virtual fixtures as hard constraints for mobility. The warning feedback and the virtual fixtures act online based on the information given by two Lidars mounted on a mobile manipulator to detect the obstacles in the surroundings. By enhancing the operator’s awareness of the environment, the proposed module improves the safety of the human–robot team in collaborative transportation scenarios by preventing collisions. Experiments with 16 non-expert subjects in four feedback modalities during four scenarios report an objective evaluation thanks to quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations based on user-level experiences. The results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented feedback modalities while providing solid evidence of the increased situational awareness of the operator when the two haptic units are employed.},

This study focuses on optimizing trajectory planning for an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) using a novel Reinforcement Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (RLPSO) algorithm. Real-time mobile robot localization and map generation are introduced through the utilization of the Hector-SLAM algorithm within the Robot Operating System (ROS) platform, resulting in the creation of a binary occupancy grid. The present research thoroughly investigates the performance of the RLPSO algorithm, juxtaposed against five established Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variants, within the context of four distinct physical environments. The experimental design is tailored to emulate real-world scenarios, encompassing a spectrum of challenges posed by static and dynamic obstacles. The AGV, equipped with LiDAR sensors, navigates through diverse environments characterized by obstacles of different geometries. The RLPSO algorithm dynamically adapts its strategies based on feedback, enabling adaptable trajectory planning while effectively avoiding obstacles. Numerical results obtained from extensive experimentation highlight the algorithm&#39;s efficacy. The navigational model&#39;s validation is achieved within a MATLAB 2D virtual environment, employing 2D Lidar mapping point data. Transitioning to physical experiments with an AGV, RLPSO continues to demonstrate superior performance, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in autonomous navigation. On average, RLPSO achieves a 10–15 % reduction in path distances and traversal time compared to the following best-performing PSO variant across diverse scenarios. The adaptive nature of RLPSO, informed by feedback from the environment, distinguishes it as a promising solution for autonomous navigation in dynamic settings, with implications for practical implementation in real-world scenarios.},

However, limited attention has been given to task allocation in such scenarios, particularly when dealing with continuously arriving tasks and time constraints. In this paper, we propose a decentralized auction-based method to address this challenge. Our approach involves robots predicting the task choices of their peers, estimating the values and partnerships associated with multi-robot tasks, and ultimately determining their task choices and collaboration partners through an auction process. A unique “suggestion” mechanism is introduced to the auction process to mitigate the decision bias caused by the leader–follower mode inherent in typical auction-based methods. Additionally, an available time update mechanism is designed to prevent the accumulation of schedule deviations during the robots’ operation process. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to both the Agent-Based Sequential Greedy Algorithm and the Consensus-Based Time Table Algorithm, in both dynamic and static scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The flexible four-finger gripper, as a specialized robotic end-effector, is highly valued for its ability to passively adapt to the shape of objects and perform non-destructive grasping. However, the development of grasping detection algorithms for flexible four-finger grippers remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses the unique characteristics of the flexible four-finger gripper by proposing a grasping detection method based on deep learning. Firstly, the Acute Angle Representation model (AAR-model), which is based on the structure of the flexible four-finger gripper and consists of grasp points and angles, is designed as the grasping representation model that reduces unnecessary rotations of the gripper and improves its versatility in grasping objects. Then, the Flexible Gripper Adaptive Attribute model (FGAA-model) is proposed to represent the grasping attributes of objects, calculate the grasp angles that meet the criteria of the AAR-model, and aggregate the AAR-models on the image data into a unified set, thereby circumventing the time-consuming process of pixel-level annotation. Finally, the Adaptive Grasping Neural Net (AGNN), which is based on Adaptive Feature Fusion and the Grasp Aware Network (AFFGA), is introduced by eliminating redundant network detection headers, fusing color and depth images as inputs, and incorporating a Series Atrous Spatial Pyramid (SASP) structure to produce more accurate grasp poses. Our method not only attains a remarkable accuracy of 97.62% on the Cornell dataset but also swiftly completes grasping detection within 25 ms. In practical robotic arm grasping tests, where a robot is outfitted with a flexible four-finger gripper, it successfully grasps unknown objects with a 96% success rate. These results underscore the reliability and real-time performance of our method, significantly enhancing the gripper&#39;s adaptability and precision when handling objects of varying sizes and shapes. This advancement provides a powerful technical solution for robots utilizing flexible four-finger grippers, enabling autonomous, real-time, and highly accurate grasping maneuvers. Moreover, it addresses the persistent challenge of the scarcity of efficient grasping detection techniques tailored for flexible four-finger grippers.},

  abstract     = {Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly popular in the robotics community. Yet in the growing body of published work on this topic, there is a lack of consensus on what to measure and how to quantify BTs when reporting results. This is not only due to the lack of standardized measures, but due to the sometimes ambiguous use of definitions to describe BT properties. This work provides a comprehensive overview of BT properties the community is interested in, how they relate to each other, the metrics currently used to measure BTs, and whether the metrics appropriately quantify those properties of interest. Finally, we provide the practitioner with a set of metrics to measure, as well as insights into the properties that can be derived from those metrics. By providing this holistic view of properties and their corresponding evaluation metrics, we hope to improve clarity when using BTs in robotics. This more systematic approach will make reported results more consistent and comparable when evaluating BTs.},

The presented algorithm generates locally optimal shape trajectories, i.e., continuous trajectories in the base space of the robot. Such shape trajectories produce a desired rotation of the snake robot, i.e., change in the uncontrolled orientation fiber variable. The proposed method formulates the motion planning problem as an optimization problem where the objective function could be defined to minimize various metrics, such as energy-based cost functions. Additionally, the proposed motion planning algorithm uses a heuristic to generate shape trajectories that avoid self-intersections and obstacle collision. Hence, the motion planning method generates shape trajectories that locally minimize user-defined cost functions and eliminate self-intersections or obstacle collision. The proposed gait generation method is validated using numerical simulations of five-link and seven-link snake robots.},

  abstract     = {We live in a constantly changing world. For robots to fully operate in our world, they need to work in dynamic environments where objects are not fixed in place or may be moved by humans or other agents. This work is based on tactile sensing, as it enables sufficiently responsive robotic systems for contact-based tasks in dynamic environments. Our proposed approach is divided into two parts: (1) a way to perform object following using a shear controller that minimises tactile shear deformation and (2) a switching controller that alternates between the shear controller and a tactile exploration controller that enables contour-following of a moving object. We find that during the object-following task, the robot follows the moving object to sub-millimetre accuracy over a ≈ ≈ 72 mm range for 5 different velocities in 2D. The switching controller successfully performs 2D contour following on several moving objects at various object speeds whilst keeping an almost constant speed of exploration. We expect our method for minimising sensor deformation using a simple controller will generalise over different kinds of contact scenarios for moving objects. Moreover, the switching controller provides an architecture where velocity information of moving objects is fused with another controller thereby enabling a more holistic use of tactile information to empower robotic systems to perform complex tactile tasks.},

The main novelty of this work is the definition of this navigation function and its MPC application with guaranteed closed-loop convergence in finite time for a non-holonomic robot with speed and acceleration constraints. The navigation function consists of an interpolated potential function derived from the grid-based search and a term that guides the orientation of the robot on continuous gradients. The navigation function guarantees convergent trajectories to the desired goal, results in smooth motion between obstacles, has no local minima, and is computationally efficient.

To address this issue, we developed a new upper-limb rehabilitation robot that takes advantage of both end-effector and exoskeleton robots. Moreover, we propose a compensation-corrective adaptive control (CCAC) strategy, which employs an admittance model and incorporates two estimators. Specifically, the first estimator is designed to assess human intention, allowing for compliant human-robot interaction. The second estimator calculates dynamic assistance that adjusts for trunk compensation, utilizing two virtual forces applied to the hand and shoulder. Based on this novel CCAC strategy, the newly designed robot is capable of assisting upper limb movements and correcting compensatory postures simultaneously. Results indicate a significant reduction in trunk compensation across three types of reaching tasks when the robot provides assistance. Moreover, the CCAC strategy enhances upper-limb motor performance, resulting in reduced position errors and increased shoulder and elbow joint angles. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed CCAC strategy, combined with upper-limb exoskeleton robots, as a promising approach for correcting compensatory postures and optimizing the advantages of robotic stroke rehabilitation.},

To achieve high levels of accuracy and robustness, it is essential to leverage a range of sensor modalities to account for highly dynamic and diverse scenes, and consequent sensor limitations. In this work, we introduce TEFu-Net, a Deep-Learning-based late fusion architecture that combines multiple ego-motion estimates from diverse data modalities, including stereo RGB, LiDAR point clouds and GNSS/IMU measurements. Our approach is non-parametric and scalable, making it adaptable to different sensor set configurations. By leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), TEFu-Net produces reliable and robust spatiotemporal ego-motion estimates. This capability allows it to filter out erroneous input measurements, ensuring the accuracy of the car’s motion calculations over time. Extensive experiments show an average accuracy increase of 63% over TEFu-Net’s input estimators and on par results with the state-of-the-art in real-world driving scenarios. We also demonstrate that our solution can achieve accurate estimates under sensor or input failure. Therefore, TEFu-Net enhances the accuracy and robustness of ego-motion estimation in real-world driving scenarios, particularly in challenging conditions such as cluttered environments, tunnels, dense vegetation, and unstructured scenes. As a result of these enhancements, it bolsters the reliability of autonomous driving functions.},

This paper proposes a novel strategy for assigning turn angles for collision-free path planning in scenarios where a small team of robots cooperate in a certain mission. The algorithm allows each robot to reach a predetermined destination safely. It establishes consecutive, short time intervals, and at each interval, possible conflicts are solved centrally in an optimal manner. This is done by keeping constant speeds but generating a discrete set of possible directions for each robot, and solving efficiently the turn-angle allocation for a collision-free path that minimizes the path deviation from the shortest one. Due to the discretization, the final paths are not optimal, but the system can react to possible failures during execution, as conflicts are resolved at each time interval. Computational results and Software-In-The-Loop simulations are presented in order to evaluate the proposed algorithm. A comparison with a state-of-the-art approach shows that our algorithm is more energy-efficient and achieves lower mission completion time.},

To obtain a uniform initial distribution of the ACO parameter combination, we incorporated the Kent Chaos Map (KCM) to randomly initialize the seagull’s position, reducing the tendency of SOA to fall into the local optimum. To avoid slow calculation speed and premature convergence of ACO, we improved the adaptive multi-population mechanism to reduce repeated redundant calculations and used the ϵ − g r e e d y ϵ−greedy and default strategy, respectively, to update the ants’ position. 2Opt is applied to find shorter paths in each iteration. In addition, when AUV navigates on the planned path, it may encounter obstacles. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithm based on forward-looking sonar to ensure safety during tasks. SOA-ACO-2Opt is verified against twelve different problems extracted from TSPLIB and compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, sea trials were carried out for several representative marine engineering applications of TSP and obstacle avoidance.

  abstract     = {Small-scale jumping robots widely employ the pause-and-leap locomotion strategy. They use elastic elements to enhance the jumping performance, which is promising for locomotion over rugged terrain. However, these robots typically lose a significant amount of mechanical energy during landing, which is initially accumulated for takeoff, resulting in wasted energy. Here, we propose a landing strategy that uses a jumping mechanism with controlled mono-stable or bi-stable characteristics to achieve the energy recoverable landing. By adjusting the jumping mechanism to an appropriate bi-stable state before landing, the robot’s extended leg retracts to its pre-jump configuration upon touchdown, enabling the recapture of mechanical energy within the springs. We develop analytical models for the touchdown collision and landing dynamics. A 165 g robot prototype is constructed, featuring integrated sensing, actuation, and computations. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to explore the effects of various factors on the landing behavior. Experiments demonstrate successful landings with energy recovery ratio exceeding 50% across different landing trajectories. This landing strategy holds significant potential for enhancing the locomotion efficiency of future small-scale jumping robots.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a repetitive motion planning (RMP) scheme with guaranteed precision has been developed for redundant robot manipulators. However, the RMP scheme does not consider joint constrains. As a result, such a scheme may not perform effectively when the joint configuration exceeds its physical limit. In this paper, we provide a further study by proposing a new discrete-time RMP (DTRMP) scheme based on the pseudoinverse formulation for redundant robot manipulators with joint constrains. Specifically, by using the direct derivation and by introducing the feedback, the handling of joint physical limit is formulated as an implicit dynamic equation. Then, the combined kinematic equation of the constrained redundant robot manipulators is obtained, and the resultant continuous-time RMP (CTRMP) scheme with the pseudoinverse-based formulation is established. By utilizing a numerical difference rule to discretize the CTRMP scheme, the new DTRMP scheme is thus developed for redundant robot manipulators with joint constrains. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations under a constrained five-link robot manipulator validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DTRMP scheme. The experiment results of implementing the proposed scheme on the constrained practical Panda robot manipulator further indicate the scheme applicability and feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Tactile sensing plays an irreplaceable role in robotic material recognition. It enables robots to distinguish material properties such as their local geometry and textures, especially for materials like textiles. However, most tactile recognition methods can only classify known materials that have been touched and trained with tactile data, yet cannot classify unknown materials that are not trained with tactile data. To solve this problem, we propose a tactile Zero-Shot Learning framework to recognise materials when they are touched for the first time, using their visual and semantic information, without requiring tactile training samples. The biggest challenge in tactile Zero-Shot Learning is to recognise disjoint classes between training and test materials, i.e., the test materials that are not among the training ones. To bridge this gap, the visual modality, providing tactile cues from sight, and semantic attributes, giving high-level characteristics, are combined together and act as a link to expose the model to these disjoint classes. Specifically, a generative model is learnt to synthesise tactile features according to corresponding visual images and semantic embeddings, and then a classifier can be trained using the synthesised tactile features for zero-shot recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed multimodal generative model can achieve a high recognition accuracy of 83.06% in classifying materials that were not touched before.

  abstract     = {Robots and humans coexist in various social environments. In these contexts, robots predominantly serve as assistants, necessitating communication and understanding capabilities. This paper introduces a biologically inspired model grounded on neuroendocrine substances that facilitate the development of social bonds between robots and individuals. The model simulates the effects of oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, and dopamine on social behavior, acting as modulators for bonding in the interaction between the social robot Mini and its users. Neuroendocrine levels vary in response to circadian rhythms and social stimuli perceived by the robot. If users express care for the robot, a positive bond is established, enhancing human–robot interaction by prompting the robot to engage in cooperative actions such as playing or communicating more frequently. Conversely, mistreating the robot leads to a deterioration of the relationship, causing user rejection. An experimenter-robot interaction scenario illustrates the model’s adaptive mechanisms involving three types of profiles: Friendly, Aversive, and Naive. Besides, a user study with 22 participants was conducted to analyze the differences in Attachment, Social Presence, perceived Anthropomorphism, Likability, and User Experience between a robot randomly selecting its behavior and a robot behaving using the bioinspired pair-bonded method proposed in this contribution. The results show how the pair-bonding with the user regulates the robot’s social behavior in response to user actions. The user study reveals statistical differences favoring the robot using the pair-bonding regulation in Attachment and Social Presence. A qualitative study using an interview-like form suggests the positive effects of creating bonds with bioinspired robots.},

Secondly we develop an original initialization module where encoder readings are fully utilized to refine gravity direction and provide an initial value for camera pose in real scale. Thirdly, we design a computationally efficient online extrinsic calibration method by fixing the linearization point for the rotational component of IMU-odometer extrinsic parameters, which is deployed depending on the convergence of accelerometer bias. Fourthly, we give an observability analysis of our optimization based approach under more general assumption. Extensive experiments are performed on two sets of data in various scenes, bringing the state-of-the-art visual odometry and visual-inertial odometry algorithms into comparison. Experimental results prove the overwhelmingly better performance of our proposed approach on the above two sets of data, as well as the robustness of our initialization module and the improvement resulted from online extrinsic calibration.},

To address the intricacies of truss environments, we present a pole landmark mapping module with dedicated operations including pole detection, data association, and parameterizations. In the back-end, we formulate the localization problem of biped climbing robots using a multi-source factor graph, encompassing factors including forward kinematics, LiDAR odometry, gripping, and points of poles.

The shield shape is modeled as a quadric surface in the 3D space. To design the desired formation (target distances between agents and interconnections), an algorithm is proposed where the input parameters are just the parametrization of the quadric and the number of agents of the system. This algorithm guarantees that the agents are almost uniformly distributed over the virtual surface and that the topology is a Delaunay triangulation. Moreover, a new method is proposed to check if the resulting triangulation meets that condition and is executed locally. Because this topology ensures that the formation is rigid, a distributed control law based on the gradient of a potential function is proposed to acquire the desired shield shape and proofs of stability are provided. Finally, simulation and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) is known as one of the recurring themes that possess these promising characteristics with a synergistic combination of productivity-efficiency transport and flexibility through a number of machine tools alongside other material handling devices. In FMS, mobile robots are commonly deployed in material handling system for the purpose of increasing the efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing process. A reliable, efficient, and optimal scheduling is the most important in manufacturing system. The scheduling problems can become highly complex, especially in large-scale systems with numerous tasks and constraints. Thus, schedule optimization becomes crucial to enhance target performance by determining the best allocations and sequences of resources under specified constraints. Recently, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a remarkably applicable search algorithm to solve scheduling problems to the way that near optimal could be found. While the performance of GA much depends on the selection of the main parameters, a standard GA may suffer from the issue of premature convergence due to the lack of control on its parameters especially crossover and mutation operators. As there is no specific method or way to tune these parameters, the algorithm is prone to converge on the local optimum, thereby leading to performance degradation. To overcome such flaw, this paper proposed an improved Genetic Algorithm using an adaptive Fuzzy Logic to control crossover and mutation operators (FGAOC) for the solution to the NP-hard problem of scheduling mobile robot within Job-Shop FMS environment. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in several case studies such as small and large-scale problem, various numbers of mobile robots and the 40-test benchmark problem. The results have demonstrated that the proposed FGAOC has delivered a good performance in exploration-exploitation activities with better solution quality.},

The methodological approach involves both simulation and the construction of the test platform. Two simulators are developed: (i) a linear simulator, used to assist in determining control parameters, and (ii) a nonlinear simulator, used to model the nonlinearity inherent to the rotational behavior of aircraft. In addition, the control system for the quadcopter is implemented, utilizing proportional, integral, and derivative control principles. By conducting seven experiments on the test platform and in the nonlinear simulator, the obtained results are compared in order to validate the proposed methodology. The mean discrepancy observed between the mean absolute difference obtained by the test platform and by the nonlinear simulator for the angle ϕ ϕ was 0 . 85 ° 0.85° , for the angle θ θ was 2 . 77 ° 2.77° , and for the angle ψ ψ was 4 . 66 ° 4.66° . When analyzed separately, the mean absolute errors for the angles, using the nonlinear simulator and the test platform, showed differences below 2% in almost all evaluated experiments. The developed test platform preserves the rotational dynamics of the quadcopter as desired, closely approaching the results obtained by the nonlinear simulator. Consequently, this platform can be used to carry out practical tests in a controlled environment.},

Moreover, the tasks can be defined in locations changing with time (i.e., dynamic targets), and their future motions are not known a priori. This unpredictability requires an online control approach which motivates us to investigate the use of control barrier functions (CBFs). The proposed CBFs take into account the actuation limits of the robots and a feasible sequence of STL tasks. They define time-varying feasible sets of states the system must always stay inside. We show the feasible sequence generation process that even includes the decomposition of periodic tasks and alternative scenarios due to disjunction operators. The sequence is used to define CBFs, ensuring STL satisfaction. We also show some theoretical results on the correctness of the proposed method.

In response, this work establishes an Exploration-Planning framework developed for the real-world deployment of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in subterranean exploration missions. The fundamental task for an autonomous MAV to navigate in an unknown area, is to decide where to look while navigating such that the MAV will acquire more information about the surrounding. The work presented in this article focuses around 3D exploration of large-scale caves or multi-branched tunnel like structures, while still prioritizing the Look-Ahead and Move-Forward approach for fast navigation in previously unknown areas. In order to achieve such exploration behaviour, the proposed work utilizes a two-layer navigation approach. The first layer deals with computing traversable frontiers to generate the look ahead poses in the constrained field of view, aligned with the MAV’s heading vector that leads to rapid continuous exploration. The proposed frontier distribution based switching goal selection approach allows the MAV to explore various terrains, while still regulating the MAV’s heading vector. The second layer of the proposed scheme deals with global cost based navigation of the MAV to the potential junction in a multi-branched tunnel system leading to a continuous exploration of partially seen areas. The proposed framework is a combination of a novel frontier goal selection approach, risk-aware expandable grid based path planning, nonlinear model predictive control and artificial potential fields based on local reactive navigation, obstacle avoidance, and control for the autonomous deployment of MAVs in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Research in autonomous systems is gaining popularity both in academia and industry. These systems offer comfort, new business opportunities such as self-driving taxis, more efficient resource utilization through car-sharing, and most importantly, enhanced road safety. Different forms of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication have been under development for many years to enhance safety. Advances in wireless technologies have enabled more data transmission with lower latency, creating more possibilities for safer driving. Collaborative perception is a critical technique to address occlusion and sensor failure issues in autonomous driving. To enhance safety and efficiency, recent works have focused on sharing extracted features instead of raw data or final outputs, leading to reduced message sizes compared to raw sensor data. Reducing message size is important to enable collaborative perception to coexist with other V2X applications on bandwidth-limited communication devices. To address this issue and significantly reduce the size of messages sent while maintaining high accuracy, we propose our model: LaCPF ( La te C ollaborative P erception F usion), which uses deep learning for late fusion. We demonstrate that we can achieve better results while using only half the message size over other methods. Our late fusion framework is also independent of the local perception model, which is essential, as not all vehicles on the road will employ the same methods. Therefore LaCPF can be scaled more quickly as it is model and sensor-agnostic.},

  abstract     = {3D human pose estimation from a single image is still a challenging problem despite the large amount of work that has been performed in this field. Generally, most methods directly use neural networks and ignore certain constraints ( e . g . e.g. , reprojection constraints, joint angle, and bone length constraints). While a few methods consider these constraints but train the network separately, they cannot effectively solve the depth ambiguity problem. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based model for 3D human pose estimation, in which a reprojection network is employed to learn the mapping of the distribution from 3D poses to 2D poses, and a discriminator is employed for 2D–3D consistency discrimination. We adopt a novel strategy to synchronously train the generator, the reprojection network and the discriminator. Furthermore, inspired by the typical kinematic chain space (KCS) matrix, we introduce a weighted KCS matrix and take it as one of the discriminator’s inputs to impose joint angle and bone length constraints. The experimental results on Human3.6M show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory planning is a crucial aspect of macro-micro robotic systems (MMRSs), especially when the system has high degrees of freedom (DOFs). In the field of robotic polishing, the MMRS is usually composed of an industrial robot and an end-effector, which is responsible for polishing force control. Therefore, the compliance of the macro-robot can be minimized by trajectory planning to reduce its impact on the micro-robot. This study proposes a trajectory planning strategy based on Gauss pseudospectral method for a 9-DOF MMRS. Different from traditional sequential solution strategies, it can be used to obtain an approximate global optimal trajectory. Firstly, the velocity-level kinematics model of MMRS is built, which comprehensively considers the workpiece placement pose and task redundancy. Secondly, an optimal control model for trajectory planning is developed through an effective variable allocation. On the premise of considering traditional trajectory smoothness constraints, a constraint on manipulability is additionally analyzed to avoid reaching a singular configuration during compliance optimization. Thirdly, a Gauss pseudospectral framework based on the optimal control model is proposed, and the costate mapping theorem is proved. The latter provides a theoretical basis for the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To balance efficiency and accuracy, this paper presents a fast and stable GNSS-LiDAR-inertial state estimator: GNSS, LiDAR and IMU are fused to achieve state estimation from coarse to fine, thereby improving the system accuracy and stability; the overall framework based on iterated error-state Kalman filter makes our system faster than most multi-sensor fusion SLAM. We also design a fast GNSS online initialization method and a multi-layer outlier rejection mechanism for our system.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in sensors and deep learning techniques have improved reliability of robotic perceptual systems, but current systems are not robust enough for real-world challenges such as occlusions and sensing uncertainties in cluttered scenes. To overcome these issues, active or interactive perception actions are often necessary, such as sensor repositioning or object manipulation to reveal more information about the scene. Existing perception systems lack a comprehensive approach that incorporates both active and interactive action spaces, thereby limiting the robot’s perception capabilities. Moreover, these systems focus on exploring a single object or scene, without utilizing object information to guide the exploration of multiple objects. In this work, we propose an object-aware hybrid perception system that selects the next best action by considering both active and interactive action spaces and enhances the selection process with an object-aware approach to guide the cognitive robot operating in tabletop scenarios. Novel volumetric utility metrics are used to evaluate actions that include positioning sensors from a heterogeneous set or manipulating objects to gain a better perspective of the scene. The proposed system maintains the volumetric information of the scene that includes semantic information about objects, enabling it to exploit object information, associate occlusion with corresponding objects, and make informed decisions about object manipulation. We evaluate the performance of our system both in simulated and real-world experiments using a Baxter robotic platform equipped with two arms, RGB and depth cameras. Our experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the compared state-of-the-art methods in the given scenarios, achieving an 11.2% performance increase.},

The method extends the Encode-Manipulate-Decode network (EMD net), which can predict shape changes of deformable objects and generate robot motion sequences for producing desired shape transitions. This enables us to find connector trajectories that avoid collision between the cable and the surrounding environment. We conducted experiments with several different cable lengths.

  abstract     = {3D object detection is a key element for the perception of autonomous vehicles. LiDAR sensors are commonly used to perceive the surrounding area, producing a sparse representation of the scene in the form of a point cloud. The current trend is to use deep learning neural network architectures that predict 3D bounding boxes. The vast majority of architectures process the LiDAR point cloud directly but, due to computation and memory constraints, at some point they compress the input to a 2D Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representation. In this work, we propose a novel 2D neural network architecture, namely the Feature Aware Re-weighting Network, for feature extraction in BEV using local context via an attention mechanism, to improve the 3D detection performance of LiDAR-based detectors. Extensive experiments on five state-of-the-art detectors and three benchmarking datasets, namely KITTI, Waymo and nuScenes, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of both detection performance and minimal added computational burden.

  abstract     = {Recent years have experienced a notable surge in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) research, prompting exploration into innovative concepts. This paper introduces a compact UAV harnessing the Coandă effect, an underexplored phenomenon in fluid mechanics. Featuring a single lift motor and two types of flaps, this UAV offers exceptional maneuverability, presenting significant challenges compared to conventional multi-rotor UAVs. To address these challenges, we explore the theoretical study, mechatronic design, and manufacturing complexities of the Coandă UAV. Emphasizing the distinctiveness of our work, we assess a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for UAV stabilization, marking the first application of such techniques to a Coandă-effect UAV, in contrast to the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control employed by other researchers. This innovative application of Fuzzy logic, particularly the Sugeno model, proves advantageous, offering faster and more robust control in uncertain or noisy environments. The proposed FLC strategy is systematically compared against a classical PID control approach, formulated based on the Mamdani and Sugeno models, optimized and manually tuned using a genetic algorithm. Our results showcase a significantly improved settling time of 0.417 s with the FLC strategy, surpassing the PID control approach by 35.23%. To substantiate our findings, we present comprehensive experimentation conducted at both software and hardware levels using Matlab® and Simulink for a microcontroller-based UAV. This groundbreaking fusion of novel design and advanced control techniques not only addresses the unique challenges posed by the Coandă UAV&#39;s aerodynamics but also contributes significantly to the field of UAV research.},

Kinematic and dynamic models were developed based on the morphology of this type of robot. Cutting-edge and previously unexplored control strategies for these types of manipulators are then designed and implemented based on Fuzzy PD and Fuzzy PID configurations. Several performance indicators, such as the Integral Square Error (ISE), Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) and Integral Time Square Error (ITSE), were used to conduct a performance comparison of the control techniques, considering type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy sets. In all the analyzed scenarios, the fuzzy controllers correspond to the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang model using linear functions of the inputs in the outputs. Among the main contributions of this work is the development of a detailed dynamic model of the robot in Simscape, incorporating realistic aspects that are often overlooked during analytical modeling. To ensure more accurate results, the rejection of external disturbances is thoroughly analyzed in simulations, considering elements such as time delays and control signal saturations. The results demonstrate the veracity of the proposed design for a four-arm Delta robot, both in models and in the Simscape/Simulink implementation. In the trajectory tracking task and external disturbance rejection, the superiority of the Fuzzy PID controller with interval type-2 fuzzy sets over fuzzy controllers with PD structure and over type-1 fuzzy sets is evidenced.},

Because of friction to the ground, rotation of the external shell results in translational motion. Rolling without slipping implies a constraint on the tangential velocity of the robot at the contact point to the ground which makes it a non-holonomic dynamical system. The mathematical model is obtained upon writing a Lagrangian function that describes the mechanical system and by the Hamilton minimal-action principle modified through d’Alembert virtual work principle to account for non-conservative control actions as well as frictional reactions. The result of the modeling appears as a series of non-holonomic Euler–Poincaré equations of dynamics plus a series of auxiliary equations of reconstruction and advection type.

The movement of microswimmers is affected by stringent constraints because of the low Reynolds number of the surrounding environment. Researchers have been working on enhancing microrobots’ propulsion tactics and figuring out new approaches to find optimal propulsion strategies. In this research, we employ a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, specifically Q-Learning, to train linear-shaped microrobots, comprised of spheres and rods, by introducing an innovative and pioneer coding approach, termed “Basic Coding”, which is utilized to specify states and actions within the RL framework. Basic Coding is a powerful general method that can be employed for different agents in any discrete RL environment. We show how to apply Basic Coding to various microrobots with different geometrical configurations, like a triangular one. Our smart microswimmers, with different numbers of spheres, acquire the knowledge of the optimal propulsion cycle to accomplish large net mechanical displacement without relying on any pre-existing locomotion expertise. The three-sphere linear microrobot recovers the cycle Najafi and Golestanian suggested. The N-sphere microrobots with higher degrees of freedom can find the optimal propulsion cycle within a reasonable number of learning steps and low computational cost utilizing our RL and Basic Coding approach, while the learning step number significantly increases using other methods like Brute-force search. For example, we show this number for the 5-sphere microrobot is 1.19E03 and 8.97E10 steps using our methodology and Brute-force, respectively. Furthermore, our intelligent microrobots can successfully and adaptively find new optimal strategies in indeterministic environments in the presence of uncertainty.

In this paper, a new Informed Sampling Space (ISS) driven Informative Path Planning (IPP) approach is developed to facilitate autonomous robots to navigate and explore unknown and hazardous environments for in-situ resource utilization efficiently. The developed ISS-driven IPP approach is targeted on multi-objective optimization enabling the robot to plan its path from start to target locations in the environment and simultaneously explore multiple high-interest areas efficiently. The high-interest areas could be locations advised by a human supervisor or from the robot’s prior knowledge of the environment. Typically, a cost function (time, distance, etc. ) is used in sampling-based path planners. A new cost function is also developed to incorporate the high-interest spots in this paper, which is based on Multivariate normal (MVN) probability density function (PDF) and a normalization function. Two different IPP models are developed using the new cost function to assist robot navigation. IPP with RRT* is used in the first model with no heuristics, while IPP with RRT* and heuristic ISS is used in the second model. Simulation and comparative analysis substantiate the efficacy and robustness of our approach. The simulation results corroborate that our proposed ISS-driven IPP with RRT* converges rapidly towards the near-optimal solution with respect to both navigation time and environment exploration.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new approach is proposed for the smooth path planning of Ackermann mobile robots based on an improved ant colony algorithm and B-spline curves. Firstly, by incorporating path length constraints and path smoothing constraints into the objective function, the smooth path planning problem for Ackermann mobile robots is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem. Secondly, to address the limitations of the traditional ant colony algorithm, an improved ant colony algorithm based on the turning angle constraint (IACO-TAC) is proposed. IACO-TAC incorporates the distance factor and steering angle penalty factor in the heuristic function to reduce the path search&#39;s blindness. Moreover, the pheromone update method is improved, consisting of local pheromone update and global pheromone update, which uses a reward penalty mechanism to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm and increases the pheromone concentration of the global optimal path, respectively. Thirdly, an improved B-spline curve smoothing algorithm that considers the minimum turning radius constraint is proposed to generate a path that satisfies the kinematic constraints of the Ackermann mobile robot. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by conducting gradient comparison experiments and ant colony algorithm comparison experiments on maps of different sizes. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits a fast convergence rate and plans a path that balances path length and turn frequency while satisfying the kinematic constraints of the mobile robot. Thus, the proposed method offers an efficient and smooth path planning solution for Ackermann mobile robots in complex environments.},

  abstract     = {This research addresses the challenge of large/complex deformation in the shape control tasks of Deformable Linear Objects (DLO). We propose a collaborative approach using two manipulators to achieve shape control of a DLO in 2D workspace. The proposed methodology introduces an innovative Intermediary Shapes Generation (ISG) algorithm which outputs a series of intermediary shapes to guide the DLO towards the desired shape. The robot controller is formulated as an optimization problem, where the main objective is to minimize the error between the current shape and the desired shape, while ensuring the diminishing rigidity property of the DLO as a constraint. We conduct extensive simulations and real-life experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We consider various scenarios of basic shapes, as well as complex deformations with opposite concavities between initial and final shapes. The outcomes demonstrate the robustness and high accuracy of the proposed system in achieving complex deformations. This capability represents the primary contribution of our research. The optimization-based control framework, coupled with the ISG algorithm, enables effective shape control without the need for extensive modeling nor training, and offers a promising solution for practical applications requiring precise shape control of DLOs. Moreover, we carry out a thorough review and comparative analysis encompassing the latest literature in DLO shape control, and the techniques for DLO modeling.},

Moreover, a dynamic parameters identification procedure is devised to improve the simulation model fidelity and reduce the sim-to-real gap for controllers deployment. We show the capability of our model to handle different cable configurations and suspension mechanisms by customising it for two representative cable-suspended dual-arm manipulation systems: the LiCAS arms suspended by a drone and the CRANEbot system, featuring two Pilz arms suspended by a crane. The identified dynamic models are validated by comparing their evolution with data acquired from the real systems showing a high (between 91.3% to 99.4%) correlation of the response signals. In a comparison performed with baseline pendulum models, our model increases the simulation accuracy from 64.4% to 85.9%.

This calls for the need of gait training devices that allow full control and assistance of user’s pelvis to improve gait rehabilitation therapies of stroke survivors. This paper presents a new pelvic assistance treadmill-based exoskeleton (PeXo) for gait rehabilitation. The system includes a total of 5 actively controlled Degrees of Freedom (DOFs), plus a passive one, in order to provide all DOFs of the human pelvis. The paper describes the mechatronic design and haptic control of PeXo, and introduces a newly developed self-paced walking mode where the user can control walking speed at his/her will. The system was evaluated by means of a pilot study with a stroke survivor. Results showed PeXo can be used safely and reliably during walking activities, allowing for the natural motion of the pelvis with reduced interaction forces. However, the use of the platform reduced user’s Range of Motion at the pelvis and lower limb joints , whereas lower limb’s muscle activity increased to compensate the disturbances introduced by the platform. Nevertheless, the user reported a positive feedback when using the system, suggesting potential and promising advantages of PeXo that should be explored in a larger study in the future.},

In its local frame, the robot has sensorial access only to the part of the scene that is within a finite zone of visibility and in direct line of sight. It is required to approach and then circumnavigate the objects, with maintaining a given distance to the currently nearest of them, so that the ideal targeted path is the equidistant curve of the set of the objects. The focus is on the case where this curve cannot be perfectly traced due to excessive contortions and singularities. So the objective is restated as that of automatically finding, approaching and repeatedly tracing an approximation of the equidistant curve that is the best among those trackable by the robot with respecting safety concerns. Though pre-computation of this approximation is a hard problem of computational geometry, we show that autonomously seeking and tracking this approximation can be performed on-the-fly at a miserable computational cost via implementation of the proposed navigation law. This law is hybrid and operates in only a few discrete modes; within any mode, it is reactive, i.e., it directly converts the current observation into the current control. Nonlocal convergence of this law is justified by mathematically rigorous results and is confirmed by computer simulations and real-world experiments.},

To address this issue, a passive gripper mechanism is presented that minimizes operation time, thereby significantly improving sorting rates. The presented gripper utilizes a spring-based system, leveraging its energy storage capabilities. The force exerted by the gripper on glass bottles increases proportionally with their diameter, demonstrating force amplification through the spring mechanism via static analysis . Experimental validation across diverse glass bottles confirms to the gripper’s effectiveness. Comparative studies with two commercially available grippers validate our design’s high-speed. The result show a substantial increase in sorting time, suggesting its potential to revolutionize glass recycling. Furthermore, our proposed gripper exhibits minimized operational time as the manipulator’s speed increases. By introducing mechanism, high-speed gripper, this work not only accelerates glass bottle sorting but also contributes to sustainable waste management.

We achieve such a construction by designing appropriate adaptive control protocols in the lower level, which guarantee the safe robot navigation/object transportation in the environment while compensating for the dynamic uncertainties. The transition system is efficiently interfaced with the temporal logic specification via a sampling-based algorithm to output a discrete path as a sequence of synchronized actions of the robots; such actions satisfy the robots’ as well as the objects’ specifications.

However, robot systems on wheels are currently unstable and require a control mechanism to increase stability, resulting in much research requirement to develop an appropriate controller algorithm for wheeled mobile robot systems. Proportional, integral, derivative (PID) controllers are currently widely used for this purpose, but the PID approach is frequently inappropriate due to disruptions or fluctuations in parameters. Other control approaches, such as linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) control, can be used to address some of the issues associated with PID controllers. In this study, a kinematic model of a four-wheel skid-steering mobile robot was developed to test the functionality of LQR control. Three scenarios (control cheap, non-zero state expensive; control expensive, non-zero state cheap; only non-zero state expensive) were examined using the characteristics of the wheeled mobile robot. Peak time, settling time, and rising time for cheap control based on these scenarios was found to be 0.1 s, 7.82 s, and 4.39 s, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Numerous advanced simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been developed due to the scientific and technological advancements. However, their practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios is severely limited by the assumption that objects are stationary. Improving the accuracy and robustness of SLAM algorithms in dynamic environments is therefore of paramount importance. A significant amount of research has been conducted on SLAM in dynamic environments using semantic segmentation or object detection, but a major drawback of these approaches is that they may eliminate static feature points if the movable objects are static, or use dynamic feature points if the static objects are moved. This paper proposed DynaTM-SLAM, a robust semantic visual SLAM algorithm, designed for dynamic environments. DynaTM-SLAM combines object detection and template matching techniques with a sliding window to quickly and efficiently filter out the real dynamic feature points, drastically minimizing the impact of dynamic objects. Our approach uses object detection instead of time-consuming semantic segmentation to detect dynamic objects. In addition, an object database is built online and the camera poses, map points, and objects are jointly optimized by implementing semantic constraints on the static objects. This approach fully exploits the positive effect of the semantic information of static objects and refines the accuracy of ego-motion estimation in dynamic environments. Experiments were carried out on the TUM RGBD dataset, and the results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance in dynamic scenes.},

In order to maintain the efficiency of primary assembling under a dual-manipulator welding gantry system, a rule-based lazy Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) with a repulsion field is proposed to realize the collision-free online path planning system. It combines manual rules and the repulsive force field, which reduces computational complexity and maintains safety at work compared with traditional Lazy-PRM. Besides, the method plans paths in Cartesian space considering the coordinated movement between manipulators, welding guns and the gantry frame. The proposed method was tested in simulated and practical application scenarios, which proves its effectiveness in solving collision-free online path planning problems for the arc welding gantry system.},

  abstract     = {Pushing is an essential non-prehensile manipulation skill used for tasks ranging from pre-grasp manipulation to scene rearrangement, reasoning about object relations in the scene, and thus pushing actions have been widely studied in robotics. The effective use of pushing actions often requires an understanding of the dynamics of the manipulated objects and adaptation to the discrepancies between prediction and reality. For this reason, effect prediction and parameter estimation with pushing actions have been heavily investigated in the literature. However, current approaches are limited because they either model systems with a fixed number of objects or use image-based representations whose outputs are not very interpretable and quickly accumulate errors. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network based framework for effect prediction and parameter estimation of pushing actions by modeling object relations based on contacts or articulations. Our framework is validated both in real and simulated environments containing different shaped multi-part objects connected via different types of joints and objects with different masses, and it outperforms image-based representations on physics prediction. Our approach enables the robot to predict and adapt the effect of a pushing action as it observes the scene. It can also be used for tool manipulation with never-seen tools. Further, we demonstrate 6D effect prediction in the lever-up action in the context of robot-based hard-disk disassembly.},

In the following, considering the bankruptcy concept, a new base algorithm , which is called Reverse Adjusted Proportional (RevAP), is introduced. Based on this algorithm, three methods PTST, T-MAS, and T-KAg, were presented to solve the MCA with different strategies.

  abstract     = {This comprehensive review focuses on the Autonomous Driving System (ADS), which aims to reduce human errors that are the reason for about 95% of car accidents. The ADS consists of six stages: sensors, perception, localization, assessment, path planning , and control. We explain the main state-of-the-art techniques used in each stage, analyzing 275 papers, with 162 specifically on path planning due to its complexity, NP-hard optimization nature, and pivotal role in ADS. This paper categorizes path planning techniques into three primary groups: traditional (graph-based, sampling-based, gradient-based, optimization-based, interpolation curve algorithms), machine and deep learning, and meta-heuristic optimization, detailing their advantages and drawbacks. Findings show that meta-heuristic optimization methods, representing 23% of our study, are preferred for being general problem solvers capable of handling complex problems. In addition, they have faster convergence and reduced risk of local minima . Machine and deep learning techniques , accounting for 25%, are favored for their learning capabilities and fast responses to known scenarios. The trend towards hybrid algorithms (27%) combines various methods, merging each algorithm’s benefits and overcoming the other’s drawbacks. Moreover, adaptive parameter tuning is crucial to enhance efficiency, applicability, and balancing the search capability. This review sheds light on the future of path planning in autonomous driving systems, helping to tackle current challenges and unlock the full capabilities of autonomous vehicles.},

Hand and wrist exoskeletons for therapeutic purposes , however, are widely researched featuring existing technologies which can be adapted for occupational augmentation. This paper presents a literature review of upper-body exoskeleton systems researched within the past five years with a focus on the systematic comparison of augmentative or occupational design compared to other roles. Several important aspects of exoskeleton development for augmentation are identified and evaluated within this review. This includes actuation methods, which determine workspace and scalability, human-robot-interaction, thus ensuring affinity with the wearer, and use of modelling, design optimisation or generative design methods to arrive at effective solutions. This paper systematically reviews 108 upper limb exoskeleton systems and compares their design in three main aspects: The optimisation of their design, their physical features, and the data published to evaluate their effectiveness. Design optimisation in the exoskeleton field faces challenges in parameter choice, lack of integrated personalisation, complex models, computation time , and limited access to effective optimisation techniques. Although there are no perfect combinations of design features, observable trends suggest certain choices are more viable and efficient. The wide range of contemporary hand exoskeleton systems indicates both potential for diverse form factors and a need for further development to converge on a concise solution like that of shoulder exoskeletons.},

In such environments, robots frequently face new objects while working in the environment and need to learn them in an open-ended fashion. Furthermore, such robots must be able to recognize a wide range of object categories. In this paper, we present a lifelong ensemble learning approach based on multiple representations to address the few-shot object recognition problem. In particular, we form ensemble methods based on deep representations and handcrafted 3D shape descriptors . To facilitate lifelong learning , each approach is equipped with a memory unit for storing and retrieving object information instantly. The proposed model is suitable for open-ended learning scenarios where the number of 3D object categories is not fixed and can grow over time. We have performed extensive sets of experiments to assess the performance of the proposed approach in offline, and open-ended scenarios. For evaluation purposes, in addition to real object datasets , we generate a large synthetic household objects dataset consisting of 27000 views of 90 objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on online few-shot 3D object recognition tasks , as well as its superior performance over the state-of-the-art open-ended learning approaches. Furthermore, our results show that while ensemble learning is modestly beneficial in offline settings, it is significantly beneficial in lifelong few-shot learning situations. Additionally, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in both simulated and real-robot settings, where the robot rapidly learned new categories from limited examples.

  abstract     = {Robot sequential decision-making in the real world is a challenge because it requires the robots to simultaneously reason about the current world state and dynamics, while planning actions to accomplish complex tasks. On the one hand, declarative languages and reasoning algorithms support representing and reasoning with commonsense knowledge . But these algorithms are not good at planning actions toward maximizing cumulative reward over a long, unspecified horizon. On the other hand, probabilistic planning frameworks, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), support planning to achieve long-term goals under uncertainty. But they are ill-equipped to represent or reason about knowledge that is not directly related to actions. In this article, we present an algorithm, called iCORPP, to simultaneously estimate the current world state, reason about world dynamics, and construct task-oriented controllers. In this process, robot decision-making problems are decomposed into two interdependent (smaller) subproblems that focus on reasoning to “understand the world” and planning to “achieve the goal” respectively. The developed algorithm has been implemented and evaluated both in simulation and on real robots using everyday service tasks, such as indoor navigation , and dialog management.

  abstract     = {This study introduces the development of a novel extremum-seeking controller designed to stabilize the tracking trajectory of a fully actuated four-wheeled skid steering vehicle. The controller design employs a class of averaged sub-gradient optimization strategies for a suitable convex function that depends on the enforced tracking trajectory achieved through an integral sliding mode implementation. The application of this controller necessitates a nonlinear coordinate transformation of the skid steering vehicle dynamics, resulting in a perturbed multi-input–multi-output linear system . Using the proposed controller, a multidimensional sliding surface remains remarkably stable despite tracking errors. The surface design defines a manifold that aligns with the sub-gradient of a convex function , contingent upon the integral of the tracking error. This connection establishes a link between the extremum-seeking problem and the sliding mode control design. Employing the cascade design strategy, commonly referred to as backstepping, enables the calculation of torques for the four wheels of the mobile vehicle using a sequence of auxiliary sliding surfaces, each with its corresponding complementary function for every stage. The dynamic formulation for the wheel torques is derived from the integral sliding mode methodology. A series of numerical evaluations are conducted to assess the controller’s effectiveness in terms of functional performance. A comparison between the control action based on sliding mode and the traditional state feedback formulation validates the efficacy of the proposed design. This comparison demonstrates advancements in robustness in the face of modeling uncertainties and optimization of the performance function, which are theoretically supported by the suggested control design. Implementing the proposed controller in an experimental platform for a wheeled skid steering vehicle reaffirms the control design methodology presented in this study. This platform includes the application of an image processing algorithm to determine the non-inertial position of the autonomous vehicle using integral sliding mode control . This information completes the necessary data for implementing the on-site version of the proposed controller.},

The application of autonomous UAVs in low-altitude surveillance has motivated research into non-cooperative local obstacle avoidance. This paper provides an overview of such solutions that have been proposed within the last decade. Unlike most literature that limits obstacle avoidance to algorithms, this work provides an in-depth review of obstacle avoidance components, namely the perception sensor, techniques, and hardware architecture of the obstacle avoidance system. This review categorizes the non-cooperative obstacle avoidance techniques into four groups: gap-based methods, geometric methods, repulsive force-based methods, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods.

To achieve these goals, a new expression of the tire forces and a new controlled system are proposed for the three degree of freedom vehicle model. A longitudinal input-saturation controller is designed to track the desired longitudinal velocity and attenuate the influence of lateral and yaw motions. The virtual control input method is used to design the input-saturation controller and get the desired steering angles to track the desired path for the lateral and yaw motions while a new control problem with desired forces tracking is considered to autonomously avoid the limit of lateral tire friction forces and the steering lost situation appearing. To test these results, lane changing, U-corner turning and straight-line driving for a varying-velocity vehicle are simulated with external disturbances and model uncertainties.

By designing cooperative defense strategies that ensure all invaders are detected, conditions on the defenders’ speed are derived. Successful accomplishment of the defense task implies invaders with a known limit on their speed cannot slip past the defenders and enter the guarded region undetected. The desired outcome of the defense protocols is to defend the area and additionally to expand it as much as possible. Expansion becomes possible if the defenders’ speed exceeds a critical speed that is necessary to only defend the initial region. We present results on the total search time, critical speeds and maximal expansion possible for two types of novel pincer-movement defense processes, circular and spiral, for any even number of defenders. The proposed spiral process allows to detect invaders at nearly the lowest theoretically optimal speed, and if this speed is exceeded, it also allows to expand the protected region almost to the maximal area.},

  abstract     = {There have been many methods to improve the capacity of scene classification of service robots . However, most of them are proposed from a technical standpoint but without reference to any cognitive principle of the brain, and furthermore, from design to evaluation, the particularity of the robot task is still not fully considered, such as cross-environment generalization, explicit semantic preservation and interpretation. Thus, the scene cognitive behavior of robots is far from humans, and their environmental adaptability is still poor. It is difficult to complete learning place concepts from discrete fragments and then continuously perceiving them with a limited view in unvisited spaces. Inspired by the recent findings from neuroscience, an attention-based global and object attribute fusion mechanism (AGOFM for short) constructed by three parts is proposed to overcome these deficiencies. In the global attribute part, a global feature extractor and a sequence context extractor are used to generate the holistic feature. The involved context integrates limited views to form an overall impression of a scene for guiding attention. In the object attribute part, a novel object vector is proposed. It simultaneously involves the detected object quantity, category and confidence information, which are all related to the vector index and high-level semantics. In the attention generation part, two sorted top-X characteristics deriving from the above two parts are fed into a fully connected (FC) network with batch normalization to generate effective attention. The attention weights are then applied to the batch normalized global and object vectors respectively, and subsequently, the two heterogeneous information are directly fused by another FC network to achieve scene classification. The policies for multi-learner fusion and frame rejection are also provided. Finally, a novel evaluation paradigm is proposed that the model is trained on a discrete prior dataset, and then the inference is tested on a traditional dataset and two robot view datasets. This simulates the cross-environment situation. Under such severe conditions, the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several popular methods.},

Specifically, we consider scenarios where the map is built using a robot’s 3D-Lidar point cloud observations, with potential uncertainty in the robot localization. When considering a natural environment, such as a park or a forest, unstructured by nature, another difficulty arises: the data becomes extremely sparse. As a result, measuring the map quality becomes even more challenging. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of various metrics in measuring the 3D-map quality. Firstly, we evaluate these metrics in a controlled experimental setup, where the reconstructed map is created by progressively degrading the reference map using different degradation models . Secondly, we compare their ability to measure 3D-map quality at a local level, across various simulated environments, ranging from structured to unstructured. Finally, we conduct a qualitative comparison to demonstrate the robustness of certain metrics to noise in the robot localization. This qualitative comparison is done both in simulation and in a real world experiment. Ultimately, we synthesize the properties of these metrics and provide practical recommendations for their selection.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel path inference approach based on Voronoi graph for unmanned maritime vehicles (UMV). We model the two-dimensional space with a flexible construction scheme of Voronoi graph, represent the inter-cell shortest distance with a delicate calculation of cell diameters, and infer the potential qualified navigation paths of UMVs w.r.t. the specified distance constraint based on a diameter path model with an efficient depth-first exploration algorithm. Existing path planning approaches are generally focused on finding a single optimal path. However, in many practical scenarios, such as UMV patrolling and search and rescue, it is the comprehensiveness rather than the optimality that matters for the UMV paths. Inspired by the above problem, we propose a path inference method based on Voronoi graph to infer all the possible UMV paths satisfying the distance constraint. Experimental results indicate that our path inference approach based on Voronoi graph is able to perform more delicately and efficiently than the traditional path planning approach in terms of both space modeling and path exploration. The paths identified by our path inference method were more precise in distance estimation as well as more comprehensive when compared with the grid-based path planning method. In the simulated scenario of UMV search &amp; rescue, we obtained the coverage rates of 63.14% and 100% against those of 14.5% and 81.07% for the grid-based method. Our path inference approach is able to provide valuable insights in various practical UMV applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a control scheme for aerial manipulators which allows to solve different motion problems: end-effector position control , end-effector trajectory tracking control and path-following control. The scheme has two cascaded controllers: i ) the first controller is a minimum norm controller based on numerical methods , it solves the three motion control problems just by modifying the controller references. Also, since the aerial manipulator robot is a redundant system , i.e. , it has extra degrees of freedom to accomplish the task, it is possible to set other control objectives in a hierarchical order. As a secondary objective of the control it is proposed to maintain a desired configuration for the robotic arm during the task. ii ) The second cascade controller is designed to compensate the dynamics of the system which main objective is to drive the velocity errors to zero. The coupled dynamic model of the robotic system (hexarotor and robotic arm) is presented. This model is usually developed as a function of the forces and torques. However, in this work, it is written as a function of reference velocities which are usual references for these vehicles. The proposed control algorithms are given with the corresponding stability and robustness analysis. Finally, to validate the control scheme, experimental tests are performed in a partially structured environment with an aerial manipulator conformed by an aerial platform and a 3DOF robotic arm.},

  abstract     = {Non-prehensile cooperative object transportation is a challenging model problem for distributed control and organization methods but also has practical applications. Therefore, it is widely studied in distributed robotics research. This paper describes and evaluates a novel transportation scheme for differential-drive mobile robots that is, to the authors’ best knowledge, the most versatile scheme of its kind successfully evaluated with real-world hardware. The proposed scheme can conceptually deal with any number of robots and arbitrary polygonal objects, including non-convex ones, without having to retune, retrain, or reconfigure any of the control parameters between different scenarios. This is achieved by splitting the task into a formation control and a formation finding task, both of which are tackled with model-based approaches using distributed optimization . Formation control and formation finding are complicated by the robots’ non-holonomic kinematic constraints. Therefore, a tailored distributed model predictive controller is used for formation control. Finding formations relies on a multibody-dynamics representation of the robots-object system to properly account for contact and non-holonomic constraints. Due to these measures, the transportation scheme achieves a very satisfactory performance and dexterity in real-world hardware experiments utilizing network communication and distributed computation.},

Third, a stability feasible workspace (SFW) based on the stability requirements of the CDPR and an algorithm based on convex set theory to create the SFW are developed. The factors that affect the stability of the CDPR are analysed, and the size of the moving platform is optimised with the maximum SFW. The results show that the value of the SFW can be effectively improved (with an increase of 146.57 %), and thus, the stability of the CDPR can be increased significantly.

The main contributions of this research are the publication of the two open-source datasets and the validation of the dual approach for a reliable vehicle recognition. Precisely, the UC3M-LP dataset is unique, as it fills the gap of European license plates public datasets, becoming the largest of its kind and the first ever for Spanish plates. The proposed dual identification system provides a more robust solution , as it is less sensitive to the variability of image conditions. Performance has been evaluated both on public and the proposed datasets using a multi-network architecture and achieving remarkable results. This strategy opens up new research opportunities in the field of vehicle identification, and the generated datasets may serve as a benchmark for future research.

We evaluate the performance of this controller on our robots using ROS in a virtual environment with Gazebo. Our work proves hedge algebra’s significant potential in the mobile robots’ domain, specifically in formation control . HAFC allows not only the precise formation of a robot swarm into any desired formation, with minimal deviation but also adaptive transition to the different formations. Our results show that HAFC can effectively maintain the desired formation of multiple robots, even in certain extraordinary situations. Furthermore, HAFC exhibits higher efficiency than the fuzzy logic-based controller, as evidenced by its faster adaptation rate and shorter computation time . The proposed approach has the potential to be applied in various real-world scenarios, such as surveillance, transportation, and exploration, where the robot has to move in formation and change formation accordingly with the terrain.},

R2 is optimal and online, returning any-angle paths by applying heuristic costs to vector-based searches. R2 delays line-of-sight checks to expand the most promising path that has the least detours from the start and goal points. As delayed checks can cause severe path cost underestimates, R2 infers the smallest known convex hull, the best hull, of obstacles while moving around them. To construct the best hull, phantom points are introduced, which are imaginary turning points lying on non-convex corners to guide future searches. Tracing rules are introduced to ensure that the estimated path cost from the best hull increases admissibly and monotonically between queues to the open-list. The distance between the start and goal points have little impact on R2’s performance when compared to the number of line-of-sight checks that collide with obstacles. While having an exponential search time in the worst case with respect to the number of collided line-of-sight checks, R2 is much faster than state-of-the-art when the optimal path is expected to turn around few obstacles, especially on large maps with few disjoint and non-convex obstacles.},

In particular, efficient sensing has become a crucial challenge due to the growing demand for advanced intelligent monitoring missions. However, while previous studies have focused on power consumption models for vehicle locomotion, they have not fully addressed the high energy consumption of sensors. This study proposes an adaptive sensor-management algorithm to address the critical issue of energy consumption by considering the monitoring and navigation sensors that are widely used in UGV monitoring. After characterizing the proposed adaptive sensor-management strategy based on a risk map composed of monitoring and saving zones, we present a power consumption model to quantify the energy savings of the sensors. Furthermore, the optimal interval was derived to minimize power consumption during UGV monitoring. The proposed algorithm can minimize the energy consumption by adjusting the optimal interval according to the mission environment. We demonstrate the results of our analysis through various evaluations.},

The STE algorithm in conjunction with the convex polyhedrons extracted from the environment enables our method to be deployed in realistic scenarios with complex obstacles, which are often unfeasible for existing methods. The source confirmation algorithm in the relocation stage considerably accelerates the overall processing, improving the time efficiency in finding the radioactive sources. In both simulations and experiments, this approach is able to precisely localize at the success rate of 90% within an average of less than 13 measurements in 7 different environments, which is impressive when compared to the traditional STE which can hardly achieve an accurate estimation in most cases.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this article is to develop real-time controllers for positioning multi-agent autonomous platforms (specifically drones) without any collisions. The framework is divided in two controllers. The first, based on control barrier functions and quadratic programming , is an acceleration field , that computes an acceleration for each position and velocity of the system that guides the agents towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and inter-collisions. The second controls the agents’ total thrusts and angular velocities to track the previously-defined acceleration profiles. We show formal guarantees for both controllers, and simulation and experimental studies are used to show the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The short-run production and customization are increasingly common in the manufacturing industry, which results in the frequent adjustments of production lines. Industrial robots in these production lines are also required to quickly learn to perform new grasping tasks. However, the traditional approaches in grasping points selection, which rely on the geometric envelope models of objects in preset task space, can no longer meet the demands of fast-shifting production. Therefore, the present paper tackled the problem of grasping points selection with a novel CNN-based imitating learning framework. Our imitating model learns the correct grasping posture for objects from human grasping operations captured on camera. The experiments showed that this imitating learning algorithm can help a dual-arm robot master the correct grasping posture of an object within only 20 min. Compared to traditional geometric modeling-based methods, such as the pick-and-place module available in the Robot Operating System (ROS), this new approach can increase grasping planning efficiency by 26.1%.},

Three cases were examined in a static environment , achieving average performance metrics for reference signals in the X- and Y-directions, and heading tracking of 99.62%, 99.64%, and 95.08%, respectively.

The reactive obstacle avoidance strategy is based on quadratic programming(QP), using singularity avoidance and EE trajectory tracking tasks as soft constraints with different priorities. Considering the nonholonomic constraints and motion differences of MB, we employ a dynamic tracking approach to avoid obstacles of MB. Additionally, an adaptive weight method is utilized to adjust the priority of MB path tracking task, effectively preventing joint velocity jitter during the insertion process.

  abstract     = {Developing optimal controllers for aggressive high-speed quadcopter flight poses significant challenges in robotics. Recent trends in the field involve utilizing neural network controllers trained through supervised or reinforcement learning . However, the sim-to-real transfer introduces a reality gap, requiring the use of robust inner loop controllers during real flights, which limits the network’s control authority and flight performance. In this paper, we investigate for the first time, an end-to-end neural network controller, addressing the reality gap issue without being restricted by an inner-loop controller. The networks, referred to as G&amp;CNets, are trained to learn an energy-optimal policy mapping the quadcopter’s state to rpm commands using an optimal trajectory dataset. In hover-to-hover flights, we identified the unmodeled moments as a significant contributor to the reality gap. To mitigate this, we propose an adaptive control strategy that works by learning from optimal trajectories of a system affected by constant external pitch, roll and yaw moments. In real test flights, this model mismatch is estimated onboard and fed to the network to obtain the optimal rpm command. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing energy-optimal hover-to-hover flights with and without moment feedback. Finally, we compare the adaptive controller to a state-of-the-art differential-flatness-based controller in a consecutive waypoint flight and demonstrate the advantages of our method in terms of energy optimality and robustness.},

To enhance intubation efficiency, this paper developed a master–slave robotic nasotracheal intubation system (RNIS) for endoscopic operation. Movements in three degrees of freedom of the endoscope are controlled by the RNIS. An assisted teleoperation control strategy is designed to assist the operator in remotely controlling the pose, i.e., position and orientation, of the endoscope tip via a joystick. To ensure the efficiency of intubation, visual feedback assistance is hereby proposed, which fine-tunes the orientation of the endoscope tip as needed. The proposed system and methods are experimentally validated on a motion simulator and a phantom. The results demonstrated that the master–slave RNIS can successfully insert the flexible endoscope into the trachea of a phantom through the nasal cavity.},

Implementation of various model-based Kalman Filtering (KF) techniques for state estimation is prevalent in the literature.

Such methods are widely investigated and majorly focus on increasing the accuracy of the estimation. Ego motion prediction in these approaches does not model the sensor failure modes and assumes completely known dynamics with motion and measurement model noises. In this work, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based motion predictor that parallelly models the sensor measurement dynamics and selectively fuses the features to increase the robustness of prediction, in particular in scenarios where we witness sensor failures. This motion predictor is integrated into a KF-like framework, RobustStateNet that takes a global position from the GNSS sensor and updates the predicted state. We demonstrate that the proposed state estimation routine outperforms the Model-Based KF and KalmanNet architecture in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness. The proposed algorithms are validated in the modified NuScenes CAN bus dataset, designed to simulate various types of sensor failures.},

Path planning in complex and large environments using classical graph-based search is computationally too intensive. One of the main challenges of mobile robotics is describing the large robot’s workspaces with a reduction of graph complexity and improvement of path planning efficiency. A representation by a hierarchical graph (H-graph) facilitates graph creation and reduces the complexity of path planning. In this paper, we present an algorithm for autonomously generating a hierarchical graph of the environment from floor plans. The hierarchical abstraction depicts the environment in levels, from the most detailed to the most abstract representation of the environment, where pre-computed partial paths at the most detailed level are graph edges at a higher level. We use the E* algorithm to find partial paths in the most detailed abstraction level, and we propose the extraction of higher levels automatically from lower levels. We verified the proposed H-graph creation on three cases: our University premises as an example of a multi-building environment, a large warehouse with a lot of shelves, and an outdoor urban environment which is represented by a city map. All cases result in five abstract levels. The result shows that the path planning algorithm searches about 50 to 800 times fewer nodes when using the H-graph as the environment representation than when using a plain graph representing the entire environment as an occupancy grid map.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the problem of informative path planning for a UAV deployed for precision agriculture applications. First, we observe that the “fear of missing out” data lead to uniform, conservative scanning policies over the whole agricultural field. Consequently, employing a non-uniform scanning approach can mitigate the expenditure of time in areas with minimal or negligible real value, while ensuring heightened precision in information-dense regions. Turning to the available informative path planning methodologies, we discern that certain methods entail intensive computational requirements, while others necessitate training on an ideal world simulator. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an active sensing coverage path planning approach, named OverFOMO, that regulates the speed of the UAV in accordance with both the relative quantity of the identified classes, i.e. crops and weeds, and the confidence level of such detections. To identify these instances, a robust Deep Learning segmentation model is deployed. The computational needs of the proposed algorithm are independent of the size of the agricultural field, rendering its applicability on modern UAVs quite straightforward. The proposed algorithm was evaluated with a simu-realistic pipeline, combining data from real UAV missions and the high-fidelity dynamics of AirSim simulator, showcasing its performance improvements over the established state of affairs for this type of missions. An open-source implementation of the algorithm and the evaluation pipeline is also available: https://github.com/emmarapt/OverFOMO .},

It also provides a module for location estimation of the human pickers, allowing the robot to navigate to the estimated goal and assist them in real-time with logistic tasks during harvesting. The authors contribute a new video dataset of real fruit-picking operations under suboptimal conditions, which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Simulation results, obtained from the collected experimental dataset , show that the overall time required to compute insights-to-action is around six seconds for challenging scenarios such as multiple human pickers in the scene. This research aims to establish a baseline, end-to-end AI pipeline of insight predictions to prescriptive robot actions in fruit-picking operations to reduce workers’ working time and physical fatigue in logistics operations in the field. The authors expect this study to be used further to improve and develop anticipatory scheduling of robots methodology to save time and energy for pickers in logistics activities. The vision-based DTC architecture presents a reliable and cost-effective solution to address the scarcity of human labor in agriculture by facilitating the collaboration between humans and robots in fruit-picking tasks, as shown by simulations in the ROS-Gazebo framework.},

  abstract     = {High-definition (HD) maps provide a complementary source of information for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), allowing them to better understand the vehicle’s surroundings and make more informed decisions. HD maps are also largely employed in virtual testing phases to evaluate the behavior of ADAS components under simulated conditions. With the advent of autonomous sensorized vehicles, raw machine-oriented data will be increasingly available. The proposed pipeline aims to provide a high-level semantic interpretation of raw vehicle sensory data to derive, in an automated fashion, lane-oriented HD maps of the environment. We first present RoadStarNet, a deep learning architecture designed to extract and classify road line markings from imagery data. We show how to obtain a semantic Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) mapping of the extracted road line markings by exploiting frame-by-frame localization information. Then, we present how to progress to a graph-based representation that allows modeling complex road line markings’ structures practically, as this representation can be leveraged to produce a Lanelet2 format HD map. Lastly, we experimentally evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios in terms of accuracy and coverage performance.},

  abstract     = {Safe interaction with pedestrians is important for autonomous vehicles in urban environments. Comprehensive understanding of pedestrian behavior is a challenge for autonomous driving, as different pedestrian attributes have different characteristics and there is not yet a dataset providing all attribute labels. In this paper, we design an efficient multi-task model for pedestrian detection, tracking and attribute recognition to fully mine information in multiple tasks and multiple datasets to reduce redundant image processing computation. Multiple training datasets are utilized to take full advantage of the available partially-labeled data. The model consists of two stages. The first stage is to detect and track pedestrians, using only low-resolution images to save computational resources. Accurate pedestrian detection is achieved in the bird&#39;s-eye-view (BEV), while pedestrian tracking is implemented on the basis of 3D bounding boxes. The second stage is image-based multi-attribute detection. This stage uses the detection and tracking results and some pre-processed information from the first stage along with high-resolution images. Multi-attributes of the pedestrian are identified, such as pedestrian&#39;s pose, age, gender, and motion direction. With a carefully-designed multi-task system that shares necessary feature maps among multiple tasks and reuses computation results, we can solve pedestrian detection, tracking, and multi-attribute recognition problems in an efficient framework. This leads to more accurate decisions and more efficient computations. The innovation of the model is to accomplish a simultaneous detection of multiple pedestrian attributes for autonomous driving, while fully sharing the features in the model to avoid repeated computation, as well as utilizing multiple partially-labeled datasets for the pedestrian detection, tracking and attribute recognition model training.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), the perception of inland waterways has become significant to autonomous navigation . RGB cameras can capture images with rich semantic features , but they would fail in adverse weather and at night. As a perception sensor that has initially emerged in recent years, 4D millimeter-wave radar (4D mmWave radar) can work in all weather and has more abundant point-cloud features than ordinary radar, but it also suffers from water-surface clutter seriously. Furthermore, the shape and outline of dense point cloud captured by 4D mmWave radar are irregular. CNN-based neural networks treat features as 2D rectangle grids, which excessively favor image modality and are unfriendly to radar modality. Therefore, we transform both features of image and radar into non-Euclidean space as graph structures. In this paper, we focus on robust panoptic perception in inland waterways. Firstly, we propose the first Clutter-Point-Removal (CPR) algorithm for 4D mmWave radar, removing water-surface clutter and improving the recall of radar targets. Secondly, we propose a high-performance panoptic perception model based on the graph neural network called Mask-VRDet, fusing features of vision and radar to simultaneously perform object detection and semantic segmentation . To the best of our knowledge, Mask-VRDet is the first riverway panoptic perception model based on vision-radar graphical fusion. It outperforms other single-modal and fusion models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our collected dataset. We release our code at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/Mask-VRDet-Official .},

Compared with single-structure soft actuators for a whole finger, which require redesigning for each user, modular soft actuators enable the support for each joint by adjusting rigid connectors that are easier to fabricate. Several modular actuators have been developed, however, neither the effect of interaction between soft actuators and fingers nor the functionality of a hand under the support of an SRG has been appropriately evaluated. In this study, we proposed a new modular soft actuator that improved the support performance with enlarged chambers and fiber reinforcement . Moreover, we made an SRG with the proposed actuators and conducted an objective evaluation for the range of motion (ROM), torque, and response time of both actuators and the SRG with a dummy finger and hand. Furthermore, the Kapandji test, a clinical evaluation of the thumb’s opposition, was performed to show the performance of the proposed actuators and the SRG. As a result, the new modular soft actuators showed better support performance, and the SRG can support multiple grasping profiles and enable the thumb’s opposition. This work moves one step toward applying soft robotics to rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {The RRT algorithm based on random sampling is widely used in planning problems with non-holonomic constraints. In indoor environments, narrow passages exist in the map, and the RRT method suffers from slow convergence speed and poor path quality. Additionally, the typical feature of large indoor room spaces with small exits creates traps where RRT can easily become stuck, making it difficult to find a path quickly. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an improved RRT algorithm. This method first uses the simplified Bridge Test and point cloud clustering algorithm to locate the narrow passages on the map and place the root nodes in the narrow passage. Then grow multiple random trees from the root nodes, starting and endpoints. As the number of samples increases, the random trees gradually expand and connect to each other. The trees are connected to each other to build a complete path. Finally, the initial path is optimized and the final planning result is obtained. The simulation of the improved RRT, RRT*, RRT, and Bi-RRT is carried out. The simulation results show that the improved RRT algorithm proposed in this paper outperforms in terms of path length, number of exploring nodes, and processing time. We also tested 4 algorithms on a real robot, and the results prove the practical value of the improved algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The explosive growth of civil applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) calls for control algorithms that enable safe and trustworthy operations, especially in complex environments to facilitate real-world deployment. Although Model-Based Control (MBC) has found great applicability in the last decades, it relies heavily on the accuracy of the underlying mathematical models. Thanks to their powerful approximation capability, data-driven approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have raised a great interest in UAV dynamical modeling in recent years. Despite the promising results achieved in learning either full or partial dynamics such as aerodynamic effects , prior studies merely pay little to no attention to the black-box nature of ANNs, yielding poorly interpretable learning processes and implying a lack of generalization capability due to undesirably learned spurious relationships among features and labels. While nowadays practitioners and society are far from being concerned just with performance, such risk evidently reduces the overall trustworthiness of the control system with ANNs as control-oriented models. With the goal of both accurate and interpretable neural modeling of nonlinear dynamics , we propose a novel modeling approach that utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), designed to seamlessly embed physical laws into Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To further enhance model interpretability , we adopt the Covariance Confidence Ellipse (CCE) as post-hoc visualization to help understand the model behavior. We also set up a visual and physical simulator based on AirSim with custom implementation on quadrotor ground effect, which is made publicly available to facilitate further experiments for the community. An extensive simulation campaign validates our approach on data sets including aerodynamics and periodic wind, highlighting advantages regarding the accuracy and physical consistency, pointing to further insight on the development of learning-based control-oriented models for quadrotors, and facilitating flight controller design with performance guarantees.},

In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to predict the probability that a human user will interact with a robot before the interaction actually begins; the approach is self-supervised because after each encounter with a human, the robot can automatically label it depending on whether it resulted in an interaction or not. We explore different classification approaches , using different sets of features considering the pose and the motion of the user. We validate and deploy the approach in three scenarios. The first collects 3442 natural sequences (both interacting and non-interacting) representing employees in an office break area: a real-world, challenging setting, where we consider a coffee machine in place of a service robot . The other two scenarios represent researchers interacting with service robots (200 and 72 sequences, respectively). Results show that, even in challenging real-world settings, our approach can learn without external supervision, and can achieve accurate classification (i.e. AUROC greater than 0.9) of the user’s intention to interact with an advance of more than 3 s before the interaction actually occurs.},

Currently, most active prosthetic knee joints are directly actuated via motors, which have the disadvantages of high-power consumption and insufficient joint compliance.

The VSPEA prosthetic knee joint is implemented by a geared five-bar mechanism with a motor-screw system. The VSPEA mechanism is implemented via another optimized compact motor-screw-spring system controlled by an adaptive stiffness adjustment algorithm. Numerical verifications show that the VSPEA prosthetic knee joint can reduce its actuation torque and power compared to the prosthetic knee joint without the VSPEA mechanism. Further practical experiments of the VSPEA prosthetic knee joint indicate that the Root Mean Square of its actuation motor power can decline 7.36 %, 8.75 %, and 11.51 % at 1.49 m/s, 1.21 m/s, and 0.85 m/s level-ground walking, respectively, which demonstrated that VSPEA could effectively reduce the energy consumption and improve the endurance of the prosthetic knee joint.},

  abstract     = {Aeronautical performance is enhanced by increasingly complex and lightweight composite parts. The improvement of their manufacturing must ensure the quality measured by Non-Destructive Testing. To evaluate the health of aeronautical parts that are a few meters long, we built a high dimensional robotic cell including two industrial robots positioned on 5-meter-tracks equipped with X-ray Computed Tomography devices. Our main objective is to reconstruct the interior of the parts and detect any anomaly that may have occurred during life cycle or manufacturing (such as porosity or inclusions). In this way, the objective is to present a methodology, firstly, to evaluate the raw process capability and secondly, to assess the improved process capability. The raw process capability uses geometrical identification and we demonstrate that without proper identification, some defects can remain hidden. Three strategies are then developed. The first one involves improving the robot behavior model, which takes into account a thermo-geometrical model, including backlash compensation. Due to possible repositioning problems and to ensure the correct knowledge of the source with respect to the detector, the second strategy involves a real-time test phantom located on the detector named the comb prototype. Finally, a large-sized steel balls phantom is designed to allow a calibration in the full workspace of the robots. This phantom is also used to accurately determine the axis of the rotary horizontal-axis support on which the large parts to be controlled are fixed. We demonstrate that such an architecture, for reconstructing a perfect sphere, leads to an initial mean radius error of 0.05 mm which we improve to 0.016-0.017 mm with our methodology.},

  abstract     = {A new power-cycling variable transmission (PCVT) is proposed and applied to construction vehicles to improve transmission efficiency. To adapt to changes in external loads, construction vehicles need to shift gears continuously. However, the shift points obtained by traditional method cannot change with working conditions. This study aims to identify construction vehicles’ mass and gradient changes, and to develop a shift correction strategy. The double-forgetting factors least squares method is designed to identify slope gradient and load. A PCVT dynamic shift strategy is developed based on speed ratio adjustment characteristics. Next, a modified shift strategy under different loading mass and slope gradient conditions is proposed based on the construction vehicles’ mass change ratio, the gradient change ratio and balanced velocity. Simulation results show the proposed method can correct shift points, improve operation efficiency, avoid shift cycles and ensure a safer operation process.},

  abstract     = {Generic and high-performance feedback control is still challenging for tendon-driven continuum robots. Conventional model-based controllers, based on the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption, explicitly require the arc parameters (bending angle and direction angle) to link the task (in Cartesian coordinates) and actuation spaces. However, the approaches&#39; effectiveness remains to be explored when robot shapes deviate from circular arcs. This paper proposed a hybrid scheme for novel kinematic control of continuum robots. The error led by the slack state has been avoided through tension supervision, while analytical differential kinematics is further developed to avoid the explicit call of arc parameters by importing Cylindrical coordinates into task space and applying accurate piecewise linear approximation. Comparison between a conventional PCC-based controller and the proposed controller has been done by implementing them in a twin-pivot joint-based continuum section. An overall tip positioning accuracy of ±0.35mm has been reached, and a result of root-mean-square-error (RMSE): 0.3mm and Max error: 0.97mm has been observed when running two predefined path tracking. Further, in order to evaluate the versatility of the proposed controller, a dual-revolute joint-based and a 3D-printed continuum section were used to test for path tracking to prove the effectiveness of the controller on a wide range of continuum robotic systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, social robots have been increasingly used in the cultural sector to make artworks and exhibits more appealing to a larger audience. On the other hand, visitors, more accustomed to using novel technologies, are increasingly attracted to the possibility of exploiting new ways of interaction. However, more research needs to be done on how social robots successfully interact verbally and non-verbally with visitors. There are few studies on the impact of these technologies and, in particular, a greater level of involvement in using social robots instead of the more usual voice apps to access interactively and acquire information about a work of art or a museum exhibition. This paper proposes a human–robot interaction system based on a three-level architecture able to process and merge heterogeneous sensory information and obtain a set of anthropomorphic mechanisms and metaphors to make the interaction with visitors in museum settings as natural as possible. Moreover, an experimental study has been proposed to assess the impact of this proposed solution, embedded in the social robot Pepper, on museum visitors in the context of an exhibit on Leonardo da Vinci . In particular, the study first aimed to find a potential difference in the interactions between visitors grouped by age and interfacing with the robot equipped with the proposed system or a voice app. Secondly, the study focused on evaluating the effectiveness and usefulness of the robot equipped with the proposed interaction system. A comparative User Experience was conducted between the robot and voice app and a User Experience only for the robot using a specific questionnaire for robotic applications . The results showed a good ability of the proposed system integrated into the robot to make interaction with visitors more pleasant, attractive, and friendly. Engagement and dialogue with them are more natural, stable, and lasting. The cultural information is conveyed more easily and clearly.},

This paper presents a novel traversability analysis and path planning technique that processes 3D point cloud maps to compute terrain gradient information and detect the presence of obstacles to generate efficient paths. These avoid unnecessary slope changes when more conservative paths are available, potentially promoting fuel economy, reducing the wear on the equipment and the associated risks. The proposed approach is shown to outperform existing techniques both in 3D simulation scenarios as well as in a real forest dataset, in which it also generates paths that are comparable to the ones drawn by humans with different backgrounds and expertise levels.},

  abstract     = {Accurate detection and tracking of vulnerable road users and traffic objects represent vital tasks for autonomous driving and driving assistance systems. The recent developments in the field rely heavily on deep learning techniques , which require large computational resources . Thus, optimizing software components alongside appropriate hardware choices is imperative for the development of a system that can perform real-time inference. In this paper, we propose a solution for object detection and tracking in an autonomous driving scenario. Specifically, we compare and explore the applicability of various state-of-the-art object detectors trained on the BDD100K dataset, including YOLOv8, YOLOv7, YOLOv5 , Scaled-YOLOv4, and YOLOR. Moreover, we investigate the deployment of these algorithms on edge devices, such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of DeepStream technology for real-time inference, comparing different object trackers, such as NvDCF and DeepSORT, using the KITTI tracking dataset. The suggested approach entails utilizing a YOLOR-CSP architecture in conjunction with a DeepSORT tracker, to achieve a real-time inference rate of 33.3 frames per second (FPS) with a detection interval of one, and a 17 FPS rate with an interval of zero.},

  abstract     = {Powered exoskeletons have been shown to significantly reduce physical workload during occupational tasks. Due to this they have great potential impact on future labor practices. However, powered exoskeleton controllers must first be developed that are able to directly assist with task objectives and truly collaborate with users. To address this need we present a shared autonomy control framework that separates the human and exoskeleton control objectives . This allows for creating a feedback-based exoskeleton controller that will help accomplish the user’s task goals rather than just assisting in specific motions. We introduce Positive Power control for the human-based controller that is designed to allow the human to directly command work that accomplishes the desired task. While a standard robotic controller can be used for the feedback-based control, we introduce ‘acceptance’ as a measure of how well the exoskeleton’s control objective matches the human’s. Both control objectives are implemented in an optimization-based Whole-Body-Control structure. Finally, we introduce a method to update the exoskeleton’s objectives to match the humans’ such that after operating for a time the exoskeleton can learn to assist the user in accomplishing their task. This framework is implemented on a 10-DoF upper-body powered exoskeleton. The results verify that the control framework works as desired and can form a basis for developing extended methods for directly improving cooperative control for powered exoskeletons.},

This paper investigates the problem of controlling a wheeled mobile manipulator endowed with a snake-like arm to inspect the structures while stabilizing the supporting pipe. A model predictive control approach stabilizes the wheeled robot on the pipe. When the wheel torques saturate, the stabilization task leverages the resulting propagating force on the wheeled robot given by the snake-like arm’s dynamics. The significant number of degrees of freedom given by the snake-like arm allows a prioritized redundancy resolution scheme with hybrid motion/force tracking to inspect the same and adjacent pipes while avoiding self-collisions and environmental impacts. Simulations in the realistic Gazebo environment validate the achieved preliminary results.},

This paper proposes a two-objective optimization technique for the MRS that undertakes the machining mission of large spacecraft components, where the robot base positions and task assignment are taken as optimization variables, and a multi-objective algorithm based on NSGA-II is introduced, efficient execution of the algorithm is guaranteed by specially designed crossover and correction operators. A test case of spacecraft structure machining mission shows that the algorithms find both productivity-optimal and machining performance-optimal solutions, and an appropriate trade-off between productivity and machining performance should be more desirable in real-world applications.},
