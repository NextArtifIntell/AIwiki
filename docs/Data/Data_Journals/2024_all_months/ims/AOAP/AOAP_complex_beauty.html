We show that the corresponding rate functions in these cases can be expressed as a variational problem over a suitable space of functions. We use the tools developed to study Gibbs measures with the corresponding Hamiltonians, which include tensor generalizations of both Ising (with noncompact base measure) and Potts models. For these Gibbs measures, we establish scaling limits of log normalizing constants, and weak laws in terms of weak* topology, which are of possible independent interest.},

Whenever a site is occupied by at least two particles, all the particles at that site are annihilated. We prove that for any μ&gt;1 the process survives when R is sufficiently large. For fixed R we show that the process dies out if μ is too small or too large. Furthermore, we exhibit an interval of μ-values for which the process survives and possesses a unique nontrivial ergodic equilibrium for R sufficiently large.

We derive limit distributions for the Lp-error with arbitrary p∈[1,∞) and for linear functionals of the empirical OT map, together with their moment convergence. The former has a non-Gaussian limit, whose explicit density is derived, while the latter attains asymptotic normality. For both cases, we also establish consistency of the nonparametric bootstrap. The derivation of our limit theorems relies on new stability estimates of functionals of the OT map with respect to the dual potential vector, which may be of independent interest. We also discuss applications of our limit theorems to the construction of confidence sets for the OT map and inference for a maximum tail correlation. Finally, we show that, while the empirical OT map does not possess nontrivial weak limits in the L2 space, it satisfies a central limit theorem in a dual Hölder space, and the Gaussian limit law attains the asymptotic efficiency bound.},

  abstract     = {The present paper is devoted to the study of the long term dynamics of diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity is determined by the sign of Λ0, the external Lyapunov exponent, as follows: Λ0&lt;0 implies (asymptotic) extinction and Λ0&gt;0 implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution μ0. If the system is of size 1ϵ2 for small ϵ&gt;0 (the intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) μϵ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is well known under mild assumptions. We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, that is, when ϵ→0. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a key role: (1) If Λ0&lt;0, then μϵ→δ0, the mean extinction time is of order |lnϵ| and the extinction rate associated with the QSD μϵ has a lower bound of order 1|lnϵ|; (2) If Λ0&gt;0, then μϵ→μ0, the mean extinction time is polynomial in 1ϵ2 and the extinction rate is polynomial in ϵ2. Furthermore, when Λ0&gt;0 we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics: at first the process quickly approaches the QSD μϵ and then, after spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We give sharp asymptotics in ϵ for the time spent close to μϵ. In contrast to models that only take into account demographic stochasticity, our results demonstrate the significant effect of environmental stochasticity—it turns an exponentially long mean extinction time to a sub-exponential one.},

We present a general method, based on tools used to prove the metastable behaviour of Markov chains, to derive a full expansion of In expressing it as In=I(0)+∑ 1≤p≤q(1/θn(p))I(p), where I(p):P(Rd)→[0,+∞] represent rate functionals independent of n and θn(p) sequences such that θn(1)→∞, θn(p)/θn(p+1)→0 for 1≤p&lt;q. The speed θn(p) corresponds to the time-scale at which the Markov chains Xt(n) exhibits a metastable behaviour, and the I(p−1) zero-level sets to the metastable states. To illustrate the theory we apply the method to random walks in potential fields.},

Here, we change the perspective, with surprising results. We show that any distributions μ, ν in convex order with ν atomless admit a martingale coupling given by a Monge map over the second marginal ν. Namely, we construct a particular coupling called the barcode transport. Much more generally, we prove that such “backward Monge” martingale transports are dense in the set of all martingale couplings, paralleling the classical denseness result for Monge transports in the Kantorovich formulation of optimal transport. Various properties and applications are presented, including a refined version of Strassen’s theorem and a mimicking theorem where the marginals of a given martingale are reproduced by a “backward deterministic” martingale, a remarkable type of process whose current state encodes its whole history.},

Our approach uses k distinguished spine particles and a suitable change of measure under which (a) the spines form a uniform sample without replacement, as required, but additionally (b) there is k-size biasing and discounting according to the population size.

The measurements are correlated both timewise and between rows. We show that the r largest eigenvalues of the wavelet random matrices, when appropriately rescaled, converge in probability to scale-invariant functions in the high-dimensional limit. By contrast, the remaining p−r eigenvalues remain bounded in probability.

  abstract     = {The analysis of large-scale, parallel-server load balancing systems has relied heavily on mean-field analysis. A pivotal assumption for this framework is that servers are exchangeable. However, modern data-centers have data locality constraints, such that tasks of a particular type can only be routed to a small subset of servers. An emerging line of research, therefore, considers load balancing algorithms on bipartite graphs where vertices represent task types and servers, respectively. Due to the lack of exchangeability in this model, mean-field techniques fundamentally break down. Recent progress has been made on graphs with strong edge-expansion properties, that is, where any two large subsets of vertices are well-connected. However, data locality often leads to spatial graphs that do not have strong expansion properties. In this paper, we develop a novel coupling-based approach to establish mean-field approximation for a large class of graphs which includes spatial graphs. The method extends the scope of mean-field analysis far beyond the classical full-flexibility setup. En route, we prove that, starting from suitable states, the occupancy process becomes close to its steady state in a time that is independent of system size, which might be of independent interest. Numerical experiments are conducted, which positively support the theoretical results.},

We also provide sharp estimates on the center and width of the cutoff window. Finally, we illustrate those results by establishing explicit separation cutoffs on various networks, including: (i) large finite subgraphs of any fixed infinite nonamenable graph, with absorption at the boundary and (ii) large finite vertex-transitive graphs with absorption at a single vertex. The latter result settles a conjecture of Levine and Liang.

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a general methodology for stochastic control problems driven by the Brownian motion filtration including non-Markovian and nonsemimartingale state processes controlled by mutually singular measures. The main result of this paper is the development of a numerical scheme for computing near-optimal controls associated with controlled Wiener functionals via a finite-dimensional approximation procedure. The approach does not require functional differentiability assumptions on the value process and ellipticity conditions on the diffusion components. The general convergence of the method is established under rather weak conditions for distinct types of non-Markovian and nonsemimartingale states. Explicit rates of convergence are provided in case the control acts only on the drift component of the controlled system. Near-closed/open-loop optimal controls are fully characterized by a dynamic programming algorithm and they are classified according to the strength of the possibly underlying non-Markovian memory. The theory is applied to stochastic control problems based on path-dependent SDEs and rough stochastic volatility models, where both drift and possibly degenerated diffusion components are controlled. Optimal control of drifts for nonlinear path-dependent SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion with exponent H∈(0,12) is also discussed. Finally, we present a simple numerical example to illustrate the method.},

  abstract     = {For an n×n matrix An, the r→p operator norm is defined as ‖A n‖r→p:=supx∈Rn:‖x‖r≤1‖Anx‖pforr,p≥1. For different choices of r and p, this norm corresponds to key quantities that arise in diverse applications including matrix condition number estimation, clustering of data, and construction of oblivious routing schemes in transportation networks. This article considers r→p norms of symmetric random matrices with nonnegative entries, including adjacency matrices of Erdős–Rényi random graphs, matrices with positive sub-Gaussian entries, and certain sparse matrices. For 1&lt;p≤r&lt;∞, the asymptotic normality, as n→∞, of the appropriately centered and scaled norm ‖An‖r→p is established. When p≥2, this is shown to imply, as a corollary, asymptotic normality of the solution to the ℓp quadratic maximization problem, also known as the ℓp Grothendieck problem. Furthermore, a sharp ℓ∞-approximation bound for the unique maximizing vector in the definition of ‖An‖r→p is obtained, and may be viewed as an ℓ∞-stability result of the maximizer under random perturbations of the matrix with mean entries. This result, which may be of independent interest, is in fact shown to hold for a broad class of deterministic sequences of matrices having certain asymptotic expansion properties. The results obtained can be viewed as a generalization of the seminal results of Füredi and Komlós (1981) on asymptotic normality of the largest singular value of a class of symmetric random matrices, which corresponds to the special case r=p=2 considered here. In the general case with 1&lt;p≤r&lt;∞, spectral methods are no longer applicable, and so a new approach is developed involving a refined convergence analysis of a nonlinear power method and a perturbation bound on the maximizing vector, which may be of independent interest.},

More precisely, we give nonasymptotic bounds on ρ(L(Yk),L(Y˜k)), where ρ is an appropriate weighted Wasserstein distance or a V-distance, uniformly in the parameter γ, and on ρ(πγ,π˜γ), where πγ and π˜γ are the respective stationary measures of the two processes. The class of considered processes encompasses the Euler–Maruyama discretization of Langevin diffusions and its variants. The bounds we derive are of order γ as γ→0. To obtain our results, we rely on the construction of a discrete sticky Markov chain (Wk(γ))k∈N which bounds the distance between an appropriate coupling of the two processes. We then establish stability and quantitative convergence results for this process uniformly on γ. In addition, we show that it converges in distribution to the continuous sticky process studied in Howitt (Ph.D. thesis (2007)) and Eberle and Zimmer (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab.

In this random geometry, we study the meeting time of two random walks starting at stationarity, the coalescence time for a system of coalescent random walks, and the consensus time of the classical voter model. Indeed, it is known that the latter three quantities are related to each other under certain mean field conditions requiring fast enough mixing time and not too concentrated stationary distribution. Our main result shows that, for a typical large graph from the DCM ensemble, the meeting time is well-approximated by an exponential random variable for which we provide the first-order asymptotics of its expectation, showing that the latter is linear in the size of the graph, and its pre-constant depends on some explicit statistics of the degree sequence. As a byproduct, we explore the effect of the degree sequence in changing the meeting, coalescence, and consensus time by discussing several classes of examples of interest also from an applied perspective. Our approach follows the classical idea of converting meeting into hitting times of a proper collapsed chain, which we control by the so-called first visit time lemma. The main technical challenge is related to the fact that in such a directed setting the stationary distribution is random, and it depends on the whole realization of the graph. As a consequence, a good share of the proof focuses on showing that certain functions of the stationary distribution concentrate around their expectations, and on their characterization, via proper annealing arguments.},

The analysis becomes challenging when this scheme is critical (i.e., G and H are simultaneously singular). Motivated by many examples (random mappings, planar maps, directed lattice paths), we consider a natural extension of this scheme, namely F(z,u)=G(uH(z))M(z). We also consider a variant of this scheme, which allows us to analyse the number of H-components of a given size in F. We prove that these two models lead to a rich world of limit laws, where we identify the key role played by a new universal law introduced in this article: the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution, which is essentially the product of a beta and a Mittag-Leffler distribution. We also prove (double) phase transitions, additionally involving Boltzmann and mixed Poisson distributions, bringing a unified explanation of the associated thresholds. In all cases we obtain moment convergence and local limit theorems. We end with extensions of the critical composition scheme to a cycle scheme and to the multivariate case, leading to product distributions. Applications are presented for random walks, trees (supertrees of trees, increasingly labelled trees, preferential attachment trees), triangular Pólya urns, and the Chinese restaurant process.},

This approach enables Lp-estimates, p∈(2,∞), for the approximation error depending on the weight, and it allows a change of the underlying measure which leaves the error estimates unchanged. To take advantage of this approach, we propose a new approximation scheme obtained from an adjustment for the Riemann approximation based on tracking jumps of the underlying semimartingale. We discuss a way to optimize the approximation and also illustrate the sharpness of the obtained convergence rates. When the small jump activity of the semimartingale behaves like an α-stable process with α∈(1,2), our scheme achieves under a regular regime the same convergence rate for the error as in Rosenbaum and Tankov [Ann. Appl. Probab. 24 (2014) 1002–1048]. Moreover, our approach extends to the case α∈(0,1] and to the Lp-setting which are not treated there. As an application, we apply the methods in the special case where the semimartingale is an exponential Lévy process to mean-variance hedging of European type options.},

The noisy voter model is a variation of the voter model in which vertices may change their opinions by the action of an external noise. The strength of this noise is measured by an extra parameter p∈[0,1]. In this work we analyse the density process, defined as the stationary mass of vertices with opinion 1, that is, St=∑ x∈Vπ(x)ξt(x), where π is the stationary distribution of P, and ξt(x) is the opinion of vertex x at time t. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of St when t tends to infinity for different values of the noise parameter p. In particular, by allowing P and p to be functions of the size |V|, we show that, under appropriate conditions and small enough p a normalised version of St converges to a Gaussian random variable, while for large enough p, St converges to a Bernoulli random variable. We provide further analysis of the noisy voter model on a variety of specific graphs including the complete graph, cycle, torus, and hypercube, where we identify the critical rate p (depending on the size |V|) that separates these two asymptotic behaviours.},

To implement the comparison we estimate an object reminiscent to the Radon–Nikodym derivative on a carefully chosen set of trajectories.

Our main result shows the existence of a solution whose discontinuities obey the natural physicality condition for the problem at hand. Thus, this work extends the recent series of existence results for singular one-phase Stefan problems in one space dimension. As for the one-phase problems, our existence result is obtained via a large system limit of a finite particle system approximation in the Skorokhod M1 topology.

We observe that this is an implicit Euler scheme for a gradient flow system. We prove that appropriate interpolations of the iterates of the modified MSA converge to a gradient flow with rate τ. We then study the convergence of this gradient flow as time goes to infinity. In the general (nonconvex) case we prove that the gradient term itself converges to zero. This is a consequence of an energy identity which shows that the optimization objective decreases along the gradient flow. Moreover, in the convex case, when Pontryagin optimality principle provides a sufficient condition for optimality, we prove that the optimization objective converges at rate 1S to its optimal value and at exponential rate under strong convexity. The main technical difficulties lie in obtaining appropriate properties of the Hamiltonian (growth, continuity). These are obtained by utilising the theory of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) martingales required for estimates on the adjoint backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE).},

We derive law of large numbers and central limit type results for the number of individuals and the number of communities affected and the so-called severity of the outbreak.

The inference is based on a panel of high-frequency asset returns, with both the sampling frequency and the size of the cross-section increasing asymptotically. The feasible limit theory developed in the paper utilizes the different asymptotic roles played by diffusive versus jump risks and systematic versus idiosyncratic risks in statistics that involve cross-sectional averages of suitably chosen transforms of the high-frequency price increments. The rate of convergence of the statistics is determined by the two asymptotically increasing dimensions of the panel, without imposing restrictions on their relative size. In an empirical application, using the developed tools, we document the existence of systematic jump risk, that is not spanned by standard (observable) risk factors, and we further show that this risk commands a nontrivial risk premium.},

  abstract     = {The theory of two projections is utilized to study two-component Gibbs samplers. Through this theory, previously intractable problems regarding the asymptotic variances of two-component Gibbs samplers are reduced to elementary matrix algebra exercises. It is found that in terms of asymptotic variance, the two-component random-scan Gibbs sampler is never much worse, and could be considerably better than its deterministic-scan counterpart, provided that the selection probability is appropriately chosen. This is especially the case when there is a large discrepancy in computation cost between the two components. The result contrasts with the known fact that the deterministic-scan version has a faster convergence rate, which can also be derived from the method herein. On the other hand, a modified version of the deterministic-scan sampler that accounts for computation cost can outperform the random-scan version.},

We next characterize the optimal stopping policies of the mean field problem by the accumulation points of the finite population optimal stopping strategies. In particular, if the limiting problem has a unique optimal stopping policy, then the finite population optimal stopping strategies do converge towards this solution. As a by-product of our analysis, we provide an extension of the standard propagation of chaos to the context of stopped McKean–Vlasov diffusions.},

The position of the obstacles is drawn according to a renewal process with a power-law increment distribution. In a previous work, we computed the large-time asymptotics of the quenched survival probability. In the present work we continue our study by describing the behaviour of the random walk conditioned to survive. We prove that with large probability, the walk quickly reaches a unique time-dependent optimal gap that is free from obstacles and gets localized there. We actually establish a dichotomy. If the renewal tail exponent is smaller than one then the walk hits the optimal gap and spends all of its remaining time inside, up to finitely many visits to the bottom of the gap. If the renewal tail exponent is larger than one then the random walk spends most of its time inside of the optimal gap but also performs short outward excursions, for which we provide matching upper and lower bounds on their length and cardinality. Our key tools include a Markov renewal interpretation of the survival probability as well as various comparison arguments for obstacle environments. Our results may also be rephrased in terms of localization properties for a directed polymer among multiple repulsive interfaces.},

Lions. Rather than studying the usual system of Hamilton–Jacobi/Fokker–Planck PDEs using analytic techniques, we instead study a stochastic control problem on a specially constructed Hilbert space, which is reminiscent of a tangent space on the Wasserstein space in optimal transport. On this Hilbert space we can use classical control theory techniques, despite the fact that it is infinite-dimensional. A consequence of our construction is that the mean field type control problem appears as a special case. Thus we preserve the advantages of the lifting procedure, while removing some of the difficulties. Our approach extends previous work by two of the coauthors, which dealt with a deterministic control problem for which the Hilbert space could be generic (ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var. 25 (2019) 1–36).},

Although these algorithms are often first derived for matrices having independent Gaussian entries or satisfying rotational invariance in law, their state evolution characterizations are expected to hold over larger universality classes of random matrix ensembles. We develop several new results on AMP universality. For AMP algorithms tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles, including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over delocalized sign-and-permutation-invariant matrix ensembles that have a limit distribution over the diagonal, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or Fourier transforms and diagonal operators. We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness for traces of matrix products.},

In the graph-based semisupervised learning community this equation is also known as Lipschitz learning. The graph infinity Laplace equation is characterized by the metric on the underlying space, and convergence rates follow from convergence rates for graph distances. At the connectivity threshold, this problem is related to Euclidean first passage percolation, which is concerned with the Euclidean distance function dh(x,y) on a homogeneous Poisson point process on Rd, where admissible paths have step size at most h&gt;0. Using a suitable regularization of the distance function and subadditivity we prove that dhs(0,se1)/s→σ as s→∞ almost surely where σ≥1 is a dimensional constant and hs≳log(s)1/d. A convergence rate is not available due to a lack of approximate superadditivity when hs→∞. Instead, we prove convergence rates for the ratio dh(0,se1) dh(0,2se1)→1 2 when h is frozen and does not depend on s. Combining this with the techniques that we developed in (IMA J. Numer. Anal. 43 (2023) 2445–2495), we show that this notion of ratio convergence is sufficient to establish uniform convergence rates for solutions of the graph infinity Laplace equation at percolation length scales.},

  abstract     = {Sourav Chatterjee, Persi Diaconis, Allan Sly, and Lingfu Zhang (Ann. Probab. 50 (2022) 1–17), prompted by a question of Ramis Movassagh, renewed the study of a process proposed in the early 1980s by Jean Bourgain. A state vector v∈Rn, labeled with the vertices of a connected graph, G, changes in discrete time steps following the simple rule that at each step a random edge (i,j) is picked and vi and vj are both replaced by their average (vi+vj)/2. It is easy to see that the value associated with each vertex converges to ∑ i=1nvi/n. The question focused on understanding the time denoted as tϵ,1, which represents how quickly will v be ϵ-close to uniform in the L1 norm in the case of the complete graph, Kn, when v is initialized as a standard basis vector that takes the value 1 on one coordinate, and zeros everywhere else. They have established a sharp cutoff of 1 2log2nlogn+O(nlogn). Our main result is to prove, that (1−ϵ)2log2nlogn−O(n) is a general lower bound for all connected graphs on n nodes. We also get sharp magnitude of tϵ,1 for several important families of graphs, including star, expander, dumbbell, and cycle.

  abstract     = {Arrow’s theorem concerns a fundamental problem in social choice theory: given the individual preferences of members of a group, how can they be aggregated to form rational group preferences? Arrow showed that in an election between three or more candidates, there are situations where any voting rule satisfying a small list of natural “fairness” axioms must produce an apparently irrational intransitive outcome. Furthermore, quantitative versions of Arrow’s theorem in the literature show that when voters choose rankings in an i.i.d. fashion, the outcome is intransitive with nonnegligible probability. It is natural to ask if such a quantitative version of Arrow’s theorem holds for non-i.i.d. models. To answer this question, we study Arrow’s theorem under a natural non-i.i.d. model of voters inspired by canonical models in statistical physics; indeed, a version of this model was previously introduced by Raffaelli and Marsili in the physics literature. This model has a parameter, temperature, that prescribes the correlation between different voters. We show that the behavior of Arrow’s theorem in this model of an election with three alternatives undergoes a striking phase transition: in the entire high temperature regime of the model, a quantitative Arrow’s theorem holds showing that the probability of paradox for any voting rule satisfying the axioms is nonnegligible; this is tight because the probability of paradox under pairwise majority goes to zero when approaching the critical temperature, and becomes exponentially small in the number of voters beyond it. We prove this occurs in another natural model of correlated voters and conjecture this phenomena is quite general.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we address the problem of testing whether two observed trees (t,t′) are sampled either independently or from a joint distribution under which they are correlated. This problem, which we refer to as correlation detection in trees, plays a key role in the study of graph alignment for two correlated random graphs. Motivated by graph alignment, we investigate the conditions of existence of one-sided tests, that is, tests which have vanishing type I error and nonvanishing power in the limit of large tree depth. For the correlated Galton–Watson model with Poisson offspring of mean λ&gt;0 and correlation parameter s∈(0,1), we identify a phase transition in the limit of large degrees at s=α, where α∼0.3383 is Otter’s constant. Namely, we prove that no such test exists for s≤α, and that such a test exists whenever s&gt;α, for λ large enough. This result sheds new light on the graph alignment problem in the sparse regime (with O(1) average node degrees) and on the performance of the MPAlign method studied in (Ganassali, Massoulié and Lelarge (2022), J. Stat. Mech. Theory Exp. 2022 (2022)), proving in particular the conjecture of (J. Stat. Mech. Theory Exp. 2022 (2022)) that MPAlign succeeds in the partial recovery task for correlation parameter s&gt;α provided the average node degree λ is large enough. As a byproduct, we identify a new family of orthogonal polynomials for the Poisson–Galton–Watson measure which enjoy remarkable properties. These polynomials may be of independent interest for a variety of problems involving graphs, trees or branching processes, beyond the scope of graph alignment.},

By a different approach, we are able to prove an analogous reverse ergodic theorem for a family of inhomogeneous subprobability transition functions. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness for a semimartingale diffusion process with varying, oblique direction of reflection, in a domain with one singular point that can be approximated, near the singular point, by a smooth cone, under natural, easily verifiable geometric conditions. Along the way we also show that, under our conditions, the parameter α of Kwon and Williams (1991) is strictly less than 1, thus partially extending the results of Williams (Z. Warsch. Verw.

  abstract     = {The Doeblin graph of a countable state space Markov chain describes the joint pathwise evolutions of the Markov dynamics starting from all possible initial conditions, with two paths coalescing when they reach the same point of the state space at the same time. Its bridge Doeblin subgraph only contains the paths starting from a tagged point of the state space at all possible times. In the irreducible, aperiodic, and positive recurrent case, the following results are known: the bridge Doeblin graph is an infinite tree that is unimodularizable. Moreover, it contains a single bi-infinite path which allows one to build a perfect sample of the stationary state of the Markov chain. The present paper is focused on the null recurrent case. It is shown that when assuming irreducibility and aperiodicity again, the bridge Doeblin graph is either a single infinite tree or a forest made of a countable collection of infinite trees. In the first case, the infinite tree in question has a single end, is not unimodularizable in general, but is always locally unimodular. These key properties are used to study the stationary regime of several measure-valued random dynamics on this bridge Doeblin Tree, which can be seen as pathwise extensions of classical distributional dynamics associated to the Markov chain. This includes the taboo random dynamics, which admits as steady state a random measure with mean measure equal to the invariant measure of the Markov chain, and the potential random dynamics which admits as steady state a locally finite random measure, with a mean measure equal to infinity at every point of the state space. The practical interest of these two random measures is discussed in the context of perfect sampling.},

Furthermore, we prove that the accumulated proportion of infection converges to a number that is constant over space and find its explicit value. An important message is that if there is no vaccination, then the accumulated proportion of infection can be much higher than the vaccination proportion required to prevent sustained spread of infection.},

It is important to notice that the type of dependencies featured by cylinder’s percolation is particularly intricate, given that the cylinders have infinite range (unlike some models like Boolean percolation) while at the same time being rigid bodies (unlike processes such as random interlacements). Our work introduces a new notion of fast decoupling, proves that it holds for the model in question and finishes with an application. More precisely, we prove that for a small enough density of cylinders, a random walk on a connected component of the vacant set is transient for all dimensions d≥3.},

Here, vertices are equipped with a random vertex-weight representing initial inhomogeneities in the network, so that a new vertex connects to one of the old vertices with a probability that is proportional to their vertex-weight. We first identify the asymptotic degree distribution of a uniformly chosen vertex for a general vertex-weight distribution. For the maximal degree, we distinguish several classes that lead to different behaviour: For bounded vertex-weights we obtain results for the maximal degree that are similar to those observed for RRTs and DAGs. If the vertex-weights have unbounded support, then the maximal degree has to satisfy the right balance between having a high vertex-weight and being born early. For vertex-weights in the Fréchet maximum domain of attraction the first-order behaviour of the maximal degree is random, while for those in the Gumbel maximum domain of attraction the leading order is deterministic. Surprisingly, in the latter case, the second order is random when considering vertices in a compact window in the optimal region, while it becomes deterministic when considering all vertices.},

This paper establishes bounds on Wasserstein distances between the invariant probability measures of inexact MCMC methods and their target distributions with a focus on understanding the precise dependence of this asymptotic bias on both dimension and discretization step size. Assuming Wasserstein bounds on the convergence to equilibrium of either the exact or the approximate dynamics, we show that for both ULA and uHMC, the asymptotic bias depends on key quantities related to the target distribution or the stationary probability measure of the scheme. As a corollary, we conclude that for models with a limited amount of interactions such as mean-field models, finite range graphical models, and perturbations thereof, the asymptotic bias has a similar dependence on the step size and the dimension as for product measures.},

  abstract     = {We study the computational-statistical gap of the planted clique problem, where a clique of size k is planted in an Erdős–Rényi graph G(n,12). The goal is to recover the planted clique vertices by observing the graph. It is known that the clique can be recovered as long as k≥(2+ϵ)logn for any ϵ&gt;0, but no polynomial-time algorithm is known for this task unless k=Ω(n). Following a statistical-physics inspired point of view, as a way to understand the nature of this computational-statistical gap, we study the landscape of the “sufficiently dense” subgraphs of G and their overlap with the planted clique. Using the first moment method, we present evidence of a phase transition for the presence of the overlap gap property (OGP) at k=Θ(n). OGP is a concept originating in spin glass theory and known to suggest algorithmic hardness when it appears. We further prove the presence of the OGP when k is a small positive power of n, and therefore, for an exponential-in-n part of the gap, by using a conditional second moment method. As our main technical tool, we establish the first, to the best of our knowledge, concentration results for the K-densest subgraph problem for the Erdős–Rényi model G(n,12) when K=n0.5−ϵ for arbitrary ϵ&gt;0. Our methodology throughout the paper, is based on a certain form of overparametrization, which is conceptually aligned with a large body of recent work in learning theory and optimization.},

  abstract     = {The maximum likelihood threshold (MLT) of a graph G is the minimum number of samples to almost surely guarantee existence of the maximum likelihood estimate in the corresponding Gaussian graphical model. We give a new characterization of the MLT in terms of rigidity-theoretic properties of G and use this characterization to give new combinatorial lower bounds on the MLT of any graph. We use the new lower bounds to give high-probability guarantees on the maximum likelihood thresholds of sparse Erdős–Rényi random graphs in terms of their average density. These examples show that the new lower bounds are within a polylog factor of tight, where, on the same graph families, all known lower bounds are trivial. Based on computational experiments made possible by our methods, we conjecture that the MLT of an Erdős–Rényi random graph is equal to its generic completion rank with high probability. Using structural results on rigid graphs in low dimension, we can prove the conjecture for graphs with MLT at most 4 and describe the threshold probability for the MLT to switch from 3 to 4. We also give a geometric characterization of the MLT of a graph in terms of a new “lifting” problem for frameworks that is interesting in its own right. The lifting perspective yields a new connection between the weak MLT (where the maximum likelihood estimate exists only with positive probability) and the classical Hadwiger–Nelson problem.},

This establishes the well-known connection between Pontryagin’s maximum principle and dynamic programming within the framework of viscosity solutions. As a corollary, we derive that the correction term in the stochastic Hamiltonian arising in nonsmooth stochastic control problems is nonpositive. These results directly lead us to a stochastic verification theorem for fully nonlinear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations in the framework of viscosity solutions.},

  abstract     = {We consider an epidemic SIS model described by a multitype birth-and-death process in a randomly switching environment. That is, the infection and cure rates of the process depend on the state of a finite Markov jump process (the environment), whose transitions also depend on the number of infectives. The total size of the population is constant and equal to some K∈N∗, and the number of infectives vanishes almost surely in finite time. We prove that, as K→∞, the process composed of the proportions of infectives of each type XK and the state of the environment ΞK, converges to a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) given by a system of randomly switching ODEs. The long term behaviour of this PDMP has been previously investigated by Benaïm and Strickler, and depends only on the sign of the top Lyapunov exponent Λ of the linearised PDMP at 0: if Λ0, the disease becomes endemic. In this paper, we show that the large population asymptotics of XK also strongly depend on the sign of Λ: if negative, then from fixed initial proportions of infectives the disease disappears in a time of order at most log(K), while if positive, the typical extinction time grows at least as a power of K. We prove that in the situation where the origin is accessible for the linearised PDMP, the mean extinction time of XK is logarithmically equivalent to Kp∗, where p∗&gt;0 is fully characterised. We also investigate the quasi-stationary distribution μK of (XK,ΞK) and show that, when Λ0 are supported by the extinction set, while when Λ&gt;0, limit points belong to the (nonempty) set of stationary distributions of the limiting PDMP which do not give mass to the extinction set.},

From a computational viewpoint, one never has access to the continuous observation of the excursion set, but rather to observations at discrete points in space. It has been reported that for specific regular lattices of points in dimensions 2 and 3, the usual approximation of the surface area of the excursions does not converge when the lattice becomes dense in the domain of observation to the desired limit. In the present work, under the key assumptions of stationarity and isotropy, we demonstrate that this limiting factor is invariant to the locations of the observation points. Indeed, we identify an explicit formula for the correction factor, showing that it only depends on the spatial dimension d. This enables us to define an approximation for the surface area of excursion sets for general tessellations of polytopes in Rd, including Poisson–Voronoi tessellations. We also establish a joint central limit theorem for the surface area and volume of excursion sets observed over hypercubic lattices.},

Invasion percolation is a paradigm model of self-organised criticality, where criticality is approach without tuning any parameter. By performing invasion percolation for n steps, and letting n→∞, we find an infinite subtree, called the invasion percolation cluster (IPC). A notable feature of the IPC is its geometry that consists of a unique path to infinity (also called the backbone) onto which finite forests are attached. The main theorem shows the volume scaling limit of the k-cut IPC, which is the cluster containing the root when the edge between the kth and (k+1)st backbone vertices is cut. We assume a power-law offspring distribution with exponent α and analyse the IPC for different power-law regimes. In a finite-variance setting (α&gt;2) the results, are a natural extension of previous works on the branching process tree (Electron. J. Probab. 24 (2019) 1–35) and the regular tree (Ann. Probab. 35 (2008) 420–466). However, for an infinite-variance setting (α∈(1,2)) or even an infinite-mean setting (α∈(0,1)), results significantly change. This is illustrated by the volume scaling of the k-cut IPC, which scales as k2 for α&gt;2, but as kα/(α−1) for α∈(1,2) and exponentially for α∈(0,1).},

The proof parallels the arguments developed in a continuum version of the model where a similar scaling was shown earlier by the first author and J. Lin. That work also conjectured that ϕβ is constant which we show to be false by proving that (logβ)Δϕβ tends, as β→∞, to a nonconstant limit that is independent of the specifics of the model.

We provide a detailed analysis of ergodicity, particle collisions, and boundary attainment, and use these results to study the associated financial markets. Their properties include (1) stability of the capital distribution curve and (2) explicit and not artificially leveraged growth optimal strategies. The sub-class of rank Jacobi models are additionally shown to (3) serve as the worst-case model for a robust asymptotic growth problem under model ambiguity and (4) exhibit stability in the large-d limit.

We rigorously establish the naïve mean-field approximation for the partition function of the corresponding Gibbs measures, and in case of “ferromagnetic” models with vanishing edge density show that typical samples resemble a typical Erdős–Rényi graph with a planted clique and/or a planted complete bipartite graph of appropriate sizes. We establish such behavior also for the conditional structure of the Erdős–Rényi graph in the large deviations regime for excess Fk-homomorphism counts. These structural results are obtained by combining quantitative large deviation principles, established in previous works, with a novel stability form of a result of (Adv.

In our setting, this establishes a rigorous proof of the physics literature mantra that positive correlations facilitate percolation when compared to the independent case. Our proof proceeds by constructing the Galton–Watson tree through an exploration via finite random walk trajectories. This exploration of the tree progressively unveils an infinite connected component in the random interlacements set on the tree, which is stable under small quenched noise. Using a Dynkin-type isomorphism theorem, we then infer the strict positivity of the critical parameter h∗. As a byproduct, we obtain transience results for the above-mentioned sets.},

This helps us to provide not only a simple proof for the Hölder regularity, but also a uniform upper bound for all moments of the Hölder coefficient as well as a maximal inequality for the local times. Moreover, based on this stochastic Volterra equation, we extend the method of duality to establish an exponential-affine representation of the Laplace functional in terms of the unique solution of a nonlinear Volterra integral equation associated with the Laplace exponent of the stable process.},

Here we establish a formal connection to another important bioinformatics problem, multiple sequence alignment, where one attempts to best align a collection of molecular sequences under some mismatch penalty score by inserting gaps. Our result is counter-intuitive: we show that perfect pairwise sequence alignment with high probability is possible in principle at arbitrary large evolutionary distances—provided the phylogeny is known and dense enough.

Under some mild high-frequency assumptions, the rescaled density process behaves asymptotically like a multi-type continuous-state branching process with immigration, which is the unique solution to a multi-dimensional stochastic differential equation with dynamical mechanism similar to that of multivariate Hawkes processes. To illustrate the strength of these limit results, we further establish diffusion approximations for multi-type Crump–Mode–Jagers branching processes counted with various characteristics by linking them to marked Hawkes shot noise processes. In particular, an interesting phenomenon in queueing theory, well known as state space collapse, is observed in the behavior of the population structure at a large time scale. This phenomenon reveals that the rescaled complex biological system can be recovered from its population process by a lifting map.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a substantive interest in rough volatility models. In this class of models, the local behavior of stochastic volatility is much more irregular than semimartingales and resembles that of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H&lt;0.5. In this paper, we derive a consistent and asymptotically mixed normal estimator of H based on high-frequency price observations. In contrast to previous works, we work in a semiparametric setting and do not assume any a priori relationship between volatility estimators and true volatility. Furthermore, our estimator attains a rate of convergence that is known to be optimal in a minimax sense in parametric rough volatility models.},

  abstract     = {The Wasserstein distance is a metric on a space of probability measures that has seen a surge of applications in statistics, machine learning, and applied mathematics. However, statistical aspects of Wasserstein distances are bottlenecked by the curse of dimensionality, whereby the number of data points needed to accurately estimate them grows exponentially with dimension. Gaussian smoothing was recently introduced as a means to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, giving rise to a parametric convergence rate in any dimension, while preserving the Wasserstein metric and topological structure. To facilitate valid statistical inference, in this work, we develop a comprehensive limit distribution theory for the empirical smooth Wasserstein distance. The limit distribution results leverage the functional delta method after embedding the domain of the Wasserstein distance into a certain dual Sobolev space, characterizing its Hadamard directional derivative for the dual Sobolev norm, and establishing weak convergence of the smooth empirical process in the dual space. To estimate the distributional limits, we also establish consistency of the nonparametric bootstrap. Finally, we use the limit distribution theory to study applications to generative modeling via minimum distance estimation with the smooth Wasserstein distance, showing asymptotic normality of optimal solutions for the quadratic cost.},

In particular, the solutions to this optimization problem generate solutions to both unstable and stable type of the Stefan problem, where the former stands for freezing of supercooled fluid (St1) and the latter for ice melting (St2). This unified approach to both types of the Stefan problem is new.

The main result is established by enriching the concepts of bistability and consistency of numerical schemes used previously for standard SDE. We introduce certain Spijker-type norms (and associated Banach spaces) to deal with the interaction of particles present in the stochastic systems being analysed.

We will use theoretical and numerical approaches to study how often this pivot movement is needed. We provide full distributional descriptions for the number of pivot movements needed using GEPP using particular Haar random ensembles as well as compare these models to other common transformations from randomized numerical linear algebra. Additionally, we introduce new random ensembles with fixed pivot movement counts and fixed sparsity, α. Experiments estimating the empirical spectral density (ESD) of these random ensembles leads to a new conjecture on a universality class of random matrices with fixed sparsity whose scaled ESD converges to a measure on the complex unit disk that depends on α and is an interpolation of the uniform measure on the unit disk and the Dirac measure at the origin.},

Moreover, we introduce semigroup-adjusted multipower variations (SAMPV) and establish their weak law of large numbers; using SAMPV, we construct a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance of the mixed-Gaussian limiting process appearing in the central limit theorem for the SARCV, resulting in a feasible asymptotic theory.

Starting with S={0}, the elements xk join S one by one, in order. When an entering element is larger than the current minimum element of S, this minimum leaves S. Let S(1,n) denote the content of S after the first n elements xk join. Simulations suggest that the size |S(1,n)| of S at time n is typically close to n/e. Here we first give a rigorous proof that this is indeed the case, and that in fact the symmetric difference of S(1,n) and the set {xk≥1−1/e:1≤k≤n} is of size at most O˜(n) with high probability. Our main result is a more accurate description of the process implying, in particular, that as n tends to infinity n−1/2(|S(1,n)|−n/e) converges to a normal random variable with variance 3e−2−e−1. We further show that the dynamics of the symmetric difference of S(1,n) and the set {xk≥1−1/e:1≤k≤n} converges with proper scaling to a three-dimensional Bessel process.},

Furthermore, the large deviation principle is also derived for the McKean–Vlasov stochastic equations under those weak assumptions. The wide applications of main results are illustrated by various concrete examples such as the granular media equations, plasma-type models, kinetic equations, McKean–Vlasov-type porous media equations and Navier–Stokes equations.

  abstract     = {We consider a class of stochastic control problems where the state process is a probability measure-valued process satisfying an additional martingale condition on its dynamics, called measure-valued martingales (MVMs). We establish the “classical” results of stochastic control for these problems: specifically, we prove that the value function for the problem can be characterised as the unique solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation in the sense of viscosity solutions. In order to prove this result, we exploit structural properties of the MVM processes. Our results also include an appropriate version of Itô’s formula for controlled MVMs. We also show how problems of this type arise in a number of applications, including model-independent derivatives pricing, the optimal Skorokhod embedding problem, and two player games with asymmetric information.},

  abstract     = {In a zero-sum stochastic game with signals (Repeated Games (2015) Cambridge Univ. Press, Chapter IV), at each stage, two adversary players make decisions and receive stage payoffs determined by these decisions and a variable called the state. The state follows a Markov chain controlled by both players. Actions and states are imperfectly observed by players, who receive private signals at each stage. Mertens (In Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. 1, 2 (Berkeley, Calif., 1986) (1987) 1528–1577 Amer. Math. Soc.) conjectured two properties regarding games with long durations: first, that a limit value always exists; second, that when Player 1 is more informed than Player 2, she can guarantee the limit value uniformly. These conjectures were recently disproved by the author (Ann. Probab. 44 (2016) 1107–1133) but remain widely open in many subclasses. A well-known particular subclass is absorbing games with incomplete information on both sides, in which the state can move at most once during the game, and players receive a private signal about it at the outset of the game. This paper proves Mertens’ conjectures in this particular model by introducing a new approximation technique of belief dynamics likely to generalize to many other frameworks. In particular, this represents a significant step towards understanding the following broad question: in which games do Mertens’ conjectures hold?},

We study the limiting spectral distributions of two empirical kernel matrices associated with f(X): the empirical conjugate kernel (CK) and neural tangent kernel (NTK), beyond the linear-width regime (d1≍n). We focus on the ultra-wide regime, where the width d1 of the first layer is much larger than the sample size n. Under appropriate assumptions on X and σ, a deformed semicircle law emerges as d1/n→∞ and n→∞. We first prove this limiting law for generalized sample covariance matrices with some dependency. To specify it for our neural network model, we provide a nonlinear Hanson–Wright inequality suitable for neural networks with random weights and Lipschitz activation functions. We also demonstrate nonasymptotic concentrations of the empirical CK and NTK around their limiting kernels in the spectral norm, along with lower bounds on their smallest eigenvalues. As an application, we show that random feature regression induced by the empirical kernel achieves the same asymptotic performance as its limiting kernel regression under the ultra-wide regime. This allows us to calculate the asymptotic training and test errors for random feature regression using the corresponding kernel regression.},

For the one-point function, averaged between horizontal and vertical edges of the square lattice, this result has been known since the 1969 work of Ferdinand and Fischer. We propose an alternative proof, in a slightly greater generality, via a new exact formula in terms of determinants of discrete Laplacians. We also compute the main term of the asymptotics of the difference E(ϵV−ϵH) of the energy density on a vertical and a horizontal edge, which is of order of δ2, where δ is the mesh size. The observable ϵV−ϵH has been identified by Kadanoff and Ceva as (a component of) the stress-energy tensor. We then apply the discrete complex analysis methods of Smirnov and Hongler to compute the multipoint correlations. The fermionic observables are only periodic with doubled periods; by antisymmetrization, this leads to contributions from four “sectors.” The main new challenge arises in the doubly periodic sector, due to the existence of nonzero constant (discrete) analytic functions. We show that some additional input, namely the scaling limit of the one-point function and of relative contribution of sectors to the partition function, is sufficient to overcome this difficulty and successfully compute all correlations.},

We provide a simple condition on α and the distribution of X(0−) such that the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation has no blow-up, and thus the McKean–Vlasov dynamics is well defined for all time t≥0. Our approach relies on a connection between the McKean–Vlasov equation and the supercooled Stefan problem, as well as several comparison principles. The second equation is X(t)=X(0−)+βt+B(t)+αlnP(τ&gt;t), t≥0, whose Fokker–Planck equation is nonlocal. We prove that for β&gt;0 sufficiently large and α no greater than a sufficiently small positive constant, there is no blow-up and the McKean–Vlasov dynamics is well defined for all time t≥0. The argument is based on a new transform, which removes the nonlocal term, followed by a relative entropy analysis.},

Although the FZRP is attractive, a property that we extensively use to derive its hydrodynamic limits in both cases, the FEP is not. To derive the hydrodynamic limit for the latter, we exploit that of the zero-range process, together with a classical mapping between exclusion and zero-range processes, both at the microscopic and macroscopic level. Due to the degeneracy of both processes, the asymmetric case is a new result, but our work also provides a simpler proof than the one that was previously proposed for the FEP in the symmetric case in (Probab.

The results are valid for a large class of cost functions and generalize distributional limits for empirical entropic optimal transport quantities on finite spaces. Our proofs are based on a sensitivity analysis with respect to norms induced by suitable function classes, which arise from novel quantitative bounds for primal and dual optimizers, that are related to the exponential penalty term in the dual formulation. The distributional limits then follow from the functional delta method together with weak convergence of the empirical process in that respective norm, for which we provide sharp conditions on the underlying measures. As a byproduct of our proof technique, consistency of the bootstrap for statistical applications is shown.},

  abstract     = {Given a spectrally negative Lévy process X drifting to infinity, (inspired on the early ideas of Shiryaev (2002)) we are interested in finding a stopping time that minimises the Lp distance (p&gt;1) with g, the last time X is negative. The solution is substantially more difficult compared to the case p=1, for which it was shown by Baurdoux and Pedraza (2020) that it is optimal to stop as soon as X exceeds a constant barrier. In the case of p&gt;1 treated here, we prove that solving this optimal prediction problem is equivalent to solving an optimal stopping problem in terms of a two-dimensional strong Markov process that incorporates the length of the current positive excursion away from 0. We show that an optimal stopping time is now given by the first time that X exceeds a nonincreasing and nonnegative curve depending on the length of the current positive excursion away from 0. We further characterise the optimal boundary and the value function as the unique solution of a nonlinear system of integral equations within a subclass of functions. As examples, the case of a Brownian motion with drift and a Brownian motion with drift perturbed by a Poisson process with exponential jumps are considered.},

The structure connects Gibbs samplers targeting higher-dimensional distributions to those targeting lower-dimensional ones. This leads to a quasi-telescoping property of their spectral gaps. Based on this property, we derive three new bounds on the spectral gaps and convergence rates of Gibbs samplers on general domains. The three bounds relate a chain’s spectral gap to, respectively, the correlation structure of the target distribution, a class of random walk chains, and a collection of influence matrices. Notably, one of our results generalizes the technique of spectral independence, which has received considerable attention for its success on finite domains, to general state spaces. We illustrate our methods through a sampler targeting the uniform distribution on a corner of an n-cube.},

This leads to a SDE whose unique strong solution will be the definition of a Λ-asymmetric frequency process (Λ-AFP). We prove that it is a Feller process and we calculate a large population limit when the total mass tends to infinity. This allows us to study the fluctuations of the process around its deterministic limit. Furthermore, we find conditions for the Λ-AFP to have a moment dual. The dual can be interpreted in terms of selection, (coordinated) mutation, pairwise branching (efficiency), coalescence, and a novel component that comes from the asymmetry between the reproduction mechanisms. In the particular case of a pair of equally distributed continuous-state branching processes the associated Λ-AFP will be the dual of a Λ-coalescent. The map that sends each continuous-state branching process to its associated Λ-coalescent (according to the former procedure) is a homeomorphism between metric spaces.},

This paper studies properties of the Smoluchowski processes and considers related statistical problems. In the first part of the paper we revisit probabilistic properties of the Smoluchowski process in a unified and principled way: explicit formulas for generating functionals and moments are derived, conditions for stationarity and Gaussian approximation are discussed, and relations to other stochastic models are highlighted. The second part deals with statistics of the Smoluchowski processes. We consider two different models of the particle displacement process: the undeviated uniform motion (when a particle moves with random constant velocity along a straight line) and the Brownian motion displacement. In the setting of the undeviated uniform motion we study the problems of estimating the mean speed and the speed distribution, while for the Brownian displacement model the problem of estimating the diffusion coefficient is considered. In all these settings we develop estimators with provable accuracy guarantees.},

Our bounds are particularly useful when the target distribution is multimodal and global mixing of the Markov kernel is slow; in such cases our approach establishes the benefits of SMC over the corresponding Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimator. The lack of global mixing is addressed by sequentially controlling the bias introduced by SMC resampling procedures. We apply these results to obtain complexity bounds for approximating expectations under mixtures of log-concave distributions and show that SMC provides a fully polynomial time randomized approximation scheme for some difficult multimodal problems where the corresponding Markov chain sampler is exponentially slow. Finally, we compare the bounds obtained by our approach to existing bounds for tempered Markov chains on the same problems.},

High peaks of solutions have been extensively studied under the name of intermittency, but less is known about spatial regions between peaks, which we may loosely refer to as valleys. We present two results about the valleys of the solution. Our first theorem provides information about the size of valleys and the supremum of the solution u(t,x) over a valley. More precisely, when the initial function u0(x)=1 for all x∈R, we show that the supremum of the solution over a valley vanishes as t→∞, and we establish an upper bound of exp{−const·t1/3} for u(t,x) when x lies in a valley. We demonstrate also that the length of a valley grows at least as exp{+const·t1/3} as t→∞. Our second theorem asserts that the length of the valleys are eventually infinite when the initial function u(0,x) has subgaussian tails.},

It is well known that an empirical measure comprising independent samples from an absolutely continuous distribution on Rd converges to that distribution at the rate n−1/d in Wasserstein distance, which can be used to prove that plug-in estimators of many optimal transport costs converge at this same rate. However, we show that when the cost is smooth, this analysis is loose: plug-in estimators based on empirical measures converge quadratically faster, at the rate n−2/d. As a corollary, we show that the Wasserstein distance between two distributions is significantly easier to estimate when the measures are well-separated. We also prove lower bounds, showing not only that our analysis of the plug-in estimator is tight, but also that no other estimator can enjoy significantly faster rates of convergence uniformly over all pairs of measures. Our proofs rely on empirical process theory arguments based on tight control of L2 covering numbers for locally Lipschitz and semiconcave functions. As a byproduct of our proofs, we derive L∞ estimates on the displacement induced by the optimal coupling between any two measures satisfying suitable concentration and anticoncentration conditions, for a wide range of cost functions.},

Existence and uniqueness results for both the EnKBF and its mean field limit are provided. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to its limiting McKean-Vlasov equation does not seem to be covered by the existing literature. In the correlated noise case the evolution of the ensemble depends also on the pseudoinverse of its empirical covariance matrix, which has to be controlled for global well-posedness. These bounds may also be of independent interest. Finally the convergence to the mean field limit is proven. The results can also be extended to other versions of EnKBFs.},

In this paper we explore the extended HTC, where the LP is merely assumed to be critical. Because multiple solutions are allowed, multiple sets of operational activities, referred to as modes, are available. Formally, the scaling limit for the control problem associated with the model is given by a so-called workload control problem (WCP) in which a cost associated with a diffusion process is to be minimized by dynamically switching between these modes. Our main result is that the WCP’s value constitutes an asymptotic lower bound on the cost associated with the PSS model.},

A popular regularization of the problem is the one-parameter family called the entropic cost problem. The entropic cost Kh, h&gt;0, is significantly faster to compute and hKh is known to converge to the optimal transport cost as h goes to zero. We are interested in the rate of convergence. We show that the difference between Kh and 1/h times the optimal cost of transport has a pointwise limit when transporting a compactly supported density to another that satisfies a few other technical restrictions. This limit is the relative entropy of ρ1 with respect to a weighted Riemannian volume measure on Rd that measures the local sensitivity of the transport map. For the quadratic Wasserstein transport, this relative entropy is exactly one half of the difference of entropies of ρ1 and ρ0. More surprisingly, we demonstrate that this difference of two entropies (plus the cost) is also the limit for the Dirichlet transport introduced by Pal and Wong (Probab. Theory Related Fields 178 (2020) 613–654) in the context of stochastic portfolio theory. The latter can be thought of as a multiplicative analog of the Wasserstein transport and corresponds to a nonlocal operator. The proofs are based on Gaussian approximations to Schrödinger bridges as h approaches zero.},

We show that the property that a solution to the SEP is of barrier type can be characterized in terms of the shadow. This characterization allows us to construct new families of barrier solutions that naturally interpolate between two given barrier solutions.

  abstract     = {We analyze an optimal stopping problem with a series of inequality-type and equality-type expectation constraints in a general non-Markovian framework. We show that the optimal stopping problem with expectation constraints (OSEC) in an arbitrary probability setting is equivalent to the constrained problem in weak formulation (an optimization over joint laws of stopping rules with Brownian motion and state dynamics on an enlarged canonical space), and thus the OSEC value is independent of a specific probabilistic setup. Using a martingale-problem formulation, we make an equivalent characterization of the probability classes in weak formulation, which implies that the OSEC value function is upper semianalytic. Then we exploit a measurable selection argument to establish a dynamic programming principle in weak formulation for the OSEC value function, in which the conditional expected costs act as additional states for constraint levels at the intermediate horizon.},

  abstract     = {We consider a family of resource sharing networks, known as bandwidth sharing models, in heavy traffic with general service and interarrival times. These networks, introduced in Massoulié and Roberts (Telecommun. Syst. 15 (2000) 185–201) as models for internet flows, have the feature that a typical job may require simultaneous processing by multiple resources in the network. We construct simple form threshold policies that asymptotically achieve the Hierarchical Greedy Ideal (HGI) performance. This performance benchmark, which was introduced in Harrison et al. (Stoch. Syst. 4 (2014) 524–555), is characterized by the following two features: every resource works at full capacity whenever there is work for that resource in the system; total holding cost of jobs of each type at any instant is the minimum cost possible for the associated vector of workloads. The control policy we provide is explicit in terms of a finite collection of vectors, which can be computed offline by solving a system of linear inequalities. Proof of convergence is based on path large deviation estimates for renewal processes, Lyapunov function constructions and analyses of suitable sample path excursions.},

The overseer may reject the allocation of each ball, in which case it is placed into a new bin, drawn independently, uniformly at random. The purpose of the overseer is to reduce the maximum load, that is, the difference between the maximum number of balls in a single bin and the average number of balls among all bins. We provide tight estimates for three quantities: the lowest achievable maximum load at a given time m, the lowest achievable maximum load uniformly over the entire time interval [m]:={1,2,…,m} and the lowest achievable typical maximum load over the interval [m], that is, a load which upper-bounds 1−o(1) portion of the times in [m]. In particular, for m polynomial in n and sufficiently large, we provide an explicit strategy, which achieves a typical maximum load of (logn)1/2+o(1), asymptotically the same as that can be achieved at a single time m. In contrast, we show that no strategy can achieve better than Θ(logn loglogn) maximum load for all times up to time m.},

In this paper, we develop computational tools for solving AOT problems numerically. First, we show that AOT problems are stable with respect to perturbations in the marginals, and thus arbitrary AOT problems can be approximated by sequences of linear programs. We further study entropic methods to solve AOT problems. We show that any entropically regularized AOT problem converges to the corresponding unregularized problem if the regularization parameter goes to zero. The proof is based on a novel method—even in the nonadapted case—to easily obtain smooth approximations of a given coupling with fixed marginals. Finally, we show tractability of the adapted version of Sinkhorn’s algorithm. We give explicit solutions for the occurring projections and prove that the procedure converges to the optimizer of the entropic AOT problem.},

We show that, when the two end-points are at small macroscopic distance, then the first-order correction to the covariance for the point-to-point model is the same as the one of the stationary model. In order to obtain the result, we first derive comparison inequalities of the last passage increments for different models. This is used to prove tightness of the point-to-point process as well as localization of the geodesics. Unlike for the full-space case, for half-space we have to overcome the difficulty that the point-to-point model in half-space with generic start and end-points is not known.},

Res. 20 (2019) 1–45) and (SIAM J. Math. Data Sci. 3 (2021) 873–899), respectively, introduced the truncated and the untruncated signature kernel of γ and σ, and showed how these concepts can be used in classification and prediction tasks involving multivariate time series. In this paper, we introduce signature kernels Kϕγ,σ indexed by a weight function ϕ, which generalise the ordinary signature kernel. We show how Kϕγ,σ can be interpreted in many examples as an average of PDE solutions, and thus we show how it can be estimated computationally using suitable quadrature formulae. We extend this analysis to derive closed-form formulae for expressions involving the expected (Stratonovich) signature of Brownian motion. In doing so, we articulate a novel connection between signature kernels and the notion of the hyperbolic development of a path, which has been a broadly useful tool in the recent analysis of the signature; see, for example, (Ann. of Math. (2) 171 (2010) 109–167; J. Funct. Anal. 272 (2017) 2933–2955) and (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 372 (2019) 585–614).

We instead consider metastable mixing, a notion of approximate mixing relative to the stationary distribution, for which it turns out to suffice to mix only within a collection of metastable states. We show that the Glauber dynamics for the ERGM at any temperature—except at a lower-dimensional critical set of parameters—when initialized at G(n,p) for the right choice of p has a metastable mixing time of O(n2logn) to within total variation distance exp(−Ω(n)).},

In contrast to the classical square-root diffusion process, here the limiting distributions may depend on the initial state of the process. Our result shows that the nonuniqueness of limiting distributions is closely related to the integrability of the Volterra convolution kernel. Using an extension of the exponential-affine transformation formula, we also give the construction of stationary processes associated with the limiting distributions.

The length ℓr(n) of order r in the n-Beta(2−α,α)-coalescent tree is defined as the sum of the lengths of all branches that carry a subtree with r leaves. We show that for any s∈N the vector of suitably centered and rescaled lengths of orders 1≤r≤s converges in distribution to a multivariate stable distribution as the number of leaves tends to infinity.},

Furthermore, we strengthen the known empirical procedure by making it fully-adaptive to the data, thinning the confidence intervals and reducing the computational complexity. Along the way, we derive new properties of the pseudo-spectral gap and introduce the notion of a reversible dilation of a stochastic matrix.},

  abstract     = {Relying on random matrix theory (RMT), this paper studies asymmetric order-d spiked tensor models with Gaussian noise. Using the variational definition of the singular vectors and values of Lim (In Proc. IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-Sensor Adaptive Processing (2005) 129–132), we show that the analysis of the considered model boils down to the analysis of an equivalent spiked symmetric blockwise random matrix, that is constructed from contractions of the studied tensor with the singular vectors associated to its best rank-1 approximation. Our approach allows the exact characterization of the almost sure asymptotic singular value and alignments of the corresponding singular vectors with the true spike components when ni ∑ j=1dnj→ci∈(0,1) with ni’s the tensor dimensions. In contrast to other works that rely mostly on tools from statistical physics to study random tensors, our results rely solely on classical RMT tools such as Stein’s lemma. Finally, classical RMT results concerning spiked random matrices are recovered as a particular case.},

In this paper we show that both Xε and a family of diffusions Ξε can be redefined on a common sufficiently rich probability space so that Esup0≤t≤T|Xε(t)−Ξε(t)|2M≤C(M)εδ for some C(M),δ&gt;0 and all M≥1, ε&gt;0, where all Ξε,ε&gt;0 have the same diffusion coefficients but underlying Brownian motions may change with ε. We obtain also a similar result for the corresponding discrete time averaging setup. As an application we consider Dynkin’s games with path dependent payoffs involving a diffusion and obtain error estimates for computation of values of such games by means of such discrete time approximations which provides a more effective computational tool than the standard discretization of the diffusion itself.},

  abstract     = {The Euclidean directed spanning forest is a random forest in Rd introduced by Baccelli and Bordenave in 2007 and we introduce and study here the analogous tree in the hyperbolic space. The topological properties of the Euclidean DSF have been stated for d=2 and conjectured for d≥3 (see further): it should be a tree for d∈{2,3} and a countable union of disjoint trees for d≥4. Moreover, it should not contain bi-infinite branches whatever the dimension d. In this paper, we construct the hyperbolic directed spanning forest (HDSF) and we give a complete description of its topological properties, which are radically different from the Euclidean case. Indeed, for any dimension, the hyperbolic DSF is a tree containing infinitely many bi-infinite branches, whose asymptotic directions are investigated. The strategy of our proofs consists in exploiting the mass transport principle, which is adapted to take advantage of the invariance by isometries. Using appropriate mass transports is the key to carry over the hyperbolic setting ideas developed in percolation and for spanning forests. This strategy provides an upper-bound for horizontal fluctuations of trajectories, which is the key point of the proofs. To obtain the latter, we exploit the representation of the forest in the hyperbolic half space.},

Examples include Ising models on lattices, and mean-field type Ising models (Erdős–Rényi, Random regular, and dense graphs). Our results rely on correlation decay and mixing type behavior for Ising models, and demonstrate the beneficial behavior of criticality in detection of strictly lower signals. As a by-product of our proof technique, we develop sharp control on mixing and spin-spin correlation for several mean-field type Ising models in all regimes of temperature–which might be of independent interest.},
