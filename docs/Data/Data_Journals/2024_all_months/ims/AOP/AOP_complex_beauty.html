Surv. 9 (2012) 103–252) and answering several other questions from the literature. Moreover, we define a partial ordering on degree sequences and show that it induces a stochastic ordering on the heights of uniformly random trees with given degree sequences. The latter result can also be used to show that sub-binary random trees are stochastically the tallest trees with a given number of vertices and leaves (and thus that random binary trees are the stochastically tallest random homeomorphically irreducible trees (Acta Math. 101 (1959) 141–162) with a given number of vertices). Our proofs are based in part on the Foata–Fuchs bijection between trees and sequences (J. Combin.

More precisely, particles branch at rate ρ/2 in the interval [0,1], for some ρ&gt;1, and at rate 1/2 in (1,+∞). The drift μ(ρ) is chosen in such a way that, heuristically, the system is critical in some sense: the number of particles stays roughly constant before it eventually dies out. This particle system can be seen as an analytically tractable model for fluctuating fronts, describing the internal mechanisms driving the invasion of a habitat by a cooperating population. Recent studies from Birzu, Hallatschek and Korolev suggest the existence of three classes of fluctuating fronts: pulled, semipushed and fully pushed fronts. Here we rigorously verify and make precise this classification and focus on the semipushed regime. This complements previous results from Berestycki, Berestycki and Schweinsberg for the case ρ=1.},

We show that these processes, as N→∞, have a right continuous left limit scaling limit G=(Gμ)μ∈R, parametrized by μ and taking values in C(R).

We believe G is the universal scaling limit of Busemann processes in the KPZ universality class. Our proof provides insight into this limiting behavior by highlighting a connection between the joint distribution of Busemann functions obtained by Fan and Seppäläinen (in Probab. Math.

  abstract     = {Activated Random Walks, on Zd for any d≥1, is an interacting particle system, where particles can be in either of two states: active or frozen. Each active particle performs a continuous-time simple random walk during an exponential time of parameter λ, after which it stays still in the frozen state, until another active particle shares its location, and turns it instantaneously back into activity. This model is known to have a phase transition, and we show that the critical density, controlling the phase transition, is less than one in any dimension and for any value of the sleep rate λ. We provide upper bounds for the critical density in both the small λ and large λ regimes.},

Here, α&gt;0 is the Malthusian parameter, a is a constant and W is the limit of Nerman’s martingale, which is positive on the survival event. In this general situation, under additional (second moment) assumptions, we prove a central limit theorem for (Ztφ)t≥0. More precisely, we show that there exist a constant k∈ℕ 0 and a function H(t), a finite random linear combination of functions of the form tjeλt with α/2≤Re(λ)&lt;α, such that (Ztφ−aeαtW−H(t))/ tkeαt converges in distribution to a normal random variable with random variance. This result unifies and extends various central limit theorem-type results for specific branching processes.},

This generalizes a theorem of van den Berg and Kesten from 1993, which treats the standard Cayley graphs of Zd,d≥2. In fact, our theorem applies to any bounded-degree graph which either is of strict polynomial growth or is quasi-isometric to a tree and which satisfies a certain geometric condition we call “admitting detours.” If a bounded degree graph does not admit detours, such a strict monotonicity theorem with respect to variability cannot hold. Moreover, we show that for the same class of graphs, independent of whether the graph admits detours, any appropriately subcritical weight measure is “absolutely continuous with respect to the expected empirical measure of the geodesic.” This implies a strict monotonicity theorem with respect to stochastic domination.},

  abstract     = {First passage percolation (FPP) on Zd or Rd is a canonical model of a random metric space where the standard Euclidean geometry is distorted by random noise. Of central interest is the length and the geometry of the geodesic, the shortest path between points. Since the latter, owing to its length minimization, traverses through atypically low values of the underlying noise variables, it is an important problem to quantify the disparity between the environment rooted at a point on the geodesic and the typical one. We investigate this in the context of γ-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) (where γ∈(0,2) is a parameter)—a random Riemannian surface induced on the complex plane by the random metric tensor e2γh/dγ(dx2+dy2), where h is the whole plane, properly centered, Gaussian Free Field (GFF), and dγ is the associated dimension. We consider the unique infinite geodesic Γ from the origin, parametrized by the logarithm of its chemical length, and show that, for an almost sure realization of h, the distributions of the appropriately scaled field and the induced metric on a ball, rooted at a point “uniformly” sampled on Γ, converge to deterministic measures on the space of generalized functions and continuous metrics on the unit disk, respectively. Moreover, toward a better understanding of the limiting objects living on the unit disk, we show that they are singular with respect to their typical counterparts but become absolutely continuous away from the origin. Our arguments rely on unearthing a regeneration structure with fast decay of correlation in the geodesic owing to coalescence and the domain Markov property of the GFF. While there have been significant recent advances around this question for stochastic planar growth models in the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class, the present work initiates this research program in the context of LQG.},

Our proof starts from a single renormalisation group step after which the integer-valued field becomes a smooth field, which we then analyse using the renormalisation group method. This paper also provides the foundation for the construction of the scaling limit of the infinite-volume gradient Gibbs state of the Discrete Gaussian model in the companion paper. Moreover, we develop all estimates for general finite-range interaction with sharp dependence on the range.

This distribution, which has a natural definition in terms of Young tableaux, is a deformation of the classical Plancherel measure, which appears naturally in the context of Hurwitz numbers, enumerating certain transposition factorisations in symmetric groups. We study a regime in which the number of factors in the underlying factorisations grows linearly with the order of the group, and the corresponding topological objects, Hurwitz maps, are of high genus. We prove that the limiting behaviour exhibits a new, twofold, phenomenon: the first part becomes very large, while the rest of the partition has the standard Vershik–Kerov–Logan–Shepp limit shape. As a consequence, we obtain asymptotic estimates for unconnected Hurwitz numbers with linear Euler characteristic, which we use to study random Hurwitz maps in this regime. This result can also be interpreted as the return probability of the transposition random walk on the symmetric group after linearly many steps.},

Efficient comparison of the MLSI Dirichlet forms is a well-known obstacle in the theory of Markov chains. We approach this problem by introducing a regularized MLSI constant, which, under some assumptions, has the same order of magnitude as the usual MLSI constant yet is amenable for comparison and thus considerably simpler to estimate in certain cases. As an application of this general comparison procedure, we provide a sharp estimate of the MLSI constant of the switch chain on the set of simple bipartite regular graphs of size n with a fixed degree d. Our estimate implies that the total variation mixing time of the switch chain is of order Od(nlogn). The result is optimal up to a multiple depending on d and resolves a long-standing open problem. We expect that the MLSI comparison technique implemented in this paper will find further applications.},

  abstract     = {We establish, in full generality, an unexpected phenomenon of strong regularization along normal convergence on Wiener chaoses. Namely, for every sequence of chaotic random variables, convergence in law to the Gaussian distribution is automatically upgraded to superconvergence: the regularity of the densities increases along the convergence, and all the derivatives converge uniformly on the real line. Our findings strikingly strengthen known results regarding modes of convergence for normal approximation on Wiener chaoses. Without additional assumptions, quantitative convergence in total variation is established by Nourdin and Peccati (Probab. Theory Related Fields 145 (2009) 75–118), and later on amplified to convergence in relative entropy by Nourdin, Peccati and Swan (J. Funct. Anal. 266 (2014) 3170–3207). Our result is then extended to the multivariate setting and for polynomial mappings of a Gaussian field, provided the projection on the Wiener chaos of maximal degree admits a nondegenerate Gaussian limit. While our findings potentially apply to any context involving polynomial functionals of a Gaussian field, we emphasize, in this work, applications regarding: improved Carbery–Wright estimates near Gaussianity, normal convergence in entropy and in Fisher information, superconvergence for the spectral moments of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles, moments bounds for the inverse of strongly correlated Wishart-type matrices, and superconvergence in the Breuer–Major Theorem. Our proofs leverage Malliavin’s historical idea to establish smoothness of the density via the existence of negative moments of the Malliavin gradient, and we further develop a new paradigm to study this problem. Namely, we relate the existence of negative moments to some explicit spectral quantities associated with the Malliavin Hessian. This link relies on an adequate choice of the Malliavin gradient, which provides a novel decoupling procedure of independent interest. Previous attempts to establish convergence beyond entropy have imposed restrictive assumptions ensuring finiteness of negative moments for the Malliavin derivatives Our analysis renders these assumptions superfluous. The terminology superconvergence was introduced by Bercovici and Voiculescu (Probab. Theory Related Fields 103 (1995) 215–222) for the central limit theorem in free probability.},

  abstract     = {We consider a branching Brownian motion in Rd with d≥1 in which the position Xt(u)∈Rd of a particle u at time t can be encoded by its direction θt(u)∈Sd−1 and its distance Rt(u) to 0. We prove that the extremal point process ∑δ (θt(u),Rt(u)−mt(d)) (where the sum is over all particles alive at time t and mt(d) is an explicit centering term) converges in distribution to a randomly shifted, decorated Poisson point process on Sd−1×R. More precisely, the so-called clan-leaders form a Cox process with intensity proportional to D∞(θ)e− 2rdrdθ, where D∞(θ) is the limit of the derivative martingale in direction θ and the decorations are i.i.d. copies of the decoration process of the standard one-dimensional branching Brownian motion. This proves a conjecture of Stasiński, Berestycki and Mallein (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab. Stat. 57 (2021) 1786–1810). The proof builds on that paper and on Kim, Lubetzky and Zeitouni (Ann.

As a consequence, we provide a new, and arguably simpler, proof of some of the results of Celentano, Fan and Mei (Ann. Statist. 51 (2023) 519–546), which establishes that the so-called TAP free energy in the Z2-synchronization problem is locally convex in the region to which AMP converges.

The mean of this quantity is known to scale like the volume of the domain under general assumptions on the field. We prove that, assuming sufficient decay of correlations (e.g., the Bargmann–Fock field), a central limit theorem holds with volume-order scaling. Previously, such a result had only been established for “additive” geometric functionals of the excursion/level sets (e.g., the volume or Euler characteristic) using Hermite expansions. Our approach, based on a martingale analysis, is more robust and can be generalised to a wider class of topological functionals. A major ingredient in the proof is a third moment bound on critical points, which is of independent interest.},

In particular, we do not assume positive correlations. This result is new for all strongly correlated models (i.e., α∈(0,d]) in dimension d≥3 except the Gaussian free field, for which sharpness was proven in a recent breakthrough by Duminil-Copin et al.

For planar fields which are continuous and positively correlated, we establish sharper bounds on the percolation density by exploiting a new ‘weak mixing’ property for strongly correlated Gaussian fields. As a byproduct, we establish the box-crossing property for the nodal set, of independent interest.

Let φ:R→R be such that E[φ(N)2]0 with D⊂Rd compact. Since the pioneering works from the 1980s by Breuer, Dobrushin, Major, Rosenblatt, Taqqu and others, central and noncentral limit theorems for Yt have been constantly refined, extended and applied to an increasing number of diverse situations, to such an extent that it has become a field of research in its own right. The common belief, representing the intuition that specialists in the subject have developed over the last four decades, is that as t→∞ the fluctuations of Yt around its mean are, in general (i.e., except possibly in very special cases), Gaussian when B has short memory, and non-Gaussian when B has long memory and R≥2. We show in this paper that this intuition forged over the last 40 years can be wrong, and not only marginally or in critical cases. We will indeed bring to light a variety of situations where Yt admits Gaussian fluctuations in a long memory context. To achieve this goal, we state and prove a spectral central limit theorem, which extends the conclusion of the celebrated Breuer–Major theorem to situations where C∉LR(Rd).

In this paper, we prove that (for N cards) the cutoff window is in the order of N1/3, and the cutoff profile is given by the Tracy–Widom GOE distribution function.

Our result can also be viewed as a generalization of the Oriented Swap Process finishing time convergence (Ann. Appl. Probab. 32 (2022) 753–763), which is the TASEP version (of our result).},

We also demonstrate how the required products can be defined in the case that singular term is a Gaussian random field by probabilistic calculation. Interestingly, although the terms in the zeroth Wiener chaos of regularization approximation are not zero, they converge in suitable weighted Besov spaces, and no renormalization is required. As applications the global well-posedness for a nonlinear kinetic equation with singular coefficients is obtained by the entropy method. Moreover, we also solve the martingale problem for nonlinear kinetic distribution dependent stochastic differential equations with singular drifts.},

The well-posedness of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is obtained in our companion paper.

Conditional on the population surviving until a large time T, sample k individuals uniformly at random (without replacement) from amongst those alive at time T. What is the genealogy of this sample of individuals? In cases where the offspring distribution has finite variance, the probabilistic properties of the joint ancestry of these k particles are well understood, as seen in (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30 (2020) 1368–1414; Electron. J. Probab. 24 (2019) 1–35). In the present article, we study the joint ancestry of a sample of k particles under the following regime: the offspring distribution has mean 1 (critical) and the tails of the offspring distribution are heavy in that α∈(1,2] is the supremum over indices β such that the βth moment is finite. We show that for each α, after rescaling time by 1/T, there is a universal stochastic process describing the joint coalescent structure of the k distinct particles. The special case α=2 generalises the known case of sampling from critical GW trees with finite variance where only pairwise mergers are observed and the genealogical tree is, roughly speaking, some kind of mixture of time-changed Kingman coalescents. The cases α∈(1,2) introduce new universal limiting partition-valued stochastic processes with interesting probabilistic structures, which, in particular, have representations connected to the Lauricella function and the Dirichlet distribution and whose coalescent structures exhibit multiple-mergers of family lines. Moreover, in the case α∈(1,2), we show that the coalescent events of the ancestry of the k particles are associated with birth events that produce giant numbers of offspring of the same order of magnitude as the entire population size, and we compute the joint law of the ancestry together with the sizes of these giant births.},

We thus obtain that, for a general class of positively correlated smooth Gaussian fields f:R3→R with rapid decay of correlations (including the Bargmann–Fock field), large planar clusters in {f≥0}∩(R2×{0}) typically belong to clusters in {f≥0} which are not confined in thin slabs.},

  abstract     = {We prove that diffusion equations with a space-time stationary and ergodic, divergence-free drift homogenize in law to a deterministic stochastic partial differential equation with Stratonovich transport noise. In the absence of spatial ergodicity, the drift is only partially absorbed into the skew-symmetric part of the flux through the use of an appropriately defined stream matrix. This leaves a time-dependent, spatially-homogenous transport which, for mildly decorrelating fields, converges to a Brownian noise with deterministic covariance in the homogenization limit. The results apply to uniformly elliptic, stationary and ergodic environments in which the drift admits a suitably defined stationary and L2-integrable stream matrix.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and study an interacting particle system evolving on the d-dimensional torus (Z/NZ)d. Each vertex of the torus can be either empty or occupied by an individual of type λ∈(0,∞). An individual of type λ dies with rate one and gives birth at each neighboring empty position with rate λ; moreover, when the birth takes place, the newborn individual is likely to have the same type as the parent but has a small probability of being a mutant. A mutant child of an individual of type λ has type chosen according to a probability kernel. We consider the asymptotic behavior of this process when N→∞ and, simultaneously, the mutation probability tends to zero fast enough that mutations are sufficiently separated in time so that the amount of time spent on configurations with more than one type becomes negligible. We show that, after a suitable time scaling and deletion of the periods of time spent on configurations with more than one type, the process converges to a Markov jump process on (0,∞), whose rates we characterize.},

Although the process (ℓx)x≥0 is not Markov, we prove that the pair (ℓx,ℓ˙x)x≥0 is a time-homogeneous Markov process.

  abstract     = {In order to give a dual, annealed description of the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation (SHE) from regularizing the noise, we consider the Schrödinger semigroup of the many-body delta-Bose gas from mollifying the delta potentials. The main theorem proves the convergences of the corresponding approximate semigroups when they act on bounded functions. For the proof we introduce a mean-field Poisson system to expand the Feynman–Kac formula of the approximate semigroups. This expansion yields infinite series, showing certain Markovian decompositions of the summands into nonconcurrent, nonconsecutive two-body interactions. Components in these decompositions are then grouped nonlinearly in time to establish the dominated convergence of the infinite series. With regards to the two-dimensional SHE, the main theorem also characterizes the Nth moments for all N≥3 under any bounded initial condition. A particular example is the constant initial condition under which the solution of the SHE has the interpretation of the partition function of the continuum directed random polymer.},

  abstract     = {The stationary horizon (SH) is a stochastic process of coupled Brownian motions indexed by their real-valued drifts. It was first introduced by the first author as the diffusive scaling limit of the Busemann process of exponential last-passage percolation. It was independently discovered as the Busemann process of Brownian last-passage percolation by the second and third authors. We show that SH is the unique invariant distribution and an attractor of the KPZ fixed point under conditions on the asymptotic spatial slopes. It follows that SH describes the Busemann process of the directed landscape. This gives control of semi-infinite geodesics simultaneously across all initial points and directions. The countable dense set Ξ of directions of discontinuity of the Busemann process is the set of directions in which not all geodesics coalesce and in which there exist at least two distinct geodesics from each initial point. This creates two distinct families of coalescing geodesics in each Ξ direction. In Ξ directions the Busemann difference profile is distributed like Brownian local time. We describe the point process of directions ξ∈Ξ and spatial locations where the ξ± Busemann functions separate.},
