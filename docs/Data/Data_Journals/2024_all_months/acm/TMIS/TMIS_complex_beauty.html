  abstract     = {Collaborative robots are becoming increasingly present in everyday life, with applications ranging food and parcel delivery, security, and more. They can offer great value propositions for organizations and consumers. However, most people lack knowledge of how to interact with robots, and many robots themselves necessitate formal training that can be inaccessible to many and thus not societally scalable. Further, there is a lack of existing work investigating interfaces designs that can support non-dyadic interactions consisting of two or more individuals interacting with a robot sequentially and simultaneously; such interactions will be common in real-world usage. This research explores the efficacy of natural language interfaces for human–robot interaction through a human experiment and post-experiment survey. Results show that the natural language interface can afford teams enhanced capabilities to share robot control and avoid errors relative to other interfaces, while also increasing user perceptions towards overall interaction.},

  abstract     = {This study analyzes the drivers of and predicts the outcome of consumer response to e-commerce short videos (ESVs) in terms of viewing duration. We first construct a large-scale ESV dataset that contains 23,001 ESVs across 40 product categories. The dataset consists of the consumer response label in terms of average viewing durations and human-annotated ESV content attributes. Relying on the constructed dataset, we employ econometric modeling and deep learning methods to comprehensively understand and predict consumer response to ESVs. First, by employing the mixed-effects model, we find that ESV content attributes for product description, product demonstration, pleasure, and aesthetics are key determinants of ESV viewing duration. Subsample analyses further show the heterogeneous effects of different content attributes on ESV viewing response across product categories. Second, we design a content-based multimodal-multitask framework to predict consumers’ viewing response to ESVs. We propose an information distillation module to extract the shared, special, and conflicted information from ESV multimodal features. Additionally, we employ a hierarchical multitask classification module to capture the feature-level and label-level dependencies. By conducting extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the prediction performance of our proposed framework is superior to that of other state-of-the-art models. Taken together, our paper provides novel theoretical and methodological contributions to the Information Systems and relevant literatures.},

  abstract     = {The healthcare sector has recently experienced an unprecedented surge in digital data accumulation, especially in the form of electronic health records (EHRs). These records constitute a precious resource that information systems researchers could utilize for various clinical applications, such as morbidity prediction and risk stratification. Recently, deep learning has demonstrated state-of-the-art empirical results in terms of predictive performance on EHRs. However, the blackbox nature of deep learning models prevents both clinicians and patients from trusting the models, especially with regard to life-critical decision making. To mitigate this, attention mechanisms are normally employed to improve the transparency of deep learning models. However, these mechanisms can only highlight important inputs without sufficient clarity on how they correlate with each other and still confuse end users. To address this drawback, we pioneer a novel model called Rational Multi-Layer Perceptrons (RMLP) that is constructed from weighted finite state automata. RMLP is able to provide better interpretability by coherently linking together relevant inputs at different timesteps into distinct sequences. RMLP can be shown to be a generalization of a multi-layer perceptron (that only works on static data) to sequential, dynamic data. With its theoretical roots in rational series, RMLP’s ability to process longitudinal time-series data and extract interpretable patterns sets it apart. Using real-world EHRs, we have substantiated the effectiveness of our RMLP model through empirical comparisons on six clinical tasks, all of which demonstrate its considerable efficacy.},

Traditional citation recommendation systems, while well-intentioned, often fall short due to their limited focus on text-based features and lack of contextual awareness. In this article, we introduce the ICA-CRMAS (Intelligent Context-Aware Approach for Citation Recommendation based on Multi-Agent System), an intelligent system that leverages the power of deep learning, semantic analysis, and multimodal learning to overcome these limitations. ICA-CRMAS goes beyond the surface, delving into the rich tapestry of information within academic papers, including figures, which often hold vital contextual clues. By weaving this contextual data directly into its recommendation models, ICA-CRMAS generates highly personalized and relevant suggestions. This comprehensive approach unlocks enhanced accuracy, diversity, and serendipity, enabling researchers to effectively discover papers aligning with their interests and research objectives. ICA-CRMAS illuminates its reasoning. Instead of opaque suggestions, the system provides clear explanations that justify and illustrate recommended citations. This transparency builds user confidence, allowing researchers to critically engage with and trust the system’s recommendations. Evaluation experiments conducted on real-world academic datasets demonstrate that ICA-CRMAS outperforms existing approaches across various metrics. it surpassing its closest competitor by a margin of 7.53 on accuracy, 6.07% on MRR and by 5.87 on Recall. User feedback further reinforces its effectiveness, with an Overall System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 76.73, exceeding benchmark scores for comparable systems.},

In fact, computer and data scientists admit potential unfairness residing in intelligent systems. Accordingly, various approaches have been proposed to make intelligent systems fair. However, the consideration of a fundamental issue is missing in current efforts to design fair intelligent systems: Fairness is in the eye of the beholder . That is, the concept of fairness is very often highly subjective in most domains. Based on the premise that fairness is subjective, we propose a framework to represent and quantify individuals’ subjective fairness beliefs and provide methodologies to aggregate them. The proposed approach provides insight into how a population will assess the fairness of a decision or policy, which in turn can provide guidance for policy as well as designing intelligent systems.},

Our new SbFAKE framework proposes, for the first time, a novel combination of language processing, optimization, and the psycholinguistic concept of surprisal to generate a set of such fakes. We start by combining psycholinguistic-based surprisal scores and optimization to generate two bilevel surprisal optimization problems (an Explicit one and a simpler Implicit one) whose solutions correspond directly to the desired set of fakes. As bilevel problems are usually hard to solve, we then show that these two bilevel surprisal optimization problems can each be reduced to equivalent surprisal-based linear programs. We performed detailed parameter tuning experiments and identified the best parameters for each of these algorithms. We then tested these two variants of SbFAKE (with their best parameter settings) against the best performing prior work in the field. Our experiments show that SbFAKE is able to more effectively generate convincing fakes than past work. In addition, we show that replacing words in an original document with words having similar surprisal scores generates greater levels of deception.},

We propose a novel local-regional model, the L ocal-Regional I nterpretable M ulti- A ttention (LIMA) model, which considers multiple aspects of a location—the place itself and its surroundings. Besides, our model offers three kinds of interpretability, providing a superior way for decision makers to understand how the model determines the prediction: critical rules learned from the tree-based module, surrounding locations that are highly correlated with the prediction, and critical regional features. Our module not only takes advantage of a tree-based model, which can effectively extract cross features, but also leverages convolutional neural networks to obtain more complex and inclusive features around the target location. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed LIMA model against existing state-of-the-art methods. The LIMA model has been deployed as a web system for assisting one of the largest bank companies in Taiwan to select locations for building new branches in major cities since 2020.},

Although existing OPP mining algorithms have achieved satisfactory performance, they discover all frequent patterns. However, in some cases, users focus on a particular trend and its associated trends. To efficiently discover trend information related to a specific prefix pattern, this article addresses the issue of co-occurrence OPP mining (COP) and proposes an algorithm named COP-Miner to discover COPs from historical time series. COP-Miner consists of three parts: extracting keypoints, preparation stage, and iteratively calculating supports and mining frequent COPs. Extracting keypoints is used to obtain local extreme points of patterns and time series. The preparation stage is designed to prepare for the first round of mining, which contains four steps: obtaining the suffix OPP of the keypoint sub-time series, calculating the occurrences of the suffix OPP, verifying the occurrences of the keypoint sub-time series, and calculating the occurrences of all fusion patterns of the keypoint sub-time series. To further improve the efficiency of support calculation, we propose a support calculation method with an ending strategy that uses the occurrences of prefix and suffix patterns to calculate the occurrences of superpatterns. Experimental results indicate that COP-Miner outperforms the other competing algorithms in running time and scalability. Moreover, COPs with keypoint alignment yield better prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {Hip fractures have profound impacts on patients’ conditions and quality of life, even when they receive therapeutic treatments. Many patients face the risk of poor prognosis, physical impairment, and even mortality, especially older patients. Accurate patient outcome estimates after an initial fracture are critical to physicians’ decision-making and patient management. Effective predictions might benefit from analyses of patients’ multimorbidity trajectories and medication usages. If adequately modeled and analyzed, then they could help identify patients at higher risk of recurrent fractures or mortality. Most analytics methods overlook the onset, co-occurrence, and temporal sequence of distinct chronic diseases in the trajectory, and they also seldom consider the combined effects of different medications. To support effective predictions, we develop a novel deep learning–based method that uses a cross-attention mechanism to model patient progression by obtaining “contextual information” from multimorbidity trajectories. This method also incorporates a nested self-attention network that captures the combined effects of distinct medications by learning the interactions among medications and how dosages might influence post-fracture outcomes. A real-world patient dataset is used to evaluate the proposed method, relative to six benchmark methods. The comparative results indicate that our method consistently outperforms all the benchmarks in precision, recall, F-measures, and area under the curve. The proposed method is generalizable and can be implemented as a decision support system to identify patients at greater risk of recurrent hip fractures or mortality, which should help clinical decision-making and patient management.},

  abstract     = {The service dominant logic is a base concept behind modern economies and software products, with service composition being a well-known practice for companies to gain a competitive edge over others by joining differentiated services together, typically assembled according to a number of features. At the other end of the spectrum, product compositions are a marketing device to sell products together in bundles that often augment the value for the customer, e.g., with suggested product interactions, sharing, and so on. Unfortunately, currently each of these two streams—namely, product and service composition—are carried out and delivered individually in splendid isolation: anything is being offered as a product and as a service, disjointly. We argue that the next wave of services computing features more and more service fusion with physical counterparts as well as data around them. Therefore a need emerges to investigate the interactive engagement of both (data) products and services. This manuscript offers a real-life implementation in support of this argument, using (1) genetic algorithms (GA) to shape product-service clusters, (2) end-user feedback to make the GAs interactive with a data-driven fashion, and (3) a hybridized approach which factors into our solution an ensemble machine-learning method considering additional features. All this research was conducted in an industrial environment. With such a cross-fertilized, data-driven, and multi-disciplinary approach, practitioners from both fields may benefit from their mutual state of the art as well as learn new strategies for product, service, and data product-service placement for increased value to the customer as well as the service provider. Results show promise but also highlight plenty of avenues for further research.},

  abstract     = {With advancements in distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts, tokenized voting rights gained prominence within decentralized finance (DeFi). Voting rights tokens (a.k.a. governance tokens) are fungible tokens that grant individual holders the right to vote upon the fate of a project. The motivation behind these tokens is to achieve decentral control within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Because the initial allocations of these tokens is often undemocratic, the DeFi project and DAO of Yearn Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them. Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of timocracies over time. The consideration is that the tokens’ tradability is the cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this article uses an agent-based model to simulate and analyze the concentration of voting rights tokens post three fair launch allocation scenarios under different trading modalities. The results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently occurs. It confirms the consideration that the ‘disease’ is endogenous: the cause of concentration is the tokens’ tradability. The findings inform theoretical understandings and practical implications for on-chain governance mediated by tokens.},

  abstract     = {Design science research has traditionally been applied to complex real-world problems to produce an artifact to address such problems. Although design science research efforts have been applied traditionally to business or related problems, there is a large set of problems in the area of digital science that also require important, digital artifacts. The digitalization of science has resulted in the need to develop essential, specialized, devices and software before it is feasible for scientists to carry out their work. This research examines digital science to identify its challenges and demonstrate how it can be possible to progress digital science with design science research, thereby establishing digital science as an important area of transdisciplinary inquiry. These areas of research are examined for their synergies and explained by positioning artifact development challenges with respect to Simon&#39;s inner and outer environments and the interface between them.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel token-based recall communication system, which integrates Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and blockchain technology to enhance recall communication and cooperation between manufacturers and customers. We employed a design science research methodology to develop a set of design principles and features that support the interoperable system. Our findings demonstrate that we can significantly improve recall coordination, traceability, and co-value creation between involved parties. By focusing on the integration potential of traditional technologies like ERP systems with blockchain and token techniques, we reveal innovative synergies for both social and technical subsystems. The study explores the implications of the proposed system for both theory and practice, offering insights into the advantages and challenges of such integration. The evaluation conducted with industry experts demonstrates high reusability of the design principles.},

  abstract     = {Business process integration (BPI) allows organizations to connect and automate their business processes in order to deliver the right economic resources at the right time, place, and price. BPI requires the integration of business processes and their supporting systems across multiple autonomous organizations. However, such integration is complex and can face coordination complexities that occur during the resource exchanges between the partners’ processes. This article proposes a new method called Process Mining for Business Process Integration (PM4BPI) that helps process designers to perform BPI by creating new process models that cross the boundaries of multiple organizations from a collection of process event logs. PM4BPI uses federated process mining techniques to detect incompatibilities before the integration of the partners’ processes. Then, it applies process adaptation patterns to solve detected incompatibilities. Finally, organizations’ processes are merged to build a collaborative process model that crosses the organizations’ boundaries. Adapt WF_Net , an extension of a Petri net, is used to design inter-organizational business processes and adaptation patterns. An integrated care pathway is used as a case study to assess the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs can be used to enhance text search and access by augmenting textual content with relevant background knowledge. While many large knowledge graphs are available, using them to make semantic connections between entities mentioned in the textual content remains to be a difficult task. In this work, we therefore introduce contextual path generation (CPG), which refers to the task of generating knowledge paths, contextual path , to explain the semantic connections between entities mentioned in textual documents with given knowledge graph. To perform the CPG task well, one has to address its three challenges, namely, path relevance, incomplete knowledge graph, and path well-formedness. This article designs a two-stage framework comprised of the following: (1) a knowledge-enabled embedding matching and learning-to-rank with multi-head self-attention context extractor to determine a set of context entities relevant to both the query entities and context document, and (2) a non-monotonic path generation method with pretrained transformer to generate high-quality contextual paths. Our experiment results on two real-world datasets show that our best performing CPG model successfully recovers 84.13% of ground truth contextual paths, outperforming the context window baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-monotonic model generates more well-formed paths compared to the monotonic counterpart.},
