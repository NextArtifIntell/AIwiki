  abstract     = {$\Theta$ is the least ordinal $\alpha$ with the property that there is no surjection $f:\mathbb {R}\rightarrow \alpha$. ${\mathsf {AD}}_{\mathbb {R}}$ is the Axiom of Determinacy for games played on the reals. It asserts that every game of length $\omega$ of perfect information in which players take turns to play reals is determined. An ideal $\mathcal {I}$ on $\omega _1$ is $\omega _1$-dense if the boolean algebra ${\wp }(\omega _1)/ \mathcal {I}$ has a dense subset of size $\omega _1$. We consider the theories, where $\mathsf {CH}$ stands for the Continuum Hypothesis, \begin{gather*} \mathsf {ZFC} + \mathsf {CH} + \text {‚ÄúThere is an $\omega _1$-dense ideal on $\omega _1$.&#39;&#39;}\\ \mathsf {ZF}+{\mathsf {AD}}_{\mathbb {R}} + \text {‚Äú$\Theta $ is a regular cardinal.&#39;&#39;}\end{gather*} The main result of this paper is that the first theory given above implies the existence of a class model of the second theory given above. Woodin, in unpublished work, showed that the consistency of the second equation given above implies the consistency of the first equation given above. We will also give a proof of this result, which, together with our main theorem, establish the equiconsistency of both the equations given above. As a consequence, this resolves part of question 12 of W. Hugh Woodin [ The axiom of determinacy, forcing axioms, and the nonstationary ideal , Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, 1999], in particular, it shows that the theories (b) and (c) in question 12 of W. Hugh Woodin [ The axiom of determinacy, forcing axioms, and the nonstationary ideal , Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co., Berlin, 1999] are equiconsistent. Thus, our work completes the work that was started by Woodin and Ketchersid in [ Toward AD($\mathbb {R}$) from the continuum hypothesis and an $\omega _1$-dense ideal , ProQuest LLC, Ann Arbor, MI, 2000] some 25 years ago. We also establish other theorems of similar nature in this paper, showing the equiconsistency of the second equation given above and the statement that the non-stationary ideal on ${\wp }_{\omega _1}(\mathbb {R})$ is strong and pseudo-homogeneous. The aforementioned results are the only known equiconsistency results at the level of $\mathsf {AD}_{\mathbb {R}} + \text {‚Äú$Œò$ is a regular cardinal.&#39;&#39;}$},

  abstract     = {For any $Q\in \{\frac {3}{2},2,\frac {5}{2},3,\dotsc \}$, we establish a structure theory for the class $\mathcal {S}_Q$ of stable codimension 1 stationary integral varifolds admitting no classical singularities of density $&lt;Q$. This theory comprises three main theorems which describe the nature of a varifold $V\in \mathcal {S}_Q$ when: (i) $V$ is close to a flat disk of multiplicity $Q$ (for integer $Q$); (ii) $V$ is close to a flat disk of integer multiplicity $&lt;Q$; and (iii) $V$ is close to a stationary cone with vertex density $Q$ and supports the union of 3 or more half-hyperplanes meeting along a common axis. The main new result concerns (i) and gives in particular a description of $V\in \mathcal {S}_Q$ near branch points of density $Q$. Results concerning (ii) and (iii) directly follow from parts of previous work of the second author [Ann. of Math. (2) 179 (2014), pp. 843‚Äì1007]. These three theorems, taken with $Q=p/2$, are readily applicable to codimension 1 rectifiable area minimising currents mod $p$ for any integer $p\geq 2$, establishing local structure properties of such a current $T$ as consequences of little, readily checked, information. Specifically, applying case (i) it follows that, for even $p$, if $T$ has one tangent cone at an interior point $y$ equal to an (oriented) hyperplane $P$ of multiplicity $p/2$, then $P$ is the unique tangent cone at $y$, and $T$ near $y$ is given by the graph of a $\frac {p}{2}$-valued function with $C^{1,\alpha }$ regularity in a certain generalised sense. This settles a basic remaining open question in the study of the local structure of such currents near points with planar tangent cones, extending the cases $p=2$ and $p=4$ of the result which have been known since the 1970‚Äôs from the De Giorgi‚ÄìAllard regularity theory [Ann. of Math. (2) 95 (1972), pp. 417‚Äì491] [ Frontiere orientate di misura minima , Editrice Tecnico Scientifica, Pisa, 1961] and the structure theory of White [Invent. Math. 53 (1979), pp. 45‚Äì58] respectively. If $P$ has multiplicity $&lt; p/2$ (for $p$ even or odd), it follows from case (ii) that $T$ is smoothly embedded near $y$, recovering a second well-known theorem of White [ Proc. Sympos. Pure Math. , Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1986, pp. 413‚Äì427]. Finally, the main structure results obtained recently by De Lellis‚ÄìHirsch‚ÄìMarchese‚ÄìSpolaor‚ÄìStuvard [arXiv:2105.08135, 2021] for such currents $T$ all follow from case (iii).},

If $M$ is such a manifold, we show that the type D structure $\widehat {CFD}(M)$ may be viewed as a set of immersed curves decorated with local systems in $\partial M$. These curves-with-decoration are invariants of the underlying three-manifold up to regular homotopy of the curves and isomorphism of the local systems. Given two such manifolds and a homeomorphism $h$ between the boundary tori, the Heegaard Floer homology of the closed manifold obtained by gluing with $h$ is obtained from the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology of the curve-sets. This machinery has several applications: We establish that the dimension of $\widehat {HF}$ decreases under a certain class of degree one maps (pinches) and we establish that the existence of an essential separating torus gives rise to a lower bound on the dimension of $\widehat {HF}$. In particular, it follows that a prime rational homology sphere $Y$ with $\widehat {HF}(Y)&lt;5$ must be geometric. Other results include a new proof of Eftekhary‚Äôs theorem that L-space homology spheres are atoroidal; a complete characterization of toroidal L-spaces in terms of gluing data; and a proof of a conjecture of Hom, Lidman, and Vafaee on satellite L-space knots.},

  abstract     = {The classical hypercontractive inequality for the noise operator on the discrete cube plays a crucial role in many of the fundamental results in the Analysis of Boolean functions, such as the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem, Friedgut‚Äôs junta theorem and the invariance principle of Mossel, O‚ÄôDonnell and Oleszkiewicz. In these results the cube is equipped with the uniform ($1/2$-biased) measure, but it is desirable, particularly for applications to the theory of sharp thresholds, to also obtain such results for general $p$-biased measures. However, simple examples show that when $p$ is small there is no hypercontractive inequality that is strong enough for such applications. In this paper, we establish an effective hypercontractivity inequality for general $p$ that applies to ‚Äòglobal functions‚Äô, i.e. functions that are not significantly affected by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This class of functions appears naturally, e.g. in Bourgain‚Äôs sharp threshold theorem, which states that such functions exhibit a sharp threshold. We demonstrate the power of our tool by strengthening Bourgain‚Äôs theorem, making progress on two conjectures of Kahn and Kalai (both these conjectures were open when we arXived this paper in 2019; one of them was solved in 2022; the other is still open), and proving a $p$-biased analogue of the seminal invariance principle of Mossel, O‚ÄôDonnell, and Oleszkiewicz. In this 2023 version of our paper we will also survey many further applications of our results that have been obtained by various authors since we arXived the first version in 2019.},

The traditional proofs of the meromorphic continuation of Eisenstein series, due to Selberg and Langlands, start with cuspidal Eisenstein series as a special case, and deduce the general case from spectral theory. We present a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù proof which relies only on rudimentary Fredholm theory (needed only in the number field case). It is valid for Eisenstein series induced from an arbitrary automorphic form. The proof relies on the principle of meromorphic continuation. It is close in spirit to Selberg‚Äôs later proofs.},

This proves in particular a conjecture of O‚ÄôGrady stating that hyper-K√§hler fourfolds of K3$^{[2]}$ numerical type are of K3$^{[2]}$ deformation type. Our topological assumption concerns the existence of two integral degree-2 cohomology classes satisfying certain numerical intersection conditions. There are two main ingredients in the proof. We first prove a topological version of the statement, by showing that our topological assumption forces the Betti numbers, the Fujiki constant, and the Huybrechts‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch polynomial of the hyper-K√§hler fourfold to be the same as those of K3$^{[2]}$ hyper-K√§hler fourfolds. The key part of the article is then to prove the hyper-K√§hler SYZ conjecture for hyper-K√§hler fourfolds for divisor classes satisfying the numerical condition mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {We prove that every slightly degenerate braided fusion category admits a minimal nondegenerate extension, and hence that every pseudo-unitary super modular tensor category admits a minimal modular extension. This completes the program of characterizing minimal nondegenerate extensions of braided fusion categories. Our proof relies on the new subject of fusion $2$-categories. We study in detail the Drinfel‚Äôd centre $\mathcal {Z}({_{}\mathrm {Mod}\text {-}\mathcal {B}})$ of the fusion $2$-category ${_{}\mathrm {Mod}\text {-}\mathcal {B}}$ of module categories of a braided fusion $1$-category $\mathcal {B}$. We show that minimal nondegenerate extensions of $\mathcal {B}$ correspond to certain trivializations of $\mathcal {Z}({_{}\mathrm {Mod}\text {-}\mathcal {B}})$. In the slightly degenerate case, such trivializations are obstructed by a class in $H^5(K(\mathbb {Z}_2, 2); \mathbb {k}^\times )$ and we use a numerical invariant‚Äîdefined by evaluating a certain two-dimensional topological field theory on a Klein bottle‚Äîto prove that this obstruction always vanishes. Along the way, we develop techniques to explicitly compute in braided fusion $2$-categories which we expect will be of independent interest. In addition to the model of $\mathcal {Z}({_{}\mathrm {Mod}\text {-}\mathcal {B}})$ in terms of braided $\mathcal {B}$-module categories, we develop a computationally useful model in terms of certain algebra objects in $\mathcal {B}$. We construct an $S$-matrix pairing for any braided fusion $2$-category, and show that it is nondegenerate for $\mathcal {Z}({_{}\mathrm {Mod}\text {-}\mathcal {B}})$. As a corollary, we identify components of $\mathcal {Z}({_{}\mathrm {Mod}\text {-}\mathcal {B}})$ with blocks in the annular category of $\mathcal {B}$ and with the homomorphisms from the Grothendieck ring of the M√ºger centre of $\mathcal {B}$ to the ground field.},
