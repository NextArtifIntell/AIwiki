  abstract     = {Inspired by Sheehan‚Äôs conjecture that no $4$-regular graph contains exactly one hamiltonian cycle, we prove results on hamiltonian cycles in regular graphs and nearly regular graphs. We fully disprove a conjecture of Haythorpe on the minimum number of hamiltonian cycles in regular hamiltonian graphs, thereby extending a result of Zamfirescu, as well as correct and complement Haythorpe‚Äôs computational enumerative results from [Exp. Math. 27 (2018), no. 4, 426‚Äì430]. Thereafter, we use the Lov√°sz Local Lemma to extend Thomassen‚Äôs independent dominating set method. This extension allows us to find a second hamiltonian cycle that inherits linearly many edges from the first hamiltonian cycle. Regarding the limitations of this method, we answer a question of Haxell, Seamone, and Verstraete, and settle the first open case of a problem of Thomassen by showing that for $k \in \{5, 6\}$ there exist infinitely many $k$-regular hamiltonian graphs having no independent dominating set with respect to a prescribed hamiltonian cycle. Motivated by an observation of Aldred and Thomassen, we prove that for every $\kappa \in \{ 2, 3 \}$ and any positive integer $k$, there are infinitely many non-regular graphs of connectivity $\kappa$ containing exactly one hamiltonian cycle and in which every vertex has degree $3$ or $2k$.},

While numerous $p$-adic continued fraction expansion algorithms have been proposed by the researchers, the establishment of several excellent properties, such as the Lagrange‚Äôs Theorem for classic continued fractions, which indicates that every quadratic irrationals can be expanded periodically, remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce several new algorithms designed for expanding algebraic numbers in $\mathbb {Q}_p$ for a given prime $p$. We give an upper bound of the number of partial quotients for the expansion of rational numbers, and prove that for small primes $p$, our algorithm generates periodic continued fraction expansions for all quadratic irrationals. Experimental data demonstrates that our algorithms exhibit better performance in the periodicity of expansions for quadratic irrationals compared to the existing algorithms. Furthermore, for bigger primes $p$, we propose a potential approach to establish a $p$-adic continued fraction expansion algorithm. As before, the algorithm is designed to expand algebraic numbers in $\mathbb {Q}_p$, while generating periodic expansions for all quadratic irrationals in $\mathbb {Q}_p$.},

As far as we know, this is the first rigorous proof of root-exponential convergence of Laguerre approximations for analytic functions. Several important applications of our analysis are also discussed, including Laguerre spectral differentiations, Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rules, the scaling factor and the Weeks method for the inversion of Laplace transform, and some sharp convergence rate estimates are derived. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the theoretical results.},

In this paper, we propose a random active set method that introduces randomness in the active set‚Äôs update process.

Employing weighted sparsity regularization and standard results for subgradients, we derive simple-to-check criteria which assure that a number of sinks ($f(x)0$) can be identified. Furthermore, we present two cases for which these criteria always are fulfilled: (a) well-separated sources and sinks, and (b) many sources or sinks located at the boundary plus one interior source/sink. Our approach is such that the linearity of the associated forward operator is preserved in the discrete formulation. The theory is therefore conveniently developed in terms of Euclidean spaces, and it can be applied to a wide range of problems. In particular, it can be applied to both isotropic and anisotropic cases. We present a series of numerical experiments. This work is motivated by the observation that standard methods typically suggest that internal sinks and sources are located close to the boundary.},

We demonstrate that these IMEX-RK methods can preserve the original energy dissipation property without any restrictions on the time-step size, thanks to a stabilization technique. The stabilization constants are solely dependent on the minimal eigenvalues that result from the Butcher tables of the IMEX-RKs. Furthermore, we establish a simple framework that can determine whether an IMEX-RK scheme is capable of preserving the original energy dissipation property or not. We also present a heuristic convergence analysis based on the truncation errors. This is the first research to prove that a linear high-order single-step scheme can ensure the original energy stability unconditionally for general gradient flows. Additionally, we provide several high-order IMEX-RK schemes that satisfy the established framework. Notably, we discovered a new four-stage third-order IMEX-RK scheme that reduces energy.

It turns out to evolve every level set of the initial condition precisely by another class of methods known as threshold dynamics. Median filters are, in other words, the natural level set versions of threshold dynamics algorithms. Exploiting this connection, we revisit median filters in light of recent progress on the threshold dynamics method. In particular, we give a variational formulation of, and exhibit a Lyapunov function for, median filters, resulting in energy based unconditional stability properties. The connection also yields analogues of median filters in the multiphase setting of mean curvature flow of networks. These new multiphase level set methods do not require frequent redistancing, and can accommodate a wide range of surface tensions.},

Such small local structures lead to a strong Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy (CFL) condition in explicit time integration schemes causing a severe loss in efficiency. For these problems, various local time-stepping schemes have been proposed in the literature in the last years and have been shown to be very efficient. Here, we construct a quite general class of local time integration methods preserving a perturbed energy and containing local time-stepping and locally implicit methods as special cases. For these two variants we prove stability and optimal convergence rates in space and time. Numerical results confirm the stability behavior and show the proved convergence rates.},

  abstract     = {In contrast with the diffusion equation which smoothens the initial data to $C^\infty$ for $t&gt;0$ (away from the corners/edges of the domain), the subdiffusion equation only exhibits limited spatial regularity. As a result, one generally cannot expect high-order accuracy in space in solving the subdiffusion equation with nonsmooth initial data. In this paper, a new splitting of the solution is constructed for high-order finite element approximations to the subdiffusion equation with nonsmooth initial data. The method is constructed by splitting the solution into two parts, i.e., a time-dependent smooth part and a time-independent nonsmooth part, and then approximating the two parts via different strategies. The time-dependent smooth part is approximated by using high-order finite element method in space and convolution quadrature in time, while the steady nonsmooth part could be approximated by using smaller mesh size or other methods that could yield high-order accuracy. Several examples are presented to show how to accurately approximate the steady nonsmooth part, including piecewise smooth initial data, Dirac‚ÄìDelta point initial data, and Dirac measure concentrated on an interface. The argument could be directly extended to subdiffusion equations with nonsmooth source data. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to illustrate the performance of the proposed high-order splitting finite element methods.},

  abstract     = {Let $F \in \mathbb {Z}[x_0, \ldots , x_n]$ be homogeneous of degree $d$ and assume that $F$ is not a ‚Äònullform‚Äô, i.e., there is an invariant $I$ of forms of degree $d$ in $n+1$ variables such that $I(F) \neq 0$. Equivalently, $F$ is semistable in the sense of Geometric Invariant Theory. Minimizing $F$ at a prime $p$ means to produce $T \in Mat(n+1, \mathbb {Z}) \cap GL(n+1, \mathbb {Q})$ and $e \in \mathbb {Z}_{\ge 0}$ such that $F_1 = p^{-e} F([x_0, \ldots , x_n] \cdot T)$ has integral coefficients and $v_p(I(F_1))$ is minimal among all such $F_1$. Following Koll√°r [Electron. Res. Announc. Amer. Math. Soc. 3 (1997), pp. 17‚Äì27], the minimization process can be described in terms of applying weight vectors $w \in \mathbb {Z}_{\ge 0}^{n+1}$ to $F$. We show that for any dimension $n$ and degree $d$, there is a complete set of weight vectors consisting of $[0,w_1,w_2,\dots ,w_n]$ with $0 \le w_1 \le w_2 \le \dots \le w_n \le 2 n d^{n-1}$. When $n = 2$, we improve the bound to $d$. This answers a question raised by Koll√°r. These results are valid in a more general context, replacing $\mathbb {Z}$ and $p$ by a PID $R$ and a prime element of $R$. Based on this result and a further study of the minimization process in the planar case $n = 2$, we devise an efficient minimization algorithm for ternary forms (equivalently, plane curves) of arbitrary degree $d$. We also describe a similar algorithm that allows to minimize (and reduce) cubic surfaces. These algorithms are available in the computer algebra system Magma.},

We demonstrate the existence of a unique solution for a general class of vertex conditions and derive the regularity of the solution in the specific case of Kirchhoff vertex conditions. These results are extended to the stochastic setting when $f$ is replaced by Gaussian white noise. For the deterministic and stochastic settings under generalized Kirchhoff vertex conditions, we propose a numerical solution based on a finite element approximation combined with a rational approximation of the fractional power $L^{-\beta }$. For the resulting approximation, the strong error is analyzed in the deterministic case, and the strong mean squared error as well as the $L_2(\Gamma \times \Gamma )$-error of the covariance function of the solution are analyzed in the stochastic setting. Explicit rates of convergences are derived for all cases. Numerical experiments for ${L = \kappa ^2 - \Delta , \kappa &gt;0}$ are performed to illustrate the results.},

  abstract     = {Interacting particle or agent systems that exhibit diverse swarming behaviors are prevalent in science and engineering. Developing effective differential equation models to understand the connection between individual interaction rules and swarming is a fundamental and challenging goal. In this paper, we study the data-driven discovery of a second-order particle swarming model that describes the evolution of $N$ particles in $\mathbb {R}^d$ under radial interactions. We propose a learning approach that models the latent radial interaction function as Gaussian processes, which can simultaneously fulfill two inference goals: one is the nonparametric inference of the interaction function with pointwise uncertainty quantification, and the other is the inference of unknown scalar parameters in the noncollective friction forces of the system. We formulate the learning problem as a statistical inverse learning problem and introduce an operator-theoretic framework that provides a detailed analysis of recoverability conditions, establishing that a coercivity condition is sufficient for recoverability. Given data collected from $M$ i.i.d trajectories with independent Gaussian observational noise, we provide a finite-sample analysis, showing that our posterior mean estimator converges in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space norm, at an optimal rate in $M$ equal to the one in the classical 1-dimensional Kernel Ridge regression. As a byproduct, we show we can obtain a parametric learning rate in $M$ for the posterior marginal variance using $L^{\infty }$ norm and that the rate could also involve $N$ and $L$ (the number of observation time instances for each trajectory) depending on the condition number of the inverse problem. We provide numerical results on systems exhibiting different swarming behaviors, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in the scarce, noisy trajectory data regime.},

Two necessary conditions, a definiteness condition and a rank-preserving condition, on an eigenbasis matrix of the NEPv that is a global optimizer of the associated optimization problem are revealed, where the definiteness condition has been known for the special cases previously investigated. We show that, locally close to the eigenbasis matrix satisfying both necessary conditions, the NEPv can be reformulated as a unitarily invariant NEPv, the so-called aligned NEPv , through a basis alignment operation ‚Äî in other words, the NEPv is locally unitarily invariantizable.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on investigating the density convergence of a fully discrete finite difference method when applied to numerically solve the stochastic Cahn‚ÄìHilliard equation driven by multiplicative space-time white noises. The main difficulty lies in the control of the drift coefficient that is neither globally Lipschitz nor one-sided Lipschitz. To handle this difficulty, we propose a novel localization argument and derive the strong convergence rate of the numerical solution to estimate the total variation distance between the exact and numerical solutions. This along with the existence of the density of the numerical solution finally yields the convergence of density in $L^1(\mathbb {R})$ of the numerical solution. Our results partially answer positively to the open problem posed by J. Cui and J. Hong [J. Differential Equations 269 (2020), pp. 10143‚Äì10180] on computing the density of the exact solution numerically.},

  abstract     = {A finite difference numerical scheme is proposed and analyzed for the Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes system with Flory-Huggins energy functional. A convex splitting is applied to the chemical potential, which in turns leads to the implicit treatment for the singular logarithmic terms and the surface diffusion term, and an explicit update for the expansive concave term. The convective term for the phase variable, as well as the coupled term in the Stokes equation, is approximated in a semi-implicit manner. In the spatial discretization, the marker and cell difference method is applied, which evaluates the velocity components, the pressure and the phase variable at different cell locations. Such an approach ensures the divergence-free feature of the discrete velocity, and this property plays an important role in the analysis. The positivity-preserving property and the unique solvability of the proposed numerical scheme are theoretically justified, utilizing the singular nature of the logarithmic term as the phase variable approaches the singular limit values. An unconditional energy stability analysis is standard, as an outcome of the convex-concave decomposition technique. A convergence analysis with accompanying error estimate is provided for the proposed numerical scheme. In particular, a higher order consistency analysis, accomplished by supplementary functions, is performed to ensure the separation properties of numerical solution. In turn, using the approach of rough and refined error estimates, we are able to derive an optimal rate convergence. To conclude, several numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

The equations we consider as examples are the nonlinear convection-diffusion equation and the biharmonic equation. Optimal error estimates are obtained for both equations under certain conditions, and the key step is to carefully design global projections to eliminate numerical errors on the cell interface terms of ultra-weak schemes on general dimensions. The well-posedness and approximation capability of these global projections are obtained for arbitrary order polynomial space based on a wide class of generalized numerical fluxes on regular meshes. These projections can serve as general analytical tools to be naturally applied to a wide class of high order equations.

Fractures are described as planar surfaces, yielding the so-called mixed- or hybrid-dimensional models. Small displacements and a linear elastic behavior are considered for the matrix. The model accounts for discontinuous fluid pressures at matrix‚Äìfracture interfaces in order to cover a wide range of normal fracture conductivities. The numerical analysis is carried out in the Gradient Discretization framework (see J. Droniou, R. Eymard, T. Gallou√´t, C. Guichard, and R. Herbin [ The gradient discretisation method , Springer, Cham, 2018]), encompassing a large family of conforming and nonconforming discretizations. The convergence result also yields, as a by-product, the existence of a weak solution to the continuous model. A numerical experiment in 2D is presented to support the obtained result, employing a Hybrid Finite Volume scheme for the flow and second-order finite elements ($\mathbb {P}_2$) for the mechanical displacement coupled with face-wise constant ($\mathbb P_0$) Lagrange multipliers on fractures, representing normal stresses, to discretize the contact conditions.},

This setting can be applied to optimization problems arising in Machine Learning; allowing $\sigma$ to depend on the position brings faster convergence in comparison with the classical Langevin equation $dY_t = -\nabla V(Y_t)dt + \sigma dW_t$. The case where $\sigma$ is a constant matrix has been extensively studied; however little attention has been paid to the general case. We prove the convergence for the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance of $Y_t$ and of the associated Euler scheme $\bar {Y}_t$ to some measure $\nu ^\star$ which is supported by $\operatorname {argmin}(V)$ and give rates of convergence to the instantaneous Gibbs measure $\nu _{a(t)}$ of density $\propto \exp (-2V(x)/a(t)^2)$. To do so, we first consider the case where $a$ is a piecewise constant function. We find again the classical schedule $a(t) = A\log ^{-1/2}(t)$. We then prove the convergence for the general case by giving bounds for the Wasserstein distance to the stepwise constant case using ergodicity properties.},

This method can generate available estimates from the approximated posterior distribution efficiently. To avoid the mutually singular obstacle that occurred in the infinite-dimensional hierarchical approach, we propose a rigorous theory of the non-centered variational Bayesian approach. Since the non-centered parameterization weakens the connection between the parameter and the hyper-parameter, we can introduce the hyper-parameter to all terms of the eigendecomposition of the prior covariance operator. We also show the relationships between the NCP-iMFVI and infinite-dimensional hierarchical approaches with centered parameterization. The proposed algorithm is applied to three inverse problems governed by the simple smooth equation, the Helmholtz equation, and the steady-state Darcy flow equation. Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings, illustrate the efficiency of solving the iMFVI problem formulated by large-scale linear and non-linear statistical inverse problems, and verify the mesh-independent property.},

By deploying some state-of-the-art variance reduced gradient estimators (rather than full gradient) in stochastic optimization, the s-ASAP method is applicable to nonconvex optimization whose objective is the sum of a nonsmooth data-fitting term and a finite number of differentiable functions. The sublinear convergence rate of s-ASAP is built upon the proximal point algorithmic framework, whilst the linear convergence rate of s-ASAP is achieved under the error bound condition. Furthermore, the convergence of the sequence produced by s-ASAP is established under the Kurdyka-≈Åojasiewicz property. Preliminary numerical simulations on some image processing applications demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed method.},

In this function space, the optimal rate for the worst-case root-mean-squared error (RMSE) is established. Here, optimality is for a general class of quadratures, in which adaptive non-linear algorithms with a possibly varying number of function evaluations are also allowed. The optimal rate is given by showing matching bounds. First, a lower bound on the worst-case RMSE of $O(n^{-\alpha -1/2})$ is proven, where $n$ denotes an upper bound on the expected number of function evaluations. It turns out that a suitably randomized trapezoidal rule attains this rate, up to a logarithmic factor. A practical error estimator for this trapezoidal rule is also presented. Numerical results support our theory.},

  abstract     = {The numerical method of Kahan applied to quadratic differential equations is known to often generate integrable maps in low dimensions and can in more general situations exhibit preserved measures and integrals. Computerized methods based on discrete Darboux polynomials have recently been used for finding these measures and integrals. However, if the differential system contains many parameters, this approach can lead to highly complex results that can be difficult to interpret and analyse. But this complexity can in some cases be substantially reduced by using aromatic series. These are a mathematical tool introduced independently by Chartier and Murua and by Iserles, Quispel and Tse. We develop an algorithm for this purpose and derive some necessary conditions for the Kahan map to have preserved measures and integrals expressible in terms of aromatic functions. An important reason for the success of this method lies in the equivariance of the map from vector fields to their aromatic functions. We demonstrate the algorithm on a number of examples showing a great reduction in complexity compared to what had been obtained by a fixed basis such as monomials.},

Under the assumption of $H^2$-solution of the NLSE, we prove error bounds at $O(\tau ^{\frac {1}{2}+\sigma } + h^{1+2\sigma })$ and $O(\tau + h^{2})$ in $L^2$-norm for $0&lt;\sigma \leq \frac {1}{2}$ and $\sigma \geq \frac {1}{2}$, respectively, and an error bound at $O(\tau ^\frac {1}{2} + h)$ in $H^1$-norm for $\sigma \geq \frac {1}{2}$, where $h$ and $\tau$ are the mesh size and time step size, respectively. In addition, when $\frac {1}{2}&lt;\sigma &lt;1$ and under the assumption of $H^3$-solution of the NLSE, we show an error bound at $O(\tau ^{\sigma } + h^{2\sigma })$ in $H^1$-norm. Two key ingredients are adopted in our proof: one is to adopt an unconditional $L^2$-stability of the numerical flow in order to avoid an a priori estimate of the numerical solution for the case of $0 &lt; \sigma \leq \frac {1}{2}$, and to establish an $l^\infty$-conditional $H^1$-stability to obtain the $l^\infty$-bound of the numerical solution by using the mathematical induction and the error estimates for the case of $\sigma \ge \frac {1}{2}$; and the other one is to introduce a regularization technique to avoid the singularity of the semi-smooth nonlinearity in obtaining improved local truncation errors. Finally, numerical results are reported to demonstrate our error bounds.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new non-resonant low-regularity integrator for the cubic nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE) allowing for long-time error estimates which are optimal in the sense of the underlying partial differential equation. The main idea thereby lies in treating the zeroth mode exactly within the discretization. For long-time error estimates, we rigorously establish the error bounds of different low-regularity integrators for the NLSE with small initial data characterized by a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$. We begin with the low-regularity integrator for the quadratic NLSE in which the integral is computed exactly and the improved uniform first-order convergence in $H^r$ is proven at $O(\varepsilon \tau )$ for solutions in $H^r$ with $r &gt; 1/2$ up to the time $T_{\varepsilon } = T/\varepsilon$ with fixed $T &gt; 0$. Then, the improved uniform long-time error bound is extended to a symmetric second-order low-regularity integrator in the long-time regime. For the cubic NLSE, we design new non-resonant first-order and symmetric second-order low-regularity integrators which treat the zeroth mode exactly and rigorously carry out the error analysis up to the time $T_{\varepsilon } = T/\varepsilon ^2$. With the help of the regularity compensation oscillation technique, the improved uniform error bounds are established for the new non-resonant low-regularity schemes, which further reduces the long-time error by a factor of $\varepsilon ^2$ compared with classical low-regularity integrators for the cubic NLSE. Numerical examples are presented to validate the error estimates and compare with the classical time-splitting methods in the long-time simulations.},

In particular, the boundary condition studied in this work enforces a power law type relation between the electric and magnetic fields along the boundary. Based on time-dependent jump relations of classical boundary operators, we derive a nonlinear system of time-dependent boundary integral equations that determines the tangential traces of the scattered electric and magnetic fields. These fields can subsequently be computed at arbitrary points in the exterior domain by evaluating a time-dependent representation formula. Fully discrete schemes are obtained by discretizing the nonlinear system of boundary integral equations with Runge‚ÄìKutta based convolution quadrature in time and Raviart‚ÄìThomas boundary elements in space. Error bounds with explicitly stated convergence rates are proven, under the assumption of sufficient regularity of the exact solution. The error analysis is conducted through novel techniques based on time-discrete transmission problems and the use of a new discrete partial integration inequality. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of the proposed method and provide empirical convergence rates.},

This algorithm is considered one of the best at the present time. Our new algorithm shows better properties of periodicity. We show for the square root of integers that if our algorithm produces a periodic expansion, then this periodic expansion will have pre-period one. It appears experimentally that our algorithm produces more periodic continued fractions for quadratic irrationals than Browkin‚Äôs algorithm. Hence, it is closer to an algorithm to which an analogue of Lagrange‚Äôs Theorem would apply.},

This problem arises in applications such as phase retrieval and absolute value rectification neural networks. While several results have been developed to characterize the uniqueness and stability of solutions when ${\boldsymbol {b}}=\lvert A{\boldsymbol {x}}_0\rvert$ for some ${\boldsymbol {x}}_0\in \mathbb {H}^d$, no existing results address the case where ${\boldsymbol {b}}$ is arbitrary. In this paper, we investigate the uniqueness and stability of solutions for the more general case where ${\boldsymbol {b}}$ is not necessarily equal to $\lvert A{\boldsymbol {x}}_0\rvert$ for any ${\boldsymbol {x}}_0\in \mathbb {H}^d$. We prove that for any matrix $A\in \mathbb {H}^{m\times d}$, there is always a vector ${\boldsymbol {b}}\in \mathbb {R}^m$ for which the solution to the nonlinear least squares problem is not unique. However, we show that such ‚Äúbad‚Äù vectors ${\boldsymbol {b}}$ are negligible in practice; specifically, if ${\boldsymbol {b}}\in \mathbb {R}_{ }^m$ does not lie in some measure zero set, then the solution is unique. Furthermore, we establish certain conditions under which the solution is guaranteed to be unique. Regarding the stability of solutions, we prove that the solution is not uniformly stable. However, if we restrict the vectors ${\boldsymbol {b}}$ to a convex set where the solution to the least squares problem is unique, then the solution becomes stable. To the best of our knowledge, our results represent the first theoretical results of the uniqueness and stability of solutions for the nonlinear least squares problem.},

  abstract     = {In solid state physics, electronic properties of crystalline materials are often inferred from the spectrum of periodic Schr√∂dinger operators. As a consequence of Bloch‚Äôs theorem, the numerical computation of electronic quantities of interest involves computing derivatives or integrals over the Brillouin zone of so-called energy bands, which are piecewise smooth, Lipschitz continuous periodic functions obtained by solving a parametrized elliptic eigenvalue problem on a Hilbert space of periodic functions. Classical discretization strategies for resolving these eigenvalue problems produce approximate energy bands that are either non-periodic or discontinuous, both of which cause difficulty when computing numerical derivatives or employing numerical quadrature. In this article, we study an alternative discretization strategy based on an ad hoc operator modification approach. While specific instances of this approach have been proposed in the physics literature, we introduce here a systematic formulation of this operator modification approach. We derive a priori error estimates for the resulting energy bands and we show that these bands are periodic and can be made arbitrarily smooth (away from band crossings) by adjusting suitable parameters in the operator modification approach. Numerical experiments involving a toy model in 1D, graphene in 2D, and silicon in 3D validate our theoretical results and showcase the efficiency of the operator modification approach.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution simulations of particle-based kinetic plasma models typically require a high number of particles and thus often become computationally intractable. This is exacerbated in multi-query simulations, where the problem depends on a set of parameters. In this work, we derive reduced order models for the semi-discrete Hamiltonian system resulting from a geometric particle-in-cell approximation of the parametric Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equations. Since the problem‚Äôs nondissipative and highly nonlinear nature makes it reducible only locally in time, we adopt a nonlinear reduced basis approach where the reduced phase space evolves in time. This strategy allows a significant reduction in the number of simulated particles, but the evaluation of the nonlinear operators associated with the Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson coupling remains computationally expensive. We propose a novel reduction of the nonlinear terms that combines adaptive parameter sampling and hyper-reduction techniques to address this. The proposed approach allows decoupling the operations having a cost dependent on the number of particles from those that depend on the instances of the required parameters. In particular, in each time step, the electric potential is approximated via dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the particle-to-grid map via a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). These approximations are constructed from data obtained from a past temporal window at a few selected values of the parameters to guarantee a computationally efficient adaptation. The resulting DMD-DEIM reduced dynamical system retains the Hamiltonian structure of the full model, provides good approximations of the solution, and can be solved at a reduced computational cost.},

It is a nonlinear advection‚Äìreaction‚Äìdiffusion equation that exhibits both parabolic‚Äìhyperbolic and parabolic‚Äìelliptic kind of degeneracies. In this study, we provide reliable, fully computable, and locally space‚Äìtime efficient a posteriori error bounds for numerical approximations of the fully degenerate Richards equation. For showing global reliability, a nonlocal-in-time error estimate is derived individually for the time-integrated $H^1(H^{-1})$, $L^2(L^2)$, and the $L^2(H^1)$ errors. A maximum principle and a degeneracy estimator are employed for the last one. Global and local space‚Äìtime efficiency error bounds are then obtained in a standard $H^1(H^{-1})\cap L^2(H^1)$ norm. The reliability and efficiency norms employed coincide when there is no nonlinearity. Moreover, error contributors such as space discretization, time discretization, quadrature, linearization, and data oscillation are identified and separated. The estimates are also valid in a setting where iterative linearization with inexact solvers is considered. Numerical tests are conducted for nondegenerate and degenerate cases having exact solutions, as well as for a realistic case and a benchmark case. It is shown that the estimators correctly identify the errors up to a factor of the order of unity.},

Furthermore, it allows for the treatment of general inhomogeneous boundary conditions. In many minimal residual formulations, however, one or more terms of the residual are measured in negative or fractional Sobolev norms. In this work, we provide a general approach to replace those norms by efficiently evaluable expressions without sacrificing quasi-optimality of the resulting numerical solution. We exemplify our approach by verifying the necessary inf-sup conditions for four formulations of a model second order elliptic equation with inhomogeneous Dirichlet and/or Neumann boundary conditions. We report on numerical experiments for the Poisson problem with mixed inhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in an ultra-weak first order system formulation.},

  abstract     = {Over the last several decades, improvements in the fields of analytic combinatorics and computer algebra have made determining the asymptotic behaviour of sequences satisfying linear recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients largely a matter of routine, under assumptions that hold often in practice. The algorithms involved typically take a sequence, encoded by a recurrence relation and initial terms, and return the leading terms in an asymptotic expansion up to a big-O error term. Less studied, however, are effective techniques giving an explicit bound on asymptotic error terms. Among other things, such explicit bounds typically allow the user to automatically prove sequence positivity (an active area of enumerative and algebraic combinatorics) by exhibiting an index when positive leading asymptotic behaviour dominates any error terms. In this article, we present a practical algorithm for computing such asymptotic approximations with rigorous error bounds, under the assumption that the generating series of the sequence is a solution of a differential equation with regular (Fuchsian) dominant singularities. Our algorithm approximately follows the singularity analysis method of Flajolet and Odlyzko [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 3 (1990), pp. 216‚Äì240], except that all big-O terms involved in the derivation of the asymptotic expansion are replaced by explicit error terms. The computation of the error terms combines analytic bounds from the literature with effective techniques from rigorous numerics and computer algebra. We implement our algorithm in the SageMath computer algebra system and exhibit its use on a variety of applications (including our original motivating example, solution uniqueness in the Canham model for the shape of genus one biomembranes).},

  abstract     = {Building on Mazur‚Äôs 1978 work on prime degree isogenies, Kenku determined in 1981 all possible cyclic isogenies of elliptic curves over $\mathbb {Q}$. Although more than 40 years have passed, the determination of cyclic isogenies of elliptic curves over a single other number field has hitherto not been realised. In this paper we develop a procedure to assist in establishing such a determination for a given quadratic field. Executing this procedure on all quadratic fields $\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt {d})$ with $|d| &lt; 10^4$ we obtain, conditional on the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis, the determination of cyclic isogenies of elliptic curves over $19$ quadratic fields, including $\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt {213})$ and $\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt {-2289})$. To make this procedure work, we determine all of the finitely many quadratic points on the modular curves $X_0(125)$ and $X_0(169)$, which may be of independent interest.},

The sampling points used in several approaches are (1) structured points connected with fast algorithms or (2) unstructured points coming from, e.g., an initial random draw to achieve an improved information complexity. We connect both approaches and propose a subsampling of structured points in an offline step. In particular, we start with quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) points with inherent structure and stable $L_2$ reconstruction properties. The subsampling procedure consists of a computationally inexpensive random step followed by a deterministic procedure to further reduce the number of points while keeping its information. In these points functions (belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of bounded functions) will be sampled and reconstructed from whilst achieving state of the art error decay. Our method is dimension-independent and is applicable as soon as we know some initial quadrature points. We apply our general findings on the $d$-dimensional torus to subsample rank-1 lattices, where it is known that full rank-1 lattices lose half the optimal order of convergence (expressed in terms of the size of the lattice). In contrast to that, our subsampled version regains the optimal rate since many of the lattice points are not needed. Moreover, we utilize fast and memory efficient Fourier algorithms in order to compute the approximation. Numerical experiments in several dimensions support our findings.},

In this paper, we deal with an analogous problem in optical diffraction tomography. Based on the Fourier diffraction theorem, we show that rigid motions of the object, i.e., rotations and translations, can be determined by detecting common circles in the Fourier-transformed data. We introduce two methods to identify common circles. The first one is motivated by the common line approach for projection images and detects the relative orientation by parameterizing the common circles in the two images. The second one assumes a smooth motion over time and calculates the angular velocity of the rotational motion via an infinitesimal version of the common circle method. Interestingly, using the stereographic projection, both methods can be reformulated as common line methods, but these lines are, in contrast to those used in cryo-EM, not confined to pass through the origin and allow for a full reconstruction of the relative orientations. Numerical proof-of-the-concept examples demonstrate the performance of our reconstruction methods.},

The first one is constructed based on the classical theory of orthogonal polynomials and its nodes and weights can be computed efficiently by using tools of numerical linear algebra. An interesting connection between the quadrature nodes and the Legendre points is proved and it is shown that the rate of convergence of this rule depends solely on the regularity of the non-oscillatory part of the integrand. The second one is constructed with respect to a sign-changing function and the classical theory of Gaussian quadrature cannot be used anymore. We explore theoretical properties of this Gaussian quadrature, including the trajectories of the quadrature nodes and the convergence rate of these nodes to the endpoints of the integration interval, and prove its asymptotic error estimate under suitable hypotheses. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite decades of practice, finite-size errors in many widely used electronic structure theories for periodic systems remain poorly understood. For periodic systems using a general Monkhorst-Pack grid, there has been no comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the finite-size error in the Hartree-Fock theory (HF) and the second order M√∏ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), which are the simplest wavefunction based method, and the simplest post-Hartree-Fock method, respectively. Such calculations can be viewed as a multi-dimensional integral discretized with certain trapezoidal rules. Due to the Coulomb singularity, the integrand has many points of discontinuity in general, and standard error analysis based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula gives overly pessimistic results. The lack of analytic understanding of finite-size errors also impedes the development of effective finite-size correction schemes. We propose a unified analysis to obtain sharp convergence rates of finite-size errors for the periodic HF and MP2 theories. Our main technical advancement is a generalization of the result of Lyness [Math. Comp. 30 (1976), pp. 1‚Äì23] for obtaining sharp convergence rates of the trapezoidal rule for a class of non-smooth integrands. Our result is applicable to three-dimensional bulk systems as well as low dimensional systems (such as nanowires and 2D materials). Our unified analysis also allows us to prove the effectiveness of the Madelung-constant correction to the Fock exchange energy, and the effectiveness of a recently proposed staggered mesh method for periodic MP2 calculations (see X. Xing, X. Li, and L. Lin [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17 (2021), pp. 4733‚Äì4745]). Our analysis connects the effectiveness of the staggered mesh method with integrands with removable singularities, and suggests a new staggered mesh method for reducing finite-size errors of periodic HF calculations.},

First, we prove an $L^2$-estimation between two SVEs with different kernels, which provides a quantification of the error between the SVE and any multifactor Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) approximation. For the particular rough kernel case with Hurst parameter lying in $(0,1/2)$, we propose various approximating multifactor kernels, state their rates of convergence and illustrate their efficiency for the rough Bergomi model. Second, we study a Euler discretization of the multifactor SDE and establish a convergence result towards the SVE that is uniform with respect to the approximating multifactor kernels. These obtained results lead us to build a new multifactor Euler scheme that reduces significantly the computational cost in an asymptotic way compared to the Euler scheme for SVEs. Finally, we show that our multifactor Euler scheme outperforms the Euler scheme for SVEs for option pricing in the rough Heston model.},

By induction on iterations used in the algorithm, we theoretically show that the proposed discrete solution converges to the underlying continuous solution as the grid becomes finer. Furthermore, we generalize our algorithm to mean-field game problems and accelerate it using multilevel and multigrid strategies. We conduct comprehensive numerical experiments to confirm the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, to show its efficiency and mass preservation property by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods, and to illustrate its flexibility for handling various mean-field variational problems.},

It is known that the smallest $2$-, $3$- and $4$-chromatic oriented graphs have $3$, $7$ and $11$ vertices, respectively. In 1994, Neumann-Lara conjectured that a smallest $5$-chromatic oriented graph has $17$ vertices. We solve this conjecture and show that the correct order is $19$.},

  abstract     = {We present a revisit of the seeds algorithm to explore the semigroup tree. First, an equivalent definition of seed is presented, which seems easier to manage. Second, we determine the seeds of semigroups with at most three left elements. And third, we find the great-grandchildren of any numerical semigroup in terms of its seeds. The the right-generators descendant (RGD) algorithm is the fastest known algorithm at the moment. But if one compares the originary seeds algorithm with the RGD algorithm, one observes that the seeds algorithm uses more elaborated mathematical tools while the RGD algorithm uses data structures that are better adapted to the final C implementations. For genera up to around one half of the maximum size of native integers, the newly defined seeds algorithm performs significantly better than the RGD algorithm. For future compilators allowing larger native sized integers this may constitute a powerful tool to explore the semigroup tree up to genera never explored before. The new seeds algorithm uses bitwise integer operations, the knowledge of the seeds of semigroups with at most three left elements and of the great-grandchildren of any numerical semigroup, apart from techniques such as parallelization and depth first search as wisely introduced in this context by Fromentin and Hivert [Math. Comp. 85 (2016) pp. 2553‚Äì2568]. The algorithm has been used to prove that there are no Eliahou semigroups of genus $66$, hence proving the Wilf conjecture for genus up to $66$. We also found three Eliahou semigroups of genus $67$. One of these semigroups is neither of Eliahou-Fromentin type, nor of Delgado‚Äôs type. However, it is a member of a new family suggested by Shalom Eliahou.},

In this article, assuming a well-known conjecture of Flynn, Poonen, and Schaefer [Duke Math.

In order to prove it, we need to determine the set of rational points on a specific non-hyperelliptic curve $C$ of genus $4$ defined over $\mathbb {Q}$. We use Chabauty‚Äôs method, which requires us to determine the Mordell-Weil rank of the Jacobian $J$ of $C$. We give two proofs that the rank is $1$: an analytic proof, which is conditional on the BSD rank conjecture for $J$ and some standard conjectures on L-series, and an algebraic proof, which is unconditional, but relies on the computation of the class groups of two number fields of degree $12$ and degree $24$, respectively. We finally combine the information obtained from both proofs to provide a numerical verification of the strong BSD conjecture for $J$.},

  abstract     = {For a single matrix (operator) it is well-known that the spectral gap is an important quantity, as well as its estimate and computation. Here we consider, for the first time in the literature, the computation of its extension to a finite family of matrices, in other words the difference between the joint spectral radius (in short JSR, which we call here the first Lyapunov exponent) and the second Lyapunov exponent (denoted as SLE). The knowledge of joint spectral characteristics and of the spectral gap of a family of matrices is important in several applications, as in the analysis of the regularity of wavelets, multiplicative matrix semigroups and the convergence speed in consensus algorithms. As far as we know the methods we propose are the first able to compute this quantity to any given accuracy. For computation of the spectral gap one needs first to compute the JSR. A popular tool that is used to this purpose is the invariant polytope algorithm, which relies on the finiteness property of the family of matrices, when this holds true. In this paper we show that the SLE may not possess the finiteness property, although it can be efficiently approximated with an arbitrary precision. The corresponding algorithm and two effective estimates are presented. Moreover, we prove that the SLE possesses a weak finiteness property, whenever the leading eigenvalue of the dominant product is real. This allows us to find in certain situations the precise value of the SLE. Numerical results are demonstrated along with applications in the theory of multiplicative matrix semigroups and in the wavelets theory.},

The proposed method builds on a classical subspace decomposition into a coarse subspace, realized as the restriction of a finite element space to the nodes of the spatial network, and localized subspaces with support on mesh stars. The main contribution of this work is the convergence analysis of the proposed method. The analysis translates results from finite element theory, including interpolation bounds, to the spatial network setting. A convergence rate of the PCG algorithm, only depending on global bounds of the operator and homogeneity, connectivity and locality constants of the network, is established. The theoretical results are confirmed by several numerical experiments.},

We establish first that the new flux satisfies sufficient properties ensuring the convergence of the associate finite volume scheme, while respecting the maximum principle. Then, we pay attention to the long time behavior of the scheme: we show relative entropy decay properties satisfied by the new numerical flux as well as by the generalized Scharfetter-Gummel flux. The proof of these properties uses a generalization of some discrete (and continuous) log-Sobolev inequalities. The corresponding decay of the relative entropy of the continuous solution is proved in the appendix. Some 1D numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.},

The proof relies on the analysis of a dual elliptic problem with a discontinuous coefficient matrix arising from the isoparametric finite elements. Therefore, the standard $H^2$ elliptic regularity which is required in the proof of the weak maximum principle in the literature does not hold for this dual problem. To overcome this difficulty, we have decomposed the solution into a smooth part and a nonsmooth part, and estimated the two parts by $H^2$ and $W^{1,p}$ estimates, respectively. As an application of the weak maximum principle, we have proved a maximum-norm best approximation property of the isoparametric finite element method for the Poisson equation in a curvilinear polyhedron. The proof contains non-trivial modifications of Schatz‚Äôs argument due to the nonconformity of the iso-parametric finite elements, which requires us to construct a globally smooth flow map which maps the curvilinear polyhedron to a perturbed larger domain on which we can establish the $W^{1,\infty }$ regularity estimate of the Poisson equation uniformly with respect to the perturbation.},
