  abstract     = {Recent advancements in autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) and visible light communication (VLC) can revolutionize indoor networks in the era of 6G, offering benefits, such as high accuracy, cost-effectiveness, power efficiency, and improved security. However, VLC-enabled indoor networks face several deployment challenges, including line-of-sight disruptions caused by dynamic obstacles, such as human obstacles and UAVs operating within an indoor area. These dynamic obstacles in the 3-D space can lead to a nonuniform distribution of the received power across the indoor area, adversely impacting the quality of service for indoor users. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the performance of VLC-enabled indoor networks in the presence of dynamic blockages. This analysis is essential to effectively mitigate the impact of dynamic obstacles and enhance the performance and reliability of indoor networks. This letter provides a performance analysis of VLC-enabled indoor networks for multiple light-emitting-diode configurations in the presence of various blockages, where the blockages (both humans and UAVs) can pause during movement for different pause times. Based on the provided analysis, we develop a model to calculate the blockage probability in indoor networks, and the bit-error-rate performance with varying blockage density is analyzed.},

  abstract     = {In signals of opportunity (SOPs)-based positioning utilizing low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, ephemeris data derived from two-line element files can introduce increasing error over time. To handle the erroneous measurement, an additional base receiver with a known position is often used to compensate for the effect of ephemeris error when positioning the user terminal (UT). However, this approach is insufficient for long baseline (distance between base receiver and UT) as it fails to adequately correct Doppler shift measurement errors caused by ephemeris inaccuracies, resulting in degraded positioning performance. Moreover, the lack of clock synchronization between the base receiver and UT exacerbates erroneous Doppler shift measurements. To address these challenges, we put forth a robust double-difference Doppler shift-based positioning framework, coined 3DPose, to handle the clock synchronization issue between the base receiver and UT, and positioning degradation due to the long baseline. The proposed 3DPose framework leverages double-difference Doppler shift measurements to eliminate the clock synchronization issue and incorporates a novel ephemeris error correction algorithm to enhance UT positioning accuracy in case of the long baseline. The algorithm specifically characterizes and corrects the Doppler shift measurement errors arising from erroneous ephemeris data, focusing on satellite position errors in the tangential direction. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct comparative analyses across three different scenarios, contrasting its performance with the existing differential Doppler positioning method. The results demonstrate that the proposed 3DPose framework achieves an average reduction of 90% in 3-dimensional positioning errors compared to the benchmark algorithm.},

Considering the practical implementation of a remote radio unit (RRU) and the nonreciprocity of downlink–uplink channels due to RCEs and LO phase drift, we model the downlink channel with a random phase rotation. Then, we study the system-level performance of both centralized and distributed CF-mMIMO architectures with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding schemes. We derive the closed-form expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the downlink precoding schemes, and obtain the closed-form expressions for the average spectral efficiency (SE) per user with locations of both RRU and user equipment (UE) following the Poisson point process. Simulation results show that the closed-form expressions are accurate when compared with Monte Carlo results. The results demonstrate that the impact of RCEs and LO phase drift on system performance is more severe for centralized ZF precoding than for MRT and distributed ZF precoding. In addition, we reveal the SE performance concerning antenna configuration of RRU, RRU density, UE density, and LO phase drift range.},

Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) attracts considerable attention and is expected to be employed in antijamming systems for secure transmission to significantly enhance the antijamming performance. However, active RIS introduces external power load, which increases the complexity of hardware and restricts the flexible deployment of active RIS. To overcome these drawbacks, we design an innovative self-sustainable structure in this article, where the active RIS is energized by harvesting energy from base station signals through the time dividing based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer scheme. Based on the above structure, we develop the BS harvesting scheme based on joint transmit and reflecting beamforming with the aim of maximizing the achievable rate of active RIS-assisted system, where the alternating optimization algorithm based on stochastic successive convex approximation tackles the nonconvex optimization problem in the scheme. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of our developed BS harvesting scheme, which can attain higher antijamming performance than other schemes when given the same maximum transmit power.},

To enhance spectral efficiency and mitigate latency caused by control signaling, we propose a grant-free nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. Packet duplication with frequency diversity (PDFD) is utilized to ensure reliability. The distributed antenna system (DAS) is deployed to further mitigate interdevice interference for URLLC in industrial automation scenarios. With the proposed scheme and antenna configuration, we jointly optimize the uplink and downlink bandwidth assignment and delay components to minimize the total spectrum consumption under the QoS requirements of end-to-end URLLC. A two-step method is then proposed to find the globally optimal solution. In addition, we expand our framework to block segmentation with independent coding mechanism for comparison with PDFD and validate the spectral efficiency superiority of PDFD. Simulation results show the spectral efficiency gain of the two-step method under our proposed schemes, indicating that NOMA integrated with DAS is superior for URLLC with massive devices.},

In addition, the logistic support, which is another key aspect of any combat is incorporated. Given the interdependencies among the layers considering logistic support and cross-domain synergy, importance measure-based malicious attack model is proposed to reflect the intensive dynamics and high uncertainties under modern combat environment.

To thoroughly explore the effects of the caching parameter and the IN parameters on the network performance, we focus on the analysis of not only the successful transmission probability (STP) but the link reliability distribution. First, the expression for the STP of each IN scheme is derived. Then, for the link reliability analysis of each IN scheme, an approximation for the SIR metadistribution is obtained by deriving the first and second moments of an upper bound of the link reliability and utilizing the beta distribution, and an approximated expression for the variance of link reliability is also derived. With this analytical framework, we compare the performance of these two IN schemes and gain some useful system design guidelines from the perspectives of STP and the link reliability distribution.},

  abstract     = {This article premises the notion of portraying a smart city energy infrastructure (SCEI) from a people-centric bottom-up view. This is concluded by a system of systems approach in which the coordinated collections of autonomous microenergy hubs construct macroenergy hubs as SCEI in a decentralized manner. Moreover, a reliability-oriented framework is introduced, complying with the performance requirement of customer satisfaction from the people-centric view. Since electric energy as a unique commodity is traded within a continuously operated system, reliability becomes an objective from the start of the planning process (i.e., reliability-oriented planning) while still achieving the performance (technical and quality) requirements demanded nowadays. Hence, the proposed reliability-oriented framework tends to improve customer interruption cost and cost of energy not supplied in the objective function, as well as the Electrical energy index of reliability (EEIR) and system average interruption frequency index as indices for both heat and electrical loads. In the proposed framework, all constituent systems collaborate to create a more functional and reliable SCEI, while each independent system intends to increase its benefit. Furthermore, the proposed framework is formulated as a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming planning problem. This bilevel formulation suffers from nonconvexity in its lower level problem. Therefore, it is transformed into a single-level problem through binary constraint relaxation and primal–dual reformulation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by implementing it to the Dättwil district (Switzerland) as a real urban case study system. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach due to considerable improvement in reliability performance (5.2% in EEIR, 95% in electrical system average interruption frequency index, 0.1% in heat energy index of reliability (HEIR), and 56% in heat system average interruption frequency index), SCEI-to-grid performance (81% in export to import ratio), and sustainability performance (77.8% in emission and 4.8% in energy loss).},

In particular, it is assumed that an RIS is near the transmitter vehicle and another RIS is close to the receiver vehicles to provide a wider smart radio environment. Besides, we suppose that the channels between two RISs suffer from the Fisher–Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ fading model. Under this scenario, we first provide the marginal distributions of equivalent channels at the legitimate receiver vehicles by exploiting the central limit theorem. Then, in order to evaluate the PLS performance of the considered system model, we derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy outage probability, and secrecy energy efficiency by using the Gauss–Laguerre quadrature and the Gaussian quadrature techniques. Moreover, to gain more insights into the secrecy performance, the asymptotic expression of the ASC is obtained. The numerical results indicate that incorporating the dual RIS in the secure V2V communication under the NOMA scheme can significantly provide ultrareliable transmission and guarantee more secure communication for intelligent transportation systems.},

To prevent potential eavesdropping, multiple friendly jammers are employed to disrupt the reception process of the eavesdropper by artificial noise. Within this setting, we then derive the closed-form expressions of the outage probability (OP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) of the considered system in the presence of imperfect channel state information. Important to mention is the fact that in complex systems (e.g., with multiple jammers, multiple relays, and considering the independent but nonidentically distributed Rician nature of satellite links), analytical approaches may not be effective due to their complex mathematical derivations. As such, we develop a highly effective yet low-complexity deep learning approach to estimate the OP and SOP of the system. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the OP and SOP of the system in various settings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Interestingly, the proposed deep learning method can achieve comparable performance to that of the analytical approach.},

Even with constituent systems (CS) interfaces documentation, achieving such links is a difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone task that requires attention from CS developers, especially if it is performed manually. In order to contribute to this task, we propose Agape, a semiautomatic method using syntactic similarity analysis of API attributes to identify potential CS connection points. We implemented the AgapeTool tool based on the method and performed two-fold evaluations. In the preliminary evaluation, we executed a controlled experiment to evaluate the performance of AgapeTool and empirically define the best similarity algorithms and thresholds for the task of identifying connection points between two well known API. In the evaluation, we use AgapeTool in two cases involving four CS API from a SoIS of a global computer manufacturer. Then, we conducted semistructured interviews with five experienced developers of the target SoIS to evaluate the outcomes. In practice, the results reveal that AgapeTool is effective in both environments, and API syntactic similarity analysis is efficient for identifying CS interoperability links. From a research point, the combination of syntactic and semantic analyzes looks promising for more accurate and reliable results.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel hybrid time-domain and direct stability method for rotor-angle stability assessment, aiming to improve the efficiency of existing approaches. The proposed method enables faster detection of both small-signal and transient stability scenarios while extending the applications of the classical stability direct methods to multiswing stability analysis. Unlike the conventional direct methods that rely on the overall system energy, the proposed approach calculates the system&#39;s critical energy using the critical apparatus energies, facilitating multiswing stability analysis. Key contributions of this work include the introduction of a new metric, termed “the time to instability,” which allows for the prediction of separation or islanding areas during disturbances. Additionally, the proposed method can rank all apparatus in a power system based on their criticality during small or large disturbances. Also, a stopping condition for the time-domain simulation is provided, reducing algorithm execution time and rendering it suitable for real-time or near-real-time application of dynamic security assessment. The proposed method is tested with multiple stability scenarios and the four possible stability scenarios are presented in this article using the IEEE 16-machine 68-bus power system. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed approach in identifying the critical apparatus and assessing first- and multirotor-anglestability in power systems.},

First, PIOs concerning state and disturbance are designed, respectively. Then, a double event-triggered mechanism is presented: One is used to reduce the communication frequency between agents and their observers and the other one is used to reduce the communication frequency between agents and the corresponding control protocols. Moreover, a novel consensus framework is constructed for the systems by introducing a set of new variables, where an additional constant term is added to error dynamics. By constructing a copositive Lyapunov function, the positivity and stability of the systems are reached under the designed proportional integral state and disturbance observers. The gain matrices of the observers and control protocols are formulated via a matrix decomposition technique and computed in terms of linear programming. Finally, one example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm.},

For each agent, a novel distributed observer is proposed under the event-triggered mechanism to estimate other agents&#39; states, eliminating the necessity for real-time information from other agents. In addition, the hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developed, which can reduce the frequency of communication between agents. Furthermore, a leader-following consensus protocol is constructed under the proposed event-triggered mechanism to ensure that all followers will track the trajectory of the leader. Moreover, the protocol is updated discontinuously, reducing computation costs for the systems. An example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.},

The attacks aim at compromising the integrity of market operations by causing profit/loss to a targeted utility/consumer. Injection of false data on sensor measurement allows for maliciously controlling the locational marginal price (LMP) through the state variable. In this work, we propose a false data injection attack (FDIA) on the market operation with the objectives of maximally deviating the LMP and minimizing the attack budget. Considering the conflict between the two objectives, a tradeoff approach based on multiobjective optimization has been proposed. The solution derived postconvergence of the optimization problem provides a set of solutions (Pareto-front), each pertaining to bus locations on which FDIA can be carried out. The solution allows an intruder to design an FDIA based on the priority assigned between market disruption and attack budget. For a given budget for launching an attack, the Pareto-front provides the optimal FDIA configuration for which the deviation in LMP is maximized. To validate the proposed design scheme in practical settings, a real-time testbed is developed involving the cosimulation of the power and communication networks.},

Some previous research methods that were applicable to single-layer networks (such as power networks) are not applicable to current CPPSs. In this article, we first establish an importance evaluation model for the lines in the power network and the nodes in the communication network of a CPPS. Then, the key nodes and lines in the CPPS are evaluated from three perspectives: network information, network properties, and network structure. Two algorithms are proposed, from network information and network property perspectives. Ten indicators are also formulated from a network structure perspective. Finally, the results of analyzing the correlations between indicators under these three perspectives using Kendall&#39;s tau-b show that the important lines and nodes in the different networks are different and that the most effective method of importance evaluation is based on information fusion from the network information perspective. The results also show that the research significance of investigating CPPS network node importance based on a Barabási–Albert communication network is greater than that of analyses based on Watts–Strogatz and Erdös–Rényi networks. The results can provide a good understanding of the operating status of a power system to help reduce the probability of system faults, thereby providing support for future intelligent and autonomous power systems.},

Extensive simulations validate our theoretical analysis under varying system parameters. The findings indicate that the FDR performance is comparable to half-duplex relaying in specific scenarios. However, analytical expressions involve nonelementary functions, posing challenges for real-time configurations. To overcome this hurdle, we adopt machine-learning (ML) models for multioutput performance prediction with short execution time, low computational complexity, and high accuracy. Among the proposed ML frameworks, the extreme gradient boosting model with multi-output regressors proves to be the most efficient estimator.

  abstract     = {The objective of virtual machine placement in cloud data centers is to optimize resource allocation, which directly impacts the adherence to service level agreements (SLAs). Existing virtual machine placement strategies have achieved some success in reducing SLA violations through various approaches such as load balancing and minimizing host overloads. However, SLA compliance is influenced by multiple factors. Based on heuristic principles, this article fully considers various factors affecting SLA violations and proposes the HLEM-VMP virtual machine placement strategy. This strategy employs a greedy method to determine the placement of virtual machines by filtering and scoring physical hosts. We conducted comprehensive comparative experiments using the Cloudsim simulator with Planetlab and random workloads against classical algorithms such as EPSO, AFED-EF, and HS3MC-3MIN-1.5. The results show that HLEM-VMP not only significantly reduces SLA violations but also performs excellently on the combined index ESV. Building on this, we further propose the General-HLEM (G-HLEM) model, which allows for a tradeoff between energy consumption and SLA violations, thereby enhancing the model&#39;s generalizability. Experiments in three typical application scenarios demonstrate that G-HLEM can meet the needs of different scenarios and outperforms methods like EPSO, AFED-EF, and HS3MC-3MIN-1.5 on the ESV index, providing valuable insights for addressing SLA violation issues through virtual machine placement strategies.},

First, for leader UAVs that can readily detect the target, a novel bearing-based estimator devised in a local frame is proposed by following a prediction and correction configuration, while a sufficient condition is established to assure the asymptotic decaying of position estimation error. Second, considering follower UAVs that cannot directly observe the target, a special consensus-based cooperative fusion algorithm comprised of coupled observation and localization subsystems is proposed for UAVs to synchronize the target estimation with neighbors’ localization, wherein a fixed-time distributed observer is delicately constructed to provide target speed estimates, such that the requirements on the global availability of target speed can be avoided. The remarkable merit is that without resorting to GPS, all members can reach an agreement on relative positioning estimates in a distributed execution sense. Lyapunov approach certifies that all errors can exponentially approximate to the origin. Simulations confirm the efficacy of the presented algorithm.},

Federated learning (FL) is a promising technology to protect vehicles&#39; privacy in IoV. Vehicles with limited computation capacity may face a large computational burden associated with FL. Federated edge learning (FEEL) systems are introduced to solve such a problem. In FEEL systems, vehicles adopt the cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) mode 4 to upload encrypted data to road side units&#39; (RSUs) cache queue. Then, RSUs train the data transmitted by vehicles, update the local model hyperparameters, and send back results to vehicles, thus, vehicles&#39; computational burden can be released. However, each RSU has limited cache queue. To maintain the stability of cache queue and maximize the accuracy of model, it is essential to select appropriate vehicles to upload data. The vehicle selection method for FEEL systems faces challenges due to the random departure of data from the cache queue caused by the stochastic channel and the different system status of vehicles. This article proposes a vehicle selection method for FEEL systems that aims to maximize the accuracy of model while keeping the cache queue stable.

To suppress pedestrian positioning errors based on zero velocity update assistance, multisensor collaborative technology provides compensation for errors generated by low-cost inertial sensors. However, traditional multisensor information fusion methods suffer from limited enhancement and insufficient adaptability. In this study, four IMUs are assigned to the foot, shank, thigh, and waist, respectively. According to the periodic characteristics of pedestrian gait, a lower limb kinematic model is constructed. Moreover, based on the kinematic model, the differential constraint relationship equations of the four position vectors of the lower limb are derived. In addition, the attitude information and zero velocity point information characteristics of the foot and waist were analyzed and compared. The optimal waist attitude information and foot zero velocity information are used as observations, and an improved extended Kalman particle filter algorithm based on the foot–waist vector difference constraint is proposed. By real-time correction of foot–waist observation information, a distribution function that is more similar to the real distribution is established. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified for some specific shape trajectories, including 2-D and 3-D trajectories. Experiments have shown that compared with classic single-sensor methods and multisensor collaborative methods, the proposed improved method reduces positioning errors by more than 45% and 34%, respectively.},

Then, we design a multisemantic relation graph between entities and entity pairs, based on which a graph convolutional network is constructed for information reasoning and relation extraction in a relation extraction agent. Next, we introduce an evidence sentence extraction agent to focus on a relevant subset of inputs. Finally, we implement collaboration between two agents in a multiagent collaborative optimization module. Experimental results on three public datasets show that our method outperforms the existing methods in terms of F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall) and IgnF1 (F1 on ignored relations). Specifically, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.91 F1 and 0.65 IgnF1 on DocRED, 1.2 F1 on CDR, and 1.2 F1 on GDA.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has attracted great attention with the gains of spectrum efficiency and deployment costs through the coexistence of sensing and communication functions. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) has great potential to apply to large-scale multiagent systems (LSMAS) in ISAC due to the attractive privacy protection mechanism. Nonindependent identically distribution (non-IID) is a fundamental challenge in FL and seriously affects the convergence performance. To deal with the non-IID issue in FL, a data augmentation optimization algorithm (DAOA) is proposed based on reinforcement learning (RL), where an augmented dataset is generated based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) and the local model parameters are inputted into a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn the optimal number of augmented data. Different from the existing works that only optimize the training performance, the number of augmented data is also considered to improve the sample efficiency in the article. In addition, to alleviate the high-dimensional input challenge in DQN and reduce the communication overhead in FL, a lightweight model is applied to the client based on deep separable convolution (DSC). Simulation results indicate that our proposed DAOA algorithm acquires considerable performance with significantly fewer augmented data, and the communication overhead is reduced greatly compared with benchmark algorithms.},

Many digital healthcare architectures based on large-scale edge and cloud multiagent systems (LSMASs) have recently been presented. The LSMAS allows agents from different institutions to work together to achieve healthcare processing goals for users. This article presents a digital twin large-scale multiagent strategy (DT-LSMAS) comprising mobile, edge, and cloud agents. The DT-LSMAS comprised different schemes for healthcare workflows, such as added healthcare workflows, application partitioning, and scheduling. We consider healthcare workflows with different biosensor data such as heartbeat, blood pressure, glucose monitoring, and other healthcare tasks. We partitioned workflows into mobile, edge, and cloud agents to meet the deadline, total time, and security of workflows in large-scale edge and cloud nodes. To handle the large-scale resource for real-time sensor data, we suggested digital twin-enabled edge nodes, where delay-sensitive workflow tasks are scheduled and executed under their quality of service requirements. Simulation results show that the DT-LSMAS outperformed in terms of total time by 50%, minimizing the risk of resource leakage and deadline missing during scheduling on heterogeneous nodes. In conclusion, the DT-LSMAS obtained optimal results for workflow applications.},

UAVs face constraints such as limited energy, latency requirements, and failure risks, making robust CO approaches essential. Current CO methods often fall short due to high energy consumption, increased latency, and reliability issues in challenging conditions. This work introduces a novel collaborative CO strategy to address these deficiencies. Our approach utilizes a Bayesian network for failure mode effect analysis, considering communication bit error probabilities among multiantenna UAVs. We further employ rating-based federated deep learning to optimize decision-making, determining the best CO destination for each UAV based on factors like positions and resource capacities. Our strategy significantly outperforms existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art methods. It decreases the average probability of critical task failure by 43% and reduces energy consumption by 15% on average ensuring UAV swarms can meet strict constraints in harsh environments. These improvements demonstrate the utility of our approach in enhancing the operational reliability and efficiency of UAV swarms across diverse applications.},

However, the implementation of some complex services requires the collaboration of multiple AI models to handle and analyze various types of sensory data. In this context, the simultaneous scheduling and execution of multiple model inference tasks is an emerging scenario and faces many challenges. One of the major challenges is to reduce the completion time of time-sensitive services. In order to solve this problem, a multiagent reinforcement learning-based multimodel inference task scheduling method was proposed in this article, with a newly designed reward function to jointly optimize the overall running time and load imbalance. First, the multiagent proximal policy optimization algorithm is utilized for designing the task scheduling method. Second, the designed method can generate near-optimal task scheduling decisions and then dynamically allocate inference tasks to different edge applications based on their status and task characteristics. Third, one assessment index, quality of method, is defined and the proposed method is compared with the other five benchmark methods. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can reduce the running time of multimodel inference by at least 25% or more, closing to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {Detection systems based on computer vision play important roles in Large-Scale Multiagent Systems. In particular, it can automatically locate and identify key objects and enhance intelligent collaboration and coordination among multiple agents. However, classification and localization in object detection may produce inconsistent prediction results due to different learning focus. Therefore, we propose a Spatial Decoupling and Boundary Feature Aggregation Network (SDBA-Net) to achieve spatial decoupling and task alignment. SDBA-Net includes a spatially sensitive region-aware module (SSRM) and a boundary feature aggregation module (BFAM). SSRM predicts sensitive regions for each task while minimizing computational cost. BFAM extracts valuable boundary features within sensitive regions and aligns them with corresponding anchors. These two modules are combined to spatially decouple and align the features of two tasks. In addition, a significance dependency complementary module (SDCM) is introduced. It enables SSRM to quickly adjust the sensitive region of the classification task to the significant feature region. Experiments are conducted on a large-scale complex real-world dataset MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014). The results show that SDBA-Net achieves better results than the baselines. Using the ResNet-50 backbone, our method improves the average precision (AP) of the single-stage detector VFNet by 1.0 point (from 41.3 to 42.3). In particular, when using the Res2Net-101-DCN backbone, SDBA-Net achieves an AP of 51.8 on the MS COCO test-dev.},

These channels are utilized in highly mobile networks such as cognitive vehicular networks (CVN). In addition, an eavesdropper aims to intercept the communications between secondary users (SUs). The SU receiver has full-duplex and energy harvesting capabilities to generate jamming signals to confound the eavesdropper and enhance security. Moreover, the SU transmitter extracts energy from ambient radio frequency signals in order to power subsequent transmissions to its intended receiver. To optimize the privacy and reliability of the SUs in a CVN, a deep Q-network (DQN) strategy is utilized where multiple DQN agents are required such that an agent is assigned at each SU transmitter. The objective for the SUs is to determine the optimal transmission power and decide whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time period in order to maximize their secrecy rate. Thereafter, we propose a DQN approach to maximize the throughput of the SUs while respecting the interference threshold acceptable at the receiver of the primary user. According to our findings, our strategy outperforms two other baseline strategies in terms of security and reliability.},

To enhance system performance, we propose to minimize the network energy consumption by jointly optimizing communication and computation parameters. This includes decisions on task offloading, edge caching policies, uplink transmission power, and the processing rates of users. Given the nonconvex nature and high computational complexity of this optimization problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where the three subproblems of caching, offloading, and power allocation are solved in an alternating manner. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showcasing significant reductions in user energy consumption and optimal resource allocation.

In this context, a malware attack on vehicle-to-grid (V2G) communications increases the risk of malware spread among EVs and public EVCSs. However, the existing literature lacks practical studies on malware spread in power-transportation systems. Hence, this article demonstrates malicious traffic injection and proposes strategies to identify target EVCSs that can maximize physical malware spread within power-transportation systems. We first show the feasibility of injecting malicious traffic into the front-end V2G communication. Next, we establish a model that reflects the logical connectivity among the EVCSs, based on a realistic framework for large-scale EV commute and charge simulation. The logical connectivity is then translated into a malware spread probability, which we use to design an optimal attack strategy that identifies the locations of target EVCSs that maximize the malware spread. We compare malware spread due to random, cluster-based, and optimal attack strategies in both urban (Nashville) and rural (Cookeville) U.S. cities. Our results reveal that optimal attack strategies can accelerate malware spread by $10\%$ – $33\%$ .},

To cope with the time-constrained DoS attacks, the proposed discrete-time communication scheme combines a periodic communication attempt in the time intervals in presence of DoS attacks, and an event-triggered communication in the time intervals in absence of DoS attacks. Moreover, a dynamic quantization scheme for data transmission is introduced in the distributed control for the stability of the frequency and voltage at the reference. Then, a sufficient stability condition is established for the microgrid and the tradeoff between the communication attempt period and DoS attacks is obtained.

Practical byzantine fault tolerant (PBFT), a voting-based consensus blockchain, is a plausible solution to the wireless network for its distributed and decentralized traits, and it is not computation-intensive. The view change mechanism guarantees the liveness and resilience of PBFT, but it also causes delay. Moreover, spectrum is usually shared in the wireless network, introducing additional channel contention. Hence, we develop a framework investigating the impacts of channel contention on the wireless PBFT network using the IEEE 802.11 protocol. Based on the Markov model, we derive the throughput, transmission success probability, and transaction confirmation delay of such a network. Furthermore, we derive the view change delay in reference to the transaction confirmation delay. The analysis and results show that channel contention impacts in two ways. It impairs the success probability and increases the chance of view change. Optimal pairs of packet arrival rate and contention window size are formulated to maximize the consensus&#39;s success probability without sacrificing the overall network performance. Further, the optimal pairs under different network sizes are demonstrated for straightforward guidance.},

In this article, we consider the transmission delay in wideband communications deteriorated by rapid user movements, where the frequency-selective wideband fading channels become fast time-varying and hence doubly-selective due to the user movements. To preferably allocate the caching resource in such circumstance, we introduce a coordinated caching network and accordingly formulate an allocation problem. However, the formulated problem is shown to be NP-hard. By considering the extremely high computational complexity to solve the NP-hard problem by traditional optimization algorithm, and considering only a few samples can be obtained for each training instance due to shortened coherence-time in the dynamical doubly selective fading channels, we propose a model-agnostic meta-reinforcement learning method to address the formulated problem. Particularly, the proposed method can efficiently recognize the unstable mobile channels and accordingly cache to reduce the overall transmission delay while only requires a few training samples. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and results show that the proposed one outperforms the commonly adopted existing method of deep-deterministic-policy-gradient learning in terms of average delay and cache hit rate.},

  abstract     = {Accurately understanding intentions is crucial in various real-world multiagent scenarios, which helps comprehend motives and predict actions within these contexts. Existing methods tend to either concentrate too much on single agents&#39; isolated characteristics or model complex interactions among multiple agents, failing to adequately address both aspects simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called integrative multiagent behavior prediction framework to systematically incorporate individual features and interagent relational dynamics. Our approach not only models multiagent interactions by learning from visual data, but also integrates mining of imagery and videos to leverage intrinsic invariant and variant qualities of each agent&#39;s extrinsic morphology. Meanwhile, inspired by time -series forecasting, we represent interagent history and connections as seasonal and trend features in time-series patterns, capturing past behavioral influences that are often ignored. We also design an encoder that efficiently learns time-dependencies and concatenates individual invariant–variant feature learning modules with multiagent interaction representations to accurately infer intentions and trajectory predictions. Our approach not only models multiagent interactions by learning from visual data, but also integrates mining of imagery and videos to leverage intrinsic invariant qualities of each agent&#39;s extrinsic morphology (e.g., body shape, color) and variant qualities (e.g., pose, expression, attire). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to current state-of-the-art intention analysis models, our framework improves behavioral prediction performance in multiagent environments.},

However, the space-time-dynamic offloading demands of vehicle users (VUs) can hardly be satisfied only by road side units (RSUs) due to their fixed resource deployment and incomplete coverage. To this end, in this article, we design a multitier IoV system, where RSU, parked cars, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as edge platforms to offer computing services. To fully utilize the multitier resources, the tasks generated by VUs can be split into multiple parts and executed in parallel on local processors as well as edge servers. Under this arrangement, we formulate a joint UAV deployment and partial task offloading problem to minimize the system cost, which includes processing delay, energy consumption, and rental price. We then develop a heuristic UAV deployment method to optimize the coverage of multitier network. Moreover, a distributed task offloading approach based on multiagent deep reinforcement learning is proposed to achieve cooperative decision makings and load balancing, thereby overcoming the adversarial competition among VUs. Experimental evaluations reveal that compared to state-of-the-art schemes that rely on a centralized controller, the proposed approach achieves superior performance with higher implementation efficiency while avoiding extra information exchange overhead.},

  abstract     = {More developed marine sensors for various applications has induced a rapid increase in marine data. The feedback from these marine data becomes challenging due to the backward marine communication techniques. The space–air–ground–sea integrated network (SAGSIN) provides a possible solution to solve this challenge by making use of the advantages of different networks. However, how to coordinate these networks and manage heterogeneous resources to satisfy the communication requirements of different marine applications remains to be solved. In this article, we investigate the resource management problem of SAGSIN for marine applications. A resource management architecture is proposed in which software-defined networking (SDN) controllers are employed. Based on this architecture, heterogeneous resources can be scheduled, and the data from devices with different communication modes can be transmitted via SAGSIN without changing the communication mode of the devices. We further propose two multiagent deep reinforcement learning resource management schemes to help individual devices find optimal access and resource allocation decisions to feed their data back to the terrestrial data centers. The design of these proposed schemes fully considers the scarce communication resources of marine scenarios, which makes data feedback more communication efficient while satisfying quality of service (QoS) requirements. Simulation results show that the improved MA_SDN_Centralized resource management scheme can significantly reduce the blocking probability of the system with guaranteed QoS, while reducing the communication overhead of learning.},

Combining cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can achieve substantial access and uniform coverage, but it also poses challenges on channel state information (CSI) acquisition. Although systems operating in time division duplex can approximate uplink CSI for downlink precoding design, the performance degradation resulting from nonreciprocity is still nonnegligible. This article proposes a calibration method to improve system sum rate of CF-mMIMO-NOMA with nonreciprocal channels. The proposed method exploits the impact of all access points (APs) on achievable rate to provide a prioritization and calibrates the selected APs orderly, finding an optimal compromise between pilot overhead and performance gain. The order and number of calibrated APs can be adjusted according to the parameters including coherence interval, number of users, etc. Based on the calibration method, a power allocation algorithm focusing on maximizing the minimum rate is presented. The nonconvex initial model is transformed into a standard second-order cone programming problem through slack variables for bisection solution. Simulation results validate the importance of calibration and indicate that the proposed method provides enhanced achievable rate with flexibility and adaptability.},

The corresponding achievable rate of our proposed scheme is obtained under fixed coding block length and the receiver&#39;s decoding error probability, and it is shown that channel feedback significantly enhances the achievable rate of the same model without feedback. Then, we extend the above scheme to the same model with an AWGN feedback channel, where a modulo lattice function is applied to mitigate the impact of the feedback channel noise on the performance of the SK-type scheme. Finally, we further extend our proposed scheme to the quasi-static Rayleigh fading RN by using a precoding strategy.

Performing an effective analysis of log information and accurately identifying system fault categories has become a substantial challenge for system administrators. To extract valuable insights from edge device logs more efficiently and ensure system security, we propose an intelligent method for system fault detection and localization. Our approach begins with an analysis of the system&#39;s source code to extract message and fault classification templates. Subsequently, real-time preprocessing of the log stream occurs, employing techniques, such as pattern matching and statistical grouping, to construct a feature vector–matrix. The detection and identification module then discerns abnormal feature vectors, using a fast classification algorithm to categorize these anomalies and determine fault types. The proposed methodology undergoes testing on our edge cloud platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a fault detection and localization accuracy that exceeds 98%.},

Second, to achieve a high-order canonical dynamic consensus and enhance the efficiency of the consensus control strategy, a sliding-mode mechanism is employed to regulate tracking errors. Moreover, we develop an adaptive NN-based fault-tolerant optimal control method by integrating the sliding-mode mechanism with an actor–critic structured RL algorithm.

However, maintaining cohesion with teammates in existing distributed control methods has always been a challenge. To enhance team coordination, we employ a graph-theoretic approach to represent the relationships between agents. Based on this, we design a dynamic target graph algorithm to enhance the coordination among pursuers. The approximate optimal strategies for each agent are solved by utilizing the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations of the system. As solving these equations becomes computationally intensive in multiagent scenarios, we propose a value-based single network adaptive critic network architecture. In addition, we consider scenarios where the numbers of agents on both sides are inconsistent and address the phenomenon of input saturation. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions to prove the system&#39;s stability.

Successful module reuse depends on the ability to mitigate interoperability problems. Over the years, different communities have worked to understand and mitigate these problems leading to different interoperability models, oftentimes tied to particular domains. One important question, tackled in this article, is whether these models can help with the design of CPS. Specifically, this article evaluates a real-world example of a CPS against the levels of conceptual interoperability model (LCIM). The approach followed leverages natural language processing techniques to narrow an initial set of system changes down to a subset of problems, some of which are interoperability problems. This effort enables a comparison between the empirical evidence found and the interoperability model considered. The results obtained show that the observed interoperability problems fit well under the multilevel categories proposed by the LCIM. Furthermore, the LCIM seems to provide a complete description for the interoperability problems found, checking for fit and completeness. A significant impact of the results obtained is the enabling of more focused discussions of the key attributes of said problems and subsequent identification and assessment of the effectiveness of existing mitigation approaches.},

On the other hand, the proposed MRB-IM has a larger capacity but less of an effect on IRI because it only happens between the active MRIS. The optimal combination algorithm is applied to select the best possible RIS combinations for the activation bits in IM. The simulation is done to support the analytical channel capacity based on mutual information and bit error rate. The results show that the proposed system offers higher capacity and a lower bit error rate compared to the conventional MRIS.

The system is divided into multiple dynamically coupled subsystems, each subjected to state and control input constraints due to safety concerns. The overall optimal control problem is decomposed into several local optimal control problems based on the local information of each subsystem, meaning each area designs its own local DEMPC controller. Within this framework, the future state trajectories of neighboring subsystems are estimated from the transmitted information between neighbors. To enhance overall economic benefits, the economic stage cost, including load frequency regulation cost, fuel consumption cost, and wind generation cost, is incorporated into the cost function. Simulation results and analysis under different scenarios demonstrate potential improvements in computational burden, economic performance, and robustness of the designed DEMPC controller.},

Specifically, we propose an optimal transmit antenna selection scheme to exploit the inherent spatial diversity gain for security enhancement. The closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability are derived to facilitate the system performance evaluation. At a more pragmatic level, we consider multiple users in the relay-aided MISO NOMA system and thus propose a user pairing algorithm to perfect successive interference cancellation. The algorithm avoids full search over all users by exploiting two-sided matching and low-complexity greed, thereby reducing the total complexity. Furthermore, aiming to maximize the secrecy rate, we formulate an optimization problem. Hence, the power allocation schemes are developed by jointly considering power limits and rate requirements. The scheme achieves closed-form solutions of power allocation for the data rate requirements of each user. Finally, simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived analysis and the improvement significant in secrecy performance by the proposed algorithm and scheme.},

  abstract     = {Structural dependency, as widely existed in complex engineering equipment, refers to the structural intervention between components so that replacing a component requires the removal of others on its disassembly path. Naturally, it is cost-efficient to cluster maintenance jobs to share disassembly time and reduce system downtime. However, maintenance management by particularly considering the disassembly structure is rarely reported in the literature. To address such deficiency, we propose an innovative dependency-specific maintenance policy, which realizes the global union of “static” scheduled block maintenance (SBM) and “dynamic” opportunistic maintenance (OM). SBM coordinates preventive maintenance jobs in conjunction, which forms the basic policy framework. OM decides which components are opportunistically replaced in case of failure, which fine-tunes the framework to further exploit the dependency. Motivated by the fractal nature of disassembly structure, we develop a dynamic-programming-based optimization approach, which enables: 1) the joint optimization of model parameters in a sequential manner, and 2) an efficient optimization applicable to large-scale equipment. We demonstrate the model through a case study in the maintenance management of high-speed train bogies. The results show that the proposed policy significantly promotes system availability by coordinating replacement intervals within the same disassembly subtree, and effectively reducing downtime by integrating SBM with OM.},

We utilize the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and consider the features of both the power and communication networks to improve the failure prediction accuracy. We use the real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to simulate the power system and make the system more applicable. We evaluate the mechanism&#39;s effectiveness using the IEEE 14-bus system, which results in the XGBoost algorithm achieving a 96.25% prediction accuracy rate in random attacks. We show that RESP can accurately predict the state of a power system in the early stages of failure propagation using real-time data. Furthermore, we show that RESP can identify the initial failure locations, which can aid in further protection plans and decisions.},

Each agent is equipped with a private cost function. The goal is to steer these agents towards minimizing the global cost function, which aggregates their individual costs. Existing literature often leans on known agent dynamics, which may not faithfully represent real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we delve into the DOC problem within a network of linear time-invariant (LTI) agents, where the system matrices remain entirely unknown. Our proposed solution introduces a novel distributed two-layer control policy: the top layer endeavors to find the minimizer and generates tailored reference signals for each agent, while the bottom layer equips each agent with an adaptive controller to track these references. Key assumptions include strongly convex private cost functions with local Lipschitz gradients. Under these conditions, our control policy guarantees asymptotic consensus on the global minimizer within the network. Moreover, the control policy operates fully distributedly, relying solely on private and neighbor information for execution. Theoretical insights are substantiated through simulations, encompassing both numerical and practical examples involving speed control of a multimotor network, thereby affirming the efficacy of our approach in practical settings.},

To solve it, a partitioning approach based on dual-stage agglomeration for Energy Internet is proposed in this article. First, the entropy weight of Energy Internet is proposed to assess the line significance of energy transmission, while establishing a uniform criterion of judgment by considering the energy loss of heterogeneous energy sources. Second, as the first stage of partitioning, the local expansion and boundary detection mechanism is proposed to realize localized node agglomeration and generate small-scale regions while ensuring all nodes contained in subregions. Furthermore, the hierarchical region agglomeration mechanism is proposed as the second stage of partitioning, which can aggregate the generated small-scale regions and improve the quality of the partitioning result based on flexible partitioning. Through the above stages, the proposed partitioning approach improves energy allocation, transmission and global efficiency of Energy Internet. Finally, case studies of an Energy Internet with 171-node are presented to validate the proposed approach.},

ME seeks to flexibly leverage SoS capabilities and dynamically adapt their configuration to meet evolving mission needs. SoS configurations today, however, remain static and are carefully designed to accomplish a mission. The problem we address in this article is developing modeling and analysis techniques for flexible integration and adaptive selection of potential SoS configurations to achieve multiple missions with an overarching agility in the execution space. We propose a foundational framework for ME, complete with semantics and grammar to represent the ME design space (MEDS), along with a set of logical and mathematical modeling approaches that lends the MEDS to robust SoS analytical methods. Specifically, the framework proposes development of a mission-focused ontology and domain-specific language to enable consistent semantic representation of MEDS, which is then logically evaluated for spatial and temporal consistency in forming SoS configurations using set-based design principles and Allen&#39;s interval algebra. The resulting feasible SoS configurations are then evaluated for mission success using graph theory and multiattribute utility theory. The application of the framework is demonstrated on a simplified and notional sense-decide-effect problem for flexibly accomplishing multiple missions with SoS.},

Power allocation for multiple transmitters in such network is a highly tricky problem, since it needs to addresses the issues of complex inter-NOMA system interference, constraints from both public users and covert users, and the optimization of overall network performance. We first conduct a theoretical analysis to depict the inherent relationship between the inter-NOMA system interference and transmit power of transmitters. With the help of the interference analysis, we then develop a theoretical framework for the modeling of detection error probability, covert rate, and public rate in each NOMA system. Based on these results and the constraints from both public users and covert users, we formulate the concerned power allocation problem as a Markov decision process, and further develop multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to identify the optimal power allocation among transmitters to maximize the sum-rate of the overall network. Finally, numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficiency of our RL algorithms for power allocation in multi-NOMA networks.},

  abstract     = {With the phenomenal growth in renewable energy generation, the conventional synchronous generator-based power plants are gradually getting replaced by renewable energy sources-based microgrids. Such transition gives rise to the challenges of procuring various ancillary services from microgrids. We propose a distributed optimization framework that coordinates multiple microgrids in an active distribution network for provisioning passive voltage support-based ancillary services while satisfying operational constraints. Specifically, we exploit the reactive power support capability of the inverters and the flexibility offered by storage systems available with microgrids for provisioning ancillary service support to the transmission grid. We develop novel mixed-integer inequalities to represent the set of feasible active and reactive power exchange with the transmission grid that ensures passive voltage support. The proposed alternating direction method of multipliers-based algorithm is fully distributed, and does not require the presence of a centralized entity to achieve coordination among the microgrids. We present detailed numerical results on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and examine the scalability and convergence behavior of the distributed algorithm for different choice of hyperparameters and network sizes.},

To that end, the secondary user (SU) monitors the primary transmitter (PT) signal, where the RIS plays a pivotal role in increasing the strength of the PT signal at the SU. The spectrograms of the synthesized dataset, including the fourth-generation long-term evolution and fifth-generation new radio signals, are mapped to images utilized for training the state-of-the-art object detection approaches, namely, Detectron2 and YOLOv7. By conducting extensive experiments using a real RIS prototype, we demonstrate that the RIS can consistently and significantly improve the performance of the DL detectors to identify the PT signal type along with its time and frequency utilization. This study also paves the way for optimizing spectrum utilization through RIS-assisted CR application in next-generation wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Edge intelligence has recently attracted great interest from industry and academia, and it greatly improves the processing speed at the edge by moving data and artificial intelligence to the edge of the network. However, edge devices have bottlenecks in battery capacity and computing power, making it challenging to perform computing tasks in dynamic and harsh network environments. Especially in disaster scenarios, edge (rescue) devices are more likely to fail due to unreliable wireless communications and scattered rescue requests, which makes it urgent to explore how to provide low-latency, reliable services through edge collaboration. In this article, we investigate the task offloading mechanism in mobile edge computing networks, aiming to ensure fault tolerance and rapid response of computing services in dynamic and harsh scenarios. Specifically, we design a fault-tolerant distributed task offloading scheme, which minimizes task execution time and system energy consumption through the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce logarithmic ratio reward functions and action masking to reduce the impact of different task queue lengths while accelerating model convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for service failure scenarios, effectively meeting the reliability requirements of tasks while simultaneously reducing system energy consumption and processing latency.},

  abstract     = {Signal clipping is a well-established method employed in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to mitigate peak-to-average power ratio. The utilization of this technique is widespread in electronic devices with limited power or resource capabilities due to its high efficiency and low complexity. While clipping effectively diminishes nonlinear distortion stemming from power amplifiers (PAs), it introduces additional distortion known as clipping distortion. The optimization of system performance, considering both clipping distortions and the nonlinearity of PAs, remains an unresolved challenge due to the intricate modeling of PAs. In this article, we undertake an analysis of PA nonlinearity utilizing the Bessel–Fourier PA model and simplify its power expression through intermodulation product analysis. We mathematically derive expressions for the receiver signal-to-noise ratio and system symbol error rate (SER) for nonlinear clipped OFDM systems. Using these derivations, we explore the optimal system configuration required to achieve the lower bound of SER in practical OFDM systems, taking into account both PA nonlinearity and clipping distortion. The results and methodologies presented in this article contribute to an improved comprehension of system-level optimization in nonlinear OFDM systems employing clipping technology.},

We formulated an optimization problem to jointly optimize the connection scheduling, computing resource allocation, and UAVs&#39; flying trajectories, considering the device offloading priority, to achieve a joint optimization of energy consumption and latency for all IoTDs during a given time period. Subsequently, to address this problem, we employed deep reinforcement learning for dynamic trajectory planning, supplemented by optimization theory and heuristic algorithm based on matching theory to assist in solving connection scheduling and computing resource allocation. To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, we compared it with deep deterministic policy gradient, particle swarm optimization, random moving, and local execution schemes. Simulation results demonstrated that the multi-UAV-assisted MEC significantly reduces the computing cost of IoTDs. Moreover, our proposed solution exhibited effectiveness in terms of convergence and optimization of computing costs compared to other benchmark schemes.},

Sufficient conditions for the existence of observer gains are established by constructing the stochastic Lyapunov function with hidden mode, observed mode, and elapsed time dependencies.

Then, an neural network policy-value iteration approximation algorithm is proposed, which obtains an approximate Nash equilibrium solution of the multiplayer games.

The primary receiver jointly decodes the received signals. The aim is to ensure secure communication for BD while meeting the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the primary system. This article investigates two practical SR systems based on the eavesdropper&#39;s available channel state information (CSI). First, when the full CSI is known, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate of BD by jointly optimizing primary transmit beamforming and power sharing between information and artificial noise (AN) signals. Second, when no eavesdropper CSI is available, it is impossible to determine a secrecy rate expression. Consequently, secrecy communication is achieved by an AN-assisted optimal beamforming scheme where a minimum transmit power is used to meet the QoS constraints of the primary and backscatter systems before utilizing the remaining power for random AN to jam the eavesdropper. Successive convex approximation-based solutions are also obtained for comparison. Simulations verify the key analytical claims, provide nontrivial design insights, and quantify the achievable gains over the relevant benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {With the growing integration of unpredictable renewable energy sources into the grid, achieving power balance has become an increasingly crucial challenge. To address this challenge, demand response has emerged as a promising solution. This article proposes a new demand-side flexible thermostatically controlled loads response strategy framework. Our method employs a hierarchical control framework that covers three layers of control, which consist of the optimization layer, coordination layer, and local control layer. The optimization layer employs a dynamic average consensus algorithm for economic optimization scheduling to maximize the sum of the aggregators&#39; welfare functions. In the coordination layer, power is distributed fairly based on the comfort state, generating reference signals for the local control layer. The local control layer tracks these reference signals and employs integral sliding mode control to suppress the influence of unknown disturbances. The control objectives of the entire framework can be achieved in a fixed time, and the parameters in the framework are heterogeneous. Furthermore, the relationships between controller parameters and tracking performance are derived, and the upper bounds of settling time are estimated. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results through numerical simulations.},

To this end, the energy management problem (EMP) of the S-IES is investigated in this article. In this way, a load demand forecasting strategy with the ensemble learning system model is proposed to predict the energy consumption in a sailing voyage. Moreover, a multiobjective energy management model is constructed to depict the tradeoff between consumption costs and the energy efficiency operation index. Then, a distributed energy management method with the event-triggered mechanism is designed to solve the EMP of S-IES. With this method, each energy participant only needs to receive/send local information from/to its neighbors and achieves discrete-time information communication, eliminating the limitation of communication resources for ships. Rigorous theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the distinct objectives are coordinated and that the effectiveness of the proposed method is guaranteed.},

Aiming at the uncertainty of the user behavior of the traffic network, a charging pile (station) pricing strategy based on stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) is proposed. The equilibrium electricity price of charging pile (station) is formulated to guide the traffic flow and realize the collaborative optimization of the distribution network. Considering the traffic congestion caused by user behavior, a congestion charging policy is proposed to promote static hybrid SUE. Its feasibility is proved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition and variational inequality. In addition, through the introduction of joint pricing center, charging pile (station) electricity price, and congestion charging policy are proposed. Aiming at the uncertainty of system, an enhanced-interval optimal method is established. Finally, the simulation analysis of the power-transportation interconnected system verifies that the congestion charging policy can optimize the unit output, and the enhanced-interval optimal method can solve the uncertain influence, reduce the system cost, and ensure the satisfaction of traffic users.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, researchers and practitioners have focused on Industry 4.0, emphasizing the role of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in manufacturing. However, the operationalization of Industry 4.0 has presented many implementation challenges caused by the inability of available technologies to meet industry needs effectively. Furthermore, Industry 4.0 has been criticized for the absence of focus on the human component in CPSs impacting the concept of sustainability in the long run. Responding to this critique and building on the foundation of the Industry 5.0 concept, this article proposes a holistic methodology empowered by human expert knowledge for human-cyber-physical system (HCPS) implementation. The proposed novel HCPS methodology represents a more sustainable solution for companies that consists of five phases to promote the integration of human expert knowledge and cyber and physical parts empowered by big data analytics for real-time anomaly detection. Specifically, real-time anomaly detection is enabled by industrial edge computing for big data optimization, data processing, and the industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) real-time product quality control. Finally, we implement the developed HCPS solution in a case study from the process industry, where automated system decision-making is achieved. The results obtained indicate that an HCPS, as a strategy for companies, must augment human capabilities and require human involvement in final decision-making, foster meaningful human impact, and create new employment opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Power Internet of Things devices deployed in smart parks have strict time synchronization requirements. However, due to the limited availability of 4-G/5-G, optical fiber, and satellite, how to achieve low-cost, reliable, and efficient time synchronization based on existing power line carrier (PLC) and two-way power frequency automatic communication system (TWACS) integrated multimodal communication has become a key challenge. Motivated by this, a cluster-based time synchronization network structure is proposed that seamlessly integrates PLC and TWACS, which provides an accurate synchronization model by comprehensively considering frequency offset, timestamp recorded error, timestamp jitter error, and transmission delay. Moreover, we incorporate digital phase-locked loop to compensate synchronization error by correcting frequency offset in clusters. The goal is to realize the minimization of the average time synchronization error within clusters. To achieve this goal, we introduce a coalition formation game-based dynamic clustering algorithm (CFG-DC), designed to effectively address the proposed optimization challenge. CFG-DC achieves dynamic clustering with consideration of time synchronization error awareness by performing leave-and-join decision iteratively to maximize synchronization error-based utility function. Simulation distinctly demonstrate the remarkable achievement of CFG-DC in attaining heightened levels of accuracy in time synchronization.},

The multiagent systems are modeled with two-time-scale structures and the parameter changes are assumed to follow semi-Markov jump processes. For multiagent systems with two-time-scale structures, singular perturbed approaches are introduced to separate the coupled slow and fast dynamics of each agent. Then, double-rate sampling mechanisms are adopted for slow and fast dynamics with different evolution rates, and a novel asynchronous event-triggered scheme (AETS) with two independent triggering conditions is proposed. The asynchronous event-triggered scheme based on double-rate sampled-data reduces the transmission of unnecessary data and saves limited bandwidth resources by triggering independently on two time-scales. In addition, a consensus strategy is proposed to assure the multiagent system of achieving consensus with a specified passive performance level. Finally, the simulation example verifies that the asynchronous event-triggered scheme saves about 50% of network resources than the synchronous scheme under the premise of the same control effect.},

  abstract     = {As dominating 6G-standard service, massive ultrareliable low-latency communications (mURLLC) strive to meet the strict requirements of massive users on latency and error rate. Compared with the traditional grant-based random access (GBRA), the grant-free random access (GFRA) allows users to directly transmit data, which avoid heavy signaling overhead and reduce delay. However, pilot collision interference resulting from uncoordinated resource selection in GFRA leads to serious transmission failure, especially in mURLLC scenarios. Therefore, this article proposes an adaptive feedback-aided hybrid random access mechanism based on the advantages of GBRA and GFRA in cell-free networks. In the proposed mechanism, the feedback factors inserted between pilot and data not only make different access policies for massive users in real time, but also achieve an acceptable tradeoff among signaling overhead, access success probability and access delay. The spatial sparsity of cell-free networks is further utilized to solve the pilot collision and improve the successful access probability. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid random access mechanism can improve access throughout with lower signaling overhead and better meet the requirements of mURLLC.},

In a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) network, we consider two scenarios for CCI cancellation. In the first scenario, we assume that both the RIS-base station uplink and downlink direct links suffer from deep fading, i.e., they do not exist. In that case, the CCI minimization problem will be cast as an unconstrained manifold optimization problem. In the second scenario, we assume that the RIS-base station uplink and downlink direct links exist and the RIS controls all the network&#39;s links. In that case, the CCI minimization problem will be constrained by the uplink and the downlink channel gains, and accordingly, a penalty-based approach will be adopted to solve the CCI minimization problem. Our results show that utilizing the RIS can be very effective in minimizing the CCI and achieving a higher downlink rate than benchmark schemes.},

SI can inform and address the emerging interdependencies with BIM processes and technologies in megaprojects. Thus, in this article, we extend the theorizing of SI and BIM for the management of megaprojects in the infrastructure sector. This process involves 1) conceptualizing the complementarity and compatibility of SI and BIM in the management of megaprojects, and 2) offering an integrative framework and model of SI and BIM. Finally, we discuss and highlight this twofold contribution and offer insights into future research.},

  abstract     = {The demand for various types of services is growing rapidly with the development of beyond 5G/6G networks, network slicing (NS) is considered as an effective technology to cope with the multiple services and large traffic demand. In this article, a NS resource allocation optimization algorithm based on multiactor-attention-critic (MAAC) joint with bidding is proposed to guarantee the service satisfaction rate (SSR) while increasing the profit of mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in heterogeneous integrated networks. First, a pricing and bidding strategies are designed for users with different service requirements and service indexes, and the resource allocation is modeled to maximize the sum of utility of all MVNO subjected to MVNO&#39;s pricing and bandwidth constraints accordingly. Second, the optimization problem is analyzed based on the augment Lagrange method, relaxed and has been proved as a convex optimization, and then, the alternating direction multiplier method is adopted to obtain the theoretical upper bound with 32.047 of the network utility. Meanwhile, the gradient descent method with different learning rates is used to accelerate the convergence rate. Third, the MAAC-based algorithm is proposed and the resource allocation procedures are transformed into a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the interactions with multiagent environment are performed accurately. Finally, the simulation results indicate that the network utility of the proposed algorithm can be improved by 25.074% while ensuring the users&#39; SSR. Compared with multiagent deep determination strategy gradient and dueling deep Q network, the network utility by the proposed algorithm can be improved by 6.265% and 39.791%, respectively, up to 27.664, which can be closest to the theoretical upper bound at the greatest extent.},

In multi-RIS-aided communication, the RIS block, comprising a certain number of RIS elements from one or more RIS, is selected to achieve high throughput reliable communication between transmitter and receiver. However, selecting an RIS block when there are multiple RIS and receivers is not trivial due to the large number of candidate blocks. In this article, a novel multiarmed bandit (MAB) framework, which can learn and select the optimal RIS block using focused exploration, is proposed. We provide the theoretical regret bound for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the gain in performance over existing state-of-the-art statistical and MAB approaches via detailed simulation results in terms of rate, ergodic capacity, outage probability, energy efficiency, and received SNR. The proposed algorithm offers 33%–85% lower latency than existing MAB algorithms on various edge platforms. Furthermore, the gain in performance and latency improves with the increase in the number and size of the RIS in the network.},

Toward this aim, a novel periodic-event-driven dynamic quantization algorithm is developed for each sensor node to save bandwidth on wireless channels and improve measurement accuracy. Such a scheme allows the sensors to implement the quantization process in a dynamic manner. In addition, it conducts a remarkable tradeoff between quantization performance and network energy consumption. Subsequently, a sufficient condition is derived in order to obtain the codesign criterion of the estimator and event-driven scheme using a dedicated auxiliary function. Especially, a recursive convex optimization algorithm is proposed to achieve the suitable ellipsoidal estimation constraint. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Edge/fog computing has gained significant popularity as a computing paradigm that facilitates real-time applications, especially in healthcare systems. However, deploying these systems in real-world healthcare scenarios presents technical challenges, among which load balancing is a key concern. Load balancing aims to distribute workloads evenly across multiple nodes in a network to optimize processing and communication efficiency. This article proposes an adaptive load-balancing method that combines the strengths of static and software-defined networking (SDN)-based load balancing algorithms for edge/fog-based healthcare systems. A new algorithm called load balancing of optimal edge-server placement (LB-OESP) is proposed to balance the workload statically in the systems, followed by the presentation of an SDN-based greedy heuristic (SDN-GH) algorithm to manage the data flow dynamically within the network. The LB-OESP algorithm effectively balances workloads while minimizing the number of edge servers required, thereby improving system performance and saving costs. The SDN-GH algorithm leverages the benefits of SDN to dynamically balance the load and provide a more efficient system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an adaptive load-balancing solution that takes into consideration changing network conditions and ensures improved system performance and reliability. Furthermore, the proposed method offers a 12% reduction in system latency and up to 28% lower deployment costs compared to the previous studies. The proposed method is a promising solution for edge/fog-based healthcare systems, providing an efficient and cost-effective approach to managing workloads.},

This algorithm consists of a fixed-time observer and a controller under switching communication topologies, which effectively deal with the existing nonlinearities in the MAS. In the observer design, both the output errors of its own nodes and the neighboring nodes are utilized through weight allocations, making the observer gain easier to be adjusted with a better implementation. Global stability with a fixed time convergence is proven by choosing an appropriate Lyapunov function.

According to the coupling form of optimization parameters in the formulated problem, this problem is first cut into a joint power control and resource (frequency spectrum) partitioning (PCRP) subproblem, a joint user association, and a computation capacity optimization (UACCO) subproblem. Then, we try to design an effective iteration algorithm to attain the solutions to these problems using convex optimization methods.

First, we establish a game model under the expected utility theory (EUT) and the framing effect (FE) of the prospect theory. Second, we analyze the relationship between VC and game model under the EUT and the FE. Third, we propose a relaxed greedy behavioral algorithm, and prove that our proposed algorithm can guarantee that the strategies of all vertices converge to a strict Nash equilibrium under the EUT and the FE.

In this article, an adaptive semi-grant-free (SGF) transmission scheme is proposed for reliable uplink nonorthogonal multiple access systems with enhanced security, in which a ratio-based user scheduling criterion and a hybrid successive interference cancellation technique are employed to suppress the activity of untrusted nodes while ensuring reliable transmission. To evaluate the superiority of the adaptive scheme, a conventional static transmission scheme and a worst-case eavesdropping scenario are used as benchmarks. Simulation results show that the adaptive scheme outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of outage and intercept probability. In addition, the closed-form results of grant-based user&#39;s and grant-free user&#39;s outage probability and untrusted node&#39;s intercept probability are derived.

We primarily address the problem of designing a framework that self-adapts to the optimal slotframe length that best suits the user&#39;s requirements. The framework takes care of all functionalities involved in the correct functioning of the network, while the RL agent instructs the framework with a set of actions to determine the optimal slotframe size each time the user requirements change.

The Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model is used to approximate the nonlinear systems over the true value of the state. A new method is developed for simultaneous distributed cyberattack detection and leader-following consensus control. The method is based on a fuzzy set-membership filtering consisting of two steps: a prediction and a measurement update. An estimation ellipsoid set is found by updating the prediction ellipsoid set with the current sensor measurement data. Two criteria are provided to detect cyberattacks that inject malicious signals into sensor data, communication channel signals, and control signals based on the intersection between the ellipsoid sets. If there is no intersection between the prediction set and the estimation set of an agent at the current time instant, then a cyberattack on its sensors is declared. Control or communication signals of an agent are under a cyberattack if their prediction sets have no intersection with the estimation sets updated at the previous time instant. Recursive algorithms are proposed for solving the consensus protocol and calculating the two ellipsoid sets. Two cyberattack recovery mechanisms are introduced.},

Compared to the existing event-triggered rules, different event-triggered functions are designed for different system models to decrease the amount of calculation and communication, and nonnegative model-depended dynamic auxiliary variables are introduced to further enhance the triggering performance. Based on the event-triggered protocols, the novel distributed model-depended bipartite event-triggered control laws are presented, in which different models correspond to different controller gains to ensure better control performance. By employing the Lyapunov theory and the average dwell time method, bipartite leader-following consensus is guaranteed with a global exponential convergence rate. Besides, the Zeno phenomenon is ruled out. Finally, several numerical examples are performed to validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed theory.},

  abstract     = {Active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has attracted great attention due to the characteristic of changing the propagation channels by amplifying the amplitude and adjusting the phase shift of signals. In this article, we apply the active IRS into a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer multigroup nonorthogonal multiple access system and focus on improving the secure transmission performance. Specifically, from the overall system performance perspective, we first formulate a power minimization problem by jointly optimizing the beamforming at the base station, power allocation coefficient in each group, power splitting ratio at each user, and the IRS matrix. Then, we consider the fairness among users and aim to maximize the minimum secrecy rate (SR). In order to solve these two nonconvex problems, two efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and block coordinate descent are proposed by applying the semidefinite relaxation, successive convex approximation, Schur complement, arithmetic–geometric mean inequality and convex upper bound substitution methods. Through simulations, we verify the convergence of the algorithms. The results show that both the power consumption and minimum SR performance can be enhanced by deploying the active IRS compared to the baseline schemes under passive IRS and random phase shift active IRS aided cases.},

The continuously developing artificial intelligence techniques can be combined with TSN to better adapt the dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to dynamically configure the network to improve its adaptability. Meanwhile, we propose the queuing transmission method in TAS by incorporating transmission windows for different types of traffic, to make resource allocation simpler and more efficient. However, DRL algorithms usually take a lot of time to train, which is contrary to the delay sensitivity of TAS. Hence, we propose an improved DRL algorithm, called preDQN, where the network prediction is used to help the agent explore the environment more efficiently. Experimental validation is carried out in a simulation environment, and the experimental results show that the scheme can significantly improve the resource utilization, reduce the end-to-end delay and packet loss rate.},

However, due to the limited processing capability of a receiver, it is difficult to utilize all the measurements of the available satellites in view when the number of satellites is large. With this motivation, selecting a subset of satellites that are in a good geometry relative to the receiver for precise positioning among a large number of available LEO constellations represents a challenging yet significant problem. Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is a metric that provides useful information about the relative geometry between satellites and a receiver. In this study, we put forth a novel GDOP-based satellite selection algorithm that uses efficient matrix decomposition and update rule. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a GDOP performance close to the optimal exhaustive search-based schemes while greatly reducing the computational complexity. In particular, the computational complexity is verified in terms of flop counts as well as numerical evaluations.},

Specifically, we use the RS to design the precoder for the common part by solving the asymptotic problem. Also, unlike traditional RIS-aided systems, receivers can be positioned on either side of the RIS panel in the proposed system. We derive the sum-rate based on statistical channel state information (CSI) to reduce the signal overhead. Next, we optimize the rate through a projected gradient ascent method algorithm simultaneously with respect to the amplitudes and phase shifts of the STAR-RIS. Simulations show the advantages of the RS strategy compared with the broadcasting strategy in improving the sum-rate. We further evaluate the efficiency of the STAR-RIS system against the traditional RIS-aided system. In our analysis, we employ energy splitting and mode switching protocols to fine-tune the transmission and reflection coefficients of the outgoing and incoming signals.},

To address these limitations, this article proposes a new reconfigurable MPC framework for large scale distributed systems, in which an optimal control problem with a time-varying structure is formulated and solved for each control loop. More specifically, at each time step, a subset of the control inputs is dynamically selected to be optimized by MPC, while the previous optimal solution is applied to the remaining control inputs. A theoretical upper bound on the performance loss, due to the fact that only a subset of inputs is optimized, is then derived to guarantee the worst-case performance. To minimize the performance loss, this upper bound is then used to guide the reconfiguration of MPC, i.e., the selection of control inputs for optimization. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated through case studies, including battery cell-to-cell balancing control and multivehicle formation control. Numerical results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve better control performance than distributed MPC and requires less computation time than conventional centralized MPC.},

This article proposed a novel resilient operating strategy of the IEGS using HCNG to provide fuel support during the emergency. First, a resilient operating model of the HCNG-integrated natural gas system is developed with the consideration of securing the gas quality and safety operation of gas turbines with insufficient gas supply. Different from the operating models formulated for the normal state, both hydrogen and methane injection are considered and their volume fractions are to be optimized in the proposed model. Furthermore, a tractable resilience-oriented operating model is reformulated using appropriate approximation techniques and it is effectively solved using the alternating optimization-integrated alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. Case studies, performed on two test systems, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing the energy crisis-resistance with the proposed strategy.},

First, a novel model of signal-to-interference-to-noise ratio for the multiattacker and multidefender is built. Taking the energy constraints into consideration, the objective of defenders is to minimize the system performance, while the attackers tend to deteriorate it by emitting interference energy. Thus, the optimal channel selection and optimal energy allocation strategies are proposed to answer which channel both of them should choose and how much power both of them should allocate to each channel in a finite time horizon. Second, a two-player zero-sum matrix game is formulated to solve the optimal problem by linear programming and obtain the Nash equilibrium. When the channel parameters are time-varying, a dynamic optimal channel selection problem is considered and a multistage game algorithm is proposed to find the Nash equilibrium. In addition, the designed optimal strategies of both players are demonstrated and analyzed. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this regard, decentralized management along considering operational concerns of the system will be a key factor in running the future multiagent systems. Therefore, this article proposes a decentralized framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers for managing the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in a multiagent distribution system while considering the technical constraints and reliability of the network. This strategy facilitates considering the effects of the network reliability while running the agents’ optimization in a decentralized manner. Respectively, each agent would tend to exchange energy with more reliable agents, which would result in the resilient operation of the network. Moreover, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources is addressed using distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, with the aim of increasing the security of the P2P energy market against communication errors and agents’ misbehavior, an algorithm is developed to identify the existence of a problem in the market convergence as well as how it could be mitigated. Finally, this scheme is investigated on 37 and 69 bus test systems to study its capability in running sustainable energy systems.},

  abstract     = {The signcryption schemes play an important role in keeping the security of information interactions among the devices in cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs). However, the existing schemes based on bilinear pairing have heavy computation and communication costs, making it challenging to deploy to resource-constrained devices (RCDs). Moreover, the most existing aggregate signcryption schemes do not validate the signcryption ciphertext when the data are aggregated by the aggregation device, jeopardizing the security and stability of the CPPSs. To solve these issues, this article explores a novel certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography applied to information interaction among RCDs of CPPSs. First, a lightweight signcryption scheme is proposed to achieve secure information interaction of RCDs. Then, to efficiently discover illegal signcryption in the aggregate signcryption, a method of constructing a 2-D matrix is proposed, which improves the robustness of secure information interaction. Furthermore, the security of the proposed signcryption scheme is theoretically proven by the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and computational Diffie–Hellman problem assumptions, and the scheme is theoretically analyzed to meet the security requirements of RCDs. Finally, experiments are carried out to validate the efficacy and appropriateness of the proposed signcryption scheme.},

In the intermediate nodes, the network coding based on Shannon theory is replaced with a multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In the sink, we trained a NN with the received massage as the input and the original data as the label. The trained NN includes the sublayers, which are the subneural networks in every node.

While existing studies have investigated how reputation evidence influences the overall network structure and cooperative behaviors, they have not extensively examined how variations in reputation evidence affect cooperative dynamics in the bipartite graph consisting of upstream and downstream enterprises. To bridge this gap, our research introduces a novel, reputation-based approach utilizing evidential reasoning theory to assess dynamic environments prone to disruption risk. This improved approach assigns specific weights and reliability to reputation evidence. In this article, we analyze the evolution of cooperation between upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain, considering varied distributions of reputation evidence. We also conduct numerical simulations to evaluate the impact of these reputation distributions on the cooperative evolution of the supply chain network under diverse disruption scenarios, including both direct and indirect risks. Our findings offer insightful guidance for managers to refine their reputation distribution strategies, effectively navigate different disruption risk scenarios, and lessen negative impacts on cooperation. Moreover, our study provides significant implications for partner selection and managing disruption risk in a dynamic and uncertain supply chain network.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is a challenging issue in the transportation field due to its high nonlinearity and complexity. The key to extract valuable information from traffic data is to characterize the spatial and temporal correlations in a proper way, but it is difficult to achieve accurate quantification on these correlations, especially the spatial ones. Since road network in reality follows non-Euclidean geometry, graph convolution network (GCN), a semisupervised neural network for non-Euclidean graph modeling, has widely been applied in traffic forecasting to capture the spatial correlation of traffic flow. However, most of these GCN-based methods use a single definition on spatial correlation, which cannot precisely reflect the complicated association of road network. Meanwhile, the traditional form of graph convolution is the aggregation of neighboring nodes information, which is equal to a smoothing operation. When this operation repeats, the original data gets smoother, and that may lead to oversmoothing problem and the loss of some important characteristics of data. In response to these issues, a novel multiscale graph convolution method is proposed, in which three representations of the spatial structure of road network are defined and integrated through the multihead attention mechanism. Meanwhile, to avoid oversmoothing, the calculation of graph convolution is redefined to fuse the results of graphs with different scales of convolution by trainable adjustment factors. The proposed method is verified by experiments from different aspects.},

The IoT encompasses applications, such as smart healthcare, intelligent transport, and smart homes that need to be connected to various cloud servers. These IoT applications offload their data workloads to the servers for processing and storage. However, existing ICPS paradigms for IoT applications must be rectified due to security, failure, execution, and communication delays. This study proposes an optimal, delay-efficient ICPS paradigm for IoT applications. The research considers task offloading and scheduling problems and presents the evolutionary meta-heuristics offloading scheduling (EMOS) algorithm framework. The EMOS algorithm framework comprises several delay-optimal schemes to address the offloading and scheduling challenges of IoT applications. The primary objective is to execute IoT applications on different nodes while adhering to the specified constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed meta-heuristic reduces local processing delays by 39%, offloading delays by 41%, execution and propagation delays by 40%, failure delays by 43%, and security and migration delays by 50% compared to existing ICPS meta-heuristics.},

The performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cellular systems in terms of coverage and quality of service offered for terrestrial users depends on the number of deployed FBSs, their 3-D location as well as trajectory. While several recent works have studied the 3-D positioning in UAV-assisted 5G networks, the problem of jointly addressing coverage and user data rate has not been addressed yet.

The proposed algorithm is shown to be general for arbitrary MIMO systems, and very robust against brute–force attacks and cryptanalysis techniques. The algorithm relies on the knowledge of the wireless channel statistics between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver through channel reciprocity, which is random and varies every coherence time. Both the transmitter and the legitimate receiver create a permutation vector from the sorted powers of the channel fading paths from each transmit antenna to all receive antennas. The generated permutation vector is used to shuffle the rows of the constellation matrix creating the security key. It is reported that the number of possible combinations is huge, especially for large MIMO configurations, which makes key decryption nearly impossible even with advanced supercomputers. For illustration purposes, several MIMO techniques are considered in this study, including space shift keying (SSK), quadrature SSK, quadrature spatial modulation, and spatial multiplexing.},

In this work, a load balancing aware task selection and migration approach is proposed comprising two algorithms to select and place tasks from multiple overloaded nodes to suitable destination nodes. The Selection algorithm determines the tasks that should be migrated from overloaded nodes. Placement algorithm focuses on finding a near optimal solution by applying modified binary particle swarm optimization. Specifically, the objective is to minimize execution time and transfer time of tasks.

  abstract     = {Renewable energy sources (RESs) are increasingly used to meet consumer demands in microgrids (MGs). However, high RES integration introduces system frequency stability, inertia, and damping reduction challenges. Virtual inertia (VI) control has been recognized as an effective solution to improve system frequency response in such circumstances. Conventional control techniques for VI control, which rely heavily on specific operating conditions, can lead to flawed performance during contingencies due to their lack of adaptivity. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel attitude found on brain emotional learning (BEL) to emulate VI and damping for effective frequency control. The BEL-based controller is capable of quickly learning and handling the complexity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty intrinsic to the MGs, and it operates independently of prior knowledge of the system model and parameters. This characteristic enables the controller to adapt to various operating conditions, improving its robustness. The simulation results across three disturbance scenarios show that the proposed BEL-based controller significantly improves the system&#39;s response. The absolute maximum deviation of frequency was reduced to 0.0561 Hz in the final scenario, marking performance enhancements of 46.62% and 49.04% when compared with the artificial neural network-based proportional–integral control and the standard proportional control, respectively. This underlines the controller&#39;s adaptability and superior effectiveness in varying operating conditions.},

In the face of intermittent and unidirectional communication scenarios, an event-based distributed fixed-time observer is designed, specifically ensuring the exclusion of Zeno phenomena in the analysis. Following this, to economize on the frequency of control input updates, an adaptive event-triggered local control approach rooted in backstepping techniques is put forward, which guarantees practical fixed-time convergence of error signals while precluding Zeno behavior. A key innovation lies in the formulation of a constrained function featuring a shift function, thereby affording a unified framework capable of flexibly addressing CTC without altering the control structure. Simulations are ultimately executed to corroborate the proposed approaches.},

First, by assigning a particular cost function for each isolated subsystem with disturbances, the decentralized control problem is equivalently converted into finding a sequence of optimal zero-sum game schemes. Then, a recurrent neural network-based data-driven model is designed to reconstruct the system, ensuring that the acquired results are applicable in a broad range of contexts. After obtaining the system model, an event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is used to approximate the Nash equilibrium solutions of Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations under a critic architecture. A noteworthy characteristic is that the critic updating laws are designed via an experience replay technology, such that the persistence of excitation condition can be excluded. Finally, all signals of the close-loop system are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov stability theory, and a simulation example is presented to exemplify the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized optimal zero-sum game scheme.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting the potential for aggregation regulation of virtual power plants (VPPs) on the distribution network side to support the frequency regulation (FR) of the main grid is an essential research topic. However, in the process of implementing FR through communication networks, the imperfect communication may affect the rapid power support performance of the VPP. As such, we propose a cyber-physical collaboration based control method. In the physical layer, in order to effectively respond to power regulation instructions, a dispatch-based control strategy is presented according to the adjustment capacity of the VPP. In the cyber layer, a joint spectrum scheduling and relay power allocation method is developed to mitigate the impact of network uncertainty and meet communication demands. Finally, extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

First, in place of introducing a compensator system, the control signals are provided by outputs of the agent and its neighbors at current and a finite number of past sampling instants, which alleviates computational burden effectively. Second, based on these control signals, two novel distributed sampled-data secure control protocols with gain are designed in fixed and switching topologies, which avoids uninterrupted communication and control updates, thereby reducing communication burden and saving system resources. Further, the secure group consensus is achieved successfully meanwhile compensating for replay attacks by the proposed control protocols, the gain control method and the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method.

  abstract     = {Digital twins have gained tremendous momentum since their conceptualization over 20 years ago, as more and more domains discover their value in driving efficiencies and reducing costs, while enabling technologies continue to advance. Originally aimed at product optimization and intelligent manufacturing, the range of applications for digital twins now spans entire complex, often highly interconnected systems such as ports, cities, and supply chains. Despite the increasing demand for sophisticated digital twinning solutions across all domains and scopes, their development is often still constrained by differing definitions, different understandings of their functional scope and design, and a lack of concrete methodology toward implementing a comprehensive digital twinning solution. Although there are already papers that evaluate the capabilities of existing digital twinning solutions on the basis of maturity levels, these usually consider the object to be twinned in isolation and are often domain-specific. With this article we address exactly this gap discussing how interoperability of digital twins can break physical boundaries of an isolated system, enabling system of systems joint optimization. We therefore consider interoperable digital twins to be the most mature twinning platforms, thus, we discuss in detail six digital twin maturity levels, departing from the interrelated contexts of ports, cities, and supply chains. Examples drawn from these domains demonstrate the need for interoperability toward optimizing processes and systems in realistic contexts, rather than in assumed isolation.},

Determining the locations of ATG base stations (BSs) is an important guarantee for efficient ATG communications. To this end, we consider an aircraft-centric ATG network where the aircraft is served by its adjacent ATG BSs. For this scenario, we formulate an optimization problem to determine the best number and locations of ATG BSs, to maximize the average uplink channel capacity. The problem is shown to be discontinuous and nonconvex. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a stochastic subgradient-based method to determine the locations of ATG BSs, followed by an algorithm to further determine the minimum number of BSs that satisfies the communication requirements on the target routes. Due to the nonconvexity of the problem, the solution obtained by stochastic optimization is not unique. To address this issue, we further propose a clustering method to obtain a unique solution for practical implementation. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared with existing ATG BS deployment methods.},

In traditional covert communication, high-gain antennas, signal amplifiers, and multipath transmission methods are commonly used to expand communication distance. However, the current research on covert communication is mostly limited to fixed receivers or fixed detection parties. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a covert communication countermeasure model in which the maximum covert transmission rate is achieved by introducing the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a typical high-flexibility relay under a movable detection party. Specifically, we obtain the optimal detection threshold and its corresponding total error probability through binary hypothesis testing and the monotonicity of the function at first. Then, we derive the optimal expressions for the covert constraint and transmission outage constraint in our model under the optimal detection threshold and total error probability. In addition, we optimize the position of the UAV based on the covert constraint and transmission outage through the Lagrange multiplier method. The numerical results reinforce the validity of our proposed approach and showcase the enhanced performance of the covert transmission rate.},

However, reducing quantization precision also leads to an increase in outage probability. Given the growing significance of ultra-reliable ultra-low latency communications that require high reliability and latency performance, it becomes crucial to explore the tradeoff between outage probability and transmission delay in cell-free massive MIMO systems under low-precision quantization. This study focuses on analyzing the outage probability and delay performance under coarse quantization in an uplink cell-free network. Based on finite-block-length communication, we derive closed-form expressions for the uplink achievable rate of users, as well as theoretical upper and lower bounds for outage probability by using moment matching method. In addition, we model the transmission delay and propose two quantization bit allocation algorithms based on Deep Q-Network and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), respectively, which allows us to jointly optimize the outage probability and transmission delay. Numerical results confirm the correctness of the theoretical derivation and the effectiveness of two intelligent quantization bit allocation algorithms proposed.},

In this article, we introduce a blockchain-based certificateless conditional anonymous authentication (BCCA) scheme specifically designed for IIoT. To optimize the authentication efficiency, BCCA employs elliptic curve design to avoid the relatively time-consuming bilinear pairing operation. Additionally, we introduce a precomputation strategy, allowing users to prepare essential materials in advance, and one-time verification support for batch signatures is applied, thus reducing authentication latency. To further enhance the security, random verification checksums are employed to counter key recovery attack, and a combination of long-term and short-term secrets is used to mitigate temporary secret leakage attack. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme has advantages in both security and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of cyber-physical systems technique has promoted the development of autonomous systems. To perform the distributed task autonomously, this study delves into the problem of distributed resource allocation over second-order multiple autonomous physical systems. It aims to minimize the global cost function while allocating plenty of resources to finite distributed second-order agents. Since exogenous disturbances in the control channel are unavoidable, and the nonlinear dynamical system can more accurately describe the physical behavior of the system, i.e., Euler–Lagrange systems. The nonlinear term in the control channel is considered, including the exogenous disturbances and nonlinear dynamics. Unlike most existing results, the nonlinear term is assumed to be bounded by a known constant. To this end, the bounded nonlinear term is handled using a sign function-based discontinuous nonlinear control scheme. Based on this, a distributed method with an adjustable dual Lagrange multiplier is designed using the modified primal-dual scheme for achieving the optimal allocation result. In addition, its convergence proof is completed in view of the fixed-time stability and the set-valued LaSalle invariance principle. With our designed method, the agent state asymptotically converges to the exact solution for the undirected and weighted-balanced directed connected networks. Last, we adopt some case studies to certify the effectuality of the developed analytical outcomes.},

This article proposes a proactive strategy for improving the operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities of power distribution networks under progressive wildfire conditions. Dynamic heat balance equations are used to characterize the effect of wildfire on the overhead line conductors. The optimal dynamic reconfiguration of the distribution system and the operation of backup generators are considered as tools to minimize the curtailed loads while maintaining the maximum flow of current through the lines within the thermal rating of the line conductors. A mixed-integer conic programming model is adopted to minimize the operation and load curtailment costs. A higher value of lost load is applied to enhance the continuity of the electricity supply to critical loads. The proposed framework is tested under various environmental conditions and wildfire paths using both a modified 33-node network and the practical 83-node Taiwan Power Company&#39;s distribution grid. Results show that the proposed approach enhances proactive decision-making for power distribution system operations and increases the resilience of critical loads to wildfire threats.},

Building on the above advantages of STS, with “on-the-fly” analysis technique addressed, the issue of offline diagnosability verification can be efficiently tackled. A symbolic approach of diagnoser construction is presented based on predicates and predicate transformers. With the BDD representation of predicates, the state space of the diagnoser is compressed and managed such that the occupied computer memory space is greatly reduced. Besides, instead of flattening an STS model to its equivalent monolithic model at first and then constructing the entire diagnoser for such a model, a heuristic on-the-fly algorithm based on the depth-first search, which unfolds the STS model gradually, is proposed for the level-by-level diagnosability analysis.

However, the systematically generated rectified wave components in a conventional direct-conversion interferometric receiver can saturate the receiver in a radio propagation environment comprising multichannel signals in the operating band of interest, which requires power-hungry auxiliary building blocks for compensation. In this work, a balanced detection scheme in a radio frequency/microwave interferometric receiver, for the first time, is devised and presented for implementing a differential acquisition. This method is based on the phase opposition of the local oscillator (LO) driving signal measured between a pair of Schottky diodes. The subtraction of two outputs is set to cancel unwanted rectified signals and improve the desired detected signal quality. A prototype is implemented in the 60-GHz frequency band using a miniature hybrid microwave integrated circuit fabrication process, which can be extended to any frequency band of interest and fabrication technology. The balanced detection scheme shows an excellent suppression of second-order distortions and about 6-dB conversion gain improvement of the detected signals in comparison to a conventional interferometric receiver employing a single-ended detection scheme. The demodulation of several modulated digital signals has been successfully demonstrated, which only requires about 25% of the driving signal power to have a similar error vector magnitude performance as with the single-ended detection scheme when probing an intermediate frequency detected signal.},

Leveraging high-fidelity synthetic electric distribution system data from the SMART-DS project and transportation system data from OpenStreetMap, this testbed models the city of Greensboro, NC down to the household level. Moreover, the methodology and the supporting scripts released with the testbed allow adaption to other areas where high-fidelity geolocated OpenDSS datasets are available. After describing the components and usage of the testbed, we exemplify applications enabled by the testbed via two scenarios modeling the extreme stresses encountered during evacuations.},

  abstract     = {The Class-1 Internet of Things (IoT) device is difficult to protect because of the lack of minimal hardware and extension support. Researchers have proposed several remote attestation schemes to protect IoT devices. However, hardware-assisted remote attestation methods require the support of minimal hardware, which is not suitable for Class-1 IoT devices. And regular software-based methods can only verify the integrity rather than the identity of devices. In this article, we propose a new identity authentication scheme for Class-1 IoT devices based on clock skew, achieving not only identity authentication but also device integrity verification. The formal verification results by employing the Tamarin tool show that our protocol achieves mutual authentication, man-in-the-middle attack resistance, replay attack resistance, and counterfeit attack resistance. And the proposed authentication protocol is evaluated on a small cluster of Arduino Mega boards, achieving 100% accuracy of identification. Our work combines remote attestation and device fingerprint and is fit for Class-1 IoT devices.},

To this end, this article develops an adaptive vibration controller to reject unknown disturbances and achieve vibration suppression. The proposed controller is equipped with a novel network of cooperative boundary disturbance observers, and each observer in the network transmits the estimated disturbance information. The cooperation among the observers in the network guides to achieve observation consensus. Moreover, based on the proposed disturbance observer network, a new antivibration adaptive boundary controller is developed, and the closed-loop stability is proved based on Lyapunov theory. In addition, it is also shown theoretically that the proposed controller is robust to unknown spatiotemporally distributed load. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical simulation examples are carried out, and the application on a marine riser system is studied to further show the strength of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a cognitive wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) (C-WPCN), which overlays to a primary peer-to-peer communication link and constitutes a hybrid access point (HAP) with multiple antennas. The HAP first transmits wireless power to an array of wireless devices (WDs) with low-power consumption and then receives sensing data from these WDs. In particular, user cooperation is proposed among the cluster of WDs to enhance the throughput fairness. We consider that the HAP assists primary transmission by cooperatively transmitting the primary message, and at the same time cancels the interference from the primary transmission. However, the mutual interference between the WDs and the primary link cannot be fully mitigated. To guarantee throughput fairness and protect the primary communication link, the minimum achievable data rate among the WDs (max–min throughput) is maximized under a primary rate constraint by optimizing the C-WPCN&#39;s transmission time allocation. To settle this nonconvex issue, a high-efficiency algorithm is put forward on the ground of the technique of sequential convex approximation. Furthermore, we run simulations in real network settings and the simulation results prove that our proposed approach can validly raise the secondary WPCN&#39;s throughput fairness under a constraint of primary rate.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing in intelligent transportation systems is a new data acquisition mode that utilizes vehicles to sense a changing traffic environment, where incentive mechanisms play a vital role in motivating vehicles to participate. Nevertheless, existing incentive mechanisms do not simultaneously consider enhancing the efficiency of task allocation, maximizing the benefits of the entire system, and balancing various costs. Therefore, a two-stage incentive mechanism, considering task aggregation, is designed to maximize the benefits of vehicles and the platform. In the first stage, each vehicle, utilizing the multiagent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, dynamically adjusts its path selection strategy to maximize its net income and then uploads the selected path information to the platform. In the second stage, this platform solves an NP-hard problem of maximizing satisfaction by combining the bid price, time consumption, and task coverage to assign tasks to the appropriate vehicles. In particular, vehicle satisfaction is measured by the analytic hierarchy process, and rewards are allocated accordingly. The proposed mechanism is compared with the state-of-the-art method, the greedy, random, and optimal algorithms. Experiments on the real trajectory dataset manifest that the proposed mechanism can fully use the platform budget to achieve the best net income, platform satisfaction, and task completion rate.},

This involves formulating the relay node placement (RNP) problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and employing the multi-objective lexicographic method (MOLM) to solve it. To achieve the optimal solution, the MOLM consists of two steps. First, the problem of lifetime maximization is tackled to find RNP solutions. This transforms the RNP into a nonconvex optimization problem, which is then converted into a convex programming equivalent. The proposed method has the same computational complexity as previous relay-node adjustment (RA) and difference convex algorithm (DCA) methods. The second step introduces a novel relay-node selection to reach the optimal number of relays. Simulation results demonstrate that it has superior network lifetime and efficiency compared with RA and DCA.},

Considering that the traditional stealthy attacks may lose their stealthiness in the presence of detectors with accumulative nature, the concept of improved stealthy attacks has been proposed. With the improved stealthy attack, estimation error will exhibit diverging behavior in naturally unstable systems. If the spectral radius of the system matrix is less than 1, it has been proved that the estimation errors or the divergence of key states are always bounded while suffering stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks. Under such consideration, optimal FDI attack schemes are proposed such that the most significant impact, i.e., severest estimation error, can be achieved if stealthiness is still maintained. In addition, the problem of degrading some key states of NCSs is concerned with. Attack strategies are proposed to achieve divergence or the largest deviation of key states for systems with different spectral radii.

However, existing deep learning-based methods assume that the potential distributions of training and test sets are identical. This assumption overlooks the issue that deviations in test data distribution can lead to a decline in recognition accuracy. To address this problem, this article proposes an intention recognition method for air targets based on bidirectional gated recurrent units (Bi-GRU) and sample reweighting (SR). First, to capture the multidimensional and temporal nature of target attributes along with their varying degrees of influence on intention recognition, a temporal self-attention mechanism is employed to capture time-domain variability. In addition, a Bi-GRU module is used to extract target features. Then, considering the distribution bias of test data, the SR model is applied to eliminate the statistical correlation between relevant and irrelevant features to avoid nonlinear dependence among features. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through ablation and comparison experiments in an air combat scenario. The results clearly indicate that our method outperforms some existing methods.},

To enhance the security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) performance of the HSTUS, we propose two relay selection schemes by considering the usability of channel state information (CSI) of CCI channels, namely, the relay selection with partial CSI (RSwPCSI) where the CCI links&#39; CSI is unknown, and the relay selection with full CSI (RSwFCSI) where the CCI links&#39; CSI is available. We employ the conventional round-robin scheduling (CRRS) scheme for performance comparison purposes. Then, we analyze both exact and asymptotic SRT performance of the CRRS, RSwPCSI, and RSwFCSI schemes by investigating their outage and intercept probabilities in CCI environments. Simulation results show that the proposed RSwPCSI and RSwFCSI schemes have better SRT performance than the CRRS scheme. Increasing the number of relays obviously improves SRT performance of the proposed RSwPCSI and RSwFCSI schemes while that of the CRRS remains unchanged, which indicates the advantages of employing the proposed RSwPCSI and RSwFCSI schemes. Moreover, the optimal SRT performance can be obtained for the three schemes by using the optimal signal-to-noise errors, which are calculated by the golden search-based iterative method.},

The model scope includes 193 concepts at multiple levels of abstraction and scale, related in psychologically relevant terms according to the work domain analysis (WDA) theoretic framework. To manage this scale, we used both conceptual and topological decomposition, and linked prototypical examples to specifics of particular power grids.

  abstract     = {Data exchange among nodes in a distributed dc microgrid (DCMG) causes time delays that can negatively impact reliability and performance. Previous literature often assumes that local data are delayed by the same value as the transmission delay between neighboring nodes, aiming to achieve convergence of average bus voltages to the desired level. However, this assumption relies on having precise knowledge of the communication delay, which is not always feasible in real-world applications. This article presents a more realistic scenario by considering unknown and varying communication delays among links. The assumption of no self-delay for local data results in a steady-state deviation of the global average bus voltages. To address this challenge, a novel observer for average bus voltage is proposed, which significantly expands the acceptable delay range and reduces the communication burden by transmitting fewer variables through the communication links. Furthermore, a modified distributed secondary control scheme is developed, and the system model is transformed into a standard linear form represented by retarded differential equations. Stability analysis and the design of control gains for the system, considering uncertain local and public loads, are presented using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii approach. The proposed method is verified through theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The radio resources are utilized for both transmissions of new data and for retransmission(s) of erroneous data to handle errors due to transmission over the wireless link. Hence, the more retransmissions occur, the fewer resources remain available for transmission of new data resulting in a lower goodput. This problem is even emphasized in cloud radio access networks (C-RAN), where remote radio heads (RRHs) cooperate with baseband unit (BBU) over fronthaul imposing additional delay and limiting goodput. In this article, we propose a flexible and dynamic Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) resource pre-allocation based on the actual retransmission needs of individual user equipments (UEs). This is managed by two algorithms, first exploiting information on the error rate experienced by individual UEs and the second using the length of the scheduling period of the UEs. Both algorithms are further integrated together to improve the efficiency of the HARQ retransmissions resource pre-allocation. Simulation results show the proposed solution provides goodput close to the theoretical upper-bound while outperforming existing approaches by up to 39%. Furthermore, the transport block loss rate and mean absolute percentage error of the amount of pre-allocated resources for the HARQ are notably decreased by around 38% and 57%, respectively.},

The background subtraction method is used to filter out the background objects. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm detects and identifies vehicle objects. The traffic target tracking method based on historical frame data fusion obtained the vehicle trajectory. Second, this article designed a method to extract high-resolution microscopic traffic information. This method constructs the boundary box model of traffic objects by finding fixed point features. Then, the speed, distance, and other information are calculated through the coordinate relationship of vehicle position. Finally, the velocity and gap distance characteristics are analyzed in car-following behavior. This study found a significant correlation between the speed of the front and rear vehicles in the car-following process. A linear function can effectively fit the relationship between speed and gap distance.

The optimal power flow issue&#39;s nonlinearity and nonconvexity make it difficult to apply and develop the conventional control approach directly. With the development of machine learning in recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed for solving such complex optimal control problems. This article proposes a DRL-based TD3 optimal control scheme to achieve the optimal generation control for dc microgrids. The generation cost of distributed generators is minimized, and the significant boundaries, such as generation bounds and the bus voltage bounds, are both guaranteed. The proposed approach connects the optimal control and reinforcement learning frameworks with centralized training and distributed execution structure. Case studies showed that reinforcement learning algorithms might optimize nonlinear and nonconvex systems with fast dynamics by utilizing particular reward function designs, data sampling, and constraint management strategies. In addition, producing the experience replay buffer before training drastically lowers learning failure, enhancing the data efficiency of the DRL process.},

It solves the problem that the traditional structural hole method cannot be used to identify important edges directly. Second, the edge information entropy of the command and control network is defined by introducing the ego-network betweenness centrality, and the complexity of information entropy calculation is reduced. Furthermore, the novel edge importance ranking method based on the combination of the improved structure hole and information entropy is proposed. This method solves the problem of edge importance evaluation which takes into account network structure and transmission performance. Finally, the performance simulation experiments are designed based on different network models and edge importance ranking methods.

The design of fire system is capitalized on the benefits of characteristics that robots have a greater tolerance for high temperatures and poisonous gases and robots can cooperate with fire evacuation systems more effectively. The system has two components: fire prediction method and path planning algorithm. Fire prediction is used to anticipate fire behavior. Using the results of fire prediction, a cooperated path planning can direct robots to a safe house to prevent being damaged. Compared to other fire evacuation systems, our approach demonstrates a 10% higher success rate in guiding robots to safe zones, thereby preventing property losses and ensuring a more efficient response to fire emergencies.},

Then, a focal firm-specific analysis is conducted to explore the multiplexity of the global EV LIB SCN, including identifying the influential firms, measuring the structure of SCNs led by different focal firms, and distinguishing the dependence and discrepancies of different focal firms’ SCNs. Furthermore, an SCN vulnerability (SCNV) index was designed to assess the vulnerability of such a multilayered SCN in two disruption scenarios, i.e., single-country blockade and intercountry blockade. The structural analysis can assist focal firms in allocating vulnerability-coping resources more effectively.

  abstract     = {In recent years, the push for accurate and reliable time synchronization has gained momentum in critical infrastructures, especially in telecommunication networks, driven by the demands of 5G new radio and next-generation technologies that rely on submicrosecond timing accuracy for radio access network (RAN) nodes. Traditionally, atomic clocks paired with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) timing receivers have served as grand master clocks, supported by dedicated network timing protocols. However, this approach struggles to scale with the increasing numbers of RAN intermediate nodes. To address scalability and high-accuracy synchronization, a more cost-effective and capillary solution is needed. Standalone GNSS timing receivers leverage ubiquitous satellite signals to offer stable timing signals but can expose networks to radio-frequency attacks due to the consequent proliferation of GNSS antennas. Our research introduces a solution by combining the white rabbit precise time protocol with a backup timing source logic acting in case of timing disruptive attacks against GNSS for resilient GNSS-based network synchronization. It has been rigorously tested against common jamming, meaconing, and spoofing attacks, consistently maintaining 2 ns relative synchronization accuracy between nodes, all without the need for an atomic clock.},

  abstract     = {To support high volumes of data transmission, multiline distribution technology is used in both 400 and 800 GbE, which uses alignment markers (AMs) in each line to differentiate them from one another. However, inefficient design of AMs can result in dc-unbalanced, low transition density symbols when they are bit multiplexed, which in turn results in large baseline wander (BW) and clock wander (CW) of the received signal. In this article, we introduce two new metrics—attenuation cumulative sum (ACS) and generalized transition balance (GTB). Using the two new metrics ACS and GTB, we efficiently design AMs for the 400GBASE-R and 800GBASE-R framework in 400 and 800 GbE, respectively. We show through numerical simulations that the proposed AMs outperform the traditional AMs in terms of BW and CW performance during data transmission.},

  abstract     = {The vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network is an infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) to be charged and discharged. As EVs are increasingly connected to V2G networks, V2G networks are facing serious data security problems. Attackers may eavesdrop on, tamper with, and forge the electricity transaction data, which will seriously damage the security of the transmitted data and affect the V2G network&#39;s normal operation. To ensure secure and efficient transmission of electricity transaction data, a pairing-free certificateless agregate signcryption (PCAS) scheme is proposed in this article. The PCAS scheme is theoretically proven to provide confidentiality, unforgeability, etc. On the premise of ensuring data security, time-consuming pairing operation is avoided in the PCAS scheme, the certificateless mechanism is used to avoid certificate management and key escrow issues, the verification time of ciphertext is reduced by using aggregate signcryption, and the special random number processing method is adopted to reduce the complexity of signcryption process. The scheme is more efficient by adopting these measures. The performance analysis results demonstrate that the PCAS scheme takes less computing time than compared schemes. When massive EVs are charged and discharged through V2G networks, the data are transmitted more securely and efficiently by using the PCAS scheme.},

  abstract     = {To address the issue that existing wireless sensor network (WSN)-based anomaly detection methods only consider and analyze temporal features, in this article, a self-supervised learning-based anomalous node detection method based on an autoencoder is designed. This method integrates the extraction of temporal WSN data flow feature, spatial position feature, and intermodal WSN correlation feature into the autoencoder design to make full use of the spatial and temporal information of the WSN for anomaly detection. First, a fully connected network is used to extract the temporal features of nodes by considering a single mode from a local spatial perspective. Second, a graph neural network is used to introduce the WSN topology from a global spatial perspective for anomaly detection and to extract the spatial and temporal features of the data flows of nodes and their neighbors by considering a single mode. Then, an adaptive fusion method involving weighted summation is used to extract the relevant features between different modes. In addition, the gated recurrent unit network structure is introduced to solve the long-term dependence problem in the time dimension. Eventually, the reconstructed output of the decoder and the hidden layer representation of the autoencoder are fed into a fully connected network to calculate the anomaly probability for the current system. Since the spatial feature extraction operation is performed first, the designed method can be applied for anomaly detection in large-scale networks with the addition of a clustering operation. Experiments show that the designed method outperforms baseline methods, and the F1 score reaches 90.6%, at least 5.2% higher than those of existing anomaly detection methods based on unsupervised reconstruction and prediction.},

This article investigates an overlay cognitive satellite-terrestrial network (CSTN) with cooperative NOMA. Different from existing works where only the secondary transmitter (ST) cooperates with the primary user (PU), we propose to let both the ST and the full-duplex (FD) secondary receiver (SR) cooperate with the PU. Specifically, the ST can forward the primary message from the satellite source to the PU and transmit the secondary message to the SR simultaneously based on the NOMA protocol, while the SR can also cooperate to forward the primary message to the PU based on the FD protocol. An adaptive mode selection strategy is proposed to let the SR choose between the cooperation mode and noncooperation mode. We obtain the closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probabilities of the PU and the SR as well as the PU diversity order. It is shown that the PU diversity order can be improved by 1 compared to the case when the SR works only in the noncooperation mode when the residual loop-interference is very low. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the correctness of the theoretical analysis.},

First, a blockchain-based mobile crowdsensing system with a dual currency mechanism is established in a distributed manner to ensure the reliability of the sensing system. Second, a consensus protocol is designed to strengthen the security of sensing data based on a credit-based verifiers declaration game.

  abstract     = {Distribution system operators seriously restrict bus voltage deviations within a small range from the nominal voltage to ensure security aspects. The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers, and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the system&#39;s nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes, where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.},

Installation of solar rooftops and photovoltaic panels is getting a broader response, even in residential and commercial buildings. However, at the same time, it is of paramount importance to manage the appliances in these buildings according to the local energy generated from these renewable sources to obtain a better supply–demand ratio. We address this problem by proposing a coordinated scheduling approach for flexible devices and the optimal usage of heterogeneous energy sources to minimize the energy drawn from the main grid and thereby reduce electricity costs for the users. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem and solve it optimally using Gurobi optimizer. Moreover, we also propose a set of efficient heuristic algorithms that consider the predicted renewable energy and price information to obtain the solutions efficiently for a large dataset. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithms deviate within 2.28%–18.47% from the optimal solutions in various settings, depicting their capability to be implemented in a real-world system.},

To validate the algorithm, we implement GWEO to solve the multiobjective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem in a modified 118-bus distribution system with high distributed photovoltaic (PV) penetration. The objective functions of MOOPF are active power losses, voltage deviation, and PV curtailment rates. Besides, we compare GWEO with GWO, salp swarm algorithm, EO, and hybrid GWO in terms of convergence rate, diversity, and optimum value. The numerical results reveal that our proposed GWEO shows faster convergence rate and better performance on diversity and optimum value, providing decision-makers with better solutions in multiobjective optimization scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Dense deployment of small base stations (SBSs) powered by on-grid and harvested renewable energy has been spotlighted as a promising solution to implement grid energy conservation in a hybrid-energy heterogeneous cellular network (HCN), which caters for the rapidly increasing demand of multimedia communication services. However, energy harvesting is inherently opportunistic, and battery leakage may deteriorate the network availability. In this article, we propose a power-aware user association and renewable energy configuration scheme for optimizing on-grid energy in HCN powered by hybrid energy with battery leakage. In this scheme, we present a power-aware user association rule that can get dynamically an availability set of SBS by predicting transmit power required by other users in each time slot (TS). Meanwhile, we exploit the Lyapunov optimization technique to control energy consumption of each user and design the heuristic algorithms to balance energy utilization for renewable energy configuration in different TSs. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in optimizing the on-grid energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {As various intelligent networked devices are increasingly introduced and applied or connected to modern vehicles, the services and functions of vehicles with controller area network (CAN) become more powerful and intelligent, however, exposed to the wide external networks. which suffer from serious cyber-security threats. Benefit from the intelligent and networked techniques, CAN for modern intelligent vehicles develops rapidly, but still faces critical security problems since it is lack of strong security protection mechanism. For the threat detection of CAN in modern vehicles, this research proposes a graph node attention network (GNAT) method to extract CAN packet context-dependent features, and improve the accuracy of malicious packet IDs identification in packet sequence windows. First, time-continuous CAN packets are converted into node profile according to the arbitration field, and the obtained nodes are connected to edges based on the time–adjacent relationship, thereby being converted into a graph. Using proper graph construction method, normal and malicious CAN packets can be converted into graphs with different topological structures. Second, the attention values of each node and edge in the graph are calculated with the GNAT through the topology difference between normal and malicious CAN packet conversion graphs, and then the node fusion features are acquired. The fused features are fed to the random forest for training and intrusion detection of CAN. Multiple tests were carried out, and the results show the features extracted by GNAT can help improve the generalization performance of the trained random forest model.},

The IIoT has the potential to benefit from advances in artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to increase efficiency and productivity and reduce overhead costs. We provide an overview of the supervisory control and data acquisition system, a definition of IIoT, and how IIoT can offer industry greater potential for system integration to improve automation and optimization. In addition, five of the major IIoT protocols are discussed, namely, message queue telemetry transport, advanced messaging queuing protocol, constrained application protocol, data distribution service, and open platform communication unified architecture. We then identified key IIoT improvements for industrial automation. These are; efficient and low-cost systems, digital twin, machine failure prediction, real-time remote monitoring, and security. We then discussed the key research in the literature for each category. We presented some public IIoT datasets so that researchers can use them to develop new learning models to improve the security of IIoT systems. Finally, we discussed some of the limitations, recommendations, and future perspectives for developing IIoT-enabled systems.},

In general, power graphs are sparsely connected, scale-free with consecutive numbering, which cannot be directly synthesized by existing random graph models, such as the Edrős–Rényi model. This article proposes a modified Edrős–Rényi random graph model (itself and Gilbert) to generate synthetic power graphs. Using vertex and component rewiring, the proposed algorithm can obtain sparsely connected graphs with average degree between 2 and 3 for different graph sizes. The proposed algorithm also uses reordering to obtain consecutive vertex numbering, and therefore, it can generate synthetic power graphs with a structure similar to power graphs. In addition to the structure of synthetic power graphs, the proposed algorithm provides some auxiliary operational data for the generated synthetic power graphs, i.e., the location of zero injection buses. The simulation results of optimal PMU placement problem for three IEEE cases and three real cases show the similarities of the two versions of generated graphs to the power graphs in terms of network structure and operational data. Also, the flexibility of the two versions of the proposed model in generating graphs with different network structures as well as operational data are shown in two simulations related to the domination number problem.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes attribute-based broadcast proxy (ABP) re-encryption with coalitional game theory—a scheme to share encrypted cloud data with Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The scheme reduces the decryption costs on the receiver&#39;s side. In the case of sharing data with a subgroup of IoT devices, i.e., identities, where attributes satisfy a particular access policy, and the cardinality of IoT devices satisfying the access policy is not known to the data owner, the existing encryption techniques, such as broadcast proxy re-encryption and attribute-based encryption, cannot solve the problem. Hence, we propose the concept of attribute-based encryption in broadcast proxy re-encryption, named ABP. In ABP, we use the coalitional game theory to find the optimal coalition for minimizing the decryption cost and the total cost of the system. We prove that ABP is a selective security chosen-plaintext attack secure under the random oracle model. The performance of ABP is evaluated and compared with the existing broadcast proxy re-encryption schemes. We observe that ABP reduces the decryption cost. Furthermore, the total cost of the system is reduced using the coalitional game.},

  abstract     = {Passive radar has been recognized as one of the most attractive and promising approaches to solving the critical challenge of spectrum scarcity. However, the ubiquitous hardware impairment (HWI) might severely degrade the passive radar&#39;s performance. This article develops maximum likelihood estimation algorithms considering I/Q imbalance (IQI) and additive distortion (AD) to propose the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT)-based detectors. For single-target cases, the novel GLRT detectors correspond to different knowledge levels of the transmitted signals and channel state information. Then, the single-target scenarios are extended to the two-target case to investigate the effects of transmitter–receiver distance, bistatic range and range resolution brought by the interfering target. Specifically, we propose the HWI mitigation algorithm to approximate and simplify the complex GLRT expressions due to the interfering target, thereby counteracting the effects of IQI and AD. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both amplitude mismatch and phase mismatch have degrading impact on the overall detection probability of single-target passive radar, and the two-target detector has a very high-range resolution compared with classical works in DVB-T. Also, the range resolution is proven to be robust to HWI.},

The jammer, on the other hand, aims at maximizing the damaging effect on the radar system. By formulating the adversarial interaction between the radar system and the jammer as a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, respectively, we compute the optimal power allocation strategies for the radar system incorporating the effect of signal-dependent interference. We begin by studying a radar network where each radar can benefit from the other radars’ transmission. The conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibrium and the Stackelberg equilibrium are examined, and algorithms to obtain the optimal transmission strategies for the radar system are developed. Next, we extend the equilibrium analyses to a more general distributed radar network with inter-radar interference. Finally, numerical results are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis.},

We jointly optimize the channel blocklength and beamforming vector to minimize the used channel blocklength in a mission-critical Internet-of-Things scenario. To solve the formulated problem, we first propose a bisection method to obtain the blocklength. The formulated problem is further transformed into a min-max problem, and the minimum error probability is obtained by performing the successive convex approach algorithm. Finally, we update the blocklength according to the obtained error probability. The simulation results show that the minimum blocklength in the MISO NOMA is lower than that in MISO orthogonal multiple access and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in latency reduction for URLLC.},

It is important to separate and analyze the case of climate-based disruptions and how they affect systems&#39; resilience. This article presents a probabilistic resilience assessment framework where failure scenarios and network disruptions are generated using weather profile data from climate prediction models with component-level fragility functions. A case study is then carried out to quantify the resilience of Great Britain&#39;s railway passenger transport system to high-temperature-related track buckling under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate change scenario. A 95-year horizon on the resilience of the railway system is drawn. The results reveal the nonlinear responses of the railway system to the increasing temperature and show that models considering random asset failures overestimate the system&#39;s resilience.},

  abstract     = {As an imperative division of the Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial IoT (IIoT) has also attracted full attention. IIoT networks are equipped with various authenticated key exchange techniques under the cumbersome Diffie–Hellman (DH) problems and certificate management overheads. However, DH-type problems are vulnerable to quantum cryptanalysis. In this article, a novel identity-based authenticated key exchange protocol is designed using the concept of lattice cryptography, which enables the different security features in the IIoT in open wireless communication. Due to the lattice hard assumptions, the proposed protocol can withstand a quantum attack. Rigorous formal security analysis has been made, which shows the ability of the proposed protocol to resist existing as well as quantum attacks. Performance results demonstrate that the proposed protocol exhibits better communication, energy consumption, cryptographic key storage, and computation costs than other similar state of the arts.},

  abstract     = {We Start the first edition of the journal in 2024 with our renewed commitment to publishing high-quality papers on complex systems and system of systems. Thanks to its page increase, the elimination of the backlog has become a major improvement in the past few years, hence the reduced publication time following the acceptance of papers. The flow of the publications has now reached a steady cadence, and as a result, the journal will now be published with a lower number of pages going forward. Nevertheless, we have continued to receive an encouraging number of papers throughout the past few years, and the review process continues to be very rigorous.},
