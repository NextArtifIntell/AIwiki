  abstract     = {Given a network of agents, we study the problem of designing a distributed algorithm that computes $k$ independent weighted means of the network&#39;s initial conditions (namely, the agents agree on a $k$ -dimensional space). Akin to average consensus, this problem finds applications in distributed computing and sensing, where agents seek to simultaneously evaluate $k$ independent functions at a common point by running a single coordination algorithm. We show that linear algorithms can agree on quantities that are oblique projections of the vector of initial conditions, and we provide techniques to design protocols that are compatible with a pre-specified communication graph. More broadly, our results show that a single agreement algorithm can solve $k$ consensus problems simultaneously at a fraction of the complexity of classical approaches but, in general, it requires higher network connectivity.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of observer design for heat diffusion–reaction partial differential equations (PDEs) that are monitored through delayed boundary sensor measurements. The novelty with respect to the existing observers lies in the fact that the PDE is subject to parameter uncertainties coming not only in the domain but also in the sensor. We develop an adaptive observer that provides online accurate estimates of both the state and parameter estimates. The observer design makes use of modal decomposition theory and the decoupling transformation method. The former is resorted to reformulate the observer design and analysis in a finite-dimensional space. The decoupling transformation makes the state estimation problem decoupled from the parameter estimation problem. Compared with the existing adaptive observers, the new observer features: 1) the injection of extra actions in the domain allowing a better compensation for the effects of parameter uncertainties and 2) a better consideration of all available information (at a given time) in the parameter estimator. The observer analysis is established using a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, under a persistent excitation assumption. The analysis highlights sufficient conditions, involving the maximal time delay, for the state and parameter estimation errors to be exponentially convergent to zero.},

A novel conception called “basic pattern” is proposed which can precisely characterize all the admissible sequences of switched systems under asynchronous switching. Compared to existing methods which are devoted to constructing different Lyapunov functions for achieving less conservative stability conditions, here we report a convex stability criteria of asynchronously switched linear systems based on the established basic patterns. The derived stability conditions depend on an integer parameter that can be possibly unbounded to reach the nonconservativeness. The convex feature of the proposed stability criterion further facilitates the computation of the $l_{2}$ -gain and $H_{\infty }$ control problems.

Our contributions are twofold.

Second, we design a class of state-norm estimators for switched systems under our class of stabilizing switching signals. These estimators are switched systems themselves with two subsystems—one stable and one unstable. The key apparatus for our analysis is multiple Lyapunov-like functions.

Nussbaum function techniques are commonly used tools to investigate output regulation problems for various systems subject to unknown control direction. They often lead to large overshoots when the initial estimates of the control direction are wrong. In this study, an extremum-seeking control approach is proposed to overcome the need for Nussbaum functions. The approach yields control laws that can handle the robust practical output regulation problem for a class of nonlinear systems subject to a time-varying control direction whose sign or value is unknown. The stability of the design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. Finally, the simulation of a chaotic control problem for the generalized Lorenz system with an unknown time-varying coefficient is provided to illustrate the validity of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The control problem of dynamic systems that undergo sudden changes and rely on past data is known to be challenging to solve and has received a lot of attention in the past years. Meanwhile, the optimal control theory has been widely used to develop efficient conditions for stability analysis and control synthesis. In this article, we propose a robust regulation strategy for Markovian jump linear systems subject to delayed states and polytopic uncertainties. The time-varying delay belongs to a known interval. To obtain less conservative results, we consider the maximum variation rate of the delay. We apply the augmented system approach and model the delay by a Markov chain, obtaining a delay-free Markovian system. Then, we establish a min–max optimization problem whose quadratic cost function collectively weights all the polytope vertices through a penalty parameter. The solution yields a mode-dependent state-feedback control law. Unlike most approaches in the literature, the main features of the proposed method are its recursiveness and stability conditions, which can be achieved through the Riccati equations. They are suitable for embedded and real-time applications. We illustrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed regulator one numerical examples.},

This study is significant since a time domain energy multiplier that allows proving the exponential stability of this continuous Schrödinger system has not yet found, thus leading to a major mathematical challenge to the uniform exponential stability of the corresponding semidiscretization systems, which is an open problem for a long time. Although the powerful frequency domain energy multiplier approach has been used in proving exponential stability for partial differential equations (PDEs) since 1980s, its use to the uniform exponential stability of the semidiscrete scheme for PDEs has not been reported yet. The difficulty associated with the uniformity is that due to the parameter of the step size, it involves infinitely many matrices in different state spaces that need to be considered simultaneously. Based on the Huang–Prüss frequency domain criterion for uniform exponential stability of a family of $C_{0}$ -semigroups in Hilbert spaces, we solve this problem for the first time by proving the uniform boundedness for all the resolvents of these matrices on the imaginary axis. The proof almost exactly follows the procedure for the exponential stability of the continuous counterpart, highlighting the advantage of this discretization method.},

This objective ensures that the system enters a target set eventually while staying within an open safe set before the first target hitting time. Three control guidance-barrier functions and corresponding conditions for synthesizing reach-avoid controllers are developed. These conditions progressively weaken, facilitating optimal controller design. We then extend two of these functions for deterministic systems to stochastic systems to synthesize reach-avoid controllers in the probabilistic setting.

Based on the stored information and primal-dual techniques, a distributed online optimization algorithm is constructed for agents to achieve the minimization of their total cost while satisfying local box constraints and a global balancing equality constraint. In the developed algorithm, the agents update their decision variables and dual variables via the projected gradient method and dual averaging method, respectively. A dynamic regret and an accumulation of constraint violation are introduced as performance indices of evaluating the established algorithm. Moreover, if the number of departing agents at each iteration is no larger than the connectivity degree of the communication graph, the upper bounds of both indices are obtained which grow sublinearly under suitable step-sizes, indicating that the proposed algorithm performs well.

  abstract     = {Recently, distributed observer designs have been investigated intensively, but the distributed unknown input observer (DUIO) which can offer the asymptotic convergent estimations of both the states and the unknown inputs (UIs) has not been developed yet. In this article, we come up with a novel DUIO design method through a distributed interval observer (DIO) for a system with UI, and each sensor with measurement noise. First, by introducing an auxiliary output, the local system is transformed into a system where the output contains no measurement noise. Then, a DIO is designed. Based on the DIO, a relationship between the UI and the state is established algebraically. By taking advantage of the algebraic relationship, a DUIO which is composed of a general distributed observer and an unknown input reconstruction (UIR) is constructed. The DUIO offers the asymptotic convergent state estimation and UIR. After this, asymptotic convergent measurement noise reconstruction is also provided. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this article, online noncooperative games without full decision information are studied, where the goal of players is to seek the Nash equilibria in a distributed manner. Different from the existing works on online noncooperative games, here we consider the case where the cost functions are stochastic. In the problem, each player only has access to a noisy gradient of its own cost function and a local action set, and needs to make decisions before the current noisy gradient information is revealed. To handle this problem, we propose an online distributed stochastic mirror descent algorithm. The performance of the presented algorithm is measured by employing the dynamic regrets, where the offline benchmarks are to seek the Nash equilibrium point at each time. Particularly, a high probability bound of the dynamic regrets is proposed on the basis of the sub-Gaussian noise model. The result shows that if the variation in the Nash equilibrium sequence grows at a certain rate, then the regrets increase sublinearly with a high probability. Finally, simulations are worked out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Under assumptions on the nonlinear vector fields, such as being homogeneous, cooperative, and order-preserving, conditions are derived for positivity and asymptotic stability of nonlinear differential-difference equations, which include the corresponding linear system as a special case. This work features three main contributions: first, a necessary and sufficient positivity condition is proposed for nonlinear differential-difference equations with delays. Then, utilizing the concept of homogeneity, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided for the global asymptotic stability of such positive nonlinear systems with unbounded delays. Finally, we analyze the global $\mu$ -stability of the systems with unbounded time-varying delays to estimate the convergence rates of the system dynamics. The effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results is illustrated by numerical examples, including an analysis of nonlinear epidemic-spreading processes.},

  abstract     = {This article contributes a theoretical framework for data-driven feedback linearization of nonlinear control-affine systems. We unify the traditional geometric perspective on feedback linearization with an operator-theoretic perspective involving the Koopman operator. We first show that if the distribution of the control vector field and its repeated Lie brackets with the drift vector field is involutive, then there exists an output and a feedback control law for which the Koopman generator is finite-dimensional and locally nilpotent. We use this connection to propose a data-driven algorithm ‘Koopman generator-based feedback linearization (KGFL)’ for feedback linearization of single-input systems. Particularly, we use experimental data to identify the state transformation and control feedback from a dictionary of functions for which feedback linearization is achieved in a least-squares sense. We also propose a single-step data-driven formula which can be used to compute the linearizing transformations. When the system is feedback linearizable and the chosen dictionary is complete, our data-driven algorithm provides the same solution as model-based feedback linearization. Finally, we provide numerical examples for the data-driven algorithm and compare it with model-based feedback linearization. We also numerically study the effect of the richness of the dictionary and the size of the dataset on the effectiveness of feedback linearization.},

We introduce techniques to convert a certain class of continuous-time event-triggered control into PETC and STC, eliminating the need for continuous evaluation of the triggering function. For the PETC, the triggering function requires only periodic evaluations to detect events, while the STC proactively computes the time of the next event right at the current event time using the system model and the continuously available measurements. For both strategies, the control input is updated exclusively at events and is maintained using a zero-order hold between events. We demonstrate that the closed-loop system is Zeno-free. We offer criteria for selecting an appropriate sampling period for the PETC and for determining the time until the next event under the STC. We prove the system&#39;s global exponential convergence to zero in the spatial $L^{2}$ norm for both anticollocated and collocated sensing and actuation under the PETC. For the STC, local exponential convergence to zero in the spatial $L^{2}$ norm for collocated sensing and actuation is proven. Simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical claims.},

The proposed framework builds upon a generalization of notions of persistency of excitation (PE) and uniform observability (UO), which we redefine to fit the realm of hybrid systems. Most remarkably, we propose for the first time in the literature a definition of hybrid PE. Then, we establish conditions, under which hybrid PE is equivalent to hybrid UO and, in turn, uniform exponential stability. Our proofs rely on an original statement for hybrid systems, expressed in terms of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal {L}_{p}}$ bounds on the solutions.

We show that this approach also minimizes an error bound on the $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ -norm of the steady-state error between the responses of the full-order nonlinear model and the reduced-order nonlinear model. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves both the Lur&#39;e-type model structure as well as global stability properties. The problem is cast as an optimization problem with bilinear matrix inequality constraints. This problem is then solved using a novel algorithm, although global convergence of the algorithm is not guaranteed. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in the reduction of a structural dynamics model of a linear beam with nonlinear supports.},

  abstract     = {This article revisits the event-triggered control problem from a data-driven perspective, where unknown continuous-time linear systems subject to disturbances are taken into account. Using data information collected offline instead of accurate system model information, a data-driven dynamic event-triggered control scheme is developed in this article. An update algorithm is proposed for dynamically updating the event-triggered function embedded in the event-triggered mechanism (ETM). Thanks to the designed dynamic ETM, a strictly positive minimum inter-event time is guaranteed without sacrificing control performance. Specifically, exponential input-to-state stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system with respect to disturbances is achieved in this article, which is superior to some existing results that only guarantee a practical exponential ISS property. The dynamic ETM is easy-to-implement in practical operation since all designed parameters are determined only by a simple data-driven linear matrix inequality, without additional complicated conditions as required in relevant literature. As quantization is the most common signal constraint in practice, the developed control scheme is further extended to the case where state transmission is affected by a uniform or logarithmic quantization effect. Finally, adequate simulations are performed to show the validity of the proposed control schemes.},

This note introduces a systematic approach for designing an immersion and invariance-based disturbance observer (IIDOB) that circumvents these strong assumptions. The proposed IIDOB ensures the disturbance estimation error is globally uniformly ultimately bounded by approximately solving a partial differential equation while compensating for the approximation error. Furthermore, by integrating IIDOB into the framework of control barrier functions, a filter-based safe control design method for control-affine systems with disturbances is established, where the filter is used to generate an alternative disturbance estimation signal with a known derivative. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the safety of the disturbed systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By making use of the Koopman operator theory, the Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the system and the disturbance model are determined by applying the Krylov dynamic mode decomposition to the data. For cyclic LTI systems, it is shown that this Koopman modal analysis is always feasible under generic conditions. With this, a data-driven output feedback regulator is determined on the basis of the internal model principle, which also ensures output regulation in the presence of nondestabilizing model uncertainties.

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to the stabilization of an uncertain reaction–diffusion equation with dynamic boundary conditions. The remarkable features of the system under investigation are reflected in the presence of the nonlinear dynamic boundary condition and the serious uncertainties that are involved in not only the dynamic boundary but also the main equation. Consequently, the traditional control schemes on this topic are incapable. Toward the control problem, a novel control scheme via condition-based adaption is proposed in this article. Specifically, an infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation is first introduced to change the original system into a new one, in which certain crucial controller parameter to be tuned later is involved. Then, for the newly obtained system, the controller is designed joint with a crucial condition-based updating mechanism. By the proposed updating mechanism, two pivotal controller parameters are online tuned so as to compensate the unknowns, respectively, involved in both the dynamic boundary and the main equation. Finally, much effort is taken to show that the designed controller guarantees that all the states of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded while converge to zero ultimately. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

It was shown that the problem admits linear optimal cost and the associated Bellman&#39;s equation can be characterized by a finite-dimensional nonlinear equation, which is solved by linear programming. In this work, we report exact dynamic programming (DP) theories for the same class of problems. Moreover, we extend the results to a related class of problems where the norms of control are bounded while the optimal costs remain linear. In both cases, we provide conditions under which the solutions are unique, investigate properties of the optimal policies, study the convergence of value iteration, policy iteration, and optimistic policy iteration applied to such problems, and analyze the boundedness of the solution to the associated optimization programs. Apart from a form of the Frobenius–Perron theorem, the majority of our results are built upon generic DP theory applicable to problems involving nonnegative stage costs.},

The article covers both convex and strongly convex problems, and it also analyzes online scenarios, involving changes in the data and costs. This article relies on interpreting stochastic algorithms as the iterated application of stochastic operators, thus allowing us to use the powerful tools of operator theory. In particular, we consider operators characterized by additive errors with sub-Weibull distribution (which parameterize a broad class of errors by their tail probability), and random updates. In this framework, we derive convergence results in mean and high probability, by providing bounds to the distance of the current iteration from a solution of the optimization or learning problem.

We propose two methods for constructing closed-loop embedding systems, which account for the interactions between the system and the controller in different ways. The interconnection-based approach considers the worst-case evolution of each coordinate separately by substituting the neural network inclusion function into the open-loop inclusion function. The interaction-based approach uses novel Jacobian-based inclusion functions to capture the first-order interactions between the open-loop system and the controller by leveraging state-of-the-art neural network verifiers. Finally, we implement our approach in a Python framework called ReachMM to demonstrate its efficiency and scalability on benchmarks and examples ranging to 200 state dimensions.},

These majorization inequalities demonstrate that the “evenness” of control difficulties in sensitivity and complementary sensitivity reduction across the channels gives a fundamental design constraint. Lower bounds for the evenness are shown to be determined by the unstable poles and nonminimum-phase zeros of the open-loop systems together with their respective directions. The majorization inequalities retain various known integral relations concerning the determinant and largest singular value of the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity function. Furthermore, we show that the majorization constraints underpin the sensitivity minimization under $p$ -norms and enable an insightful generalization of the waterbed effect to the $k$ -waterbed effect that deepens understanding on the spatial tradeoff in sensitivity reduction in MIMO systems.},

  abstract     = {Hyperparameter estimation is a critical aspect of kernel-based regularization methods (KRMs), alongside kernel design. Empirical Bayes (EB) and Stein&#39;s unbiased risk estimator (SURE) are two widely used hyperparameter estimators for tuning the unknown hyperparameters associated with the kernel matrix of KRMs. However, EB and SURE exhibit different characteristics in both theory and practice. Theoretically, SURE is asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE), whereas EB generally is not. However, practical evidence suggests that EB is often more accurate and robust than SURE, especially when the regression matrix is ill-conditioned. Therefore, this article aims to deepen our understanding of these two estimators in a unified manner. First, we construct a family of hyperparameter estimators that encompasses both EB and SURE by introducing an index. We then explain the loss function of this family as a tradeoff between data fit and model complexity for regularized least squares estimators, using least squares estimators as a reference. Second, we establish the convergence and rate of convergence of this family and further demonstrate that it is asymptotically optimal in some weighted MSE for a specific kernel matrix. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations indicate the existence of other hyperparameter estimators in this family that outperform both EB and SURE methods for certain datasets.},

First, from the perspective of the control center, which sends commands and collects measurements, a novel attack detector is designed to detect irregularities by analyzing residual signals, tracking performance, and prediction performance. Second, for detecting the stealthy attacks bypassing the detector in the control center side, an attack detector in the controlled system side is also constructed by analyzing the reliability of the received command, which is generated by a command governor. Compared to solely relying on residual signals, it is shown that combining the designed two detectors where the collected information is fully utilized ensures that more general attacks can be detected. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that the proposed detectors equipped with multiple defense mechanisms can detect various attacks.},

By utilizing $H$ -matrix theories, projection techniques, invariance principle, and an extended Barbalat&#39;s lemma, it is rigorously shown that the state of the constrained network globally asymptotically approaches the nonempty equilibrium set. Based on the equilibrium set and constraint sets, some notions and criteria are developed to explore the convergent behaviors of the constrained network, including interval bipartite consensus, bipartite consensus, global stability, and noninterior convergence. In sharp contrast to unconstrained signed networks, a constrained signed network may fail to achieve interval bipartite consensus or bipartite consensus even if the rooted subgraph is structurally balanced. Surprisingly, it is found that the constrained signed network under different initial conditions may exhibit different types of convergent behaviors.

Initially, the optimal estimates for sensor individuals are acquired using the conventional Kalman filter. Subsequently, the information pair, consisting of the local estimate and the corresponding covariance, is exchanged among their immediate neighbors to achieve cooperative estimation. Due to the constrained network bandwidth, a vector/matrix quantization approach is formulated to quantize the information pair. The output of this quantization establishes a conservative bound for the actual covariance. A two-bitrate periodic coding strategy is proposed, where the encoded bits of the quantizer outputs are divided into two separate parts, namely the most significant and least significant bits, following a periodic transmission principle. It is demonstrated that the estimation preserves a consistency property over the sensor networks as the reported error covariance always serves as an upper bound for the actual error covariance. It is shown that the mean-square estimation errors are bounded when certain conditions regarding collective observability and network connectivity are satisfied. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through a numerical example.},

As such, ( $\gamma,\delta$ )-similarity is a notion that characterizes approximation of input–output behavior, whereas existing notions of simulation target equivalence. Next, as this approximation is specified in terms of the $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ signal norm, ( $\gamma,\delta$ )-similarity allows for integration with existing methods for analysis and synthesis of control systems, in particular, robust control techniques. We characterize the notion of ( $\gamma,\delta$ )-similarity as a linear matrix inequality feasibility problem and derive its interpretation in terms of transfer matrices. Our study on the compositional properties of ( $\gamma,\delta$ )-similarity shows that the notion is preserved through series and feedback interconnections. This highlights its potential application in compositional reasoning, namely abstraction and modular synthesis of large-scale interconnected dynamical systems.

However, the computation of their global optima often faces NP-hardness, and thus only locally optimal solutions may be obtained at best. In this work, we consider the discrete-time finite-horizon optimal control problem in both deterministic and stochastic cases and study the optimization landscapes associated with two different approaches: one-shot and DP. In the deterministic case, we prove that each local minimizer of the one-shot optimization corresponds to some control input induced by a locally minimum control policy of DP, and vice versa. However, with a parameterized policy approach, we prove that deterministic and stochastic cases both exhibit the desirable property that each local minimizer of DP corresponds to some local minimizer of the one-shot optimization, but the converse does not necessarily hold. Nonetheless, under different technical assumptions for deterministic and stochastic cases, if there exists only a single locally minimum control policy, one-shot and DP turn out to capture the same local solution. These results pave the way to understand the performance and stability of local search methods in optimal control.},

  abstract     = {This article builds the theoretical foundations for dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of control-affine dynamical systems by leveraging the theory of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Specifically, control Liouville operators and control occupation kernels are introduced to separate the drift dynamics from the input dynamics. A given feedback controller is represented through a multiplication operator, and a composition of the control Liouville operator and the multiplication operator is used to express the nonlinear closed-loop system as a linear total derivative operator on RKHSs. A spectral decomposition of a finite-rank representation of the total derivative operator yields a DMD of the closed-loop system. The DMD generates a model that can be used to predict the trajectories of the closed-loop system. For a large class of systems, the total derivative operator is shown to be compact provided that the domain and the range RKHSs are selected appropriately. The sequence of models, resulting from increasing-rank finite-rank representations of the compact total derivative operator, is shown to converge to the true system dynamics, provided that sufficiently rich data are available. Numerical experiments are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed technique.},

  abstract     = {Synergistic hybrid feedback refers to a collection of feedback laws that allow for the global asymptotic stabilization of a compact set through the following switching logic: given a collection of Lyapunov functions that are indexed by a logic variable, whenever the currently selected Lyapunov function exceeds the value of another function in the collection by a given margin, then a switch to the corresponding feedback law is triggered. This kind of feedback has been under development over the past decade, and it has led to multiple solutions for global asymptotic stabilization problems on compact manifolds. The contributions of this article include a synergistic controller design in which the logic variable is not necessarily constant between jumps, a synergistic hybrid feedback that is able to tackle the presence of parametric uncertainty, backstepping of adaptive synergistic hybrid feedback, and a demonstration of the proposed solutions to the problem of global obstacle avoidance.},

This article answers this need by providing a frequency-domain framework for algorithm analysis and synthesis, with a particular emphasis on distributed optimization problems. We propose a general class of gradient-based distributed algorithms that can be viewed as interconnected dynamical systems consisting of a linear time-invariant subsystem and a Lur&#39;e-type nonlinear component, thereby enabling analysis and synthesis of such algorithms from a robust control perspective via the usage of the circle criterion and the Zames–Falb theorem. By linking the convergence of an algorithm with the absolute stability of a corresponding Lur&#39;e system, optimization of the algorithmic convergence rate is recast as a Nevanlinna–Pick interpolation problem akin to an $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ optimal control problem. Solutions to such interpolation problems lead to a variety of gradient-based algorithms with optimal and suboptimal convergence rates, and algorithmic complexity judiciously controlled.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the joint state estimation and control problems for unknown linear time-invariant systems subject to both process and measurement noise. The aim is to redesign the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller-based solely on data. The LQG controller comprises a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and a steady-state Kalman observer; while the data-based LQR design problem has been previously studied, constructing the Kalman gain and the LQG controller from noisy data presents a novel challenge. In this work, a data-based formulation for computing the steady-state Kalman gain is proposed based on semidefinite programming (SDP) using some noise-free input-state-output data. To compensate for the offline noise, a relaxed SDP is proposed, upon solving which, a robust observer gain is constructed. In addition, a robust LQG controller is designed based on the observer gain and a data-based LQR gain. The proposed controller is proven to achieve robust global exponential stability for the observer and input-to-state stability for the resultant closed-loop systems under standard conditions. Finally, numerical tests are conducted to validate the proposed controllers&#39; correctness and effectiveness.},

Unlike existing studies that focus on noiseless data, we introduce a distributed data-driven controller that enables all heterogeneous followers to synchronize with a leader&#39;s output trajectory. To handle the noise in the state-input–output data, we develop a data-based polytopic representation for the MAS. We tackle the issue of infeasibility in the set of output regulator equations caused by the noise by seeking approximate solutions via constrained fitting error minimization. This method utilizes measured data and a noise-matrix polytope to ensure near-optimal output synchronization, in the sense of ultimately uniformly boundedness stability. Stability conditions in the form of data-dependent semidefinite programs are derived, providing stabilizing controller gains for each follower. The proposed distributed data-driven control protocol achieves near-optimal output synchronization by ensuring the convergence of the tracking error to a bounded polytope, with the polytope size positively correlated with the noise bound. Numerical tests validate the practical merits of the proposed data-driven design and theory.},

It is, thus, highly desirable to augment existing algorithms such that the impact of adversarial attacks on cooperative networks is at least bounded. We consider a fully decentralized network, where each agent receives a local reward and observes the global state and action. We propose a resilient consensus-based actor-critic algorithm, whereby each agent estimates the team-average reward and value function, and communicates the associated parameter vectors to its immediate neighbors. We show that in the presence of Byzantine agents, whose estimation and communication strategies are completely arbitrary, the estimates of the cooperative agents converge to a bounded consensus value with probability one, provided that there are at most $H$ Byzantine agents in the network that is $(2H+1)$ -robust. Furthermore, we prove that the policy of the cooperative agents converges with probability one to a bounded neighborhood around a stationary point of their team-average objective function under the assumption that the policies of the adversarial agents asymptotically become stationary.},

This article presents an efficient algorithm to tackle the so-called “learn and control while switching between different actuating modes” problem in the linear quadratic setting. Our proposed strategy is constructed upon optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU)-based algorithm equipped with a projection toolbox to keep the algorithm efficient, regretwise. Along the way, we derive an optimum duration for the warm-up phase, thanks to the existence of a stabilizing neighborhood. The stability of the switched system is also guaranteed by designing a minimum average dwell time. The proposed strategy is proved to have a regret bound of $\mathcal {O}(ns\sqrt{T})$ in horizon $T$ with $(ns)$ number of switches, provably outperforming naively applying the basic OFU algorithm.},

A necessary and sufficient condition is proposed, built from the Koopman operator, for the exact identification of CT systems from sampled data. This condition provides a Nyquist–Shannon-like critical frequency for the exact identification of the CT nonlinear dynamical system, which has Koopman invariant spaces. First, it establishes a sufficient condition for a sampling frequency that permits a discretized sequence of samples to discover the underlying system. Second, it establishes a necessary condition for the sampling frequency to avoid system aliasing, which would render the underlying system distinguishable. Finally, unlike the requirement in the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, the CT signal associated with the system need not be band-limited.

The control does not have access to complete state information, but only to noisy state information from the (stochastic) observation model. The dynamics and observation model as well as the objective functional include the expected values of state and control variables, known as the mean-field variables. The main result is the separation between optimal control and state estimation. Specifically, we show that the classical separation principle can be extended to the LQ mean-field type problem, where the optimal solution can be obtained by a simple replacement of the state in the complete information case with the state of the optimal filtering process. The main result is proved by decomposing the original problem into stochastic and mean-field parts leading to an equivalent lifted problem, constructing the optimal filtering process for the lifted problem using the innovation approach, and employing the completion of squares method through the orthogonal projection property of the filtering process.

Different from common research works, which only focus on final position constraints, we model the nonholonomic mobile robot as a rigid body and introduce both of position and orientation constraints for the robot&#39;s final states. In other words, the robot should not only reach the specified position, but also point to the desired orientation simultaneously. The challenge of this problem lies in the underactuation of full-state motion planning, since three states need to be planned by mere two control inputs. To this end, we propose a dynamic vector field (DVF) based on the rigid body modeling. Specifically, the dynamics of the robot orientation is brought into the vector field, implying that the vector field is not static on the 2-D plane anymore, but a dynamic one varying with the attitude angle. Hence, each robot can move along the integral curve of the DVF to arrive at the desired position, and in the meantime, the attitude angle can converge to the specified value following the orientation dynamics. Subsequently, by designing a circular vector field under the framework of the DVF, we further study the obstacle avoidance and multirobot collision avoidance. Finally, numerical simulation and hardware experiment are provided to verify the effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical decision making problems, such as bilevel programs and Stackelberg games, are attracting increasing interest in both the engineering and machine learning communities. Yet, existing solution methods lack either convergence guarantees or computational efficiency, due to the absence of smoothness and convexity. In this work, we bridge this gap by designing a first-order hypergradient-based algorithm for Stackelberg games and mathematically establishing its convergence using tools from nonsmooth analysis. To evaluate the hypergradient , namely, the gradient of the upper-level objectve, we develop an online scheme that simultaneously computes the lower level equilibrium and its Jacobian. Crucially, this scheme exploits and preserves the original hierarchical and distributed structure of the problem, which renders it scalable and privacy-preserving. We numerically verify the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on a large-scale hierarchical demand-response model.},

  abstract     = {Q-learning has become an important part of the reinforcement learning toolkit since its introduction in the dissertation of Chris Watkins in the 1980s. In the original tabular formulation, the goal is to compute exactly a solution to the discounted-cost optimality equation, and thereby, obtain the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process. The goal today is more modest: obtain an approximate solution within a prescribed function class. The standard algorithms are based on the same architecture as formulated in the 1980s, with the goal of finding a value function approximation that solves the so-called projected Bellman equation. While reinforcement learning has been an active research area for over four decades, there is little theory providing conditions for convergence of these Q-learning algorithms, or even existence of a solution to this equation. The purpose of this article is to show that a solution to the projected Bellman equation does exist, provided the function class is linear and the input used for training is a form of $\varepsilon$ -greedy policy with sufficiently small $\varepsilon$ . Moreover, under these conditions it is shown that the Q-learning algorithm is stable, in terms of bounded parameter estimates. Convergence remains one of many open topics for research.},

Unlike previous works that provide specific event-triggered controllers, we provide a framework that characterizes a family of distributed event-triggered controllers leveraging nonsingular edge-potentials to achieve approximate rendezvous while maintaining the initial distance-limited graph. The proposed framework excludes the possibility of Zeno behavior and accommodates the development of self-triggered controllers. The combination of continuous and impulsive dynamics results in a hybrid system, where the closed-loop dynamics of the MAS is presented and analyzed using hybrid differential inclusions. In particular, three distinct hybrid system formulations are presented, where the advantages and disadvantages of each construction are discussed in terms of their solution spaces. The approximate rendezvous problem is recast into a set stabilization problem, and sufficient conditions of the rendezvous set are obtained through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Simulation results are provided to validate the development, where a specific instance of an event trigger mechanism satisfying the requirements of the proposed design achieves approximate rendezvous while preserving the edges of an initially connected communication graph.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that Lie algebra methods are the leading methods for studying controllability of continuous-time nonlinear systems including bilinear systems, where the controllability problems are usually transformed into the transitivity problems of the corresponding Lie algebras. Unfortunately, it is in general a difficult task to check transitivity of Lie algebras, especially in the high-dimensional cases. In this article, we propose a new notion, named near-transitivity. We focus on unconstrained bilinear systems and show that the systems are nearly-controllable if and only if their corresponding Lie algebras are nearly-transitive. That is, even if the Lie algebras are not transitive, they can be nearly-transitive and the systems can still own a very large controllable region nearly covering the whole state space. More importantly, we demonstrate that near-transitivity is easier to check than transitivity. This will be useful in both the theory and applications of controllability of nonlinear systems since verifying near-controllability may suffice for most nonlinear systems. Sufficient algebraic conditions as well as algorithms for checking near-transitivity of unconstrained bilinear systems are presented, which are also generalized to inhomogeneous bilinear systems to derive near-controllability. Furthermore, we apply the presented near-transitivity results to structural bilinear systems to derive necessary and sufficient conditions on structural near-controllability. Examples are given to demonstrate the proposed near-transitivity of this article.},

We first assume that PI is recursively feasible, in the sense that the optimization problems solved at each iteration admit a solution. In this case, we provide novel conditions to establish recursive robust stability properties for a general attractor, meaning that the policies generated at each iteration ensure a robust $\mathcal {KL}$ -stability property with respect to a general state measure. We then derive novel explicit bounds on the mismatch between the (suboptimal) value function returned by PI at each iteration and the optimal one. However, we show by a counterexample that PI may fail to be recursively feasible, disallowing the mentioned stability and near-optimality guarantees. We therefore also present a modification of PI so that recursive feasibility is guaranteed a priori under mild conditions. This modified algorithm, called PI $^{+}$ , is shown to preserve the recursive robust stability when the attractor is compact. In addition, PI $^{+}$ enjoys the same near-optimality properties as its PI counterpart under the same assumptions.},

We provide an upper bound on how long the system can remain under stealthy attack before the safety constraints are violated.

Two linear matrix inequality approaches are proposed, the first one based on the construction of a Lyapunov function that weakly depends on the uncertainty, and the second one based on the construction of an index that quantifies the feasibility of different controllers. The proposed approaches have two main advantages with respect to the existing methods, namely, considering not only state-feedback design for polytopic systems but also output-feedback design for systems depending polynomially on the uncertainty, and providing conditions that are not only sufficient but also necessary under some assumptions. These advantages are illustrated through various examples, where it is shown that the existing methods may be more conservative or may be not applicable.},

A distributed observer of the leader exosystem is key to overcoming these topological obstructions combined with the generic graph topology we consider.

To construct a nominal delay-compensated control law, assuming a known input delay, a three-step backstepping design is used. To build the delay-adaptive boundary control law, the nominal control action is fed with the estimate of the unknown delay, which is generated from a batch least-squares identifier that is updated by an event-triggering mechanism that evaluates the growth of the norm of the system states. As a result of the closed-loop system, the actuator and plant states can be regulated exponentially while avoiding Zeno occurrences. The prescribed-time identification of the unknown delay is also achieved. As far as we know, this is the first delay-adaptive control result for systems governed by heterodirectional hyperbolic PDEs. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated in the control application of a deep-sea construction vessel with cable-payload oscillations and subject to input delay.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the problem of nonlinear (stochastic) filter stability for a hidden Markov model (HMM) with white noise observations. A contribution is the variance decay property, which is used to conclude filter stability. For this purpose, a new notion of the Poincaré inequality (PI) is introduced for the nonlinear filter. PI is related to both the ergodicity of the Markov process and the observability of the HMM. The proofs are based upon a recently discovered minimum variance duality, which is used to transform the nonlinear filtering problem into a stochastic optimal control problem for a backward stochastic differential equation.},

  abstract     = {Despite the fact that many distributed resource allocation (DRA) algorithms have been reported in the literature, it is still unknown how to allocate resources optimally over multiple interacting coalitions. One major challenge in solving such a problem is that the relevance of one coalition&#39;s decision to other coalitions&#39; benefits may lead to conflicts of interest among these coalitions. Within this context, a new game model is formulated in the present note, termed as resource allocation game, where each coalition contains multiple agents cooperating to maximize the coalition-level benefit subject to an intracoalition resource constraint described by a coupled equality. Inspired by techniques such as variable replacement, gradient tracking, and leader-following consensus, a new DRA algorithm is developed. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges linearly to the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the proposed game while satisfying the resource constraint during the whole NE-seeking process. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed allocation algorithm is verified by numerical simulations.},

Although the linear case is well understood, analysis and controller design for nonlinear positive systems remain challenging. Model reduction methods can help tame this problem. Here, we propose a notion of model reduction for a class of positive bilinear systems with (bounded) matrix and exogenous controls. Our reduction, called proper positive lumping, aggregates the original system such that states of the corresponding reduced model represent nonnegative linear combinations of original state variables. In this article, we prove a characterization result showing that the reductions by proper positive lumping are exactly those preserving the optimality of a suitable class of value functions. Moreover, we provide an efficient polynomial-time algorithm for the computation of the minimal lumping. We numerically evaluate our approach by applying it to a number of benchmark case studies.},

To further improve the transient performance during the uncertainty learning, we enrich the information fed to the learning by maximizing the volume of the ellipsoid set. The maximized set volume stimulates the system to actively learn the uncertainties and leads to accelerated uncertainty reduction.

In this article, we consider sufficient conditions for reciprocal and zeroing control barrier functions ensuring safety with probability one and design a control law using the functions. Then, we propose another version of a stochastic zeroing control barrier function to evaluate a probability of a sample path staying in a safe set and confirm the convergence of a specific expectation related to the attractiveness of a safe set. We also show a way of designing a safety-critical control law based on our stochastic zeroing control barrier function.

Meanwhile, a mode-dependent sliding surface is constructed and a switchinglike sliding mode controller is well designed via the triggered sampled states.

It is known that the torque control exerted on the disk combined with the boundary control can make it rotate with the desired angular velocity, and when the angular velocity is greater than $\sqrt{\mu _{1}}\approx \text{3.516}$ , where $\mu _{1}$ is the first eigenvalue of the free beam operator, it is found that there exists at least one positive eigenvalue, so the system can not be stabilized by the collocated static feedback controls only. How to stabilize the system with the higher angular velocity is an interesting problem. In order to improve the admissible high angular velocity, we propose a static feedback composed of collocated and noncollocated boundary measurements on the beam and a nonlinear torque control exerted on the disk. We show that the closed-loop system is well-posed and stable as long as the desired angular velocity of the disk is improved from less than 3.516 to less than $\pi ^{2}$ . This relaxes the limitation 3.516 of the admissible angular velocity of the disk in literature. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control design.},

The nonlinear growth rate under consideration is allowed to contain a continuous function of the system output, and the problem has not been considered under the existing impulsive control framework. By constructing a state transformation, a novel dynamic event-triggered impulsive tracking controller is designed. It is proved that the proposed impulsive controller ensures that the tracking error ultimately converges to an adjustable bounded neighborhood of the origin, and all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are bounded. Furthermore, by introducing a class of shifting functions, an improved dynamic event-triggered impulsive tracking controller is developed to improve tracking performance.

  abstract     = {While barrier Lyapunov function-based approach has been successfully used in adaptive control of uncertain systems with output/state constraints, it is nontrivial to use this method to deal with systems with irregular constraints (where the constraints may appear, disappear, or alternate during system operation). It is in fact an open interesting problem to develop a control method capable of coping with the irregular constraints uniformly. In this note, a unified adaptive control strategy is developed for uncertain systems subject to irregular output constraints. First, we introduce the concept of link function, with which we transform the nondifferentiable constraint into a smooth one. Second, by using several function transformations, and the decision function in particular that bridges the irregular output constraints and the barrier function, we recast the problem of maintaining irregular constraints into the stabilization of the barrier function, which allows different constraint forms to be addressed under a fixed control structure wherein one only needs to select the appropriate decision function and design parameters, eliminating the need for control redesign and stability reanalysis. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by numerical simulations.},

In this work, a dynamic hardware redundancy technique with a performance-based trivial fault detector is proposed to accommodate multiple levels of actuator failures, upon which a unified performance-based fault-tolerant control scheme is developed irrespective of different phases of actuator failures. The proposed fault-tolerant control exhibits several salient features, which include the following: by choosing appropriate performance functions, the controller is developed under a unified control structure against different actuation phases ranging from healthy actuation and moderate failure actuation to post extreme failure actuation; the faulty actuator is replaced with the backup one only in the event of extreme failures, avoiding the unnecessary replacement during moderate actuation failure; and without the need for neural networks or fuzzy systems based approximation, the resultant control scheme is simple in structure and inexpensive in computation.},

In the scheme, we explore the idea of using tracking MPC with artificial references to let agents coordinate their cooperation without external guidance. Each agent combines a tracking MPC with artificial references, the latter penalized by a suitable coupling cost. They solve an individual optimization problem for this artificial reference and an input that tracks it, only communicating the former to its neighbors in a communication graph. This puts the cooperative problem on a different layer than the handling of the dynamics and constraints, loosening the connection between the two. We provide sufficient conditions on the formulation of the cooperative problem and the coupling cost for the closed-loop system to asymptotically achieve it. Since the dynamics and the cooperative problem are only loosely connected, classical results from distributed optimization can be used to this end. We illustrate the scheme&#39;s application to consensus and formation control.},

It is found in the present research that under certain combinations of parameters of the discontinuous homogeneous SM controller and actuator, the chattering is manifested not as periodic but as chaotic oscillations. This work investigates the phenomenon of chaotic chattering through the locus of perturbed relay systems (LPRS) method and the formulated conditions for the periodic solutions found through the LPRS to manifest themselves as periodic motions. Adherence to or violation of these conditions is correlated with the occurrence of periodic or chaotic chattering. The particular controller investigated is a homogeneous SM controller. Bifurcation points in terms of the time constant of the actuator and the relay amplitude are determined.},

  abstract     = {This article considers a strongly connected network of agents, each capable of partially observing and controlling a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system that is jointly observable and controllable. Additionally, agents collaborate to achieve a shared estimated state, computed as the average of their local state estimates. Recent studies suggest that increasing the number of average consensus steps between state estimation updates allows agents to choose from a wider range of state feedback controllers, thereby potentially enhancing control performance. However, such approaches require that agents know the input matrices of all other nodes, and the selection of control gains is, in general, centralized. Motivated by the limitations of such approaches, we propose a new technique where: 1) estimation and control gain design is fully distributed and finite-time; and 2) agent coordination involves a finite-time exact average consensus subroutine, allowing arbitrary selection of the convergence rate of the overall asymptotic estimation process despite the estimator&#39;s distributed nature. We verify our methodology&#39;s effectiveness using illustrative numerical simulations.},

In this article, we consider the problem of distributed control of nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) where the information broadcasts over a network are susceptible to one such imperfection, namely, transmission delays. The design methodology employed is such that the sampling instants (at which agents broadcast information) could be both aperiodic and asynchronous in nature. The broadcasts, upon arrival, are propagated by the agents through dynamical models and these propagates are used in their control protocols. The overall MAS is formulated as a hybrid dynamical system whose stability governs the upper bounds on: first, the sampling interval, namely, the duration between two consecutive broadcasts, and second, the transmission delays that the broadcasts might be prone to. Finally, through a case study on the consensus of Lipschitz nonlinear agents, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the active fault diagnosis problem for linear parameter-varying systems with bounded disturbances. Constrained zonotopes (CZs) are utilized to model the range of the system disturbances, in which case, the system state and output can also be described by CZs. Different models are employed to describe different fault modes. The basic idea of the proposed method is to design proper auxiliary input and inject it into the system to ensure that the system&#39;s output is only within the theoretical output set of a certain system mode. The auxiliary input, which can guarantee fault diagnosis and has minimum energy, is calculated by solving a bilevel programming problem. By replacing the inner programming problem with its necessary and sufficient conditions, the original bilevel programming problem can be transformed into a single-level programming problem. Through variable substitution, linear relaxation, and complementary condition transformation, the obtained single-level programming problem can be transformed into a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. Furthermore, in order to reduce conservatism, an online updating scheme is proposed. The auxiliary input is redesigned at every moment and injected into the system by a selection mechanism. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In contrast to existing MCGs, our problem involves the second-order nonlinear dynamics of players. Due to the second-order nonlinear dynamics, existing Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithms cannot deal with our problem. Also, the second-order nonlinear dynamics and the nonlinear inequality constraints make it difficult to design and analyze distributed algorithms for our problem, because it is hard for the players to satisfy the inequality constraints as a result of the second-order dynamics and the inequality constraints must be satisfied by the NE of the MCGs. In order to control these heterogeneous second-order nonlinear players to autonomously seek the NE of the MCGs, we design a distributed algorithm via gradient descent and state feedback. With the help of Lyapunov stability theory, we analyze the convergence of the algorithm. Under the algorithm, the second-order players globally converge to the NE. Finally, the simulation example of electricity market games verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

As a result, a novel sliding-mode-based observation algorithm is developed, which exhibits desirable properties, such as global finite-time convergence or semiglobal fixed-time convergence. Notably, the method is also capable of reconstructing the unknown inputs without requiring any low-pass filtering or continuous approximations of the discontinuous observer signals.

The proposed algorithm directly uses online data to solve the ALQCP based on an unbiased estimator and an initial stabilizing controller with unknown system dynamics and unmeasurable multiplicative and additive noises. It is shown that the proposed algorithm under a finite length of online data converges to a neighborhood of the solution to the SARE with a probability and the input-to-state stability, and the neighborhood can be arbitrarily small while the probability can be arbitrarily close to one as the length of online data increases.

To meet the PPMs and state constraints, the preassigned performance control-based barrier Lyapunov functions are designated to acquire the performance metrics and the satisfaction of state constraints. The proposed control approach combines the predefined-time control with the recursive design of command-filter backstepping to achieve the preset convergence time based on designing indicators while also ensuring the satisfaction of the desired PPMs and constraint conditions. In addition, the command-filter design eliminates the requirement of proving the continuity of high-order derivatives of the virtual control signals, resulting in a significant reduction in the complexity of stability analyses related to predefined-time convergence of the closed-loop signals. The stability analyses and simulation results of two examples provide support for the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed command-filter predefined-time control approach.},

The disturbances are in the form of trigonometric polynomials with arbitrary unknown amplitudes, unknown initial phases, and known or unknown frequencies. For the case of the known frequencies, we employ the canonical internal model to solve the problem, and, for the case of the unknown frequencies, we combine the canonical internal model and some distributed adaptive control technique to deal with the problem. It is noted that the existing results can only handle constant disturbances by continuous control laws or disturbances with known bounds by discontinuous control laws. The first case is a special case of our result. The second case cannot cover our results because the bounds of our disturbances are unknown. Moreover, our control law is smooth. In addition, we also present the collision avoidance condition on the initial condition of the closed-loop system for each case. Finally, numerical examples are used to illustrate our design.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a dynamic platoon management and cooperative driving framework for a mixed traffic flow consisting of multiple connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and possible human-driven vehicles (HDVs) that can be regarded as the surrounding vehicles (SVs). Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three stages. At the first stage, the cruising information of all the SVs will be collected by the leader CAV through the cellular-vehicle-to-X (C-V2X) infrastructure, while an automatic decision-making driving assistance system(ADMDSS) is constructed to determine the driving states of the platoon. When the HDVs approach the communication range of the platoon, in the second stage, the trajectories of the HDVs will be estimated and the reference trajectory planning for the leader CAV and the cooperative controller design for the follower CAVs will be activated, respectively, by using C-V2X infrastructure. We consider two types of social driving behaviors (SDBs): courteous and rude, where the optimal trajectory estimation for the SDBs will be obtained by the known social preferences of the SVs. While the HDVs enable to impose their social cut-in intentions into the platoon, the ADMDSS will provide a high-level driving guidance to the platoon to adjust the time-varying space error among the CAVs rejecting the potential cut-in behaviors. For this case, the problems of collision avoidance, energy efficiency, and stability of the platoon will be solved at the third stage within a finite time by designing a cooperative trajectory tracking optimization algorithm. Simulation cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

One of the main strengths of ERG is that it does not make use of any online optimization, which makes it an appropriate solution for real-time applications; in particular, it has been shown that ERG has potential to control safety-critical systems that are subject to time-varying constraints. This article proposes a systematic approach for designing an ERG for the control of systems that are subject to the intersections of multiple time-varying concave constraints. Under certain conditions on the change-rate of the constraints and system dynamics, constraints satisfaction and convergence properties are proven rigorously. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation studies on two relevant problems in the field of robotics: 1) automated packaging line and 2) noncooperative household robots.},

The asynchronous switchings are present in the followers, the leader, and the topology, bringing dynamic heterogeneity that yields nonvanishing perturbations which inherently prevent a perfect tracking. To handle the heterogeneity, a distributed dynamic controller with adaptive observers is proposed for each follower. The embedded observers estimate both the dynamics and the state of the leader which may not be directly known by the followers while rule out unwanted merges of asynchronous switchings that yield adverse fast switchings. To deal with the nonvanishing perturbations in the presence of destabilizing effects and disconnected topologies, a piecewise- average-dwell-time-based slow/fast-mixed switching stabilization method is proposed to ensure an ultimately bounded consensus tracking performance for the MAS. We show that the obtained ultimate bound can be made arbitrarily small by properly adjusting the corresponding tunable parameters under a mild assumption.

In this context, a popular metric for analyzing the system-level performance is the price of anarchy (PoA), which measures the loss in efficiency caused by distributed decision making. Over the past two decades, significant effort has been devoted to developing analytical and computational methodologies for characterizing this metric, with remarkable success. However, existing approaches for obtaining PoA bounds either require the solution of intractable programs, or provide bounds that are not tight. Motivated by this gap, our work develops a computationally efficient framework to tightly characterize the PoA in a broad class of problems. Our framework not only recovers and generalizes many existing PoA results, but it also enables the efficient computation of decision-making rules that optimize the PoA—a central component in the design of socio-technological systems.},

Specifically, we consider a general setup with a nonlinear affine physical plant controlled with a perception-based controller that maps both the physical [e.g., inertial measurement units (IMUs)] and perceptual (e.g., camera) sensing to the control input; the system is also equipped with a statistical or learning-based anomaly detector (AD). We model the attacks in the most general form and introduce the notions of attack effectiveness and stealthiness independent of the used AD. In such a setting, we consider attacks with different levels of runtime knowledge about the plant. We find sufficient conditions for the existence of stealthy effective attacks that force the plant into an unsafe region without being detected by any AD. We show that as the open-loop unstable plant dynamics diverges faster and the closed-loop system converges faster to an equilibrium point, the system is more vulnerable to effective stealthy attacks. Also, depending on runtime information available to the attacker, the probability of the attack remaining stealthy can be arbitrarily close to one if the attacker&#39;s estimate of the plant&#39;s state is arbitrarily close to the true state; when an accurate estimate of the plant state is not available, the stealthiness level depends on the control performance in attack-free operation.},

  abstract     = {Extremum seeking, an online model-free optimization algorithm with traditionally exponential convergence, was recently advanced by Poveda and coauthors to fixed-time convergence, using nonsmooth time-invariant feedback. In this article, we introduce an alternative time-varying prescribed-time extremum seeking (PT-ES) approach to reaching the optimum in a user-assignable “prescribed” time (PT), independent of the initial condition of the estimator. Instead of conventional sinusoidal probing signals, we employ “chirpy” perturbations, i.e., sinusoids with growing frequencies. In addition to providing a result for a static input–output map, we provide algorithms for a map in cascade with a delay, a wave partial differential equation (PDE), and a heat/diffusion PDE. The designs are based on the time-varying PT backstepping approach, which transforms the PDE–ordinary-differential-equation cascade into a suitable PT-stabilized target system, and on averaging-based estimates of the gradient and Hessian of the map. Classical averaging does not apply for the analysis of PT-ES algorithms for four reasons: neither is probing periodic, nor is the “average system” exponentially stable, nor is the original system finite-dimensional, nor is the interval of operation infinite. We develop an averaging technique needed for this non-periodic finite-time infinite-dimensional problem. Along with PDE Lyapunov analysis, we show that the input converges to the optimizer in PT. We present three numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for delay-free case as well as for compensation of time-delay and diffusion PDE dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We consider open games where players arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and stay in the game for an exponential random duration with rate $\mu$ . The game evolves in continuous time, where each player $n$ sets an exponential random clock and updates his/her action $a_{n}\in \lbrace 0,\ldots,K\rbrace$ when it expires. The players take independent actions according to local decision rules that, uninterrupted, are designed to converge to an equilibrium. When $\lambda$ is small, the game spends most of the time in a (time-varying) equilibrium. This equilibrium exhibits predictable behavior and can have performance guarantees by design. However, when $\lambda$ is too small, the system is underutilized since not many players are in the game on average. Choosing the maximal $\lambda$ that the game can support while still spending a target fraction $0&amp;lt; \rho &amp;lt; 1$ of the time at equilibrium requires knowing the reward functions. To overcome that, we propose an online learning algorithm that the gamekeeper uses to adjust the probability $\theta$ to admit an incoming player. The gamekeeper only observes whether an action was changed without observing the action or who played it. We prove that our algorithm learns, with probability 1, a $\theta ^{*}$ such that the game is at equilibrium for at least $\rho$ fraction of the time, and no more than $\rho +\varepsilon(\mu,\rho)&amp;lt; 1$ , where we specify $\varepsilon(\mu,\rho)$ .

The dual-loop policy optimization algorithm is shown to be globally and uniformly convergent, and robust against disturbances during the learning process. This robustness property is called small-disturbance input-to-state stability and guarantees that the proposed policy optimization algorithm converges to a small neighborhood of the optimal controller as long as the disturbance at each learning step is relatively small. In addition, when the system dynamics is unknown, a novel model-free off-policy policy optimization algorithm is proposed.

  abstract     = {This article studies the controller synthesis problem for nonlinear control systems under linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications using zonotope techniques. A local-to-global control strategy is proposed for the desired specification expressed as an LTL formula. First, a novel approach is developed to divide the state space into finite zonotopes and constrained zonotopes, which are called cells and allowed to intersect with the neighbor cells. Second, from the intersection relation, a graph among all cells is generated to verify the realization of the accepting path for the LTL formula. The realization verification determines if there is a need for the control design, and also results in finite local LTL formulas. Third, once the accepting path is realized, a novel abstraction-based method is derived for the controller design.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose and solve a social power game, i.e., a strategic game formulated on an opinion dynamics model and in which the agents aim to maximize their social power. As model we consider the concatenated Friedkin–Johnsen (FJ) model, which describes opinion evolution over a sequence of discussion events, while as actions we take the stubbornness coefficients, which can be freely chosen by the agents in order to maximize their social power, here corresponding to the utility function of the game. We show that the optimal solution of the social power game corresponds to an “early mover” strategy, in the sense that being stubborn as much as possible in early meetings allows to achieve the highest social power. This early mover advantage can be explained in terms of a diminishing return law that exists in the concatenated FJ model.},

  abstract     = {We propose a method for analyzing the distributed random coordinate descent algorithm for solving separable resource allocation problems in the context of an open multiagent system, where agents can be replaced during the process. In particular, we characterize the evolution of the distance to the minimizer in expectation by following a time-varying optimization approach which builds on two components. First, we establish the linear convergence of the algorithm in closed systems, in terms of the estimate toward the minimizer, for general graphs and appropriate step-size. Second, we estimate the change of the optimal solution after a replacement, in order to evaluate its effect on the distance between the current estimate and the minimizer. From these two elements, we derive stability conditions in open systems and establish the linear convergence of the algorithm toward a steady-state expected error. Our results enable to characterize the tradeoff between speed of convergence and robustness to agent replacements, under the assumptions that local functions are smooth, strongly convex, and have their minimizers located in a given ball. The approach proposed in this article can moreover be extended to other algorithms guaranteeing linear convergence in closed system.},

  abstract     = {Logical dynamic games (LDGs) are a class of dynamic games that incorporate logical dynamics to describe the evolution of external states. Such games can be found in a wide range of natural and engineered systems, such as the Boolean network of lactose operon in Escherichia coli . However, little attention has been paid to LDGs in the control community. This article aims at developing a framework for the analysis and synthesis of LDGs under finite-horizon criteria. First, a general mathematical model of LDGs is constructed. Using dynamic programming theory, we prove that an LDG can be decomposed as a series of time-sliced static games, and the existence of pure dynamic Nash equilibrium (DNE) is proved to be equivalent to the existence of pure Nash equilibria of the decomposed time-sliced static games. To disentangle the circular dependence in the DNE calculation, a backward recursive method is proposed. Second, the concept of logical dynamic potential games (LDPGs) is proposed, and the connection between an LDG and its corresponding optimal control problem is established. Three verification conditions for a given LDG to be LDPG are presented, including time-sliced condition, closed-path condition, and potential equation condition. And a recursive algorithm is further designed for the verification of LDPGs via potential equation conditions. Third, to seek time-independent verification conditions, LDGs with action-independent transition properties are investigated. We prove that, if the auxiliary game constructed by the stage cost function is a state-based potential game, then the LDG is an LDPG. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is demonstrated by some numerical examples.},

A linear parametric state-space model, taking into account both time-delay effects from the classical $n-\tau$ model and low-pass filtering effects, models the flame subsystem. For the acoustics, a distributed model taking into account variations in the cross-sectional area along the duct is developed and written as a $2\times 2$ linear hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) system. Next, a full-state feedback control law is proposed, designed by first mapping the considered plant into a simplified partial differential equation - ordinary differential equation (PDE-ODE) cascade, for which control design is a solved problem. Subsequently, the observer is designed by mapping the estimation error dynamics directly into a stable target PDE-ODE cascade. Combining the full-state feedback control law and observer, we arrive at an output feedback controller. A simulation example to demonstrate the theory is presented, where the full-state feedback controller, observer, and output feedback controller are shown to stabilize and estimate the pressure, velocity, and heat release rate.},

We propose decentralized consensus protocols that, using such intermittent information obtained at communication times, globally and asymptotically drives the values of their states to an agreement value, with stability and robustness to perturbations on the dynamics, the information exchanged over the network, and the communication times. Using stability analysis tools for hybrid systems, we recast the consensus problem as a set stabilization problem and leverage Lyapunov stability tools for the analysis of the networked system, both in the nominal and perturbed cases. When communication between the agents occurs synchronously, we show that the set of points characterizing consensus is globally exponentially stable, and, under some mild additional conditions, is partially pointwise globally exponentially stable. On the other hand, when communication occurs asynchronously, we show global asymptotic stability of consensus, for which we exploit well-posedness of the hybrid system modeling the network and an hybrid invariance principle. Results certifying robustness of the proposed consensus protocols, to a wide class of perturbations, are presented. Numerical examples illustrate the main results.},

  abstract     = {Recently introduced distributed zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) algorithms have shown their utility in distributed reinforcement learning (RL). Unfortunately, in the gradient estimation process, almost all of them require random samples with the same dimension as the global variable and/or require evaluation of the global cost function, which may induce high estimation variance for large-scale networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed zeroth-order algorithm by leveraging the network structure inherent in the optimization objective, which allows each agent to estimate its local gradient by local cost evaluation independently, without use of any consensus protocol. The proposed algorithm exhibits an asynchronous update scheme, and works for stochastic nonconvex optimization with a possibly nonconvex feasible domain based on the block coordinate descent method. The algorithm is later employed as a distributed model-free RL algorithm for distributed linear quadratic regulator design. We provide an empirical validation of the proposed algorithm to benchmark its performance on convergence rate and variance against a centralized ZOO algorithm.},

The proposed navigation approach relies on a hybrid feedback that guarantees global asymptotic stabilization of a target location while ensuring the forward invariance of the modified obstacle-free workspace.

In virtue of this, a two-layer network perspective is adopted in studying the nodal consensus, where it is shown that the behavior of edge communication is essentially an image of a finite-gain $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ -stable operator acting on the node-layer network, whose operator norm is limited by the nodal dynamics, the edge dynamics and the communication topologies of both the node-layer and the edge-layer. Then, the robust nodal consensus subject to edge communications against additive nodal uncertainties is discussed. The quantitative relationship of the nodal dynamics, the edge dynamics, the structure of the two-layer communication network and the robustness against the nodal uncertainties and the edge-communication uncertainties are characterized.

  abstract     = {Secrecy encoding for remote state estimation in the presence of adversarial eavesdroppers is a well studied problem. Typical existing secrecy encoding schemes rely on the transmitter&#39;s knowledge of the remote estimator&#39;s current performance. This performance measure is often shared via packet receipt acknowledgments. However, in practical situations the acknowledgment channel may be susceptible to interference from an active adversary, resulting in the secrecy encoding scheme failing. Aiming to achieve a reliable state estimate for a legitimate estimator while ensuring secrecy, we propose a secrecy encoding scheme without the need for packet receipt acknowledgments. Our encoding scheme uses a prearranged scheduling sequence established at the transmitter and legitimate receiver. We transmit a packet containing either the state measurement or encoded information for the sestimate legitimate user. The encoding makes the packet appear to be the state but is designed to damage an eavesdropper&#39;s estimate. The prearranged scheduling sequence and encoding is chosen psuedorandom. We analyze the performance of our encoding scheme against a class of eavesdropper, and show conditions to force the eavesdropper to have an unbounded estimation performance. Further, we provide a numerical illustration and apply our encoding scheme to an application in power systems.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the consensus problem of linear discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) under the conditions of input constraints and bounded time-varying communication delays. We propose a novel consensus framework for such constrained MASs that incorporates an offline optimal consensus design for unconstrained systems to achieve optimal consensus convergence, along with an online robust distributed model predictive control (DMPC) to accommodate constraints. Our framework accomplishes near-optimal consensus performance by minimizing the divergence between the online DMPC input and the predesigned optimal consensus input, all while adhering to control input constraints. Notably, we explicitly integrate the knowledge of communication topology into the offline consensus protocol design, thereby enhancing the analysis of consensus convergence in MASs. More specifically, each agent is equipped with an offline consensus protocol based on the estimated states of its immediate neighbors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that estimation errors propagated over time due to imprecise neighboring information remain bounded under mild assumptions. In addition, we confirm that, with the appropriate design of the cost function and constraints, the feasibility of the related optimization problem can be recursively assured. We also provide a consensus convergence result for the constrained MASs under conditions of bounded varying delays. Lastly, we present two numerical examples that verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed consensus algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Synthesis from linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications provides assured controllers for systems operating in stochastic and potentially adversarial environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model of the environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach to derive controllers from given LTL specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We model the problem as a stochastic game (SG) between the controller and the environment; we then learn optimal strategies that maximize the probability of satisfying the LTL specifications against the worst-case environment behavior. We first construct a product game using the deterministic parity automaton (DPA) translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving distinct rewards and discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA, we reduce the maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL specification into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the product game; this enables the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an optimal controller strategy. To address the scalability issues arising when the number of sets defining the acceptance condition of the DPA, usually referred to as colors, is large; we propose a lazy color generation method where distinct rewards and discount factors are utilized only when needed, and an approximate method where the controller eventually focuses on only one color. In several case studies, we show that our approach is scalable to a wide range of LTL formulas, significantly outperforming existing methods that learn controllers from LTL specifications in SGs.},

In these algorithms, a collection of nodes performs several local updates based on their local data, and then, they communicate with each other to exchange estimate information. While there have been many studies on distributed local methods with centralized network connections, there has been less work on decentralized networks. In this work, we propose and investigate a locally updated decentralized method called local exact-diffusion (LED). We establish the convergence of LED in both convex and nonconvex settings for the stochastic online setting. Our convergence rate improves over the rate of existing decentralized methods. When we specialize the network to the centralized case, we recover the state-of-the-art bound for centralized methods. We also link LED to several other independently studied distributed methods, including Scaffnew, FedGate, and VRL-SGD. In addition, we numerically investigate the benefits of local updates for decentralized networks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A cascade connection comprising a delay, a partial differential equation (PDE), and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is referred to as “distributed” if an integral operator of the functional state of the delay or the PDE enters, as a scalar, the next system in the cascade, or if the ODE state acts as an input to the PDE throughout the PDE&#39;s domain. While boundary control of systems involving PDEs or delays typically calls for the PDE backstepping approach, such “distributed” interconnections call for the PDE forwarding approach. The cascaded triple consisting of a delay, a parabolic PDE, and an ODE can constitute nine (3 × 3) distinct interconnections and each of the nine structures is “doubly distributed” if both of its two connections are distributed. We focus on the most interesting three of the nine possible structures and present mixed backstepping-forwarding designs of controllers and observers. We first propose controllers to exponentially stabilize delay-PDE-ODE and PDE-delay-ODE cascades. Then, we introduce an observer to estimate the states of PDE-ODE systems with sensor delays. Besides advancing the backstepping-forwarding design for “doubly-distributed” systems, we do so with the aid of the input-to-state stability approach for parabolic PDEs. This enables proving stability without constructing Lyapunov functions, as well as proving stability in both square-integral and supremum spatial norms. Our results are novel even for the particular cases of delay-free cascades. Simulations illustrate our theory.},

Despite years of efforts, these issues have not been fully addressed. In this article, we develop an output-based adaptive distributed observer for a class of uncertain linear leader systems over jointly connected switching networks. Our design consists of two steps. First, we develop an exponentially convergent estimator to estimate both the state and the unknown parameter vector of the leader system. Second, we design a state-based adaptive distributed observer for the exponentially convergent estimator over jointly connected switching networks. It turns out that such a two-step design overcomes all the three obstacles. As an application, we solve the cooperative output regulation problem for linear multiagent systems subject to an uncertain leader system.},

The existence of a CBF is defined to be equivalent to the feasibility of the optimal feedback controller. Polynomial optimization problems based on sums of squares are formulated that can be used to certify that a given function is a CBF.

We do not require the exact dynamical model or the switching signal, and as a consequence, we aim at solving uniform stabilization problems, in which the feedback is stabilizing for all possible switching sequences. In order to generalize the solution obtained from trajectories to the actual system, probabilistic guarantees on the obtained quadratic or SOS Lyapunov function are derived in the spirit of scenario optimization. For the quadratic Lyapunov technique, the generalization relies on a geometric analysis argument, while, for the SOS Lyapunov technique, we follow a sensitivity analysis argument. In order to deal with high-dimensional systems, we also develop a parallelized scheme for the proposed approach. We show that, with some modifications, the data-driven quadratic Lyapunov technique can be extended to linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control design.

The proposed framework is based on a notion of so-called transition subbarrier certificates constructed for each switched subsystem, by employing which one can compositionally synthesize safety controllers for interconnected networks over (in)finite time horizons. In our proposed scheme, we leverage dissipativity-type compositional conditions to compositionally construct transition barrier certificates for interconnected networks based on their corresponding subbarrier certificates of individual subsystems. We show that the provided compositionality conditions can utilize the structure of the interconnection topology and be potentially satisfied independently of the number or gains of subsystems. We then utilize the constructed transition barrier certificates and quantify upper bounds on the probability that the interconnected network reaches certain unsafe regions in (in)finite time horizons. For nonlinear stochastic systems with polynomial dynamics, we employ sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs to search for stochastic storage certificates of each switching mode with its independent supply rate . We then focus on a particular class of nonlinear stochastic switched systems whose nonlinearities satisfy some linear-growth restriction and propose a constructive approach to search for storage certificates of each mode via satisfying some matrix inequalities. We demonstrate our proposed results by applying them to a fully interconnected network of 400 nonlinear switched subsystems (totally 800 dimensions) accepting multiple supply rates and multiple storage certificates with dwell-time conditions.},

The control design for multivariable systems is challenging because feedback controllers can usually affect all the transmission paths concurrently. Improving the performance of some transmission paths might sacrifice the performance of others; therefore, the disturbance response decoupling theorem was proposed to keep specific transmission paths unchanged while improving others. However, an independent and concurrent control design for all transmission paths remains unavailable. This article proposes the HDRD theorem, which permits independent control designs for multiple transmission paths and integration without cross influences.

Specifically, for various (generally time-varying) choices channel gain matrices, we study the tradeoff relationship between 1) the mean-square estimation error attainable by the classical Kalman–Bucy filter, and 2) the mutual information between the source process and its Kalman–Bucy estimate. We then formulate a novel “optimal channel gain control problem” where the objective is to control the channel gain matrix strategically to minimize the weighted sum of these two performance metrics. To develop insights into the optimal solution, we first consider the problem of controlling a time-varying channel gain over a finite time interval. A necessary optimality condition is derived based on Pontryagin&#39;s minimum principle. For a scalar system, we show that the optimal channel gain is a piecewise constant signal with at most two switches. We also consider the problem of designing the optimal time-invariant gain to minimize the average cost over an infinite time horizon. A novel semidefinite programming heuristic is proposed and the exactness of the solution is discussed.},

The noise can be continuous or it may contain jumps.

The cost is assumed to be quadratic in both the state and the control. The optimal control for steering the covariance from some initial to some final value is provided. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control is shown.

  abstract     = {For an infinite-horizon control problem, the optimal control can be represented by the stable manifold of the characteristic Hamiltonian system of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation in a semiglobal domain. In this article, we first theoretically prove that if an approximation is sufficiently close to the exact stable manifold of the HJB equation in a certain sense, then the control derived from this approximation stabilizes the system and is nearly optimal. Then, based on the theoretical result, we propose a deep learning algorithm to approximate the stable manifold and compute optimal feedback control numerically. The algorithm relies on adaptive data generation through finding trajectories randomly within the stable manifold. Such kind of algorithm is grid-free basically, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through two examples: Stabilizing the Reaction Wheel Pendulums and controlling the parabolic Allen-Cahn equation.},

It is worth pointing out that the existing results are suitable for highly nonlinear networks neither based on PICS nor considering the time-varying delay. Given this, the existence of the unique global solution of HNDSNs under PICS is discussed, and then a stabilization criterion is derived by utilizing a modified Lyapunov function.

However, the potential optimal solutions are simultaneously subject to set constraints and two kinds of equality constraints, i.e., individual equality constraint and aggregate equality constraint, whereas their involved constraint parameters are privately available to individual agents. With a proper coordinate transformation, a distributed optimization protocol is synthesized by introducing proper internal dynamics. Under the Lyapunov framework, it is shown with a convex theory that the synthesized distributed protocol enables the multiagent system to achieve the concerned constrained optimization objective. An example is finally given to confirm the optimization effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {We propose the first method that determines the exact worst-case execution time (WCET) for implicit linear model predictive control (MPC). Such WCET bounds are imperative when MPC is used in real time to control safety-critical systems. The proposed method applies when the quadratic programming solver in the MPC controller belongs to a family of well-established active-set solvers. For such solvers, we leverage a previously proposed complexity certification framework to generate a finite set of “archetypal” optimization problems; we prove that these archetypal problems form an execution-time equivalent cover of all possible problems; that is, that they capture the execution time for solving any possible optimization problem that can be encountered online. Hence, by solving just these archetypal problems on the hardware on which the MPC is to be deployed, and by recording the execution times, we obtain the exact WCET. In addition to providing formal proofs of the methods efficacy, we validate the method on an MPC example where an inverted pendulum on a cart is stabilized. The experiments highlight the following advantages compared with classical WCET methods: first, in contrast to classical static methods, our method gives the exact WCET; second, in contrast to classical measurement-based methods, our method guarantees a correct WCET estimate and requires fewer measurements on the hardware.},

This relies on a random sampling of the possibly infinite number of constraints induced by uncertainties in the parameters of an optimization problem. Solving the resulting random program yields a solution for which the quality is measured in terms of the probability of violating the constraints for a random value of the uncertainties, typically unseen before. Another central issue is the determination of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of random constraints (or scenarios) that one must consider in order to guarantee a certain reliability. In this article, we introduce an additional margin in the constraints and analyze the probability of violation of solutions to the modified random programs. In particular, using tools from statistical learning theory, we show that the sample complexity of a class of problems does not explicitly depend on the number of variables.

The zeros in question are unstable invariant zeros and the zero at infinity. These zeros are the Smith invariant of the transfer matrix of the given stable system, which is a proper and stable rational matrix. Since the action of any stability-preserving state feedback can be represented by the multiplication of the system transfer matrix on the right by a proper and stable rational matrix, called a cascade compensator, the study of the control problem amounts to the study of Smith invariants of a product of two integral matrices. However, only cascade compensators that can be implemented using state feedback are of interest. This is why the solvability conditions also depend on the system&#39;s column minimal indices. It turns out that the existing infinite and unstable invariant zeros cannot be displaced; only their multiplicity can be increased, and new zeros can be created.

Low-level users can observe only the occurrence of a subset of events. On the contrary, high-level users can observe the occurrence of all the events affecting the system dynamics. A system is said noninterferent if low-level users cannot infer the occurrence of those events that are observable only by high-level users.

Some inherent properties of the Heisenberg system, e.g., the skew–symmetric/diagonal structure, are exploited to obtain a simple–to–tune and bounded control that ensures the finite–time convergence to any point of the state space outside of a zero–measure set. In addition, the resulting controller is globally bounded, and this bound can be fixed independently of the set of initial conditions. Contrasting with other approaches, this design allows us to provide the estimation of an upper bound of the settling–time function. Moreover, for a particular set of parameters, the exact settling–time function is recovered, and a predefined convergence time can be selected. Furthermore, some robustness analysis is provided, considering nonvanishing matched perturbations, leading to the design conditions for ensuring exact finite–time convergence. The performance of the proposed controller is illustrated by numerical simulations and comparisons.},

On the other part, consider the sampled-data control version of it. Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that the optimal state of the sampled-data problem converges uniformly to $x^*$ as the norm of the partition tends to zero. Moreover, applying the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) to both problems, we prove that, if $x^*$ has a unique weak extremal lift with a costate $p$ that is normal, then the costate of the sampled-data problem converges uniformly to $p$ . In other words, under a normality assumption, control sampling commutes, at the limit of small partitions, with the application of the PMP.},

  abstract     = {A novel discontinuous observer design for nonlinear systems, whether stable or not, is presented in this article; it removes former limitations on matching and minimum-phase conditions, Lipschitz bounds, and linearity of outputs. Based on a pair of diffeomorphisms an observer error system can be written whose nonlinear nominal model depends entirely on the error, input, and output signals, thus allowing error-dependent domains of attraction where unstable signals are estimated. Nonlinear nominal models constitute the key for the proposal power and flexibility; they are handled via convex embedding of nonlinearities and the direct Lyapunov method. The discontinuous nature of the observer makes it insensitive to matched signals; the influence of unmatched terms is attenuated via $\mathscr {H}_\infty$ techniques. All design conditions are in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The examples illustrate the advantages over the existing methodologies even for unstable nonminimum-phase systems that do not hold the standard matching or Lipschitz conditions.},

In particular, results concerning the robustification and the quantized sampled-data implementation of tracking controllers are provided for nonlinear systems in control-affine form. Inspired by the well-known notion of steepest descent feedbacks, the novel notion of steepest tracking feedback (STF) is introduced and the input-to-state stability (ISS) redesign method is used in order to design a new control term able to attenuates the effects of bounded actuation disturbances and of suitably bounded observation errors. Then, it is shown that the digital implementation of STFs (continuous or not), robustified via the ISS redesign methodology, ensures the semiglobal practical stability of the related quantized sampled-data closed-loop system, with arbitrarily small final target ball of the origin. Time-varying sampling intervals and the nonuniform quantization in the input/output channels are allowed.

Most results in the literature are based on commutativity and the Lie algebraic results of this note generalize the existing results. Furthermore, using the first result, we prove a Lie algebraic criterion involving the system matrices. We also prove a Lyapunov function-based sufficient condition for the exponential stability of SDLS systems and show that this result is equivalent to the existing Lyapunov function-based sufficient condition in the literature. Using this result, we show that an SDLS system with a common descriptor matrix satisfying the Lie algebraic criterion admits a common quadratic Lyapunov function. Finally, we extend the commutativity-based result for SDLS systems involving two subsystems and a common descriptor matrix in the literature to SDLS systems involving finitely many, but arbitrary number of subsystems.},

We present necessary and sufficient conditions for LES of a trajectory on a Riemannian manifold by analyzing the complete lift of the system along the given trajectory. These conditions are coordinate-free, which reveal fundamental relationships between exponential stability and incremental stability in a local sense. We then apply these results to design tracking controllers and observers for Euler–Lagrangian systems on manifolds. A notable advantage of our design is that it visibly reveals the effect of curvature on system dynamics, and hence suggests compensation terms in the controller and observer. In addition, we revisit some well-known intrinsic observer problems using our proposed method, which largely simplifies the analysis compared with existing results.},

Nevertheless, the existing body of research pertaining to constraints has predominantly focused on continuous-time systems, with limited attention given to discrete-time systems. To address this gap, we propose a novel transformation method capable of converting the consensus error constraint into an input constraint, leading to the development of an effective controller.

We develop an optimal control theory for such design by adding the requirement to minimize the $H_{2}$ norm of a closed-loop transfer function. Within the framework of eigenstructure assignment, the optimal control is proven identical to the standard $H_{2}$ control in form. However, the solution to the Riccati equation for the linear quadratic regulator is not stabilizing. Instead, it partially stabilizes the closed-loop dynamics excluding the zero dynamics. The optimal control architecture is shown to have the feedback of the deviation from the subspace of the zero dynamics and the feedforward of the control input to remain in the subspace.},

Then, to protect the privacy of initial states from disclosure, the edge-based mutually independent standard white noise is added to each communication channel. Further, to attenuate the effect of noise on consensus control, we propose a stochastic approximation-type protocol for each agent. Based on stochastic analysis and graph theory, we analyze the asymptotic property and convergence accuracy of the consensus error, the privacy of the privacy-preserving scheme, and the Zeno behavior of the event-triggered mechanism.

Under certain assumptions on the controller structure, local asymptotic stability of the origin is also guaranteed. Two sets of triggering conditions are proposed, one for the case where the exact center manifold is known and the other for the case where only an approximation of the center manifold is computable.

In this work, we propose a linear MPC approach that minimizes the probability that linear state constraints are violated in the presence of additive uncertainty. This is achieved by first determining a set of inputs that minimize the probability of constraint violation. Then, this resulting set is used to define admissible inputs for the optimal control problem. Recursive feasibility is guaranteed and input-to-state stability is proved under assumptions.

  abstract     = {The present article proposes a general framework for the analysis of constraints satisfaction with respect to the trajectories of a dynamical system. The results are presented in a discrete-time framework and pertain to the class of set-theoretic methods. The main objective is to go beyond the state of the art by characterizing the intermittent constraint satisfaction along the evolution of the trajectories of a dynamical system. Two relaxed notions are introduced in this sense, one characterizing the validation of constraints within a given finite window and the other imposing the validation after a fixed number of time-steps following a violation. The constraint satisfaction with respect to a controlled trajectory will then be extended to a set of constraints and then to tubes of trajectories. It is shown that all these notions can be accordingly anchored to the well-known controlled positive set invariance, thus offering a generalized framework for the analysis of dynamical systems in a set-theoretic framework. This technical note is completed with illustrations of the constructions on both linear and nonlinear case.},

Under this way, the necessary and sufficient criterion for the fixed-time trajectory controllability of DMJBCNs is derived. Then, constructing another augmented representation for DMJBCNs, the criterion for the finite-time state controllability is presented. Specially, focusing on DMJBCNs with constant delays, by decomposing subsystems and computing the expectation forms piecewise, extra nonaugmented criterion for the finite-time state controllability is proposed, where the iterative complexity is further reduced to $O(N)$ .

We introduce a value approximator to recursively reconstruct a terminal cost function and reformulate an infinite time optimization problem to a finite time one. This work proposes a novel controller design approach, and shows its recursive feasibility and stability. Moreover, the convergence of closed-loop trajectory and the optimality of steady trajectory as iterations proceed to the infinity are proven for general nonlinear systems. Simulation and comparison results show the lower storage requirement of the proposed control method than two state-of-the-art methods. Its resulting trajectory is validated to achieve the optimality.},

  abstract     = {A new fault accommodation scheme is proposed for a class of nonlinear uncertain systems against multiple process faults. Different from the traditional fault detection information triggered static fault accommodation scheme for dealing with single batch of fault, a targeted and dynamic fault accommodation scheme is proposed based on the availability and quality of the fault information extracted by fault detection and isolation modules. A nominal controller is designed to maintain the essential tracking performance before a fault is detected, and it is reconfigured by the adaptive fault accommodation controller after fault detection. To deal with multiple process faults, the fault information acquisition based on fault detection and isolation modules is first formulated by fault isolation modes, including zero fault isolation, partial fault isolation, full fault isolation, missed fault isolation, and initialized fault isolation. With the established fault isolation modes, the dynamic fault accommodation scheme is proposed, where the adaptive fault accommodation controller updates synchronously with respect to the change of the available fault isolation modes. The performance of the closed-loop control system under different fault accommodation scenarios is rigorously analyzed. One example is used to show the effectiveness and properties of the proposed controllers.},

Then, the consensus problem for polynomial systems can be converted into a sum-of-squares programming problem, yielding polynomial Lyapunov functions efficiently to realize the consensus criterion verification. The benefits of our method are twofold. One is the automatic verification of consensus for the heterogeneous multiagent systems, for which the widely used quadratic Lyapunov functions may not exist.

In this article, we introduce single-input boundary feedback designs for a linear 1-D hyperbolic system with two counterconvecting PDEs and $n$ equations (infinite-dimensional ODEs) with zero characteristic speed. The inclusion of zero-speed states, which we refer to as atachic , may result in the nonstabilizability of the plant. We give a verifiable condition for the model to be stabilizable and design a full-state backstepping controller, which exponentially stabilizes the origin in the $\mathcal {L}^{2}$ sense. In particular, to employ the backstepping method in the presence of atachic states, we use an invertible Volterra transformation only for the PDEs with nonzero speeds, leaving the zero-speed equations unaltered in the target system input-to-state stable with respect to the decoupled and stable counterconvecting nonzero-speed equations. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design.},

We show a duality with more classical problems which amount to minimizing the $L^{1}$ cost under the state constraint given by an upper bound on the $L^\infty$ norm of the output. More precisely, we provide a result linking the value functions of these two problems, as functions of the levels of the two kind of constraints. This is obtained for initial conditions at which lower semicontinuity of the value functions can be guaranteed, and is completed with optimality considerations. When the duality holds, we show that the two problems have the same optimal controls. Furthermore, we provide structural assumptions on the dynamics under which the semicontinuity of the value functions can be established.

In this article, we consider a setup where rather than committing to a fixed and nonadaptive information sharing protocol (e.g., periodic sharing or no sharing, etc.), agents can dynamically decide at each time step whether to share information with each other and incur the resulting communication cost. This setup requires a joint design of agents&#39; communication and control strategies in order to optimize the tradeoff between communication costs and the control objective. We first show that agents can ignore a big part of their private information without compromising the system performance. We then provide a common-information-approach-based solution for the strategy optimization problem. This approach relies on constructing a fictitious partially observable markov decision process (POMDP) whose solution (obtained via a dynamic program) characterizes the optimal strategies for the agents. We extend our solution to incorporate time-varying packet-drop channels and constraints on when and how frequently agents can communicate.},

To address the problem of input delay tolerance (IDT), we first present the existence of the solutions for a class of continuous stochastic time-delay systems and establish almost sure forward completeness under appropriate homogeneity conditions. Using the theory of stochastic homogeneous systems, we then prove that for stochastic nonlinear systems with dominant homogeneity of degree zero, $l$ th moment asymptotic stabilizability by homogeneous feedback is preserved in the presence of limited input delay. As a consequence, new results are obtained on the IDT for certain stochastic nonlinear systems with input delay, such as lower-triangular, upper-triangular, and nontriangular systems with inherent nonlinearity.},

Hyperproperties can express several specifications of interest for cyber–physical systems—such as opacity, robustness, and noninterference—which cannot be expressed using linear time properties. This article presents for the first time a discretization-free approach for the formal verification of discrete-time dynamical systems against hyperproperties. The proposed approach involves the decomposition of complex hyperproperties into several verification conditions by exploiting the automata-based structures corresponding to the complements of the original specifications. These verification conditions are then discharged by synthesizing so-called augmented barrier certificates , which provide certain safety guarantees for the underlying system. For systems with polynomial-type dynamics, we present a sound procedure to synthesize polynomial-type augmented barrier certificates by reducing the problem to sum-of-squares optimizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches on two physical case studies against two important hyperproperties: initial-state opacity and initial-state robustness.},

  abstract     = {Average consensus protocols play a central role in distributed systems and decision-making, such as distributed information fusion, distributed optimization, distributed estimation, and control. A key advantage of these protocols is that agents exchange and reveal their state information only to their neighbors. In its basic form, the goal of average consensus protocols is to compute an aggregate such as the average of network data; however, existing protocols could lead to leakage of individual agent data, thus leading to privacy concerns in scenarios involving sensitive information. In this article, we propose novel (noiseless) privacy-preserving-distributed algorithms for multiagent systems to reach an average consensus. The main idea of the algorithms is that each agent runs a (small) network with a carefully crafted structure and dynamics to form a network of networks that conforms to the interagent connectivity imposed by the agent communication graph. Together with a reweighting of the dynamic parameters dictating the interagent dynamics and the initial states, we show that it is possible to ensure that agent values reach appropriate consensus while ensuring the privacy of individual agent data. Furthermore, we show that, under mild assumptions, it is possible to design networks with similar characteristics in a distributed fashion. Finally, we illustrate the proposed schemes in a variety of example scenarios.},

According to the finite-interval bound and the previous access node, a channel scheduling mechanism is established to periodically orchestrate the communication between controller and actuators, where the access node is selected point by point via the round-robin protocol. Afterward, a 2-D sliding function involving the present state and two previous partial states is constructed and the sliding mode controller is designed by means of the triggered states and scheduling signals.

Unstable inverse models present a challenge in that useful feedforward control trajectories cannot be generated by directly propagating them. Stable inversion is a process for generating useful trajectories from unstable inverses by handling their stable and unstable modes separately. Piecewise affine (PWA) systems are a popular framework for modeling complicated dynamics. The primary contributions of this article are closed-form inverse formulas for a general class of PWA models, and stable inversion methods for these models. Both contributions leverage closed-form model representations to prove sufficient conditions for solution existence and uniqueness, and to develop solution computation methods. The result is implementable feedforward control synthesis from PWA models with either stable or unstable inverses. In practice, feedforward control alone may yield substantial tracking errors due to mismatch between the known system model and the unknowable complete system physics. Iterative learning control (ILC) is a technique for achieving robustness to model error in feedforward control.

Then, the properties of CCISs and their relation to common eigenvectors are revealed. The existence of common eigenvectors leads to the existence of CCIS, but not vice versa, so the established CCIS can reveal the structural properties of multiple matrices better than common eigenvectors can. The established CCIS is applied to the reducibility of Fornasini–Marchesini (F-M) state-space models, i.e., the necessary and sufficient conditions and the related algorithm for reducibility of F-M models are developed.

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of learning safe policies for probabilistic-constrained reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, a safe policy or controller is one that, with high probability, maintains the trajectory of the agent in a given safe set. We establish a connection between this probabilistic-constrained setting and the cumulative-constrained formulation that is frequently explored in the existing literature. We provide theoretical bounds elucidating that the probabilistic-constrained setting offers a better tradeoff in terms of optimality and safety (constraint satisfaction). The challenge encountered when dealing with the probabilistic constraints, as explored in this work, arises from the absence of explicit expressions for their gradients. Our prior work provides such an explicit gradient expression for probabilistic constraints which we term Safe Policy Gradient-REINFORCE (SPG-REINFORCE). In this work, we provide an improved gradient SPG-Actor–Critic that leads to a lower variance than SPG-REINFORCE, which is substantiated by our theoretical results. A noteworthy aspect of both SPGs is their inherent algorithm independence, rendering them versatile for application across a range of policy-based algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a safe primal-dual algorithm that can leverage both SPGs to learn safe policies. It is subsequently followed by theoretical analyses that encompass the convergence of the algorithm, as well as the near-optimality and feasibility on average. In addition, we test the proposed approaches by a series of empirical experiments. These experiments aim to examine and analyze the inherent tradeoffs between the optimality and safety, and serve to substantiate the efficacy of two SPGs, as well as our theoretical contributions.},

First, it advocates employing the Lyapunov redesign in the FTC design with the unit SMC, resulting in a generation of a discontinuous control signal. The article establishes novel conditions for system insensibility concerning the norm of actuator faults. To address chattering and reduce energy consumption, an alternative FTC design is proposed, leveraging a multivariable version of the super-twisting algorithm, which generates a continuous signal. Additionally, a novel methodology for gain selection is developed to ensure increased tolerance to actuator faults. Finally, a new multivariable version of the Lipschitz algorithm, based on the classical twisting controller, is formulated and applied to passive FTC through the Lyapunov redesign, promising a reduced level of chattering and energy consumption compared to the super-twisting algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed FTC schemes is illustrated through simulation examples, highlighting both their advantages and potential limitations in practical applications.},

First, by incorporating a novel adaptive law, a consensus-based estimator is designed for each node to obtain the plant state based on its local measurement and local interaction with neighbors, without using any global information of the communication topology. Subsequently, a local controller is developed for each node to stabilize the plant collaboratively with performance guaranteed under mild conditions. Specifically, the proposed method only requires that the communication graph be strongly connected, and the plant be collectively controllable and observable. Further, the proposed method can be applied to pure fully distributed state estimation scenarios and modified for noise-bounded LTI plants.

  abstract     = {We consider a distributed personalized optimization problem over a network of nodes whose cost functions depend on a decision variable consisting of two parts: global (shared) part and local (node-specific) part. This problem structure arises in several important scenarios, where the global part captures the common feature among nodes and the local part represents the personalized feature. To solve this problem, we develop a flexible algorithmic framework employing personalized distributed stochastic gradient tracking method, where each node updates variables locally and communicates the shared part with its neighbors for coordination in a stochastic way. Different from existing works, the proposed framework provides great flexibility in designing algorithms with uncoordinated stepsizes for updating local and global parts over changing topologies. Most importantly, it can eliminate the effect of heterogeneity among nodes thanks to the gradient tracking scheme. Leveraging a properly designed Lyapunov function, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm for both (strongly) convex and nonconvex objective functions with cross-block Lipschitz gradients. The obtained rate results show clear dependence of the convergence performance on topology, heterogeneity of stepsize, and properties of objective functions. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm accounting for node-specific heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Mechanistic and tractable mathematical models play a key role in understanding how social influence shapes public opinions. Recently, a weighted-median mechanism has been proposed as a new microfoundation of opinion dynamics and validated via experimental data. Numerical studies indicate that this new mechanism recreates some nontrivial real-world features of opinion evolution. In this article, we conduct a thorough analysis of the weighted-median opinion dynamics. We fully characterize the equilibria set, and establish the almost-sure convergence for any initial condition. Moreover, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the almost-sure convergence to consensus, as well as a sufficient condition for almost-sure dissensus. We related the rich dynamical behavior of the weighted-median opinion dynamics to two delicate network structures: the cohesive sets and the decisive links. To complement our sufficient conditions for almost-sure dissensus, we further prove that, given the influence network, determining whether the system almost surely achieves persistent dissensus is NP-hard, which reflects that the complexity of the network topology contributes to opinion evolution.},

This article studies the detection of APTs that infiltrate cyber systems and compromise specifically targeted data and/or infrastructures. Dynamic information flow tracking is an information trace-based detection mechanism against APTs that tags suspicious information flows in the system and performs security analysis for unauthorized use of tagged data. In this article, we develop an analytical model for resource-efficient detection of APTs using an information flow tracking game. The game is a nonzero-sum, turn-based, stochastic game with asymmetric information as the defender cannot distinguish whether an incoming flow is malicious or benign. The payoff functions of the game capture the cost for performing security analysis and the rewards and penalties received by the players. We analyze equilibrium of the game and prove that a Nash equilibrium is given by a solution to the minimum capacity cut set problem on a flow-network derived from the system. The edge capacities of the flow-network are obtained from the cost of performing security analysis. Finally, we implement our algorithm on a real-world dataset for a data exfiltration attack augmented with false-negative and false-positive rates and compute an optimal defender strategy.},

We assign a negative reward to the unsafe states and introduce an expected return with a state-dependent discount factor. We compute a winning region and a directed controller with the maximum satisfaction probability using a dynamic programming method, where the expected return is used as a value function. Next, we construct a permissive supervisor via the optimal value function. We show that the supervisor accomplishes the maximum satisfaction probability and maximizes the reachable set within the winning region.

We address the problem using an operator form of discrete-time linear systems.

We combine this operator representation for linear systems with the classical Youla parametrization to characterize the set of controllers that are implementable over the given network. Using this Youla operator state-space framework, we show that a certain separation principle holds for the distributed control of a general class of linear systems. In that, the distributed state estimation can be carried out independently and then used together with “state-like” controllers to obtain the set of all output feedback stabilizing controllers with structure. The stability and performance problems can be formulated as convex (but infinite dimensional) optimization. We provide converging families of finite-dimensional convex optimizations in order to upper/lower approximate the original infinite-dimensional problem.},

In this article, we propose a general distributed framework for sample efficient cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) by utilizing the structures of graphs involved in this problem. We introduce three coupling graphs describing three types of interagent couplings in MARL, namely, the state graph, observation graph, and reward graph. By further considering a communication graph, we propose two distributed RL approaches based on local value functions derived from the coupling graphs. The first approach is able to reduce sample complexity significantly under specific conditions on the aforementioned four graphs. The second approach provides an approximate solution and can be efficient even for problems with dense coupling graphs. Here there is a tradeoff between minimizing the approximation error and reducing the computational complexity. Simulations show that our RL algorithms have a significantly improved scalability to large-scale MASs compared with centralized and consensus-based distributed RL algorithms.},

Greedy algorithms have been shown in many multiagent contexts to be an efficient approach to arrive at good solutions quickly. In this work, we ask the following: Is there any way to improve the performance of greedy algorithms without sacrificing the linear run-time guarantees? For this, we take inspiration from incentive design in the game-theoretic literature. In this work, we consider a modified version of the greedy algorithm where agents do not optimize against the global objective. Instead, each agent is prescribed an auxiliary utility function (which may differ from the original objective function) in which it optimizes under. By designing the utility functions properly, we show in this work that the resulting performance guarantees of the greedy algorithm can increase significantly. We study this approach in the context of resource-allocation games, which are used to model a rich variety of engineering applications. Interestingly, the performance guarantees from the modified greedy algorithm can be significantly close to the best centralized performance guarantees. The main technical contribution of the article is the characterization of the performance guarantees through a linear program construction.},

Under the scenario with a time-invariant and balanced graph, it is theoretically shown that the present algorithm owns a linear convergence rate (in the mean-square error sense) with the strongly convex and smooth cost functions. Furthermore, the result is extended to a more general case with the time-varying graphs considered. Specifically, it is proven that the developed algorithm could converge linearly to the optimal solution of the DAO problem (in the mean-square error sense) if the time-varying balanced graph is jointly strongly connected and some suitable conditions are satisfied.

These point estimates are then retained and used for constructing an interpolation-based function approximator that predicts the Q-function values at unexplored state–action pairs.

In the setting of regularization theory in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), much work has been devoted to build uncertainty bounds around kernel-based estimates, hence characterizing their convergence rates. Such results are typically formulated using either the average squared loss for the prediction or the RKHS norm. However, in signal processing and in emerging areas, such as learning for control , measuring the estimation error through the $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ norm is often more advantageous. This can, e.g., provide insights on the convergence rate in the Laplace/Fourier domain whose role is crucial in the analysis of dynamical systems. For this reason, we consider all the RKHSs $\mathcal {H}$ associated with Lebesgue measurable positive-definite kernels, which induce subspaces of $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ , also known as stable RKHSs in the literature. The inclusion $\mathcal {H} \subset \mathcal {L}_{1}$ is then characterized. This permits to convert all the error bounds, which depend on the RKHS norm in terms of the $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ norm. We also show that our result is optimal: there does not exist any better reformulation of the bounds in $\mathcal {L}_{1}$ than the one presented here.},

We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for global stability of consensus equilibria, robustly with respect to the (constant or time-varying) external field.

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the performance of the gradient play algorithm for stochastic games (SGs), where each agent tries to maximize its own total discounted reward by making decisions independently based on current state information, which is shared between agents. Policies are directly parameterized by the probability of choosing a certain action at a given state. We show that Nash equilibria (NEs) and first-order stationary policies are equivalent in this setting, and give a local convergence rate around strict NEs. Furthermore, for a subclass of SGs called Markov potential games (which includes the setting with identical rewards as an important special case), we design a sample-based reinforcement learning algorithm and give a nonasymptotic global convergence rate analysis for both exact gradient play and our sample-based learning algorithm. Our result shows that the number of iterations to reach an $\epsilon$ -NE scales linearly, instead of exponentially, with the number of agents. Local geometry and local stability are also considered, where we prove that strict NEs are local maxima of the total potential function and fully mixed NEs are saddle points.},

This article investigates the tracking performance limitations (TPL) and regulation performance limitations (RPL) of a NCS with communication constraints in the network channel, such as network-induced delay, packet loss, additive non-zero mean noise, finite bandwidth, and encoding–decoding constraints. Explicit expressions for the TPL and RPL of NCS are derived using Youla parameterization method-based two-degree-of-freedom control techniques, various decomposition techniques, and related statistical theory. The results show that in addition to the essential characteristics of the plant such as nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles, communication constraints will also deteriorate the control performance of the system. Finally, we apply the theoretical results to an inverted pendulum system and two-input and two-output plant through numerical simulation, and the correctness of the results is verified.},

Given any initial unclustered directed graph and any initial-state followers and leaders, the distributed dynamic clustering method aims to cluster each leader with at least one follower without interconnection among the clusters. This cuts some initially available edges online by considering the real-time local information of states and connections while the distributed consensus control law is running. Then, the unified framework solves the problem under mild assumptions such that all agents in the same cluster reach a consensus with the leader without interference from the other clusters.

We first establish that an optimal policy for the considered formulation may not exist but that there always exists a near-optimal stationary policy. We additionally provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal policy. We then restrict our attention to stationary deterministic policies and show that the decision problem associated with the synthesis of an optimal stationary deterministic policy is NP-complete.

A system is incrementally exponentially stable if it admits either an incremental or Finsler–Lyapunov function, and the converse is also true when the Jacobian of the drift vector field satisfies a boundedness assumption. However, the direct relation between these Lyapunov functions is not very clear yet. In this article, we show that if one type of Lyapunov function is found, the other can directly be constructed from it without the boundedness assumption. As an application of our approach, we also show that an open system is incrementally passive if and only if it is differentially passive under a mild technical assumption.},

This article proposes a distributed proximal primal-dual (DPPD) algorithm, based on a modified primal-dual dynamics equipped with operator splitting technique, to address this nonsmooth frequency regulation problem on load side. By Lyapunov stability and invariance theory, we prove that DPPD algorithm achieves global asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution that minimizes the nonsmooth regulation cost, while restoring the frequency under constraints, such as capacity limits of load and power flow. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DPPD algorithm by simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.},

In the particular case when the cone is the nonnegative orthant this reduces to the well-known and important result that a positive system admits a diagonal Lyapunov function.

The MHGO methodology is applied to low-power observers to aggregate the advantages of the traditional HGO, low-power HGO, and MHGO. It is shown that there exists a combination of the unknown parameters for which the weighted estimated states obtained from the observer are equal to the system&#39;s states. The unknown optimal parameters are estimated using a recursive least squares approach. It is shown that the low-power MHGO reduces the peaking using a design parameter. In addition, it is shown that the observer yields the same bounds on estimation errors as a low-power HGO, in terms of the asymptotic gain between estimate error and noise frequency.

It has been previously shown that for discrete-time, linear, time-invariant, stable, observable systems with polytopic constraints, this set is a polytope described by a finite number of inequalities (i.e., has finite complexity). However, it is not possible to know the number of inequalities a priori from problem data. To address this gap, this contribution presents two computationally efficient methods to obtain upper bounds on the complexity of the MAS. The first method is algebraic and is based on matrix power series, while the second is geometric and is based on Lyapunov analysis. The two methods are rigorously introduced, a detailed numerical comparison between the two is provided, and an extension to systems with constant inputs is presented.},

  abstract     = {This article studies the Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problem for multiple coalition games over unbalanced directed graphs, where the players in the same coalition aim to achieve the optimal consensus cooperatively, but different coalitions competitively seek the NE. A distributed algorithm is proposed based on the coalition estimate strategy (CES) and the gradient tracking method. The CES directly estimates the consensus decision in a coalition rather than all decisions of other players, and the decision consensus inside a coalition can also be accomplished by the CES without the extra dynamic. The gradient tracking method is used for estimating the gradient summation inside a coalition. Based on the weighted Frobenius norm and the established linear system of inequalities, it is shown that the proposed algorithm linearly converges to the NE if the maximum value of uncoordinated step sizes is smaller than derived upper bounds for strongly convex cost functions. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the proposed algorithm also applies to distributed optimization problems and networked noncooperative games. Lastly, simulations in formation problems of unmanned vehicle swarms are performed to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.},

The performances of an ISA controller are characterized by a gain function that quantifies the deviation of closed-loop trajectories from the target set as a function of the amplitude of past disturbances on a bounded time window. We prove the existence of controllers that are gain-optimal (GO) in the sense that their gain function is minimal (with respect to a given order on the set of gain functions) over all possible ISA controllers. Then, we consider the problem of synthesizing ISA controllers. We present an approach based on successive refinements of controllers: starting from a controller synthesized against worst-case disturbances, the controller is iteratively refined in order to improve the closed-loop behavior under lower disturbances. We prove that our method makes it possible to synthesize an ISA controller that is shown to be a GO-ISA controller (for the colexicographic order) when a condition, which can be easily checked a posteriori, is satisfied. Finally, an application of adaptive cruise control demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.},

We show that the equilibrium strategies of the agents can be computed via a convex program, which remains tractable even in high-dimensional cases as opposed to the direct solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation. To that end, we mainly attempt to prove the validity of a candidate for the value of the game constructed based on Isaacs&#39; geometric approach using classical/viscosity solution concepts of the HJI equation. A major challenge is that the candidate value function generally lacks an analytical expression, making it difficult to derive its gradient/subdifferential. To address this challenge, we propose a parametric optimization approach to associate the candidate value function with the optimal value function of a parametric program and investigate its continuity and differentiability properties through duality and optimality conditions. Lastly, we present a numerical example to showcase the applicability of our solution in a nontrivial high-dimensional game scenario.},

Then, by using some interesting geometric features, a robust stability checking function and frequency bounds are provided to improve the computational efficiency of robust stability analysis. Furthermore, due to the widespread industrial use of the well-known proportional–integral-derivative (PID) controller structure, the robust stability region of PID controllers has been determined for an uncertain plant with an uncertain time delay.

In this article, two-time scale stochastic approximation-type algorithms for differentially private distributed stochastic optimization with time-varying sample sizes are proposed using gradient- and output-perturbation methods. For both gradient- and output-perturbation cases, the convergence of the algorithm and differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget $\varepsilon$ for an infinite number of iterations are simultaneously established, which is substantially different from the existing works. By a time-varying sample size method, the privacy level is enhanced, and differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget $\varepsilon$ for an infinite number of iterations is established. By properly choosing a Lyapunov function, the algorithm achieves almost sure and mean square convergence even when the added privacy noise has an increasing variance. Furthermore, we rigorously provide the mean square convergence rates of the algorithm and show how the added privacy noise affects the convergence rate of the algorithm. Finally, numerical examples, including distributed training on a benchmark machine learning dataset, are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the algorithms.},

The purpose of this article is to design a state estimation algorithm such that an upper bound of the estimation error covariance is firstly guaranteed and then minimized at each sampling instant by properly designing the estimator gain. The valid information of sensed variables is extracted from binary measurements, and a novel state estimator is constructed in a recursive form, which is suitable for online computations.

In this work, we propose a new one-point feedback method for online optimization that estimates the gradient using the residual between two feedback points at consecutive time instants. Moreover, we develop regret bounds for ZO with residual feedback for constrained convex and unconstrained nonconvex online optimization problems. Specifically, for both deterministic and stochastic problems and for both Lipschitz and smooth objective functions, we show that using residual feedback can produce gradient estimates with much smaller variance compared to conventional one-point feedback methods. As a result, our regret bounds are much tighter compared to existing regret bounds for ZO with conventional one-point feedback, which suggests that ZO with residual feedback can better track the optimizer of online optimization problems. In addition, our regret bounds rely on weaker assumptions than those used in conventional one-point feedback methods.

However, it is still quite challenge to design an efficient algorithm for such problems due to the nonlinearity and nonsmoothness. Previous researches usually ignore the underlying structure presenting in the such nonlinear regression models, where the variables can be partitioned into a linear part and a nonlinear part. Inspired by the high efficiency of variable projection algorithm for solving separable nonlinear least squares problems, in this article, we develop a robust variable projection (RoVP) method for the parameter estimation of separable nonlinear regression problem with $L_{1}$ norm loss. The proposed algorithm eliminates the linear parameters by solving a linear programming subproblem, resulting in a reduced problem that only involves nonlinear parameters. More importantly, we derive the Jacobian matrix of the reduced objective function, which tackles the coupling between the linear parameters and nonlinear parameters. Furthermore, we observed an intriguing phenomenon in the landscape of the original separable nonlinear objective function, where some narrow valleys frequently exist. The RoVP strategy can effectively diminish the likelihood of the algorithm getting stuck in these valleys and accelerate its convergence. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

Second, when there are asynchronous phenomena in both deterministic switching and Markov jump, the asynchronous $H_{\infty }$ controller is given to make the nonlinear SMJS finite-time annular domain bounded with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. In addition, two degradation results with no deterministic asynchrony and no stochastic asynchrony are derived, respectively. As a special case, the corresponding result of linear SMJSs is obtained. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the results.},

By utilizing a Lyapunov-like function consisting of a positive semidefinite term and an integral term, a novel bounded static linear event-triggered protocol is proposed to ensure that the global leader-following consensus problem is solved in a fully distributed manner for all undirected communication graphs. In order to avoid continuously monitoring the states of neighbors and continuous communication, a self-triggered protocol is also proposed. As a further result, the global consensus problem for a class of input-constrained high-order multiagent systems is also considered and linear event-triggered protocols are proposed to solve such a problem in a fully distributed manner.

The key technique is to innovatively transform the stochastic system governed by a forward stochastic difference equation into one governed by a backward stochastic difference equation.

The optimal action of the leader, coupled with the rational response of the follower, forms a Stackelberg equilibrium. Both the leader and the follower exchange their observations and historical control inputs. Under the assumption of linear feedback strategies, the problems are converted into unsolved feedback gain matrix. The introduced Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle develops a solution based on the forward and backward stochastic difference equations.

Output signals are sampled by meticulously constructed switched dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (SDE-TMs). Then, the sampled information is further quantized by logarithmic quantizer, transmitted by network and converted to analog signals by a zero-order holder. Just leveraging this quantized-after-sampled information, switched observers are constructed elaborately to estimate the unmeasurable state. Combining the formerly constructed switched observers with the state feedback stabilizers that are deliberately designed by utilizing adding a power integrator technique, event-triggered output feedback control strategy is proposed to make SNPSs asymptotically stable. The technological innovation of the method presented in this article lies in the construction of the novel SDE-TMs with the exclusion of Zeno behavior and the ingenious switching observers that can estimate unobservable state with only incomplete information.

In piecewise affine systems, the number of possible switching sequences grows exponentially with the length of the prediction horizon that leads to multiple trajectories in the receding horizon strategy; and should be considered in calculating the optimal control signal at each step. The proposed method is an optimal solution in terms of continuous variables with obtained suboptimal switching sequence. At each sample time, this method restricts the number of necessary quadratic programming problems to the length of the prediction horizon by dividing the optimization problem into subproblems through introducing a new concept, minimum dwell sample . A local control horizon concept is also introduced to reduce the length of the optimization vector and a mode avoidance technique is proposed to deal with piecewise affine systems that have some uncontrollable or undesired modes in state space. This technique relaxes the full mode controllability assumption of the system using an artificial target to avoid uncontrollable modes. The convergence and feasibility of the method are proven and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Currently, performance-guaranteed global controls, in the output-feedback context, basically need system nonlinearities (or growths) to be output dependent only. This is an essential constraint to the existing works, in which control design is on the premise that the nonlinearities can be implied bounded. Therein, the time-varying gains, which merged performance boundary and output, directly implied the boundedness of the output and in turn that of the output-dependent nonlinearities. This article removes the output-dependent constraint, and addresses the performance-guaranteed global tracking of unmeasured-state-dependent systems. Since the existing gains cannot contain unmeasured states, they can no longer imply the unmeasured-state-dependent nonlinearities are bounded during the controller design. We thus combine dynamic high gains with performance-guaranteed techniques. Notably, the dynamics of the high gain are endowed with multiple components to cancel out the multiple nonlinearities incurred by the unmeasured states and the performance guarantee. A performance-embedded function is exploited, by which the performance-guaranteed global tracking for the original system boils down to the boundedness of an integrated system. It turns out, by boundedness analysis first for the dynamic high gain and then for the scaled key variables, the designed controller can achieve the performance-guaranteed global tracking.},

In this article, a new robust PPC method without using barrier functions is proposed for second-order vector nonlinear systems, which can completely avoid the singularity problem of the control law and be considered as a complement to these mainstream PPC methods. The control design consists of three steps: first, a performance function is constructed to form the performance envelope according to the performance requirements; second, a preset trajectory (PT) is generated within the performance envelope; third, a robust sliding mode control law is designed to make the actual tracking error evolve in a certain tubular area that contains the PT and is strictly within the performance envelope. Furthermore, the obtained result is extended to the case of adaptive PPC. The effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed robust PPC method are illustrated by simulation results.},

Its compensating action is achieved by using the dynamics of a supercritical Neimark–Sacker bifurcation normal form at the core of its cost function. This work aims to extend this approach&#39;s applicability by analyzing its stability. This is accomplished by identifying the normal form&#39;s region of attraction and final set, which enables the use of LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle. These results are then extended to the proposed controller under ideal conditions, i.e., zero-cost solutions with predictable disturbances. For nonideal scenarios, i.e., solutions with unpredictable disturbances and cost restrictions, conditions are developed to ensure that the closed-loop system remains inside the normal form&#39;s region of attraction. These findings are tested under nonideal conditions in a power systems application example. The results show successful power quality compensation and a satisfactory resilient behavior of the closed loop within the margins developed during this work.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel approach to construct data-driven online solutions to optimization problems (P) subject to a class of distributionally uncertain dynamical systems. The introduced framework allows for the simultaneous learning of distributional system uncertainty via a parameterized, control-dependent ambiguity set using a finite historical dataset, and its use to make online decisions with probabilistic regret function bounds. Leveraging the merits of machine learning, the main technical approach relies on the theory of distributional robust optimization (DRO), to hedge against uncertainty and provide less conservative results than standard robust optimization approaches. Starting from recent results that describe ambiguity sets via parameterized, and control-dependent empirical distributions as well as ambiguity radii, we first present a tractable reformulation of the corresponding optimization problem while maintaining the probabilistic guarantees. We then specialize these problems to the cases of 1) optimal one-stage control of distributionally uncertain nonlinear systems, and 2) resource allocation under distributional uncertainty. A novelty of this work is that it extends DRO to online optimization problems subject to a distributionally uncertain dynamical system constraint, handled via a control-dependent ambiguity set that leads to online-tractable optimization with probabilistic guarantees on regret bounds. Further, we introduce an online version of the Nesterov&#39;s accelerated-gradient algorithm, and analyze its performance to solve this class of problems via the dissipativity theory.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the challenging problem of distributed adaptive observer design for synchronization and formation control of heterogeneous nonlinear cyber-physical-vehicle systems is addressed. Since the heterogeneous systems contain nonidentical nonlinear dynamics and the leader has unknown dynamics composed of an unknown input bound, the error dynamics of the equilibrium point for the heterogeneous nonmonotonic nonlinear systems will be affected, which has not previously been recognized in the observer design of synchronization literature. To solve this problem, a distributed adaptive observer-based approach is first developed to provide the estimation and compensation of the error dynamics of the equilibrium point for heterogeneous nonmonotonic nonlinear systems. The nonidentical nonlinear dynamics among subsystems and the unknown dynamics of the leader will be handled by the developed distributed estimation laws. Then, by constructing the appropriate error compensation controllers and scheduling the limited information interaction among neighbors, an integrated synchronization control strategy is further proposed by designing a novel class of error dynamic compensation laws to achieve perfect synchronization behaviors. Finally, the mentioned approach is applied to the formation tracking control of heterogeneous nonlinear cyber-physical-vehicle systems, and the effectiveness of our approach is illustrated by case studies.},

While most existing works address inaccurate distributional information in fully observable settings, we consider a partially observable DRC problem for discrete-time linear systems using the Wasserstein metric. For a tractable solution, we propose a novel approximation method exploiting the Gelbrich bound of the Wasserstein distance. Using techniques from modern distributionally robust optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal control policy and a tractable semidefinite programming problem for the worst-case distribution policy in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-cost settings. The proposed method features several salient theoretical properties, such as a guaranteed cost property and a probabilistic out-of-sample performance guarantee, demonstrating the distributional robustness of our controller. Furthermore, the resulting controller is shown to ensure the closed-loop stability of the mean-state system. The empirical performance of our method is tested through numerical experiments on a power system frequency control problem.},

In addition, how to characterize the data heterogeneity among the agents and its impacts on the algorithmic performance remains challenging. In light of such motivations, we revisit the classical federated averaging algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017) as well as the more recent SCAFFOLD method (Karimireddy et al., 2020) for solving the distributed stochastic optimization problem and establish the convergence results under only a mild variance condition on the stochastic gradients for smooth nonconvex objective functions. Almost sure convergence to a stationary point is also established under the condition. Moreover, we discuss a more informative measurement for data heterogeneity as well as its implications.},

A malicious adversary can corrupt an unknown set with $p$ out of $m$ sensors and manipulate their observations arbitrarily. We propose a general secure estimation framework by decomposing a centralized linear observer into local ones and fusing the local estimates by minimizing specially designed convex functions. The optimization problem can be solved with a linear convergence rate in a distributed manner by widely used proximal gradient descent+consensus iterations aligned with local malicious detectors. Moreover, we do not require solving the optimization problem exactly. We propose a hot-starting mechanism with state predictions, which combined with linear convergence, can guarantee stable estimation with fixed numbers of iterations at each time instant, both under and without attack. Thus, with bounded computation and communication complexity, the proposed algorithm obtains a secure estimation at each sensor as long as the network is connected and the observability redundancy condition is satisfied, of which the latter is proved to be equivalent to $2p$ -sparse observability if system matrix $A$ has unitary geometric multiplicity. Furthermore, numerical simulations on the IEEE 68-bus system corroborate our proposed algorithm.},

We first present a mean-field stochastic bounded real lemma (MF-SBRL), which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear perturbation operator of mean-field systems to gain an $H_{\infty }$ norm less than a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. Through a mean-field forward–backward stochastic difference equation, an equivalent condition is proposed for the existence of the open-loop $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$ control strategy. Based on the established MF-SBRL, it is further shown that the considered $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$ control problem is closed-loop solvable if and only if four coupled difference Riccati equations (CDREs) admit a set of positive-semidefinite solutions. Moreover, the state-feedback gains of the closed-loop $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$ control strategy are constructed in terms of the solutions to CDREs. As a by-product, the relationship is clarified between the open-loop solvability and the closed-loop solvability of the finite-horizon mean-field $H_{2}/H_{\infty }$ control problem. Finally, a recursive algorithm appended with a numerical example is supplied to demonstrate that the adopted CDREs can be solved effectively.},

  abstract     = {Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multirobot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Toward this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive force scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions on robots&#39; target positions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each replanning under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots, and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multirobot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.},

Constructing accurate models of such interactions—in the meantime—can become prohibitive in applications. Data-driven control methods avoid such complications by directly synthesizing a controller from the observed data. In this article, we propose an algorithm referred to as data-driven structured policy iteration (D2SPI), for synthesizing an efficient feedback mechanism that respects the sparsity pattern induced by the underlying interaction network. In particular, our algorithm uses temporary “auxiliary” communication links in order to enable the required information exchange on a (smaller) subnetwork during the “learning phase”—links that will be removed subsequently for the final distributed feedback synthesis. We then proceed to show that the learned policy results in a stabilizing structured policy for the entire network. Our analysis is then followed by showing the stability and convergence of the proposed distributed policies throughout the learning phase, exploiting a construct referred to as the “Patterned monoid.” The performance of data-driven structured policy iteration (D2SPI) is then demonstrated using representative simulation scenarios.},

The intruder implements an actuator enablement attack by enabling a vulnerable actuator event that has been disabled by a supervisor. To solve this problem, from the intruder&#39;s viewpoint, we first introduce a concept of strong actuator enablement estimability (AE-estimability) that allows the intruder to definitely decide that a controlled system can reach an undesirable state after receiving attacks. Then, a concept of weak AE-estimability is proposed to make the intruder incapable of accurately deciding whether an undesirable state in the controlled system subject to attacks is reached even if it has already been reached. We then construct an estimator for assisting the intruder to verify these two estimabilities. From the perspective of prevention, to protect a controlled system from attacks without changing the original behavior of the system, we design a prevention module to mislead an intruder&#39;s attack estimation by using the reverse sensor functions to modify sensor readings. Finally, an information construct called a reverse sensor structure is presented to characterize the interaction among an intruder, an estimator, and a prevention module. An algorithm is given to synthesize reverse sensor functions based on the proposed structure.},

  abstract     = {In many branches of engineering, Banach contraction mapping theorem is employed to establish the convergence of certain deterministic algorithms. Randomized versions of these algorithms have been developed that have proved useful in data-driven problems. In a class of randomized algorithms, in each iteration, the contraction map is approximated with an operator that uses independent and identically distributed samples of certain random variables. This leads to iterated random operators acting on an initial point in a complete metric space, and it generates a Markov chain. In this article, we develop a new stochastic dominance-based proof technique, called probabilistic contraction analysis, for establishing the convergence in probability of Markov chains generated by such iterated random operators in certain limiting regime. The methods developed in this article provides a general framework for understanding convergence of a wide variety of Monte Carlo methods, in which contractive property is present. We apply the convergence result to conclude the convergence of fitted value iteration and fitted relative value iteration in continuous state and continuous action MDPs as representative applications of the general framework developed here.},

  abstract     = {The problem of coverage control, i.e., of coordinating multiple agents to optimally cover an area, arises in various applications. However, coverage applications face two major challenges: 1) dealing with nonlinear dynamics while respecting system and safety critical constraints and 2) performing the task in an initially unknown environment. We solve the coverage problem by using a hierarchical framework, in which references are calculated at a central server and passed to the agents&#39; local model predictive control (MPC) tracking schemes. Furthermore, to ensure that the environment is actively explored by the agents a probabilistic exploration–exploitation tradeoff is deployed. In addition, we derive a control framework that avoids the hierarchical structure by integrating the reference optimization in the MPC formulation. Active learning is then performed drawing inspiration from Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) approaches. For all developed control architectures, we guarantee closed-loop constraint satisfaction and convergence to an optimal configuration. Furthermore, all methods are tested and compared on hardware using a miniature car platform.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this article is to develop a general framework of mean-square robust control in the presence of stochastic multiplicative uncertainties. We consider block diagonally structured stochastic uncertainties of a variety of structures including diagonal scalar, element-by-element, repeated scalar and full-block stochastic processes with prescribed variance bounds, which may arise from multiple sources and can be used to model various communication losses. In an important distinction from the previous work, we allow the stochastic uncertainties to be statistically correlated. A general mean-square robustness measure, termed mean-square stability radius (MSSR), is introduced as the metric to quantify stability robustness under the mean-square criterion. Explicit expressions of the MSSR are derived, and a small-gain type necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for mean-square robust stability. Based on the MSSR expressions, mean-square stabilization problems are studied by minimizing the MSSR over all possible stabilizing controllers, leading to stabilizability conditions for mean-square feedback stabilization. Moreover, as an analogy to its counterpart in the robust control theory, a mean-square optimal performance problem is shown to be equivalent to one of mean-square stabilization, by introducing a fictitious stochastic uncertainty and augmenting the system appropriately.},

Due to the coexistence of challenges caused by nonidentical Hessian matrices and more complicated agents&#39; dynamics, the extension from existing related results on single-integrator agents is nontrivial. First, a centralized algorithm is proposed to address the optimal time-varying resource allocation problem for high-order-integrator agents. Then, based on the centralized algorithm, two distributed algorithms are designed to achieve the exact optimum tracking. The main difference between the two distributed algorithms is whether a virtual system is required to be constructed for each agent, which results in a tradeoff between economical efficiency and favorable applicability to privacy-sensitive applications during implementations. Then, by using the estimation-tracking method, these two distributed algorithms are applied to solve the resource allocation problem for agents with high-order dynamics. Finally, examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Desired trajectories on each hierarchy level can be asymptotically tracked following the order of priorities. However, tasks specified by users are required to have the same dimensions as the DOF of robot and are simultaneously feasible and independent. In this article, all these restrictions are removed and a passivity-based hierarchical tracking controller with strict priorities is developed for an arbitrary number of conflicting tasks. Based on the theory of constrained optimization, a new control objective is proposed to achieve automatic tracking of hierarchy-consistent trajectory that is local optimal following the hierarchy order. Formal proof of asymptotic stability for tracking case of partially feasible, conflicting tasks is provided. The effectiveness of proposed method is evaluated in simulations and experiments on Franka Emika Panda robot.},

First, we extend Witsenhausen&#39;s “tensorization” approach originally used for single-letter random variables to causal processes, to obtain a new modified representation of the NRDF for the specific problem. For time-varying vector processes, we prove conditions so that the new modified NRDF is achieved and study its implications when it is not achievable. For both cases (which correspond to different bounds), we derive the characterization and the optimal realization, whereas we give the optimal numerical solution using the semidefinite programming (SDP) algorithm. Interestingly, the realization (for both bounds) is shown to be a linear functional of the current time-sufficient statistic of the past and current observations signals. For the infinite time horizon, we give conditions to ensure the existence of a time-invariant characterization from the finite-time horizon problems and a numerical solution using the SDP algorithm. For the time-invariant characterization, we also give strong structural properties that enable an optimal and approximate solution via a reverse-waterfilling algorithm implemented via an iterative scheme, which executes much faster than the SDP algorithm. For both finite and infinite time horizons, we study the special case of scalar processes. Our results are corroborated with various simulation studies and are also compared with existing results in the literature.},

They are a fundamental mathematical tool to depict the inherent dynamics of many complex systems, including Markovian systems or multiagent systems. This article investigates a new kind of CREs called harmonic-CREs (HCREs), whose solutions are coupled using harmonic means. We first introduce the specific form of HCREs and then analyze the existence and uniqueness of its solutions under the conditions of collective observability and primitiveness of coupling matrices. In addition, we manage to find an iterative law with low computation-complexity to obtain the solutions to HCREs. Based on this newly established theory, we greatly simplify the steady-state estimation error covariance of consensus-on-information-based distributed filtering (CIDF) into the solutions to a discrete-time Lyapunov equation (DLE). This leads to a significant conservativeness reduction of traditional performance evaluation techniques for CIDF. The obtained results are remarkable since they not only enrich the theory of CREs but also provide a novel insight into the synthesis and analysis of CIDF algorithms. We finally validate our theoretical findings through several numerical experiments.},

The method uses a modification to the reference signal on each NOILC iteration using the measured tracking error from the previous iteration. The basic algorithm is equivalent to a gradient iteration combined with an NOILC iteration. The choice of design parameters is interpreted in terms of the spectrum of the error update operator and the systematic annihilation of spectral components of the error signal. The methods apply widely, including continuous and discrete-time end point, intermediate point, and signal tracking. The effects of parameter choice are revealed using examples. A robustness analysis is presented and illustrated by frequency-domain robustness conditions for multi-input, multi-output discrete-time tracking, and robustness conditions for end-point problems for state-space systems. Finally, the algorithm is extended to embed a number of gradient iterations within a single NOILC iteration. This makes possible the systematic manipulation of the spectrum, providing additional acceleration capabilities with the theoretical possibility of arbitrary fast convergence.},

Relying on the Whittle relaxation technique, we resort to a near-optimal, scalable job-assignment policy. Under a mild condition related to the service and energy consumption rates of the servers, we prove that our proposed policy approaches optimality as the size of the entire system tends to infinity; that is, it is asymptotically optimal. For the nonasymptotic regime, we show the effectiveness of the proposed policy through numerical simulations, where the policy outperforms all the tested baselines, and we numerically demonstrate its robustness against heavy-tailed job-size distributions.},

We remark that when the solutions of interest are known to remain in a compact set and admit a uniform dwell-time and when the flows are strongly differentially observable, a sufficiently fast high-gain observer can be designed to estimate the state during flow, but using the output of the system near its jump times is counterproductive. We thus propose to “disconnect” the high-gain observer when its estimate gets close to the jump set. More precisely, the proposed observer generates an estimate that, during flow, is obtained via the high-gain observer and, around jump times, is obtained by integrating forward the flow map of the system, until reaching the jump set. Under appropriate assumptions around the jump set of the system, we show that this observer guarantees local uniform asymptotic stability of an appropriately defined zero-error set. Then, we develop a method to turn any such local hybrid observer into a semiglobal hybrid observer. This observer operates sequentially by first employing a continuous-time high-gain observer, and then, after a finite amount of time, solely determined by the current estimate, employing the available local hybrid observer. The capabilities and performance of the proposed hybrid observer are illustrated on a hybrid spiking neuron model.},

In addition, the variances of the added noises can be either decaying or constant. By using a time-varying step-size based on the stochastic approximation method, we show that the algorithm converges in mean-square and almost-surely even with increasing privacy noises. We further develop a method to design the step-size and the noise parameter, affording the algorithm to achieve the average bipartite consensus with the desired accuracy and the predefined differential privacy level. Moreover, we give the mean-square and almost-sure convergence rates of the algorithm, and the privacy level with different forms of the privacy noises. We also reveal the tradeoff between the accuracy and the privacy, and extend the results to local differential privacy.

This result establishes the desired steady-state distribution for the resulting Markov chain, ensuring exponential convergence from all initial distributions while adhering to transition constraints and minimizing state transitions. The DSMC&#39;s performance is demonstrated through a probabilistic swarm guidance example, which interprets the spatial distribution of a swarm comprising a large number of mobile agents as a probability distribution and utilizes the Markov chain to compute transition probabilities between states. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence for the DSMC-based algorithm when compared with the previous Markov chain-based swarm guidance algorithms.},

Based on the features of bisimulation, the reachability, macro-controllability, controllability, and stabilizability of CT-MCs and CT-CMCs, particularly, the large-scale ones, are addressed over the corresponding reduced chains. The bisimulation relations are defined for both CT-MCs and CT-CMCs to establish the equivalence between the original networks and their condensed networks. A computable algorithm is developed to compute the reachability-based maximal bisimulation relation for CMCs, resulting in the smallest bisimulating CMCs. Notably, one advantage of our techniques lies in their efficiency in implementing the existing analysis and control results on MCs and CMCs in a lower amount of time, with wide applications to logical networks, finite-field networks, finite automata, and Petri nets. Compared to their discrete-time counterparts, CT-MCs and CT-CMCs inherit a simplified essential network topology in the discrete-time structures while providing a quantitative description of transient functional kinetics on the microtime scale level. Besides, all the developed theoretical results for CT-MCs and CT-CMCs are operated based on the transition rate matrices of chains rather than transition probability matrices used in the traditional methods. Finally, the derived theoretical results are validated by investigating the p53-Mdm2 signaling network and a relevant case-study involving a set of randomly generated CT-CMCs.},

  abstract     = {Optimization with gradient tracking is particularly notable for its superior convergence results among the various distributed algorithms, especially in the context of directed graphs. However, privacy concerns arise when gradient information is transmitted directly which would induce more information leakage. Surprisingly, literature has not adequately addressed the associated privacy issues. In response to the gap, our article proposes a privacy-preserving distributed optimization algorithm with gradient tracking by adding noises to transmitted messages, namely, the decision variables and the estimate of the aggregated gradient. We prove two dilemmas for this kind of algorithm. In the first dilemma, we reveal that this distributed optimization algorithm with gradient tracking cannot achieve $ \epsilon$ -differential privacy (DP) and exact convergence simultaneously. Building on this, we subsequently highlight that the algorithm fails to achieve $ \epsilon$ -DP when employing nonsummable stepsizes in the presence of Laplace noises. It is crucial to emphasize that these findings hold true regardless of the size of the privacy metric $ \epsilon$ . After that, we rigorously analyze the convergence performance and privacy level given summable stepsize sequences under the Laplace distribution since it is only with summable stepsizes that is meaningful for us to study. We derive sufficient conditions that allow for the simultaneous stochastically bounded accuracy and $ \epsilon$ -DP. Recognizing that several options can meet these conditions, we further derive an upper bound of the mean error&#39;s variance and specify the mathematical expression of $ \epsilon$ under such conditions. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this article, two pinning control (PC) schemes are proposed to achieve nonperiodical stable behaviors for asynchronous Boolean networks (BNs), from the aspects of state transition digraph (STG) and dependence digraph (DD). First, under the framework of algebraic state-space representation of asynchronous BNs, a nonuniform PC is proposed based on STG and feedback vertex set. The nonuniform pinning nodes (PNs) are determined under the transformation of certain columns of the state transition matrices. Due to the high computational complexity of using STG, a uniform PC is further proposed based on the DD of asynchronous BNs, where PNs are easily found using a feedback arc set (FAS). Compared with the nonuniform PC with computational complexity $O(n2^{2n})$ ( $n$ is the size of network), the uniform PC has advantages of lower computational complexity $O(n^{2}+n2^{K})$ ( $K$ is the largest indegree of in-neighbors). Finally, simulations on gene networks with different sizes are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results that only almost 1%–33% nodes are needed. Especially, as for a network with 321 genes, only two nodes (1%) are needed, which well reflects the core idea of PC approach.},

Subsequently, a numerical approximation of the value function is proposed by solving a series of function approximation problems backwards in time along the edges of a space-filling tree consisting of trajectory samples. Moreover, a local entropy-weighted least squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method is developed to concentrate function approximation accuracy in regions most likely to be visited by optimally controlled trajectories. The proposed methodology is numerically demonstrated for linear and nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems with nonquadratic running costs, which reveal significant convergence improvements over previous FBSDE-based numerical solution methods.},

Meanwhile, the singularity problem caused by the constrained variables approaching the constraint boundaries is considered in this article.

This event-triggered mechanism dictates the time instants at which the applied control input needs to be updated based on the occurrence of specific events monitored by the control law. The reported stability analysis relies on the use of two small gain arguments. A first small gain argument is used to establish that the employed finite-dimensional observer-based control strategy with continuous application of the control input (i.e., without triggering mechanism) satisfies an input-to-state stability (ISS) estimate with respect to an additive perturbation of the control input. Then, taking advantage of this latter ISS estimate along with the introduction of an adequate triggering mechanism, a second small-gain argument is developed to establish the exponential decay of the resulting closed-loop system trajectories. Finally, the feasibility of the reported event-triggered control approach is assessed through the establishment of a minimal dwell-time between two triggering instants.},

The optimal control input policy for the deterministic version (no stochastic disturbances) is first provided and shown to be the sum of linear state feedback and path-dependent components, as for the twin linear quadratic trajectory-tracking problem. This policy is proven to also be optimal for the original stochastic problem when the path is a straight line.

Motivated by the framework of expressed and private opinions within social networks, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm to simultaneously update two state variables. One of these variables is used to transmit and interact among the network, while the other variable represents the real state evolution of agents and is not directly visible to other agents. We demonstrate that the algorithm can achieve the same performance as the well-known Laplacian consensus algorithm, but without the overhead of extra privacy protection operations. Furthermore, our algorithm is viable on general strongly connected digraphs, and does not require the topology to be undirected or balanced, nor does it require nodes to know their out-neighbors, thus, greatly weakening the topological requirements. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via numerical simulations.},

It only depends on the sampling time and the unknown disturbance. The proposed discrete-time controller is evaluated comparative to previously published discrete-time super-twisting controllers by means of the controller structure and in extensive simulation studies. The continuous-time super-twisting controller is capable of rejecting any unknown Lipschitz-continuous perturbation and converges in finite time. Furthermore, the convergence time decreases, if any of the gains is increased. The simulations demonstrate that the closed-loop systems with each of the known controllers lose one of these properties, introduce discretization-chattering, or do not yield the same accuracy level as with the proposed controller.

  abstract     = {Switching linear systems over the max-plus algebra can be used to model production plants where different choices in resource allocation are possible. In such a case, internal and external variables represent the time instants at which internal or external events occur. In particular, output variables represent the time instants at which lots of manufactured goods are released to the market. Here, we consider the problems of system synchronization and subsynchronization, which consist of forcing the output of a system to equal or anticipate the output of a given model. Their solution in the max-plus framework provides a viable strategy to control a given production plant in such a way as to comply with a desired production time schedule. Using structural methods and introducing novel structural notions, necessary and sufficient solvability conditions are given. Practical methods to construct solutions are illustrated and discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a new passivity-based sliding mode control (PBSMC) method for mechanical port-Hamiltonian systems. PBSMC is unification of sliding mode control and passivity-based control. It achieves sliding mode control and Lyapunov stability simultaneously by employing an energy-based Lyapunov function. The proposed method gives a family of stabilizing controllers that smoothly interpolates passivity-based control and sliding mode control with design parameters. The freedom is useful to adjust the tradeoff between robustness against external disturbances and undesired chattering vibration. In addition, this article relaxes the restrictive condition, which is required in the authors&#39; former result. As a result, we can apply the proposed PBSMC method to trajectory tracking control problems. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed controller against matched and unmatched disturbances is investigated. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

As such, we present, in this article, a non-strict projection lemma that generalizes both its original strict formulation as well as an earlier non-strict version.

The resulting decision-making dynamics of a mixture of individuals following these three mechanisms may either eventually reach an equilibrium state where no one tends to switch strategies or enter a nonsingleton positively invariant set, where perpetual switches of strategies will take place. In reality, however, the decisions are subject to mistakes or perturbations. Will any of the equilibrium states “survive” under the perturbed dynamics? That is, will they be visited infinitely often with a nonvanishing frequency under vanishing perturbations. We approach this problem by performing stochastic stability analysis for a population of individuals choosing between cooperation and defection , accordingly earning payoffs based on their payoff matrices, and updating their decisions by following one of the above three mechanisms provided that with a certain probability they may choose the opposite action to what the mechanism puts forward. We find that if an equilibrium consisting of both imitating cooperators and defectors is stochastically stable, so is an extreme equilibrium, where all or none of the imitators cooperate. This highlights the robustness of extreme equilibria and in turn the role of imitation in decision-making dynamics.},

Differential privacy, as a performance metric, is introduced to evaluate the level of privacy, and an EDS-based DPCC scheme is proposed to ensure the ultimate mean-square consensus with preserved differential privacy. A set of criteria is first established for the EDS-embedded DPCC problem in terms of the performance of consensus, the size of transmitted data, and the level of privacy. Subsequently, the codesign issue is discussed for the EDS, the differentially private mechanism, and the consensus controller.

A new hybrid control strategy is introduced, which differs conceptually from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches. The key idea involves the construction of a generalized synergistic Lyapunov function whose switching variable can either remain constant or dynamically change between jumps. Based on this new hybrid mechanism, a generalized synergistic hybrid feedback control scheme, endowed with global asymptotic stability guarantees, is proposed. This hybrid control scheme is then improved through a smoothing mechanism that eliminates discontinuities in the feedback term. Moreover, the smooth hybrid feedback is further extended to a larger class of systems through the integrator backstepping approach. The proposed hybrid feedback schemes are applied to solve the global obstacle avoidance problem using a new concept of synergistic navigation functions. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid controllers.},

Second, a distributed output feedback model predictive controller is designed to generate effective control sequences. Third, a buffered actuator is added to realize adequate compensation to defend against DoS attacks.

To address this scenario, a new distributed diagnosability condition is proposed, which extends decentralized diagnosability conditions proposed in the literature.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the trajectory tracking control problem for the wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) subject to actuator faults. The challenge lies in the partial loss of effectiveness of the actuated wheels which results in the loss of strong controllability of the WMR, rendering the classical fault-tolerant control methods infeasible. To overcome this obstacle, a novel mixed-gain adaption technique is put forward and is skillfully combined with the robust prescribed performance control method. The resulting control achieves trajectory tracking of the WMR with the predefined settling time and accuracy, against the actuator faults, the model uncertainties, and the disturbances. Moreover, it exhibits significant simplicity, without parameter identification, function approximation, disturbance estimation, or fault estimation. The theoretical findings are illustrated by a comparative simulation.},

In this article, the barrier function methodology is extended to a class of signed power-based controllers. It turns out that, whenever the upper bound of the perturbation is smaller than one, powers smaller than zero produce a smaller size of the positively invariant final set, and when the upper bound of the perturbation is bigger than one, the size of the final set for the same controllers is bigger. Finally, we propose a bipowered extension of the methodology to adjust the size of the final set for any value of the upper bound of the perturbation.},

However, for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems, probabilistic reach-avoid-stay problems are viewed as challenging tasks. Motivated by the recent surge of applications in characterizing safety-critical properties using Lyapunov-barrier functions, we aim to provide a stochastic version for probabilistic reach-avoid-stay problems in consideration of robustness. To this end, based on the weak topology, we first establish a connection between probabilistic stability with safety constraints and reach-avoid-stay specifications. We, then, prove that stochastic Lyapunov-barrier functions provide sufficient conditions for the target objectives. We apply Lyapunov-barrier conditions in control synthesis for reach-avoid-stay specifications, and show its effectiveness in a case study.},

The difficulty is how to dominate the implicit time in the system and the parameter error multiplied by an adaptive law without breaking the time-varying output constraint. To overcome the difficulty, we develop an event-triggered adaptive stabilizing controller comprising a time-varying scaling function and an exponential decay term, which is bounded on the whole-time interval and ensures that the states converge to the origin after entering a prescribed compact set within a prescribed finite time. Superior to the existing event-triggered schemes, the new triggered rule with a time-varying threshold guarantees that the designed controller is not only more robust against more serious uncertainties but also unifies the design in dealing with both constrained and unconstrained systems without constructing barrier functions associated with the output constraint. Finally, a practical simulation example is provided to illustrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ and $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ norms of the multiagent system transfer function matrices are employed as measures of the consensus error. For the $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ consensus performance, we obtain an analytical expression of the consensus error, while for the $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ consensus performance, we show that it can be determined by solving a sequence of independent unimodal quasi-convex problems.

  abstract     = {Task allocation is a crucial process in modern systems, but it is often challenged by incomplete information about the utilities of participating agents. In this article, we propose a new profit maximization mechanism for the task allocation problem, where the task publisher seeks an optimal incentive function to maximize its own profit and simultaneously ensure the truthful announcing of the agent&#39;s private information (type) and its participation in the task, while an autonomous agent aims at maximizing its own utility function by deciding on its participation level and announced type. Our mechanism stands out from the classical contract theory-based truthful mechanisms as it empowers agents to make their own decisions about their level of involvement, making it more practical for many real-world task allocation scenarios. It has been proven that by considering a linear form of incentive function consisting of two decision functions for the task publisher the mechanism&#39;s goals are met. The proposed mechanism is initially modeled as a nonconvex functional optimization with the double continuum of constraints, nevertheless, we demonstrate that by deriving an equivalent form of the incentive constraints, it can be reformulated as a tractable convex optimal control problem. Further, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain the solution.},

The proposed scheme extends previous solutions by allowing the handling of time-varying dynamic interconnections, including the online addition/removal of subsystems (plug-and-play) during normal system operations. This approach ensures global coordination of the subsystems while effectively handling corresponding changes in the underlying constraint topology. The coordination is achieved by determining a distributed feasible set-point for each subsystem when the nominal set-point becomes unfeasible due to topological changes in the system, resulting in constraints violation. In order to address this challenge, this article generalizes the distributed command governor (CG) theory to handle online requests for structural changes in the system and/or in the coordination constraints. An add-on module is provided for each local CG to process the coordination constraints and appropriately schedule the topology changes when certain formal conditions are satisfied. This ensures that the coordination constraints are satisfied even during the topological changes. Case studies are presented by evaluating the proposed strategy on the coordination of a formation of moving vehicles and a water distribution network. These simulations are used to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Strategic decision-making in uncertain and adversarial environments is crucial for the security of modern systems and infrastructures. A salient feature of many optimal decision-making policies is a level of unpredictability, or randomness, which helps to keep an adversary uncertain about the system&#39;s defensive strategies. This article seeks to explore decision-making policies on the other end of the spectrum—namely, whether there are benefits in revealing one&#39;s strategic intentions to an opponent before engaging in competition. We study these scenarios in a well-studied model of competitive resource allocation problem known as General Lotto games. In the classic formulation, two competing players simultaneously allocate their assets to a set of battlefields, and the resulting payoffs are derived in a zero-sum fashion. Here, we consider a three-stage extension where one of the players has the option to publicly precommit assets in a binding fashion to battlefields before play begins. In response, the opponent decides which of these battlefields to secure (or abandon) by matching the precommitment with its own assets. They then engage in a General Lotto game over the remaining set of battlefields. Interestingly, this article highlights many scenarios where strategically revealing intentions in this fashion can actually significantly improve one&#39;s payoff. Thus, we show precommitments can serve as alternate decision-making policies that contrast with conventional policies where randomness is the central component of strategy in adversarial environments.},

We propose an open-loop control scheme for multivehicle planning, with both target sets and collision avoidance constraints. Our method relies on the one-sided Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality, a tool from statistics used to bound tail probabilities of unimodal random variables. Using the one-sided Vysochanskij–Petunin inequality, we reformulate each chance constraint in terms of the expectation and standard deviation. While the reformulated bounds are conservative with respect to the original bounds, they have a simple and closed form, and are amenable to difference of convex optimization techniques. We demonstrate our approach on a multisatellite rendezvous problem.},

The objective is to guarantee the evolution of the tracking error within a performance funnel with prescribed asymptotic shape (thus achieving desired transient and asymptotic accuracy objectives), for any sufficiently smooth reference signal. We design a novel funnel controller which, in order to satisfy the input constraints, contains a dynamic component, which widens the funnel boundary whenever the input saturation is active. This design is model-free, of low-complexity and extends earlier funnel control approaches. We present a simulation where the controller is compared with these approaches.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized optimization enables a network of agents to cooperatively optimize an overall objective function without a central coordinator and is gaining increased attention in domains as diverse as control, sensor networks, data mining, and robotics. However, the information sharing among agents in decentralized optimization also discloses agents&#39; information, which is undesirable or even unacceptable when involved data are sensitive. This article proposes two gradient-based decentralized optimization algorithms that can protect participating agents&#39; privacy without compromising optimization accuracy or incurring heavy communication/computational overhead. Both algorithms leverage a judiciously designed mixing matrix and time-varying uncoordinated stepsizes to enable privacy, one using diminishing stepsizes while the other using nondiminishing stepsizes. In both algorithms, when interacting with any one of its neighbors, a participating agent only needs to share one message in each iteration, which is in contrast to most gradient-tracking-based algorithms requiring every agent to share two messages (an optimization variable and a gradient-tracking variable) under nondiminishing stepsizes. Furthermore, both algorithms can guarantee the privacy of a participating agent even when all information shared by the agent are accessible to an adversary, a scenario in which most existing accuracy-maintaining privacy approaches will fail to protect privacy. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

We prove that uniform complete controllability of the open-loop system is necessary for uniform global nonsingular attainability of the closed-loop system and is sufficient if the coefficients of the open-loop system are time invariant. From here, we demonstrate that if a given discrete-time linear time-invariant system is completely controllable, then, by choosing a suitable time-varying feedback, it is possible to yield a dynamic equivalence between the closed-loop system and an arbitrary discrete time-varying linear system, which has a Lyapunov sequence as its coefficient matrix.},

We learn the nonlinear operator from the plant parameters to the control gains with a (deep) neural network. We provide closed-loop stability guarantees (global exponential) under an neural network (NN)-approximation of the feedback gains. While, in the existing PDE backstepping, finding the gain kernel requires (one offline) solution to an integral equation, the neural operator (NO) approach we propose learns the mapping from the functional coefficients of the plant PDE to the kernel function by employing a sufficiently high number of offline numerical solutions to the kernel integral equation, for a large enough number of the PDE model&#39;s different functional coefficients. We prove the existence of a DeepONet approximation, with arbitrarily high accuracy, of the exact nonlinear continuous operator mapping PDE coefficient functions into gain functions. Once proven to exist, learning of the NO is standard, completed “once and for all” (never online) and the kernel integral equation does not need to be solved ever again, for any new functional coefficient not exceeding the magnitude of the functional coefficients used for training. We also present an extension from approximating the gain kernel operator to approximating the full feedback law mapping, from plant parameter functions and state measurement functions to the control input, with semiglobal practical stability guarantees. Simulation illustrations are provided and code is available online. 1 1https://github.com/lukebhan/NeuralOperatorsForGainKernels This framework, eliminating real-time recomputation of gains, has the potential to be game changing for adaptive control of PDEs and gain scheduling control of nonlinear PDEs.

We provide a characterization of a simulating map that provably contains all monotone functions that are consistent with the data. This map is also minimal in the sense that any set-valued map containing all consistent monotone functions would also include the map we are proposing. We show that this minimal simulating map is interval-valued and admits a simple construction on a finite partition induced by the data. As the complexity of the partition increases with the amount of data, we also consider the problem of computing minimal interval-valued simulating maps defined on partitions that are fixed a priori. We present an efficient algorithm for their computation. We then use those data-driven over-approximations to build models for partially unknown systems where the unknown part is monotone. The resulting models are used to construct finite-state symbolic abstractions, paving the way for discrete controller synthesis methods to be applied. We extend our approach to handle systems with bounded derivatives and introduce an algorithm to calculate the bounds on those derivatives and on the disturbances from the data. We present several numerical experiments to test the performance of the introduced method and show that the data-driven abstractions are suitable for controller synthesis purposes.},

The pursuer is assumed to have a greater acceleration and attempt to capture the evader as quickly as possible, while the evader wants to avoid or delay the capture. Different from the problems with single integrator dynamics, optimal strategies for such a problem are not intuitive. To solve this problem, we exploit both geometrical methods and differential games. Specifically, we first illustrate some properties of the optimal strategies, using which isochrones of the players are constructed. Then, by exploring the geometrical characteristics of the isochrones of the two players, we derive the target point directly without using the explicit formula of the intersections of isochrones. We propose an algorithm to determine the capture time, which is exactly the value function of the game, and finally the optimal strategies are derived subsequently. To prove the optimality of the proposed strategies, differential games and Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation are used, where we show that the proposed value function is the solution to the HJI equation under our proposed strategies. Moreover, we apply our results to the game with one pursuer and multiple evaders, and some useful results are given. Finally, we carry out various simulations to show the optimality and effectiveness of our proposed strategies.},

  abstract     = {A class of closed-form distributed controllers achieving leader-following in a multiagent system (MAS) with distance-limited communications in a compact obstructed environment is developed: given a user-provided navigation field for a single point agent as an input, the desired MAS PnP (“Plug-and-Play”) controller is obtained through a closed-form expression. In particular, cooperative navigation in an environment of arbitrary complexity is achievable whenever an adequate single-agent navigation solution is available. Sufficient conditions on the navigation field in relation to the communication radius are developed, guaranteeing that a prescribed initial graph of agents retains all of its edges while following a leader. In contrast with existing work, the standard radial symmetric interactions among agents are replaced with an asymmetrically rescaled version of the provided navigation field, removing the need for assumptions such as the sphericity or convexity of obstacles, and enabling the switching of the attractive interactions between neighbors on and off as needed. This approach elucidates the tradeoffs between communication range, the size of the MAS, the control effort required for cooperation, and the complexity of navigating in the provided environment. The reliance of the approach on navigation fields enables the use of state-of-the-art sensing-based reactive navigation methods designed for settings with incomplete prior knowledge of the environment and based on a sphere-world model layer. For this reason, two case studies are provided—one of sphere worlds, and the other of topological sphere worlds with star-convex obstacles—comparing different variations of the PnP controller derived from state-of-the-art single-agent navigation fields.},

For throughput analysis, we first use insights into congestion spillback to propose novel Lyapunov functions and then exploit monotone network dynamics to reduce computational costs of verifying stability conditions. For control design, we show that 1) for a network with infinite link storage space, there exists an open-loop control that attains the min-expected-cut capacity; 2) for a network with observable disruptions that restrict maximum sending and/or receiving flows, there exists a mode-dependent control that attains the expected-min-cut capacity; 3) for general networks, there exists a closed-loop control with throughput guarantees.

As opposed to conventional formulations based on partial differential equations, our FBSDE-based formulation can be easily implemented by optimizing criteria over sample data and is, therefore, less sensitive to the state dimension. In particular, both on-policy and off-policy evaluation methods are discussed by constructing different FBSDEs. The backward-measurability-loss criterion is then proposed for solving these equations. By choosing specific weight functions in the proposed criterion, we can recover the popular deep BSDE method or the martingale approach for BSDEs. The convergence results are established under both ideal and practical conditions, depending on whether the optimization criteria are decreased to zero. In the ideal case, we prove that the policy sequences produced by the proposed FBSDE-based algorithms and the standard policy iteration have the same performance and, thus, have the same convergence rate. In the practical case, the proposed algorithm is still proved to converge robustly under mild assumptions on optimization errors.},

The MAS operate at a competitive equilibrium to ensure a balanced supply and demand for available resources. Example resources include energy in a microgrid and carbon permits in a carbon trading system. First, we investigate the MAS over a finite horizon, where the utility functions of agents are parameterized to incorporate individual preferences. We shape individual preferences through a set of utility functions to guarantee the resource price at a competitive equilibrium remains socially acceptable, i.e., the price is upper-bounded by an affordability threshold. We show this problem is solvable implicitly. Next, we consider quadratic MAS and formulate the social shaping problem as a multiagent linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. We propose explicit utility sets using quadratic programming and dynamic programming. Moreover, we propose a numerical algorithm for calculating a tight range of the preference function parameters that guarantee a socially accepted price. We then investigate the properties of a competitive equilibrium over an infinite horizon, and show cases where any competitive equilibrium maximizes the social welfare. We show that for initial conditions sufficiently close to the origin, the social welfare maximization solution constitutes a competitive equilibrium with zero price. We also show that for all feasible initial conditions, there exists a time instant after which the optimal price, corresponding to a competitive equilibrium, becomes zero.},

Given the noncooperative relationship among participating players, protecting the privacy of individual players becomes imperative when sensitive information is involved. We propose a fully distributed equilibrium-seeking approach for aggregative games that can achieve both rigorous differential privacy and guaranteed computation accuracy of the Nash equilibrium. This is in sharp contrast to existing differential-privacy solutions for aggregative games that have to either sacrifice the accuracy of equilibrium computation to gain rigorous privacy guarantees or allow the cumulative privacy budget to grow unbounded, hence, losing privacy guarantees as iteration proceeds. Our approach uses independent noises across players, thus making it effective even when adversaries have access to all shared messages as well as the underlying algorithm structure. The encryption-free nature of the proposed approach also ensures efficiency in computation and communication. The approach is also applicable in stochastic aggregative games, able to ensure both rigorous differential privacy and guaranteed computation accuracy of the Nash equilibrium when individual players only have stochastic estimates of their pseudogradient mappings. Numerical comparisons with existing counterparts confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Despite the recent development of distributed constrained optimization algorithms in the literature, it is still a challenging issue to construct distributed algorithms to efficiently solve the constrained optimization problem with convergence rate guarantees, especially for the case with general constraints and unbalanced time-varying digraphs. This article aims to investigate the distributed discrete-time optimization problem over time-varying unbalanced digraphs with general constraints including the nonidentical closed convex set constraints, the multiple equality, and inequality constraints. Toward this end, a new kind of distributed discrete-time algorithm synthesizing some graph topology-dependent row stochastic and column stochastic weight matrix sequences is proposed and employed. In virtue of a randomized constraint solving method, it is theoretically shown that the proposed algorithm can efficiently deal with the considered distributed optimization problem with a large number of inequality constraints and the inequality constraints that cannot be known in advance. Furthermore, the almost sure convergence of the proposed distributed constrained optimization algorithm is theoretically demonstrated under some mild assumptions. The explicit convergence rate for the designed distributed algorithm is provided, like the centralized counterpart. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the present algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the zonotope-based distributed set-membership state estimation problem is considered for a class of nonlinear multirate complex networks (MRCN) subjected to unknown but bounded (UBB) noises and eavesdropping attacks. Both the process and measurement noises and the system linearization errors are constrained within known zonotopes. To ensure the communication security between the sensor and the estimator, an encryption–decryption mechanism (EDM) is proposed to prevent data from being eavesdropped by illegal intruders during transmission. The encryption errors generated by the signal encryption process are also constrained within a set of zonotopes. One purpose of this article is to design a distributed state estimation approach where the state estimation errors are confined to a set of zonotopes in the presence of UBB noises, linearization errors, and encryption errors. By minimizing the $F$ -radius, which characterizes the size of zonotope, the desired estimator gains are recursively obtained. Subsequently, the influence of the designed EDM on the zonotope constraints of state estimation error is analyzed. Firstly, the dynamic upper bounds of the $F$ -radius of the zonotope constraints are calculated, and the conditions for upper bound convergence are discussed under the designed EDM. Then, the design rule of the dynamic encryption keys is provided. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the validity of the developed state estimation algorithm and the designed EDM.},

  abstract     = {In feedback control of dynamical systems, the choice of a higher loop gain is typically desirable to achieve a faster closed-loop dynamics, smaller tracking error, and more effective disturbance suppression. Yet, an increased loop gain requires a higher control effort, which can extend beyond the actuation capacity of the feedback system and intermittently cause actuator saturation. To benefit from the advantages of a high feedback gain and simultaneously avoid actuator saturation, this article advocates a dynamic gain adaptation technique in which the loop gain is lowered whenever necessary to prevent actuator saturation, and is raised again whenever possible. This concept is optimized for linear systems based on an optimal control formulation inspired by the notion of linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The quadratic cost functional adopted in the LQR is modified into a certain quasi-quadratic form in which the control cost is dynamically emphasized or deemphasized as a function of the system state. The optimal control law resulted from this quasi-quadratic cost functional is essentially nonlinear, but its structure resembles an LQR with an adaptable gain adjusted by the state of system, aimed to prevent actuator saturation. Moreover, under mild assumptions analogous to those of LQR, this optimal control law is stabilizing. As an illustrative example, application of this optimal control law in feedback design for dc servomotors is examined, and its performance is verified by numerical simulations.},

Different from the sampling control of single systems, the pathological sampling of node systems could be eliminated by an appropriate design of network structure and inner couplings. Whereas the pathological sampling of single nodes will cause the entire system with a singular topology matrix to lose controllability. Moreover, any periodic sampling will not affect the controllability of networked systems with specific node dynamics.

  abstract     = {Whether a population of decision-makers reach a state of satisfactory decisions is a fundamental problem in studying collective behaviors. In the framework of evolutionary game theory, researchers used potential functions to establish equilibration under best-response and imitation update rules by imposing conditions on the individuals&#39; utility functions, and in turn to control the population toward a desired equilibrium. Nevertheless, finding a potential function is often daunting, if not near impossible. We introduce the so-called coordinating agent whose tendency to switch to a decision changes only if another agent switches to that decision. We prove that any population of coordinating agents, a coordinating population , almost surely equilibrates. Apparently, some binary network games that were proven to equilibrate using potential functions are coordinating, and some coloring problems can be solved using this notion. We additionally show that mixed networks of agents following best-response, imitation, or rational imitation, and associated with $\text{2}\times\text{2}$ coordination payoff matrices are coordinating, and hence, equilibrate. As a second contribution, we provide an incentive-based control algorithm that leads coordinating populations to a desired equilibrium by iteratively maximizing the ratio of the number of agents choosing the desired decision to the provided incentive. It performs near optimal and as well as specialized algorithms proposed for best-response and imitation; however, it does not require a potential function.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the question whether model knowledge can guide a defender to appropriate decisions, or not, when an attacker intrudes into control systems. The model-based defense scheme considered in this study, namely Bayesian defense mechanism, chooses reasonable reactions through observation of the system&#39;s behavior using models of the system&#39;s stochastic dynamics, the vulnerability to be exploited, and the attacker&#39;s objective. On the other hand, rational attackers take deceptive strategies for misleading the defender into making inappropriate decisions. In this article, their dynamic decision making is formulated as a stochastic signaling game. It is shown that the belief of the true scenario has a limit in a stochastic sense at an equilibrium based on martingale analysis. This fact implies that there are only two possible cases: 1) the defender asymptotically detects the attack with a firm belief, or 2) the attacker takes actions such that the system&#39;s behavior becomes nominal after a finite number of time steps. Consequently, if different scenarios result in different stochastic behaviors, the Bayesian defense mechanism guarantees the system to be secure in an asymptotic manner provided that effective countermeasures are implemented. As an application of the finding, a defensive deception utilizing asymmetric recognition of vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker is analyzed. It is shown that the attacker possibly withdraws even if the defender is unaware of the exploited vulnerabilities, as long as the defender&#39;s unawareness is concealed by the defensive deception.},

In this article, we combine these two control mechanisms to synthesize a more powerful supervisor. The control goal is to design an isolation supervisor, which ensures in the closed-loop system, faults are fault isolatable in the sense that after a fault occurs, we can determine which type the fault belongs to by observing the output of the closed-loop system. The isolation supervisor starts to work when the occurrence of faults is detected. We solve the isolation supervisor synthesis problem as follows. For a given discrete event system, we first construct a bipartite transition system which includes all feasible isolation supervisors. An isolation supervisor is feasible if it enforces only events that are physically possible. We then develop an algorithm to check whether the synthesis problem is solvable or not. The algorithm can also be used to find a valid isolation supervisor if the synthesis problem is solvable. The method of combining two control mechanisms can be used to synthesize more powerful supervisors for other supervisory control problems of discrete event systems as well.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate both qualitative and quantitative synthesis of optimal privacy-enforcing supervisors for partially observed discrete-event systems. We consider a dynamic system whose information flow is partially available to an intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer. We assume that the system has a “secret” that does not want to be revealed to the intruder. Our goal is to synthesize a supervisor that controls the system in a least-restrictive manner such that the closed-loop system meets the privacy requirement. For the qualitative case, we adopt the notion of infinite-step opacity as the privacy specification by requiring that the intruder can never determine for sure that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific instant. If the qualitative synthesis problem is not solvable or the synthesized solution is too restrictive, then we further investigate the quantitative synthesis problem so that the secret is revealed (if unavoidable) as late as possible within a finite security-preserving horizon. Effective algorithms are provided to solve both the qualitative and quantitative synthesis problems. Specifically, by building suitable information structures that involve information delays, we show that the optimal qualitative synthesis problem can be solved as a safety game. The optimal quantitative synthesis problem can also be solved as an optimal total-cost control problem over an augmented information structure. Our work provides a complete solution to the standard infinite-step opacity control problem, which has not been solved without an assumption on the relationship between controllable events and observable events. Furthermore, we generalize the opacity enforcement problem to the numerical setting by introducing the secret-revelation-time as a new quantitative measure.},

The distributed attackers to be synthesized should fulfill the following goals: 1) Each local sensor–actuator attacker needs to remain covert against all the distributed monitors, which are used to detect the existence of attacks; and 2) the distributed sensor–actuator attackers need to cooperate to implement attacks such that the damage infliction could be realized. To solve this distributed attacker synthesis problem, our solution methodology is to first model the original problem as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem by modeling each system component as a finite-state automaton and then perform incremental synthesis with a heuristic that takes the special structure of this distributed synthesis problem into consideration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated via an example regarding the transportation task of multiple robots.},

A new indicator, the maximum number in updating disorder, is proposed to evaluate the intensity of updating disorder. Then, to describe the complicated relationship between transmission and updating time sequences in the presence of updating disorder, some auxiliary variables are introduced, which result in two new memory vectors for computing the update of measurement errors. Subsequently, after an elaborate investigation for the evolutions of the introduced variables and vectors, a new hybrid model is established for the closed-loop system. Furthermore, sufficient conditions on closed-loop stability are proposed by constructing a new function that characterizes the effects of the evolutions of measurement errors in different cases of transmission and updating. Moreover, a popular mechanism in existing studies for compensating updating disorder is reviewed. Its efficiency is evaluated after comparing the stability conditions with and without using compensation mechanisms. Finally, a practical nonlinear example of single-link robot arms is simulated to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the theoretical results.},

For this purpose, the notion of Zhukovskii stability, typically stated for continuous-time systems, is extended to the hybrid systems. Necessary conditions, particularly, a condition using a forward invariance notion, for existence of hybrid limit cycles are first presented. In addition, a sufficient condition, related to Zhukovskii stability, for the existence of (or lack of) hybrid limit cycles is established. Furthermore, under mild assumptions, we show that asymptotic stability of such hybrid limit cycles is not only equivalent to asymptotic stability of a fixed point of the associated Poincaré map but also robust to perturbations. Specifically, robustness to generic perturbations, which capture state noise and unmodeled dynamics, and to inflations of the flow and jump sets are established in terms of $\mathcal {KL}$ bounds. Furthermore, results establishing relationships between the properties of a computed Poincaré map, which is necessarily affected by computational error, and the actual asymptotic stability properties of a hybrid limit cycle are proposed. In particular, it is shown that asymptotic stability of the exact Poincaré map is preserved when computed with enough precision. Two examples, including a congestion control system, are presented to illustrate the notions and results throughout this article.},

  abstract     = {Optimal linear feedback control design is a valuable but challenging problem due to the nonconvexity of the underlying optimization and the infinite dimensionality of the Hardy space of stabilizing controllers. A powerful class of techniques for solving optimal control problems involves using reparameterization to transform the control design into a convex but infinite-dimensional optimization. To make the problem tractable, historical work focuses on Galerkin-type finite-dimensional approximations to Hardy space, especially those involving Lorentz series approximations such as the finite impulse response approximation. However, Lorentz series approximations can lead to infeasibility, difficulty incorporating prior knowledge, deadbeat control in the case of finite impulse response, and increased suboptimality. The goal of this two-part article is to introduce a new Galerkin-type method based on approximation by transfer functions with a selection of simple poles, and to apply this simple pole approximation for optimal control design. In Part I, error bounds for approximating arbitrary transfer functions in Hardy space are provided based on the geometry of the pole selection. It is shown that the space of transfer functions with these simple poles converges to the full Hardy space, and a uniform convergence rate is provided based purely on the geometry of the pole selection. This is then specialized to derive a convergence rate for a particularly interesting pole selection based on an Archimedes spiral. In Part II, the simple pole approximation is combined with system-level synthesis, a recent reparameterization approach, to develop a new control design method with desirable properties and bounded suboptimality.},

The estimate of the dynamics is used in an optimization-based control law that ensures safety while expanding the operating region of the dynamical system as the dynamic model is identified. We provide conditions for when the control law is locally Lipschitz continuous. The RISE-based disturbance observer can provide safety guarantees to a secondary model of the dynamics of unknown accuracy.

When the time-varying projection matrix satisfies a so-called continuity condition, the sliding function is continuous along the state trajectories, which will facilitate the analysis and design of SMC laws. To obtain a tractable design algorithm on the time-varying projection matrix, a regular form is introduced for the representation of the considered impulsive system. Within this framework, the projection matrix is represented as a piecewise time-varying form based on a partition on the impulse intervals, which can be determined by finite constant gain matrices. Then, a piecewise Lyapunov function associated with the partition is constructed to analyze the stability of the reduced-order sliding dynamics. By this means, the solvability condition for the desired sliding function is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, a numerical example that considers four types of impulses is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on a class of problems where a switched system approach is used to model intermittencies in state feedback. Specifically, a single-agent with nonlinear dynamics is tasked with following a desired path that lies in a feedback-denied region where state feedback is unavailable. As a result, the agent must use open-loop state estimates (dead-reckon) to navigate along the desired path while periodically returning to a known feedback region where the accumulated dead-reckoning errors are regulated. A dwell-time update mechanism is developed that leverages intermittent data measurements to generate a relaxed dwell-time condition in comparison to previous literature. The updated dwell-time conditions are used to plan the duration spent following the desired path before returning to the feedback region to acquire state feedback. A Lyapunov-based switched system dwell-time analysis is used to show the state tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded to a prescribed error threshold that also guarantees re-entry of the agent to the feedback region. Comparative numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method.},

The CGVF is characterized by three terms, i.e., a convergence term to drive the robots to converge to the desired surface, a propagation term to provide a traversing direction for maneuvering on the desired surface, and a coordinated term to achieve the surface motion coordination with an arbitrary ordering of the robotic group. By setting the surface parameters as additional virtual coordinates, the proposed approach eliminates potential singularity of the CGVF and enables both the global convergence to the desired surface and the maneuvering on the surface from all possible initial conditions. The ordering-flexible surface motion coordination is realized by each robot to share with its neighbors only two virtual coordinates, i.e., that of a given target and that of its own, which reduces the communication and computation cost in multirobot surface navigation . Finally, the effectiveness of the CGVF is substantiated by extensive numerical simulations.},

Then, the idea of dynamic linearization is adopted to obtain the equivalent linear dynamics of nonlinear agents. Furthermore, a distributed predictive controller is designed with the help of the auxiliary variables and the acquired time-varying linear system model. Compared with the existing schemes, the proposed controller compensates for the delayed signals in an active way, makes the traditional model-based predictive control method get rid of the dependence on the accurate system model, and carries out the rolling prediction in a distributed form.

  abstract     = {Q-learning is known as one of the fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Its convergence has been the focus of extensive research over the past several decades. Recently, a new finite-time error bound and analysis for Q-learning was introduced using a switching system framework. This approach views the dynamics of Q-learning as a discrete-time stochastic switching system. The prior study established a finite-time error bound on the averaged iterates using Lyapunov functions, offering further insights into Q-learning. While valuable, the analysis focuses on error bounds of the averaged iterate, which comes with the inherent disadvantages: It necessitates extra averaging steps, which can decelerate the convergence rate. Moreover, the final iterate, being the original format of Q-learning, is more commonly used and is often regarded as a more intuitive and natural form in the majority of iterative algorithms. In this article, we present a finite-time error bound on the final iterate of Q-learning based on the switching system framework. The proposed error bounds have different features compared to the previous works, and cover different scenarios. Finally, we expect that the proposed results provide additional insights on Q-learning via connections with discrete-time switching systems, and can potentially present a new template for finite-time analysis of more general RL algorithms.},

Consequently, its scope is limited to linear or preparameterized systems. In this study, we formulate the identification as a (nonparametric) kernel regression problem applicable to nonlinear dynamic systems, which facilitates the joint assessment of the data fitness and fidelity of dynamics, that is, the error between the state derivative and the vector field. This is realized by employing “smooth” kernels, which facilitate the embedding of the state derivative into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. To demonstrate the feasibility of the formulation, we extend the representer theorem, resulting in a finite dimensional albeit nonconvex minimization problem. To achieve fast linear estimation despite the nonconvexity, we propose a practical algorithm, called state-dynamics alternate descent, which is basically an unconstrained iterated quadratic programming. Furthermore, the proposed method was evaluated using the example of a simple nonlinear pendulum.},

We then design a continuous composite controller by integrating the disturbance compensation term and the state feedback term computed via solving the quadratic program, such that the undesirable influence of time-varying disturbances on both control performance and safety property can be effectively attenuated. It shows that under the proposed continuous control method, the robust safety property of dynamical systems can be strictly guaranteed in the presence of time-varying disturbances. Moreover, the results on the continuous safe control are extended into the sampled-data case, where the control input keeps the same in the intersample time intervals.

To compensate uncertainties, an adaptive controller is designed with a switching parameter by utilizing adding a power integrator method. A logic switching rule is constructed based on fixed-time stability theorem to tune the switching parameter online. To save communication resources, a novel event-triggered mechanism is designed by introducing a $K_\infty$ class function and a pretrigger idea. This design enables the controller to update timely when all state variables reach zero, while avoiding redundant switching. In order to achieve coexistence of the two discrete conditions, a new fixed-time switching event-triggered mechanism is developed to determine the moments of triggering and switching reasonably.

Moreover, considering the nonsynchronization between the controller mode and the system mode caused by the delayed measurements between agents, a continuous-time hidden Markov model is constructed to simulate this situation, in which the introduced mode-independent detector can directly observe the unmeasured information. Besides, by designing a novel distributed asynchronous SMC law, some sufficient conditions are provided to ensure fast consensus within a finite-time interval.

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the leader–follower consensus of multiagent systems over finite fields, which model agents with limited capacities for storing, processing, and transmitting the information, from the perspectives of the transition graph and the characteristic polynomial of the network matrix, respectively. By the features of dynamics over finite fields, we reveal that the transition graph of networks achieving the leader–follower consensus over finite fields is either a spanning in-tree topped at zero-state or is composed of spanning in-trees with the same structure, topped at steady states. To address the high time complexity associated with transition graphs and existing methods, we integrate the characteristic polynomial of the network matrix with the cycle and tree structures in the transition graph. As a result, a concise criterion is established only based on the characteristic polynomial, which merely requires polynomial computational complexity with respect to the number of network nodes. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate property verification problems in partially-observed discrete-event systems (DES). Particularly, we are interested in verifying observational properties that are related to the information-flow of the system. Observational properties considered here include diagnosability, predictability, detectability, and opacity, which have drawn considerable attentions in the literature. However, in contrast to existing results, where different verification procedures are developed for different properties case by case, in this work, we provide a unified framework for verifying all these properties by reducing each of them as an instance of HyperLTL model checking . Our approach is based on the construction of a Kripke structure that effectively captures the issue of unobservability as well as the finite string semantics in partially-observed DES so that HyperLTL model checking techniques can be suitably applied. Then for each observational property considered, we explicitly provide the HyperLTL formula to be checked over the Kripke structure for the purpose of verification. Our approach is uniform in the sense that all different properties can be verified with the same model checking engine and also brings new insights for classifying observational properties in terms of their verification complexity. Numerical experiments are conducted, which show that our framework is computationally more efficient for verifying properties involving quantifier alternations, such as opacity, compared with the standard subset-based approaches.},

Self-triggering mechanisms (STMs) are widely used in MASs, thanks to their advantages in avoiding continuous monitoring and saving computing and communication resources. However, existing results require the knowledge of system matrices, which are difficult to obtain in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we present a data-driven approach to designing STMs for unknown MASs building upon the model-based solutions. Our approach leverages a system lifting method, which allows us to derive a data-driven representation for the MAS. Subsequently, a data-driven STC scheme is designed, which combines a data-driven STM with a state feedback control law. We establish a data-based stability criterion for asymptotic consensus of the closed-loop MAS in terms of linear matrix inequalities, whose solution provides a matrix for the STM as well as a stabilizing controller gain. Numerical tests are conducted to validate the correctness of the proposed data-driven STC.},

As a new attempt, without using complete system dynamics, the composite controller is designed by using controller of the different subsystems along with the usage of the subsystem decomposition technique by means of singular perturbation theory. Compared with the existing policy iteration and value iteration algorithms, there is no enforced requirement for a stabilizing control strategy and the increase in convergence speed is achieved by the proposed hybrid iteration algorithm. For the purpose of considering that the fast and slow subsystems have different characteristics, two hybrid iteration algorithms that can be applied in different situations are developed.

For such a system, we derive, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient stabilization condition utilizing a delay-dependent algebraic Riccati equation. Different from many previous works, one significant contribution is that our control policy is designed as the feedback of an extended state that contains the current available state and relevant past control information. Furthermore, we introduce an existence and uniqueness theorem for the maximum packet loss rate in symmetric systems. Notably, we derive its closed-form expression specifically in the scalar case.},

We show that the scores can be efficiently calculated by using a proposed algorithm based on the projected gradient method on the standard simplex. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than an existing interior point method, and the proposed scores can correctly capture the importance of each state node on controllability, outperforming existing control centralities.},

To cope with the resulting complexity, several approaches have been suggested in the past. Some of them rely on solving a reformulated and relaxed control problem, referred to as partial outer convexification (POC). Inspired by an efficient algorithm for switching time optimization by Stellato and coworkers, SwitchTimeOpt.jl, we developed an algorithmic approach for POC implemented in a Julia package. Both approaches are based on linearization and exponential integration to obtain second derivatives. We show the efficiency and applicability of the novel approach by comparing it to SwitchTimeOpt.jl, by extending the concept and calculations to the treatment of constraints, and by investigating warm starting of switching time optimization. An additional comparison to a CasADi-based standard single shooting approach shows a significant reduction in computational time despite an increase in iterations. The new solver facilitates the reliable and fast solution of mixed-integer optimal control problems.},

  abstract     = {This article adopts the event-triggered control strategy to investigate the consensus problem of multiagent systems. Owing to the effect of random noises, the communication information among agents is transmitted based on binary-valued measurements. Each agent employs the recursive projection algorithm to estimate the states of all neighbors. Then, an event-triggered protocol with time-varying threshold parameters is proposed to guarantee that the state of each agent can lie within the same bounded region as the estimate of its neighbors&#39; states. Furthermore, this article emphasizes that this kind of same bounded relation is necessary and essential to achieve a precise state estimate and the desired consensus performance. By the designed control law, the estimation error and the consensus error can converge to zero in the mean square sense with explicit convergence rates $O(t^{-a})$ $(a&amp;gt;0$ is a constant). Finally, this article shows that the communication rate of the designed control scheme can almost surely converge to zero with a rate $o(t^{-\kappa })$ $(\kappa &amp;gt;0$ is a constant), and is much lower than the existing results when achieving the same convergence value. Thus, the communication resources can be saved. An example is presented to illustrate the advantage of the proposed control strategy.},

The approach is based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that approximate the time-delay system. The ODEs are derived via spectral methods, e.g., the Chebyshev collocation method (also called pseudospectral discretization) or the Legendre tau method. A core insight is that the Lyapunov–Krasovskii theorem resembles a theorem for Lyapunov–Rumyantsev partial stability in ODEs. For the linear approximating ODE, only a Lyapunov equation has to be solved to obtain a partial Lyapunov function. The latter approximates the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. Results are validated by applying Clenshaw–Curtis and Gauss quadrature to a semianalytical result of the functional, yielding a comparable finite-dimensional approximation. In particular, the article provides a formula for a tight quadratic lower bound, which is important in applications. Examples confirm that this new bound is significantly less conservative than known results.},

We propose two set-valued maps for the forward and backward distributional reachability problems: the forward map collects all state distributions that can be reached from a set of initial distributions, while the backward map collects all state distributions that can reach a set of final distributions. We show that there exists a maximal invariant set under the forward map and this set is the region where the state distributions eventually always belong to, regardless of the initial state distribution and policy. The backward map provides an alternative way to solve a class of important problems for MDPs: the study of controlled invariance, the characterization of the domain of attraction, and reach-avoid problems.

According to the Rankine–Hugoniot condition, a propagation equation of the shock front is proposed depending on the characteristic velocities of the Aw–Rascle–Zhang traffic flow model. Then, the complete dynamics of the stop-and-go waves is formulated as a coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE– PDE) system with a common moving boundary. The well posedness of the coupled system with the moving boundary is established via the fixed-domain method. To stabilize the discontinuous traffic state and the location of shock front simultaneously, the bilateral boundary feedback control is formulated for the stop-and-go waves of traffic flow. Some sufficient conditions in terms of matrix inequalities are derived for ensuring the local exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the $H^{2}$ –norm.

  abstract     = {Feedback optimization is a control paradigm that enables physical systems to autonomously reach efficient operating points. Its central idea is to interconnect optimization iterations in a closed loop with the physical plant. Since iterative gradient-based methods are extensively used to achieve optimality, feedback optimization controllers typically require knowledge of the steady-state sensitivity of the plant, which may not be easily accessible in some applications. In contrast, in this article, we develop a model-free feedback controller for efficient steady-state operation of general dynamical systems. The proposed design consists of updating control inputs via gradient estimates constructed from evaluations of the nonconvex objective at the current input and at the measured output. We study the dynamic interconnection of the proposed iterative controller with a stable nonlinear discrete-time plant. For this setup, we characterize the optimality and stability of the closed-loop behavior as functions of the problem dimension, the number of iterations, and the rate of convergence of the physical plant. To handle general constraints that affect multiple inputs, we enhance the controller with Frank–Wolfe-type updates.},

  abstract     = {As a common strategy of contagious disease containment, lockdowns inevitably have economic cost. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscores the tradeoff arising from public health and economic cost. An optimal lockdown policy to resolve this tradeoff is desired. Here, we propose a mathematical framework of pandemic control through an optimal fixed stabilizing nonuniform lockdown, where our goal is to reduce the economic activity as little as possible while decreasing the number of infected individuals at a prescribed rate. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal stabilizing lockdown policy for general epidemic spread models, including both the classical susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS)/susceptible-infectious-recovered/susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered models and a model of COVID-19 transmissions. We demonstrate the power of this framework by analyzing publicly available data of intercounty travel frequencies to analyze a model of COVID-19 spread in the 62 counties of New York State. We find that an optimal stabilizing lockdown based on epidemic status in April 2020 would have reduced economic activity more stringently outside of New York City compared to within it, even though the epidemic was much more prevalent in New York City at that point. This finding holds for a variety of epidemic models and parameters from the literature, and is robust to errors in travel rates, different cost functions, and potential urban–rural transmission spread differentials.},

First, by introducing an external disturbance observer, a balanced compensation variable and using the output regulation technique, a new robust continuous-time DOC algorithm is developed, ensuring that the sum of the local convex objective functions is optimal and the behaviors of all agents are coordinated. Then, a robust event-triggered DOC algorithm is designed, which consists of an event-triggered closed-loop controller and an event-triggered balanced compensator. Compared with the existing distributed optimization algorithms, the algorithms of this article solve the DOC problem over unbalanced directed communication network. The heterogeneous agent dynamics with external disturbances considered in this article are in a general form. Further, the introduction of the event-triggering mechanism can avoid continuous information transmission and improve the efficiency of system resources utilization.

Departing from previous approaches, we consider implicit, rather than explicit, representations for controlled invariant sets. Moreover, by considering such representations in the space of states and finite input sequences we obtain closed-form expressions for controlled invariant sets. An immediate advantage is the ability to handle high-dimensional systems since the closed-form expression is computed in a single step rather than iteratively. To validate the proposed method, we present thorough case studies illustrating that in safety-critical scenarios the implicit representation suffices in place of the explicit invariant set. The proposed method is complete in the absence of disturbances, and we provide a weak completeness result when disturbances are present.},

Due to the network&#39;s heterogeneity, complete synchronization is impossible in general, but an emergent dynamics arises. This may be characterized by two dynamical systems evolving in two timescales. The first, which is “slow,” corresponds to the dynamics of the network on the synchronization manifold. The second, which is “fast,” corresponds to that of the synchronization errors. We present a framework to analyze the emergent dynamics based on the behavior of the slow dynamics. First, we give conditions under which if the slow dynamics admits a globally asymptotically stable (GAS) equilibrium, so do the networked systems. Second, we give conditions under which if the slow dynamics admits an asymptotically stable orbit and a single unstable equilibrium point, there exists a unique periodic orbit that is almost-GAS. The emergent behavior is thus clear; the systems asymptotically synchronize in frequency, and, in the limit, as the coupling strength grows unboundedly, the emergent dynamics approaches that of the slow system. Our analysis is established using singular-perturbations theory. In that regard, we also contribute with original statements on the stability of disconnected invariant sets and limit cycles for systems in singular-perturbation form.},

We tackle the optimization problem using an implicit RPI set approach that provides a priori approximation error guarantees, and adopt a novel disturbance set parameterization that permits the encoding of the set of feasible disturbance sets as a polyhedron.

To solve the control problem, we first show that the steady-state gain of the transfer function of a linear system can be computed directly from historical data generated by the open-loop system, thus overcoming the need to first identify the full system dynamics. We leverage this data-driven representation of the steady-state gain to design a controller, which is inspired by stochastic gradient descent methods, to regulate the system to the solution of the prescribed optimization problem. A distinguishing feature of our method is that it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics or of the possibly time-varying disturbances affecting them (or their distributions). Our technical analysis combines concepts from behavioral system theory, stochastic optimization with decision-dependent distributions, and Lyapunov stability. We illustrate the applicability of the framework in a case study for mobility-on-demand ride service scheduling in Manhattan.},

We first study the secret-protecting problem with minimum cost, i.e., to design a protecting policy whose cost is minimal. We prove that the decision version of such a secret protection problem is NP-hard, which implies that there unlikely exists a polynomial algorithm to solve it. As a result, we developed a heuristic method to obtain a locally optimal solution to protect the secrets using the notion of cost-weighted centrality . Then, we consider the disruptiveness, i.e., the degree of disruptiveness of protecting policies to legal users&#39; normal operations. We formulate the disruptiveness to users incurred by the protection of events as a penalty function, which describes the impact of events and transitions on the paths leading to marker states. A heuristic method based on the notion of cost-penalty-weighted centrality is analogously developed to obtain a protecting policy, which can well balance the cost and the disruptiveness to users.},

As a particular class of recurrent neural network, the zeroing neural network (ZNN) takes time-derivative information into consideration, and thus, is a competent approach to dealing with dynamic problems. Hitherto, two kinds of ZNN models have been developed for solving systems of dynamic nonlinear equations. One of them is explicit, involving the computation of a pseudoinverse matrix, and the other is of implicit dynamics essentially. To address these two issues at once, a low-computational-complexity ZNN (LCCZNN) model is proposed. It does not need to compute any pseudoinverse matrix, and is in the form of explicit dynamics. In addition, a novel activation function is presented to endow the LCCZNN model with finite-time convergence and certain robustness, which is proved rigorously by Lyapunov theory. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the results of theoretical analyses, including the competence and robustness of the LCCZNN model. Finally, a pseudoinverse-free controller derived from the LCCZNN model is designed for a UR5 manipulator to online accomplish a trajectory-following task.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we prove new connections between two frameworks for analysis and control of nonlinear systems: the Koopman operator framework and contraction analysis. Each method, in different ways, provides exact and global analyses of nonlinear systems by way of linear systems theory. The main results of this article show equivalence between contraction and Koopman approaches for a wide class of stability analysis and control design problems. In particular, the stability or stablizability in the Koopman framework implies the existence of a contraction metric (resp. control contraction metric) for the nonlinear system. Further in certain cases, the converse holds: contraction implies the existence of a set of observables with which stability can be verified via the Koopman framework. We provide results for the cases of autonomous and time-varying systems, as well as orbital stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, the converse claims are based on a novel relation between the Koopman method and construction of a Kazantzis–Kravaris–Luenberger observer. We also provide a byproduct of the main results, that is, a new method to learn contraction metrics from trajectory data via linear system identification.},

In this class of problems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot be induced by any weighted linear combination of rewards. Hence, there exist constrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor classical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this shortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and reinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives the multiplier evolution. This approach provides a systematic state augmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning problems with constraints. Thus, as we illustrate by an example, while previous methods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while executing the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples actions from the optimal policy.},

The latter is obtained from finite noisy samples. By incorporating the measurement noise, the error of polynomial approximation, and potentially given prior knowledge on the structure of the system dynamics, we achieve computationally tractable conditions by sum of squares relaxation to verify dissipativity of nonlinear dynamical systems with rigorous guarantees. The framework is extended by combining multiple Taylor polynomial approximations, which yields a less conservative piecewise polynomial system representation.

  abstract     = {Multitime scale techniques, such as singular perturbations and averaging theory, have played an important role in the development of distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms for network systems. Such techniques rely on the uniform asymptotic stability properties of the dynamics that evolve in each of the time scales of the closed-loop system. When such properties are absent, the synthesis of multitime scale Nash equilibrium-seeking algorithms is more challenging and it requires additional regularization mechanisms. In this article, we investigate the synthesis and analysis of these mechanisms in the context of accelerated pseudogradient flows with time-varying damping in noncooperative games. Specifically, we introduce a new class of distributed and hybrid Nash set-seeking algorithms that synergistically combine dynamic momentum-based flows with coordinated discrete-time resets. The reset mechanisms can be seen as restarting techniques that allow individual players to choose their own momentum restarting policy to potentially achieve better transient performance. The resulting closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid dynamic inclusion, which is analyzed using tools from hybrid dynamical system&#39;s theory. Our algorithms are developed for potential games, as well as for monotone games for which a potential function does not exist. They can be implemented in games where players have access to gradient Oracles with full or partial information of the multiagent system, as well as in games where players have access only to measurements of their costs. In the latter case, we use tools from hybrid extremum seeking control.},

Our methodology takes into account the performance residual , i.e., how well the system is doing in regards to the prescribed performance. Inspired by the notion of control barrier function, the trigger design allows the certificate to deviate from monotonically decreasing, with leeway specified as an increasing function of the performance residual, resulting in greater flexibility in prescribing update times. We study different types of performance specifications, with particular attention to quantifying the benefits of the proposed approach in the exponential case. We build on this to design intrinsically Zeno-free distributed triggers for network systems. A comparison of event-triggered approaches in a vehicle platooning problem shows how the proposed design meets the prescribed performance with a significantly lower number of controller updates.},

For the distributed control case, a proportional-type stabilizing control is given explicitly. After applying modal decomposition, the stabilizing law is based on a transformation for the ordinary differential equations (ODE) system corresponding to the comparatively unstable modes into a target one, where the calculation of the stabilization law is independent of the arbitrarily large number of these modes. This is achieved by solving generalized Sylvester equations recursively. For the boundary control case, under appropriate sufficient conditions on the coupling matrix (reaction term), the proposed controller is dynamic. A dynamic extension technique via trigonometric change of variables that places the control internally is first performed. Then, modal decomposition is applied followed by a state transformation of the ODE system, which must be stabilized in order to be written in a form where a dynamic law can be established. For both distributed and boundary control systems, a constructive and scalable stabilization algorithm is proposed, as the choice of the controller gains is independent of the number of unstable modes and only relies on the stabilization of the reaction term. The present approach solves the problem of stabilization of underactuated systems when in the presence of distinct diffusion coefficients, the problem is not directly solvable, similarly to the scalar PDE case.},

The corresponding filtering error system is proposed. By utilizing the Lyapunov function technique and stochastic analysis method, some new sufficient conditions are established to demonstrate the stochastic finite-time boundability of the filtering error system and ensure satisfaction of the $H_{\infty }$ performance index. Moreover, the optimal $H_{\infty }$ performance index problem is solved to determine the distributed filter gains and establish the lower boundness of the average dwell time of the topology switching signals. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed design method is validated through two simulation examples.},

The developed scheme can cope with multiple distinct input and state time delays in the dynamics description and mitigate the effect of uncertainties due to both the traditional and network-induced phenomena. The underlying idea is based on a suitable equivalent reformulation of the plant model. In this way, it is possible to pull the input delay out of the design control law.

First, operator theory is used to establish a spatial modified repetitive controller (SMRC) that incorporates the position-domain internal model of the time-varying periodic reference signal. Second, a full-order state observer is designed to estimate the system state and a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate the nonparametric uncertainties, while a derivative-free weight update law is derived to estimate the parametric uncertainties. This ensures direct adaptive control even in the presence of rapid or sudden changes in the uncertain system dynamics. Third, a digital implementation approach for the SMRC is developed that guarantees the synchronization of the spatial repetitive control and the temporal disturbance-observer-based adaptive control for fixed time sampling rates. Stability criteria and an optimization algorithm for the controller parameters are provided. Finally, an application to the speed control of a variable-speed rotational brushless dc motor servo system demonstrates the efficacy of the method, which outperforms conventional adaptive control and other spatial repetitive control methods.},

It is shown that the proposed cost function can be stated in another form. This enables us to extract the optimal solution without solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation (HJIE). To achieve the solution of $H_{\infty }$ , a Riccati differential equation needs to be solved instead of solving the HJIE. The unknown drift dynamics are estimated by an adaptive neural network. The stability and disturbance attenuation of the proposed approach are studied.

Next, the event-triggering mechanism that we design relies on a dynamic variable, which allows for reducing the amount of transmissions over the network. The dynamic quantizer is binary in the sense that the quantized output signal can be transmitted by using only a single bit. The encoding–decoding mechanism is provided in a systematic way such that the encoder–decoder pair realize a matching information on the quantized signal. The combined event-triggering condition and the dynamic quantizer guarantee asymptotic stability property for the closed-loop system. The Zeno behavior is prevented by means of the time-regularization technique. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on a numerical example.},

The SGAS result is obtained by developing a novel Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional framework for the recursive construction of a set of Lyapunov--Krasovskii functionals, associated sublevel sets in Banach space, and linear state controllers systematically, which can be viewed as a semiglobal backstepping method linking Lyapunov functionals to sublevel sets in Banach space.},

We prove a generic property in this notion, that for almost all controllable realizations of a structured system, either there exist such structured perturbations rendering the systems uncontrollable, or there are no such perturbations. We present a decomposition-based necessary and sufficient condition for the PTSC of single-input linear systems, whose verification has polynomial time complexity. We then discuss some intuitive graph-theoretic conditions for PTSC. As an application, our results can serve as some feasibility conditions for the conventional structured controllability radius problems from a generic view.},

To this end, a distributed online algorithm based on mirror descent and one-point delayed bandit feedback is designed for seeking generalized Nash equilibria in the online game. It is shown that the devised online algorithm achieves sublinear expected regrets and accumulated constraint violation if the path variation of the generalized Nash equilibrium sequence is sublinear. Simulations are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the theoretical result.},

  abstract     = {Distinguishability and, by extension, observability are key properties of dynamical systems. Establishing these properties is challenging, especially when no analytical model is available and they are to be inferred directly from measurement data. The presence of noise further complicates this analysis, as standard notions of distinguishability are tailored to deterministic systems. In this article, we build on distributional distinguishability, which extends the deterministic notion by comparing distributions of outputs of stochastic systems. We first show that both concepts are equivalent for a class of systems that includes linear systems. We then present a method to assess and quantify distributional distinguishability from output data. Specifically, our quantification measures how much data is required to tell apart two initial states, inducing a continuous spectrum of distinguishability. We propose a statistical test to determine a threshold above which two states can be considered distinguishable with high confidence. We illustrate these tools by computing distinguishability maps over the state space in simulation, then leverage the test to compare sensor configurations on hardware.},

The synthesis of the adaptive observer is given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, providing a constructive design method.

A convex hull relaxation of the optimal control problem is obtained by taking the convex hull of the original nonconvex control set. To make sure that the convex hull relaxation is exact (which is generally very challenging to achieve), we slightly modify the convex hull relaxation to get an augmented convex hull relaxation in which an auxiliary state variable and an auxiliary terminal constraint are added. In addition, we propose an assumption that the control set has a special property. This assumption can be checked a priori, and we prove that a control set not having the property can be approximated with any accuracy by one having the property. Then, we theoretically establish that the solution of the augmented convex hull relaxation is optimal to the original problem. This theoretical result will be demonstrated by numerical examples.},

In order to fulfill optimality for the tracker design, we introduce a new performance index to reformulate the LQT problem in terms of the minimal polynomial of the exosystem that generates the reference trajectory. We prove that, under routine assumptions, the obtained solution to the formulated LQT problem realizes both closed-loop stability and asymptotic tracking. It is worth pointing out that the proposed procedure does not impose any constraints on the stability of the exosystem. Besides, our method can determine both the optimal control gain and the optimal dynamic compensator, simultaneously. This is different from existing optimal tracker design based on internal model principle, which presets a nonoptimal dynamic compensator. Our theoretical results are corroborated by a simulation example.},

The attacks&#39; cardinal number is supposed to be subject to Poisson distribution, so the interattack time, i.e., the time between two consecutive attack instants, is subject to exponential distribution. The considered system is modeled as the stochastic hybrid formalism, where the randomness enters through the jump map into the reset value (interattack time directly related) of the designed triggered strategy. Using stochastic hybrid tools to combine attack-active parts with attack-over parts, we show that the designed triggered strategy, if designed well according to the actual system needs, can tolerate (be resilient to) the pulsing DoS attacks without jeopardizing the stability and Zeno-freeness.},

These results show that the switched least squares method for MJS has the same rate of convergence as the least squares method for autonomous linear systems.

We propose a lightweight distributed Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm that is cognizant of agents&#39; limited capabilities in communication, computation, and memory. Each agent independently runs agent-based GPR using local streaming data to predict test points of interest; then, the agents collaboratively execute distributed GPR to obtain global predictions over a common sparse set of test points; finally, each agent fuses results from distributed GPR with agent-based GPR to refine its predictions. By quantifying the transient and steady-state performances in predictive variance and error, we show that limited interagent communication improves learning performances in the sense of Pareto. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the developed algorithm.},

The designed distributed controller can handle both state-dependent uncertain system dynamics terms and state-dependent uncertain interconnection terms among neighboring agents. No structural knowledge of such terms is required other than the standard properties of EL systems (positive definite mass matrix, bounded gravity, velocity-dependent friction bound, etc.). The study of stability relies on a suitable analysis of the nonactuated and the actuated synchronization errors, resulting in stable error dynamics perturbed by parametrized state-dependent uncertainty. This uncertainty is tackled via appropriate adaptation laws, giving stability in the uniform ultimate boundedness sense, in line with available literature on state-dependent uncertain system dynamics and/or state-dependent uncertain interconnections. An example with a network of boom cranes is used to validate the proposed approach.},

Small gain-like conditions, for systems with quadratic, general-form nonlinear, and parametrized supply rates, respectively, are derived and interpreted using the underlying graph. This allows enforcing such a condition via the design of a class of controlled nodes, called active nodes, provided their locations satisfy a graph-based condition. The article then proceeds to discuss control synthesis methods using the notion of active nodes, including the placement, the parameter computation, and the adaptation of the active nodes.

Our assumption is that the estimator belongs to the space of polynomials composed of Hilbert-Schmidt operators, which ensures the ability to approximate nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily, even within bounded but noncompact data domains. By employing regularization techniques, we propose a finite-dimensional identification procedure that exhibits computational complexity proportional to the square of the size of the training set size. This procedure is applicable to a broad range of systems, including discrete and continuous time nonlinear systems on finite or infinite dimensional state spaces. We delve into the selection of the regularization parameter, taking into account the measurement noise, and also discuss the incorporation of causality constraints. Furthermore, we explore how to derive estimates of the Volterra series of the operator by selecting a parametric inner product between data trajectories.},

We provide a second-order minimax-optimal dynamic regret guarantee (i.e., dependent on the sum of squared subgradient norms) for a sequence of general convex functions, which may not have strong-convexity, smoothness, exp-concavity or even proper Lipschitz-continuity. The guarantee holds against any comparator sequence with bounded path variation (i.e., the sum of distances between successive decisions). We generate a lower bound of the worst-case second-order dynamic regret by incorporating actual subgradient norms. We show that this bound matches our regret guarantee within a constant, making our algorithm minimax-optimal. We also derive the extension for learning in each decision coordinate-block individually. We demonstrate how to best preserve our regret guarantee in a truly online manner, when the bound on the path variation of the comparator grows in time or the feedback regarding that arrives partially as time goes on. We then build on our algorithm to eliminate the need of any knowledge on the comparator path variation, and provide minimax-optimal second-order regret guarantees with no a priori information. Our approach can compete against all comparator sequences simultaneously (i.e., universally) in a minimax-optimal manner, i.e., each regret guarantee depends on the respective comparator path variation. We discuss modifications that address complexity reductions for time, computation and memory. We further improve our results by making the regret guarantees also dependent on the comparator sets&#39; minimum-bounding diameters, in addition to the respective path variations.},

  abstract     = {Kernel-based methods have been successfully introduced in system identification to estimate the impulse response of a linear system. Adopting the Bayesian viewpoint, the impulse response is modeled as a zero mean Gaussian process whose covariance function (kernel) is estimated from the data. The most popular kernels used in system identification are the tuned-correlated (TC), the diagonal-correlated (DC) and the stable spline (SS) kernel. TC and DC kernels admit a closed-form factorization of the inverse. The SS kernel induces more smoothness than TC and DC on the estimated impulse response, however, the aforementioned property does not hold in this case. In this paper we propose a second-order extension of the TC and DC kernel, which induces more smoothness than TC and DC, respectively, on the impulse response and a generalized-correlated kernel, which incorporates the TC and DC kernels and their second order extensions. Moreover, these generalizations admit a closed-form factorization of the inverse and thus they allow to design efficient algorithms for the search of the optimal kernel hyperparameters. We also show how to use this idea to develop higher oder extensions. Interestingly, these new kernels belong to the family of the so called exponentially convex local stationary kernels: such a property allows to immediately analyze the frequency properties induced on the estimated impulse response by these kernels.},

First, we present a dynamical system that asymptotically tracks the optimizer trajectory of an inequality constrained TV optimization problem. Later, we modify the proposed dynamics to achieve the convergence to the optimizer trajectory within a fixed time. The asymptotic and fixed-time convergence of the proposed dynamical systems to the optimizer trajectory is shown via the Lyapunov-based analysis. Finally, we consider the TV extended Fermat–Torricelli problem of minimizing the sum-of-squared distances to a finite number of nonempty, closed, and convex TV sets, to illustrate the applicability of the projected dynamical systems proposed in this article.},

In a recent paper, Posa et al. (2016) demonstrated that sums-of-squares (SOS) programming can be used to verify the Lyapunov stability of planar systems via Lyapunov’s direct method if impacts are inelastic. However, this method appears to be too conservative to verify the stability of some remarkably simple examples. In this article, an extension of Lyapunov’s direct method is proposed, which makes use of a piecewise smooth Lyapunov function and allows a temporary increase of the Lyapunov function along a motion trajectory. In addition, a modified SOS formulation enables the investigation of planar systems with partially elastic contacts. The proposed method remains compatible with SOS programming techniques. The improved stability test is successfully applied to a point mass on a slope and to a rigid body with two contact points. For the latter, several mechanisms of instability have been demonstrated experimentally, but the exact conditions of Lyapunov stability are unknown.},

We investigate the synthesis of supervisory controllers for modular systems under partial observation that, as the closed-loop system, realize the supremal normal sublanguage of the specification. Such controllers are called maximally permissive normal supervisors. The challenge in modular systems is to find conditions under which the global nonblocking and maximally permissive normal supervisor can be achieved locally as the parallel composition of local normal supervisors. We show that a structural concept of hierarchical supervisory control called modified observation consistency (MOC) is such a condition. However, the algorithmic verification of MOC is an open problem, and therefore it is necessary to find easily verifiable conditions that ensure MOC. We show that the condition that all shared events are observable is such a condition. Considering specifications, we examine both local specifications, where each module has its own specification, and global specifications. Combining our results for normality with the existing results for controllability yields the local synthesis of the nonblocking and maximally permissive controllable and normal supervisor.

We then take into account sampling induced by the network and we present robust data-driven triggering strategies to (approximately) preserve this stability property. The approach is general in the sense that it allows deriving data-based versions of various popular triggering rules of the literature. In all cases, the designed transmission policies ensure the existence of a (global) strictly positive minimum interevent time thereby excluding Zeno phenomenon despite disturbances.

To support this novelty, the familiar Doob martingale inequality in the continuous version is improved; the equivalence principle, which says that the exponential stability in moment of an anhysteretic stochastic system infers the same property of the corresponding hysteretic system, is extended to the cases with the newly proposed semi-Lipschitz condition; the implication theorem, which indicates that the exponential stability in moment implies almost sure exponential stability, is generalized to the stochastic systems with time delays of general forms only under the linear growth condition. Technically, variable substitution is applied to time to map the function spaces for the functional differential equation models with unbounded time delays into those with bounded ones. Unified framework for the stability analysis for both bounded and unbounded time delays is built with the mapping, the decay rates, including those for polynomial stability, for estimates of the solutions with time delays of general form are formulated. At the end of the article, typical strategies, including the divided state feedback with unbounded time delays, for the stabilizing noise are presented, a numerical example is proposed to illustrate the method and to show the efficiency of the results of the paper.},

  abstract     = {Distributed secondary frequency control for power systems, is a problem that has been extensively studied in the literature, and one of its key features is that an additional communication network is required to achieve optimal power allocation. Therefore, being able to provide stability guarantees in the presence of communication delays is an important requirement. Primal-dual and distributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI) protocols, respectively, are two main control schemes that have been proposed in the literature. Each has its own relative merits, with the former allowing to incorporate general cost functions and additional operational constraints, and the latter being more straightforward in its implementation. Although delays have been addressed in DAPI schemes, there are currently no theoretical guarantees for the stability of primal-dual schemes for frequency control, when these are subject to communication delays. In fact, simulations illustrate that even small delays can destabilize such schemes. In this article, we show how a novel formulation of primal-dual schemes allows to construct a distributed algorithm with delay independent stability guarantees. We also show that this algorithm can incorporate many key features of these schemes such as tie-line power flow requirements, generation constraints, and the relaxation of demand measurements with an observer layer. Finally, we illustrate our results through simulations on a five-bus example and on the IEEE-39 test system.},

Among them, the Kalman filter-based disturbance observer is an attractive one since it estimates both the state and the disturbance simultaneously, and is optimal for a linear system with Gaussian noises. Unfortunately, the noise in the disturbance channel typically exhibits a heavy-tailed distribution because the nominal disturbance dynamics usually do not align with the practical ones. To handle this issue, we propose a generalized multikernel maximum correntropy Kalman filter for disturbance estimation, which is less conservative by adopting different kernel bandwidths for different channels and exhibits excellent performance both with and without external disturbance. The convergence of the fixed point iteration and the complexity of the proposed algorithm are given. Simulations on a robotic manipulator reveal that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in disturbance estimation with moderate algorithm complexity.},

To this end, a high-relative-degree input-to-state safety (ISSf) approach is proposed to quantify the influence of external inputs on the subsystem safety. With a coordination transformation, the relationship between ISSf barrier functions (ISSf-BFs) and the existing high-relative-degree (or high-order) barrier functions is established to simplify the safety analysis under external inputs. With high-relative-degree ISSf-BFs, a small-gain theorem is proposed for safety verification. It is shown that, under the small-gain condition, the compositional safe set is forward invariant and asymptotically stable. The effectiveness of the proposed small-gain theorem is illustrated on the output-constrained decentralized control of two inverted pendulums connected by a spring mounted on two carts.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the recursive Bayesian estimation problem is investigated for a class of linear discrete-time systems subject to state-dependent packet dropouts. During the transmission to a remote estimator, the data packets carrying the local measurements might be dropped if the system state is located within certain occlusion region, and this gives rise to a nonstationary dropout process relying on real system states. In this scenario, due to the exponential growth of the computational cost, it is almost impossible to calculate the exact posterior distribution of the system state for the purpose of optimal state estimation. To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-coupled estimation framework consisting of two interactively working estimators, namely, a region-label estimator and a state estimator, where the former is utilized to obtain the optimal estimates of the region-label sequence in the maximum a posteriori sense, while the latter is adopted to achieve the optimal estimates of the system states in the minimum mean-square error sense. Moreover, a sufficient condition is obtained to ensure the mean-square boundedness of the resultant estimation error. The effectiveness of the proposed cross-coupled estimation framework is verified by a numerical simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the distributed fixed-point finding problem for a global operator over a directed and unbalanced multiagent network, where the global operator is quasi-nonexpansive and only partially accessible to each individual agent. Two cases are addressed, i.e., the global operator is sum separable and block separable. For this first case, the global operator is the sum of local operators, which are assumed to be Lipschitz, and each local operator is privately known to each individual agent. To deal with this scenario, a distributed (or decentralized) algorithm, called distributed quasi-averaged operator tracking algorithm (DOT), is proposed and analyzed, and it is shown that the algorithm can converge to a fixed point of the global operator at a linear rate under a linear regularity condition, which is strictly weaker than the strong convexity assumption on cost functions in existing convex optimization literature. For the second scenario, the global operator is composed of a group of local block mappings which are Lipschitz and can be accessed only by each individual agent. In this setup, a distributed algorithm, called distributed quasi-averaged operator playing algorithm (DOP), is developed and shown to be linearly convergent to a fixed point of the global operator under the linear regularity condition. The above studied problems provide a unified framework for many interesting problems. As examples, the proposed DOT and DOP are exploited to cope with distributed optimization and multiplayer games under partial-decision information. Finally, numerical examples are presented to corroborate the theoretical results.},

Despite substantial results, conventional theories suffer from the stringent requirement of knowing the postdisturbance equilibrium a priori. In contrast, the wisdom from practice, which certificates stability by only the observation of converging frequencies and voltages, seems to provide an equilibrium-independent approach. Here, we formulate empirical wisdom by the concept of augmented synchronization and aim to bridge such a theory–practice gap. First, we derive conditions under which the convergence to augmented synchronization implies the convergence to the equilibrium set, laying the first theoretical foundation for empirical wisdom. Then, we reveal from what initial values the power system can achieve augmented synchronization. Our results open the possibility of an equilibrium-independent power system stability analytic that redefines the nominal motion as augmented synchronization rather than a certain equilibrium. Single-machine examples and the IEEE 9-bus system verify our results and illustrate promising implications.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates state feedback design for achieving almost-sure robust stabilization of randomly switched linear systems whose subsystems are uncontrollable and whose models are subject to nonlinear modeling errors due to, for example, linearization. Complex systems are often uncontrollable under a fixed configuration from a single control input. However, when control actions can be used sequentially and collaboratively through different system configurations, stabilization can be potentially achieved. This design problem encounters some fundamental issues that must be resolved, involving mostly suitable coordinated implementations of state decomposition, feedback pole-placement design, usage of stochastic information on the switching process, coupling of controllable and uncontrollable substates, subsystem interactions, and modeling errors. The common state feedback on controllable substates can lead to unstable closed-loop systems, due to substate coupling. A modified control algorithm is introduced that decouples substates and designs feedback gains simultaneously. Further complications arise when subsystem interaction destabilizes the system. Some structural conditions are shown to be essential for achieving almost-sure stabilization. A design procedure that integrates feedback gain selection and switching information is introduced to achieve almost-sure stability for the closed-loop system. Robustness of the design procedure is established. Examples and simulation case studies are presented to illustrate the main algorithms and stabilization properties.},

When the noise is arbitrary large but vanishing faster than linearly, we develop a new control scheme to make the system achieve prescribed-time mean-square stabilization. In contrast to the existing stochastic prescribed-time designs, the merit of our design is that it can effectively deal with multiplicative measurement noise. The existence of measurement noise makes the design rather challenging since the resulting process noise intensity, in a closed loop, depends on the feedback gains and even goes to infinity.

The state of such systems is modeled by partial differential equations and evolves on an infinite-dimensional space. Systems modeled by delay-differential equations are also infinite-dimensional systems. The full state of these systems cannot be measured. Observer design is an important tool for estimating the state from available measurements. For linear systems, both finite- and infinite-dimensional, the Kalman filter provides an estimate with minimum-variance on the error, if certain assumptions on the noise are satisfied. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one type of extension to nonlinear finite-dimensional systems. In this article we provide an extension of the EKF to semilinear infinite-dimensional systems. Under mild assumptions we prove the well-posedness of equations defining the EKF. Next, local exponential stability of the error dynamics is shown. Only detectability is assumed, not observability, so this result is new even for finite-dimensional systems. The results are illustrated with implementation of finite-dimensional approximations of the infinite-dimensional EKF on an example.},

This article considers multiple models of stochastic time variation and analyzes the corresponding notion of hitting time for each model, i.e., the period after which optimizing the stochastic time-varying function reveals informative statistics on the optimization of the target function. The studied models of time variation are motivated by adversarial attacks on the computation of value iteration in Markov decision processes. In this application, the hitting time quantifies the extent that the computation is robust to adversarial disturbances. We develop upper bounds on the hitting time by analyzing the contraction–expansion transformation appearing in the time-variation models. We prove that the hitting time of the value function in the value iteration with a probabilistic contraction–expansion transformation is logarithmic in terms of the inverse of a desired precision. In addition, the hitting time is analyzed for optimization of unknown continuous or discrete time-varying functions whose noisy evaluations are revealed over time. The upper bound for a continuous function is super-quadratic (but subcubic) in terms of the inverse of a desired precision and the upper bound for a discrete function is logarithmic in terms of the cardinality of the function domain. Improved bounds for convex functions are obtained and we show that such functions are learned faster than nonconvex functions. Finally, we study a time-varying linear model with additive noise, where hitting time is bounded with the notion of shape dominance.},

To address this problem, a relationship between the reliability and localizability of a multiagent network is first established, based on which a sufficient and necessary condition is then given to show how to search the malicious bearing measurements in the network. Furthermore, under the given condition, a new class of algorithms is designed, which enables the agents to cooperatively generate the estimations about their own locations, such that the estimation error is bounded. Especially, the error bound can be arbitrarily small, which relies on an adjustable parameter and is independent of the malicious measurements.

By losslessly decomposing the Kalman filter, a framework of event-based distributed estimation is developed, where each sensor node runs a local filter using solely its own measurement, alongside with an event-based synchronization algorithm to fuse the neighboring information. One novelty of the proposed framework is that it decouples the local filters from the synchronization process. By doing so, we prove that a general class of triggering strategies can be applied in our framework, which yields stable distributed estimators under the requirements of collective system observability. Moreover, the developed results can be generalized to achieve a distributed implementation of any Luenberger observer. By solving a semidefinite programming, we further present a low-rank estimator design to obtain the (sub)optimal gains of a Luenberger observer such that the distributed estimation is realized under the constraint of message size. Therefore, as compared with existing works, the proposed algorithm is implemented with limited information since it enjoys lower data size at each transmission.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the stochastic finite-time stabilization problem for a class of Markovian jump systems with polytopic uncertainties. First, an adaptive gain-scheduling-based control design method is well proposed. Compared with the traditional common/parameter-independent control method, the polytopic structure characteristic is well used via approximating uncertain parameters in controller design, which might reduce the conservatism and improve the flexibility of control design. Second, the controller gains and the transition rate matrix are codesigned to ensure the stochastic finite-time stability of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, an optimization problem is also established by minimizing the constrained upper bound of the system state to achieve the optimal closed-loop performance. Finally, two numerical examples are adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with linear quadratic regulation (LQR) and stabilization problems for discrete-time stochastic systems with multiple input channels and input delays. In comparison with single-input-channel problems, a key difficulty, induced by the different delays in different input channels, is that the information sets for multiple controllers are required to be asymmetric and coupled. A novel technique, referred to as orthogonal decomposition–reorganization, is proposed to conquer the coupling between channels. After the technique is used, a new method based on some refined decompositions is provided to solve the delayed forward–backward stochastic difference equations, which overcomes the asymmetry and amounts to finding the solvability condition of the underlying LQR problems. The complete solutions of the finite- and infinite-horizon LQR problems are given by newly developing Riccati-type equations. Also, a necessary and sufficient stabilizing condition is obtained for the system restricted by a performance index. Finally, the effectiveness of the results is evaluated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the problem of designing a continuous-time dynamical system that solves a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and makes the feasible set forward invariant and asymptotically stable. The invariance of the feasible set makes the dynamics anytime, when viewed as an algorithm, meaning it returns a feasible solution regardless of when it is terminated. Our approach augments the gradient flow of the objective function with inputs defined by the constraint functions, treats the feasible set as a safe set, and synthesizes a safe feedback controller using techniques from the theory of control barrier functions. The resulting closed-loop system, termed safe gradient flow, can be viewed as a primal–dual flow, where the state corresponds to the primal variables and the inputs correspond to the dual ones. We provide a detailed suite of conditions based on constraint qualification under which (both isolated and nonisolated) local minimizers are asymptotically stable with respect to the feasible set and the whole state space. Comparisons with other continuous-time methods for optimization in a simple example illustrate the advantages of the safe gradient flow.},

This article advocates a causality-based method based on noisy observations from a single trajectory of an NS, which is represented by the state-space model with general directed topology. Specifically, we first prove its close relationships with the ideal Granger estimator for multiple trajectories and the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator for a single trajectory. Along with this line, we analyze the nonasymptotic inference performance of the proposed method by taking the OLS estimator as a reference, covering both asymptotically and marginally stable systems. The derived convergence rates and accuracy results suggest the proposed method has better performance in addressing potentially correlated observations and achieves zero inference error asymptotically. Besides, an online/recursive version of our method is established for efficient computation or time-varying cases. Extensions on NSs with nonlinear dynamics are also discussed. Comprehensive tests corroborate the theoretical findings and comparisons with other algorithms highlight the superiority of the proposed method.},

Both PDE subsystems consist of coupled scalar PDEs with the heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE subsystem subject to actuation and sensing. By making use of a multistep approach to construct the transformation into a stable target system, it is shown that a backstepping state feedback and observer design only requires to solve the well-known kernel equations for the hyperbolic and parabolic subsystems as well as additional decoupling equations. The latter are standard initial boundary value problems for parabolic PDEs. This significantly facilitates the well-posedness analysis and the numerical computation of the backstepping controller. Exponential stability is verified for the state feedback loop, the observer error dynamics, and the closed-loop system using an observer-based compensator.

A distributed formation matching algorithm for a large-scale multiagent system (DFMA-LSMAS) is proposed. The algorithm employs a distributed continuous-time strategy to deal with a minimal weight bipartite graph matching problem for the optimal matching relationship between each agent and each hole in the formation configuration. It prevents a centralized structure and the explosion of storage spaces compared with the Kuhn-Munkras algorithm. Additionally, DFMA-LSMAS utilizes a distributed parameter projection approach for the optimal location of the formation configuration subjected to a common state constraint. It reduces the growth of the auxiliary variables with the scale of the multiagent system. In the special case, an unmatched phenomenon appears which may cause the failure of DFMA-LSMAS. Therefore, a perturbation-based algorithm is provided to eliminate the influence of this phenomenon, but does not affect the optimality of the solution. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the algorithms.},

However, its accuracy is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the cumulant-generating function computed via the sparse-grid integration, which in turn is also sensitive to the choice of the bijection from the canonical hypercube to the state space. In this article, we propose two new adaptive parametric bijections for the automatic projection filter. The first bijection relies on the minimization of Kullback–Leibler divergence, whereas the second method employs the sparse-grid Gauss–Hermite quadrature. The two new bijections allow the sparse-grid nodes to adaptively move within the high-density region of the state space, resulting in a substantially improved approximation while using only a small number of quadrature nodes. The practical applicability of the methodology is illustrated in three simulated nonlinear filtering problems.},

Based on the obtained decoded measurement outputs, sufficient conditions are then established such that the filtering error variance is constrained by an optimized upper bound at each sampling instant.

  abstract     = {As one efficient technique in reinforcement learning, policy iteration (PI) requires an initial admissible (or stabilizing for linear systems) control policy that renders the existing PI-based results to be model dependent. To attain a completely data-driven adaptive optimal control, this article suggests integrating a homotopic design with PI for unknown continuous-time nonlinear systems. Technically, we leverage a homotopic constant to construct an artificially stable system that allows zero control to initialize PI. Utilizing a homotopic strategy, we recursively update the artificial system and then enforce it to gradually recover the original system. This ultimately allows us to obtain an admissible control policy in a finite number of iterations without carrying out a model-based initialization. Once the admissible control is obtained, the proposed homotopic PI inherits fast convergence from the traditional PI technique and ensures learning the optimal control solution from the data measured from unknown nonlinear systems.},

Conformist best-responders perceive an action to be successful if enough others have done so, whereas nonconformist ones think of an action as successful if few others have done so. Researchers have studied the asymptotic behavior of populations comprising one or two of these types of decision makers, but not altogether. We consider a population of heterogeneous individuals, each either cooperates or defects , and earn payoffs according to their payoff matrices and the total number of cooperators in the population. The individuals revise their choices asynchronously based on the best-response or imitation update rule. Those who update based on the best response are a conformist (resp. nonconformist) if their payoff matrix is that of a coordination (resp. anticoordination) game. The state of the system is the distribution of cooperators over conformists and nonconformists with different payoff matrices and the imitators. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibrium existence and stability. We find that unless strong conditions are met, only those equilibria where the imitators either all cooperate or all defects can be stable. We then partially characterize the nonsingleton minimal positively invariant sets and find conditions for their existence.},

Abstractions have been a key building block in the theory and practice of hybrid automata analysis. We introduce a novel abstraction for hybrid automata based on the symmetries of their modes. The abstraction procedure combines different modes of a concrete automaton $\mathcal {A}$ , whose trajectories are related by symmetries, into a single mode of the constructed abstract automaton $\mathcal {B}$ . The abstraction procedure sets the invariant of an abstract mode to be the union of the symmetry-transformed invariants of the concrete modes. Similarly, it sets the guard and reset of an abstract edge to be the union of the symmetry-transformed guards and resets of the concrete edges. We establish the soundness of the abstraction using a forward simulation relation and provide a running example. The abstraction achieves an order of magnitude speedup when used for the safety verification of vehicles pursuing reach-avoid tasks.},

A unique and in-depth comparative analysis of these LSEs is provided to reveal their technical natures and clarify several theoretical misunderstandings.

Meanwhile, a new modified Armijo step-size control strategy is presented. The resulting reduced system can preserve the port-Hamiltonian structure and the passivity of the original system.

By prescribed performance, we mean that outputs of the system should track the given reference signals, with tracking errors confined within a user-specified performance envelope. However, as the controller imposing this desirable behavior is subject to inelastic control input constraints, the reference signals are temporarily modified whenever input saturation takes place, so that the tracking task becomes more feasible. It is proved that the proposed reference modification scheme leads to the exclusion of the internal instability phenomenon, from which conventional prescribed performance control suffers when subject to input saturation. In addition, it is proved that the proposed control architecture guarantees boundedness of all closed-loop signals given either an explicitly quantified feasibility condition on the saturation level, or provided that the system is input-to-state practically stable. Finally, the distortion of the reference signal owed to a possible saturation of the control input is quantified, and we additionally provide a level of saturation that can guarantee the reference signal will not be distorted, in the $\mathcal {L}_\infty$ norm, more than a prespecified value. Simulation results verify and clarify theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the problem of asymptotical stabilization of logic dynamical systems (LDSs) under the situation where the only available measurable information is the real-time output. We propose a novel time-invariant control strategy called output-based random control (OBRC), which breaks through the limitation of time-invariant deterministic output feedback (TIDOF). The TIDOF can be regarded as a special type of the OBRC, but the OBRC is capable of stabilizing some LDSs that cannot be stabilized by any TIDOF. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotical stabilizability by the OBRC and a method of finding an optimal OBRC that minimizes a quadratic cost function are proposed. The proposed OBRC was applied to a reduced gene network for the lac operon in the bacterium Escherichia coli . The results of numerical computations and time-domain simulations indicate that the OBRC outperforms the TIDOF.},

Though this tradeoff has been studied for multiarmed bandits (MABs) and reinforcement learning for linear systems, it is less well studied for learning-based control of nonlinear systems. A significant theoretical challenge in the nonlinear setting is that there is no explicit characterization of an optimal controller for a given set of cost and system parameters. We propose the use of a finite-horizon oracle controller with full knowledge of parameters as a reasonable surrogate to an optimal controller. This allows us to develop policies in the context of learning-based model-predictive control (MPC) and conduct a control-theoretic analysis using techniques from MPC and optimization theory to show that these policies achieve low regret with respect to this finite-horizon oracle. Our simulations exhibit the low regret of our policy on a heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning model with partially unknown cost function.},

When there is no disturbance, it is shown that only one noncollocated measurement is enough to exponentially stabilize the original system by constructing an infinite-dimensional Luenberger state observer to track the state and designing an estimated state-based output feedback control law. This essentially improves the existing result in (Conrad et al. 1998) where two collocated measurements, including high-order feedback were adopted. In the case that boundary internal uncertainty and external disturbance are considered, an infinite-dimensional disturbance estimator is constructed to estimate the state and total disturbance in real time. By virtue of the estimated state and estimated total disturbance, an output feedback control law is designed to exponentially stabilize the original system while guaranteeing the boundedness of the closed-loop system.

By compensating/canceling the total disturbances in the feedback loop and combining with a collocated stabilizing controller without uncertainty, we propose an unsaturated feedback control to exponentially stabilize the system. Under the boundedness assumption on the magnitudes of the total disturbances, we further propose a saturated control to asymptotically stabilize the system. In addition to the actuator amplitude saturation, the control energy consumption is also reduced sharply. The well-posedness and stability of the closed-loop system are proved mainly by the semigroup theories and the frequency-domain method.

This article is devoted to the asymptotic properties of $\mathcal {S}$ - $\mathcal {AB}$ with diminishing step-size. Specifically, under the condition that each local objective is smooth and the global objective is strongly convex, we first present the boundedness of the iterates of $\mathcal {S}$ - $\mathcal {AB}$ and then show that the iterates converge to the global minimizer with the rate $\mathcal {O}(1/k)$ in the mean square sense.

Considering the data injection attacks that aim at maximizing the impact while remaining undetected, we use the recently proposed output-to-output gain to characterize the risk associated with the impact of attacks under a limited system knowledge attacker. The risk is formulated using a well-established risk metric, namely the maximum expected loss. Under this setup, the risk assessment problem corresponds to an untractable infinite nonconvex optimization problem. To address this limitation, we adopt the framework of scenario-based optimization to approximate the infinite nonconvex optimization problem by a sampled nonconvex optimization problem. Then, based on the framework of dissipative system theory and S-procedure, the sampled nonconvex risk assessment problem is formulated as an equivalent convex semidefinite program. Additionally, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the risk to be bounded. Finally, we illustrate the results through numerical simulation of a hydro-turbine power system.},

A state-feedback distributed fixed-time optimization controller with an estimator-based distributed optimization term is first presented. In order to overcome the lack of the absolute velocity measurements, a distributed fixed-time observer is designed to estimate the absolute velocity information of each agent. Based on the designed observer, a novel output-feedback distributed fixed-time optimization controller using only local output measurements is further presented. Both of the presented state- and output-feedback distributed fixed-time optimization controllers ensure that all agents reach a consensus while minimizing the global cost function within a fixed time.

  abstract     = {Recently, a constructive approach to the design of finite-dimensional observer-based controller has been proposed for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). This article extends it to hyperbolic PDEs. Namely, we design a finite-dimensional, output-feedback, boundary controller for a wave equation with in-domain viscous friction. The control-free system is unstable for any friction coefficient due to an external force. Our approach is based on modal decomposition: an observer-based controller is designed for a finite-dimensional projection of the wave equation on $N$ eigenfunctions (modes) of the Sturm–Liouville operator. The danger of this approach is the “spillover” effect: such a controller may have a deteriorating effect on the stability of the unconsidered modes and cause instability of the full system. Our main contribution is an appropriate Lyapunov-based analysis leading to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that allow one to find a controller gain and number of modes, $N$ , guaranteeing that the “spillover” effect does not occur. An important merit of the derived LMIs is that their complexity does not change when $N$ grows. Moreover, we show that appropriate $N$ always exists and, if the LMIs are feasible for some $N$ , they remain so for $N+1$ .},

To overcome this quandary we propose a novel hybrid controller that generates a piecewise constant dwindling reference designed to make the system operate in an oscillatory, yet asymptotically stable, regime. The controller relies on a previously proposed switching observer, for which we provide an original analysis of exponential convergence.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an adaptive reference governor (RG) framework for a linear system with matched nonlinear uncertainties that can depend on both time and states, subject to both state and input constraints. The proposed framework leverages an ${\mathcal {L}_{1}}$ adaptive controller ( ${\mathcal {L}_{1}}$ AC) that compensates for the uncertainties, and provides guaranteed transient performance in terms of uniform bounds on the error between actual states and inputs and those of a nominal (i.e., uncertainty-free) system. The uniform performance bounds provided by the ${\mathcal {L}_{1}}$ AC are used to tighten the prespecified state and control constraints. A reference governor is then designed for the nominal system using the tightened constraints, which guarantees robust constraint satisfaction. Moreover, the conservatism introduced by constraint tightening can be systematically reduced by tuning some parameters within the ${\mathcal {L}_{1}}$ AC. Compared with existing solutions, the proposed adaptive RG framework can potentially yield reduced conservativeness for constraint enforcement and improved tracking performance due to the inherent uncertainty compensation mechanism. Simulation results for a flight control example illustrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.},

The vector field of the limit-cycle oscillator is approximated by polynomials whose coefficients are estimated by convex optimization. The linear stability of the limit cycle is ensured by introducing an upper bound to the Floquet exponent. The validity of the proposed method is verified numerically by designing several types of 2-D existing and artificial oscillators. As applications, we first design a limit-cycle oscillator with an artificial star-shaped periodic trajectory and demonstrate global entrainment.

To solve the problem, a new hierarchical control method is proposed, which includes a resilient distributed observation layer, a local performance improvement layer, and a decentralized tracking layer. Specifically, a novel model transformation method is first introduced in the resilient distributed observation layer to transform the reference system into a quasi-block diagonal controllable canonical form. Based on this form, a new finite-time distributed resilient observer is designed by introducing a switching mechanism to the observer inputs. Driven by this resilient observer state, a new local reference signal generator is designed for each agent in the local performance improvement layer. The designed local reference signal satisfies that 1) it can track the reference signal after a finite-time; and 2) its high-order derivatives exist. Then, a decentralized finite-time controller is designed by using the backstepping technique in the decentralized tracking layer. It is shown that the outputs of all agents converge to the reference signal after a finite time. Finally, the effectiveness of our developed method is shown by applying the finite-time distributed resilient method to power systems.},

Using autonomous oscillators to this effect, rather than directly crafting periodic signals, may allow for systematic coordination in a distributed manner and storage of multiple motion patterns within the nonlinear dynamics, with potential extensions to adaptive mode switching through sensory feedback. This article proposes a method for designing a distributed network that possesses multiple stable limit cycles from which various output patterns are generated with prescribed frequency, amplitude, temporal shapes, and phase coordination. In particular, we adopt, as the basic dynamical unit, a simple nonlinear oscillator with a scalar complex state variable, and derive conditions for their distributed interconnections to result in a network that embeds desired periodic solutions with orbital stability. We show that the frequencies and phases of target oscillations are encoded into the network connectivity matrix as its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. Various design examples will illustrate the proposed method, including generation of human gaits for walking and running.},

At the remote end, a detector utilizing batch statistics is deployed to detect anomalies. In this setup, finding the worst-case estimation performance degradation during a detection interval is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold with linear equation constraints, which is generally hard to tackle. Such a problem is addressed by introducing new optimization variables, and structural expressions of attack strategies in worst-case are proposed. Then, by means of Riemannian optimization tools, we provide additional properties for such attack strategies in a scalar sensor by solving a boundary trust region subproblem. Furthermore, analytical attack strategies in worst-case are derived under the case where a sequence of contaminated innovation covariances has been determined. A necessary condition of the existence of attack strategies in worst-case for the attacker with symmetric attack parameter matrices is also presented. Finally, two numerical examples in multisensor and a scalar sensor are conducted to demonstrate the validity of results developed.},

  abstract     = {Brandin and Wonham introduced a timed supervisory control framework in 1994. The key innovations arguably were the introduction of tick events to model the passing of time, and the introduction of event forcing. The framework enriches the Ramadge-Wonham framework, albeit with the cost to deal with high modeling and synthesis complexities due to explicit enumeration of ticks. To address these challenges, the framework presented forgoes the explicit enumeration of tick events and instead relies on time-interval automata whose transitions are labeled by events equipped with discrete time-intervals. In contrast to the time-interval resetting mechanism of the Brandin-Wonham framework, where the time-interval of each event is reset either straight after the event occurs or when the event is not defined at a destination state, in the present framework, the time-interval of each event is reset after a new state is reached, where this event is defined. This new framework contains the Brandin-Wonham framework as a special case. After introducing the plant modeled as a free (time-interval) language, and considering the impact of event forcing on plant behaviors with the concept of time-coerced languages, the supervisory control problem is introduced, whose requirements also are time-interval languages. After presenting the concept of controllability in the time-interval framework and demonstrating the surprising existence of supremal time-coerced controllable sublanguages for a given plant and requirements, even though time-coerced languages are typically not closed under union in contrast to free languages, a new supremal controllable sublanguage synthesis algorithm is presented.},

The system is first transformed into a new system for which the disturbance appears in tracking error only. An adaptive observer approach is adopted in investigation to estimate all possible unknown frequencies that have entered into a transformed new system. By the estimates of the unknown frequencies, we are able to design a tracking-error-based feedback control to achieve output regulation and disturbance rejection for this partial differential equations (PDEs) in two different cases. In the first case, the derivative of the tracking error is allowed to be used in the control design, which leads to the exponential convergence of the tracking error. In the second case, the tracking error is solely used and the asymptotic convergence is achieved. A remarkable characteristic of the problem lies in the fact that the control operator is unbounded and is noncollocated with the regulated output, which represents a difficult situation for output regulation on PDEs. The proposed approach is potentially applicable to other PDEs.},

In addition, all nonlinearities involved have unknown analytical expressions and, moreover, are affected by external additive disturbances. The proposed robust control protocol is distributed and of low analytical and computational complexity. When the underlying communication graph is directed, we prove that all disagreement errors converge to some arbitrarily small neighborhoods of zero in finite time, whose lower bound is user specified. Furthermore, all signals in the closed-loop remain bounded. In case the graph is undirected, the size of the aforementioned neighborhoods can be prescribed. The key ingredient of the proposed control scheme is an observer that estimates the second state of the leader with predefined accuracy and not later than a predetermined fixed time. To achieve the aforementioned attributes, each agent uses relative output information and its own state and transmits to its neighbors the estimation of the leader&#39;s second state derived by its observer.

We show that the well-known $\ell _{p}$ ergodic coefficients are induced matrix seminorms and play a central role in stability problems. In particular, we formulate a duality theorem that explains why the Markov–Dobrushin coefficient is the rate of contraction for both averaging and conservation flows in discrete time. Moreover, we obtain parallel results for induced matrix logarithmic seminorms.

The DISA, for the first time, eliminates the dependence of the convergent step-size range on the Euclidean norm of the linear mapping, while inheriting the advantages of the classic primal-dual proximal splitting algorithm (PD-PSA): simple structure and easy implementation. This indicates that the DISA can be executed without prior knowledge of the norm, and tiny step sizes can be avoided when the norm is large. In addition, we prove sublinear and linear convergence rates of DISA under general convexity and metric subregularity, respectively. Moreover, we provide a variant of DISA with approximate proximal mapping and prove its global convergence and sublinear convergence rate. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate a significant acceleration of the DISA compared to the existing PD-PSAs},

Moreover, some Hurwitz stability criteria to judge whether all the roots of the quasi-polynomials are in the open left-half complex plane are provided. These Hurwitz stability criteria can be employed to analyze the stability of linear time-invariant systems with commensurate delays. It should be pointed out that on the one hand, the derived criteria are general since quasi-polynomials of retarded type and quasi-polynomials with real coefficients are their special cases. On the other hand, the conditions in Hurwitz stability criteria are all necessary and sufficient. Furthermore, as a special case, several criteria for the distribution of roots of the quasi-polynomials with real coefficients are presented.

  abstract     = {In a recent work, we introduced a new set of problems in the area of networked multiple mobile robotic systems that concern the time-optimal execution of certain coverage tasks taking place in constricted environments. That work provided the detailed problem definitions, positioned these problems in the context of the corresponding literature, formulated them as mixed integer programs (MIPs), and established their NP-hardness. This article introduces a strong combinatorial relaxation for these problems, and further establishes that the feasible solutions of these relaxations can be converted to feasible solutions for the original MIPs with equal or better objective values than the objective values of the converted solutions. The new results also enable the development of more efficient solution methods and heuristic approaches for the considered problems; this potential is addressed in the last part of this article.},

  abstract     = {One of the main problems in sparse representation in order to achieve accurate parameter estimation is the potentially large correlation between the regressors. The maximum absolute value of this correlation is called mutual coherence . The inverse of the mutual coherence controls approximately the number of nonzero parameters that can be recovered exactly from noise-free observations. In system identification, the observations are constructed from time-series data, which leads to that the columns in the regressor matrix may be highly correlated, and therefore, the mutual coherence can be large. This implies that using standard sparse estimation algorithms may lead to large errors. In this article, we derive a bound on the mutual coherence, which shows that directly using popular algorithms such as the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm can lead to large estimation errors. The key idea in this article is to make a coordinate transformation so that the regressor matrix has low mutual coherence in the new coordinates. The proposed method involves solving a nonconvex optimization problem, which is done by alternating minimization and proximal methods. Additionally, we derive a bound on the mutual coherence of the regressor in the new coordinates, which can be used to ensure the correct estimation of the support of the parameters for OMP. For this method, we show also that the criterion used to compute the transformation maximizes a lower bound for the probability of correct estimation of the support. For a limited setting, we also show formally that the transformation can significantly increase the probability of correct estimation of the support. Finally, we show via simulations how the proposed method performs in comparison with state-of-the-art sparse estimation algorithms.},

In this article, we introduce a definition of observability for stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems, which involves an explicit functional characterization. To justify its operational use, we establish that this definition implies filter stability under mild continuity conditions: an incorrectly initialized nonlinear filter is said to be stable if the filter eventually corrects itself with the arrival of new measurement information. Numerous examples are presented and a detailed comparison with the literature is reported. We also establish implications for various criteria for filter stability under several notions of convergence such as weak convergence, total variation, and relative entropy. These findings are connected to robustness and approximations in partially observed stochastic control.},

The stochastic phase-cohesiveness in two types of networks is studied. First, we consider oscillators coupled with $2\pi$ -periodic odd functions over underlying undirected graphs subject to both multiplicative and additive stochastic uncertainties. We prove stochastic phase-cohesiveness of the network with respect to two specific, namely, in-phase and antiphase, sets by deriving sufficient coupling conditions. We show the dependency of these conditions on the size of the mean values of additive and multiplicative uncertainties, as well as the sign of the mean values of multiplicative uncertainties. Furthermore, we discuss the results under a relaxation of the odd property of the coupling function. Second, we study an uncertain network in which the multiplicative uncertainties are governed by the Bernoulli process representing the well-known Erdös–Rényi network. We assume constant exogenous frequencies and derive sufficient conditions for achieving both stochastic phase-cohesive and phase-locked solutions, i.e., stochastic phase-cohesiveness with respect to the origin. For the latter case, where identical exogenous frequencies are assumed, we prove that any positive probability of connectivity leads to phase-locking. Thorough analyses are provided, and insights obtained from stochastic analysis are discussed, along with numerical simulations to validate the analytical results.},

By viewing dissipativity as a behavior and integrating it into the control design as a virtual dynamical system, the proposed approach carries out the entire design process in a unified framework with a set-theoretic viewpoint. This leads to an effective data-driven distributed control design, where the global design goal can be achieved by distributed optimization based on the local QdF conditions.

Their scalability relies heavily on the underlying communication system and its connectivity. While it is possible to generate a random graph, which exhibits almost surely good connectivity even with a large number of agents, in a “plug-and-play” setting, where agents should be able to connect and disconnect with minimal interruption, the generation of a new communication network, i.e., graph, each time an agent connects is not feasible. Rather, nodes will be added to the graph over time. In this article, we investigate methods to grow a graph, i.e., add nodes in a graph. We enforce that an upper bound on the maximum degree within the graph is maintained and that only new connections are established with the connecting node without affecting the remainder of the network. The latter condition is to avoid reconfiguration of the network, which reduces the necessary changes and allows the use in a plug-and-play setting. We find conditions on the ability to connect nodes. Furthermore, we study different connection strategies and their impact on the connectivity of the grown graph.},

Using a closed-loop heading controller and a linear observer, we evaluate the stability properties of the equilibrium points of a single particle system for state feedback with bounded actuator noise and output feedback with bounded sensor noise.

RENs are otherwise very flexible: they can represent all stable linear systems, all previously known sets of contracting recurrent neural networks and echo state networks, all deep feedforward neural networks, and all stable Wiener/Hammerstein models, and can approximate all fading memory and contracting nonlinear systems. RENs are parameterized directly by a vector in $\mathbb {R}^{N}$ , i.e., stability and robustness are ensured without parameter constraints, which simplifies learning since generic methods for unconstrained optimization such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants can be used. The performance and robustness of the new model set are evaluated on benchmark nonlinear system identification problems.

First, a novel dual hidden Markov model is constructed to characterize the mismatched phenomena when asynchronizations occur to the system mode and the TP mode. Second, following the stochastic Lyapunov method, sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions are presented to guarantee the existence of the asynchronous energy-to-peak full-order filter while simultaneously considering the nonlinear property of sensors. Third, the decoupling between the Lyapunov matrices and filter matrices is accomplished by a theoretically less conservative and computationally less arduous filtering technique. Then, the approach of designing asynchronous energy-to-peak filters extends to tackle different types of uncertain UTPs, thus adding more optional dimensions.

Based on this theory, we prove that a state is asymptotically reachable from another state under a PCRCC if and only if it is asymptotically reachable under a simple periodic PCRCC; in other words, the control values are pairwise distinct within one period. Thereafter, a verifiable, necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotical reachability between states is obtained, based on which verifiable, necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotical reachability and asymptotical controllability are derived. In particular, we prove that a CT-PLCS is asymptotically controllable if and only if each state can be asymptotically stabilized by PCRCCs. In addition, the proof of the proposed results is constructive, which naturally leads to the development of methods of designing PCRCCs. Finally, the examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Maximum hands-off control is discretized into a convex linear programming problem by zero-order-hold discretization. The first-order necessary conditions for linear programming problems are presented. To ensure that the switching points meet the allowable error, the jump function is used to preliminarily determine the switching points of the control variable. The finite switch number lemma for the maximum hands-off control is used as the initial estimate of the number of switching points. Numerical example results show that the zero-order algorithm is more effective than the alternating direction method of multipliers in solving the maximum hands-off control.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a new Lyapunov function based on the convex hull of ellipsoids was introduced for the study of uncertain and/or time-varying linear discrete-time systems with/without constraints. The new Lyapunov function has many attractive features such as: 1) the associated ellipsoids are not required to be robustly invariant; 2) the design conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequality constraints. The control law is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem online. This optimization problem generally does not have a closed-form solution, and hence it is solved by numerical methods. In this article, we intend to complement the results by analyzing the geometric structures of the solution to the optimization problem, and of the control law. In particular, we show that the control law is a piecewise linear and Lipschitz continuous function of the state.},

We show that the proposed algorithm is free of Zeno behavior (i.e., finite number of triggers in any finite time interval) by contradiction and asymptotically converges to a stationary point if the local cost functions are smooth. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm exponentially converges to the global optimal point if, in addition, the global cost function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, which is weaker than the standard strong convexity condition, and the global minimizer is not necessarily unique.

To design a distributed optimization algorithm, virtual signals are constructed for all agents to minimize the cost function under the influence of the intermittent communication network. Based on the optimal virtual signals, local references with the existence of high-order derivatives are constructed by using the Hermite interpolation method. Then, a decentralized adaptive controller is designed for each local agent by following the recursive backstepping design procedure.

From the design point of view, the proposed approach extends the AILC approach to nonsquare systems with unknown control gain matrices, which contributes significantly not only to refine the theory of AILC, but also to widen its application scope.

A widely used method for ensuring safety is to learn a control barrier function with heuristic feasibility labels that come from expert demonstrations or constraint functions. However, their forward invariant sets fall short of the maximum feasible region because of inaccurate labels. This article proposes an algorithm called feasible region iteration (FRI) that learns the maximum feasible region to generate accurate feasibility labels. The core of FRI is a constraint decay function (CDF), which comes with a self-consistency condition and naturally leads to the constraint Bellman equation. The optimal CDF, which represents the maximum feasible region, is learned through the iteration of feasible region identification and feasible region expansion. Experiment results show that our algorithm achieves near-zero constraint violations and comparable or higher performance than the baselines.},

  abstract     = {For networked systems, the communication processes between sensors, actuators, and controllers pose many challenges such as instability and performance degradation that may result from bandwidth limitations, signal-to-noise ratio constraints, and frequent occurrences of packet loss. The constraints of these elements can negatively affect the performance of control systems. In this study, we used a fading channel model to analyze the fundamental tracking performance of a networked control system (NCS). We considered the additive channel noise, external disturbances, and packet losses under the premise that an equivalent average channel can replace the fading channel to model the steady-state output. Frequency-domain analysis techniques, including all-pass factorization, Bezout identity, and Youla parameterization, were used to compute optimal values for the tracking performance. Based on the results, we were able to quantify the relation between the NCS performance and intrinsic features of the controlled object, including nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles. Explicit expressions were obtained for the negative effects of noise, disturbance, and packet losses on the tracking performance. Furthermore, an illustrative example is presented to verify our conclusions.},

  abstract     = {In the regret-based formulation of multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems, except in rare instances, much of the literature focuses on arms with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) rewards. In this article, we consider the problem of obtaining regret guarantees for MAB problems, in which the rewards of each arm form a Markov chain that may not belong to a single parameter exponential family. To achieve a logarithmic regret in such problems is not difficult: a variation of standard Kullback–Leibler upper confidence bound (KL-UCB) does the job. However, the constants obtained from such an analysis are poor for the following reason: i.i.d. rewards are a special case of Markov rewards and it is difficult to design an algorithm that works well independent of whether the underlying model is truly Markovian or i.i.d. To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel algorithm that identifies whether the rewards from each arm are truly Markovian or i.i.d. using a total variation distance-based test. Our algorithm then switches from using a standard KL-UCB to a specialized version of KL-UCB when it determines that the arm reward is Markovian, thus resulting in low regrets for both i.i.d. and Markovian settings.},

Our algorithm addresses two major issues inherent to distributed Kalman filters: fully distributed and scalable optimal estimation and reduction of the communication bandwidth usage. The first requires to solve an NP-hard optimization problem, forcing relaxations that lose optimality guarantees over the original problem. Using only information from one-hop neighbors, we propose a tight semidefinite programming relaxation that allows to certify locally and online if the relaxed solution is the optimum of the original NP-hard problem. In that case, ECO-DKF is optimal in the square error sense under scalability and event-triggered one-hop communications restrictions. In addition, ECO-DKF is a globally asymptotically stable estimator. To address the second issue, we propose an event-triggered scheme from the relaxed optimization output. The consequence is a broadcasting-based algorithm that saves communication bandwidth, avoids individual communication links and multiple information exchanges within instants, and preserves the optimality and stability properties of the filter.},

We then derive the optimal control, which entails solving two coupled matrix ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with split boundary conditions.

Our study is motivated by the fact that most of the existing source-seeking methods follow the gradient direction of the signal function and thus only lead to local convergence into a neighborhood of the nearest local extremum. So far, only a few studies present ideas on how to overcome local extrema in order to reach a global extremum. None of them apply to second-order (force- and torque-actuated) nonholonomic vehicles. We consider what is possibly the simplest conceivable algorithm for such vehicles, which employs a constant torque and a translational/surge force in proportion to an approximately differentiated measured signal. We show that the algorithm steers the unicycle through local extrema toward a global extremum. In contrast to previous extremum-seeking studies, we do not approximate the gradient of the objective function but the gradient of a certain local spatial average of the objective function. Such a spatially averaged objective function is expected to have fewer critical points than the original objective function. Under suitable assumptions on the averaged objective function and on sufficiently strong translational damping, we show that the control law achieves practical uniform asymptotic stability and robustness to sufficiently weak measurement noise and disturbances to the force and torque inputs.},

As a result of incomplete access to the system&#39;s state and the occurrence of asynchronous phenomena that occur during information transmission, the control design of the SNSMJSs becomes significantly more complicated. To tackle such a challenge, an observer-based asynchronous controller embedded with a hidden Markov model is proposed. First, an algebraic relationship among transition probability, probability distribution function, and probability density function is derived. Using the constraints on transition probabilities and the inherent properties of semi-Markov processes, time-varying transition rates are expressed. Based on the reorganized transition rates, stabilization conditions are established. Second, the double coupling terms generated by defective information transmission are addressed through the introduction of slack matrices, and then, desired controller gains and observer gains are derived to further ensure the exponential mean-square stability of the SNSMJSs. Finally, a data communication network is presented to verify the validity of the proposed method.},

In this framework, studying the steady-state behavior of the IETs is equivalent to studying the existence of a conic subregion that is positively invariant under the map that gives the evolution of the state from one event to the next. We provide necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positively invariant subregion (PIS). We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a PIS to be asymptotically stable. Indirectly, they provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the local convergence of IETs to a constant or to a given periodic sequence. We illustrate the proposed method of analysis and results through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This note studies output-feedback consensus of linear multiagent systems (MASs) on directed graphs. In view of limited communication resources in MAS tasks, the aim of this note is to reduce interagent communication. A fully distributed dynamic output-feedback protocol is proposed, where an event-triggered strategy is designed to determine when to exchange protocol states while a time-triggered one is designed to determine when to sample relative outputs. Design conditions are first established for strongly connected graphs, and then refined for directed graphs with a spanning tree. In contrast to the existing works, the merits of the proposed protocol are threefold: 1) it is applicable for directed graphs; 2) it relies on relative outputs, rather than absolute outputs or absolute/relative states; and 3) it only requires intermittent communication but no continuous monitoring of neighboring agents.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the distributed online saddle point problem for multiagent networks over time-varying graphs. The objective is to design distributed online algorithms for optimizing the accumulation of the time-varying loss functions, and further to analyze the efficiency of the algorithms by utilizing the so-called dynamic regret as a performance measure. To this end, two kinds of distributed online optimization algorithms are developed by considering full-information feedback and bandit feedback, respectively. Under some certain assumptions and resorting to appropriate diminishing step sizes, it is proved that the two developed algorithms yield upper bounds of the dynamic regret in order $\mathcal {O}(\max \lbrace T^{\lambda _{1}}, T^{\lambda _{2}} (V_{T}+1) \rbrace)$ and order $ \mathcal {O}(\max \lbrace k T^{\lambda _{3}}, k T^{\lambda _{4}} (V_{T}+1) \rbrace)$ , respectively, where $T$ is the horizon (total iteration number) of the algorithm, $V_{T}$ is the path-variation level, $k$ is the maximum dimension of the state variables, and $\lambda _{i}$ , $i=1,2,3,4$ , are positive tuning parameters less than 1. Clearly, both of the two developed algorithms can guarantee that the considered dynamic regret is sublinear with respect to $T$ , provided that the path-variation level $V_{T}$ is sublinear with respect to $T$ . This theoretically shows the efficiency of the developed algorithms. Moreover, the efficiency of the developed algorithms is also illustrated numerically by taking an example of a specific bilinear matrix game problem.},

To address this erratic attack, this article develops a distributed secure state monitoring protocol for a class of homogeneous cyber-physical networked systems under location-varying sparse attacks. To effectively overcome the influence of variable attack positions on state estimation, a distributed Luenberger-like observer together with a logical detection scheme is proposed such that the remote monitoring center and each local agent can precisely isolate the transmitted data that are being attacked. Sufficient conditions for the existence of observer parameters for secure state monitoring are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the enforcement of (current-state) opacity, an important information-flow security property, via insertion functions. An insertion function is an obfuscation mechanism that inserts fictitious events to the outputs in order to confuse the outside observer (intruder) such that the secret of the system is not revealed. In some situations, the secret may be revealed when the insertion mechanism is (or becomes) publicly known. This leads to the problem of synthesizing private-and-public enforcing (PP-enforcing) insertion functions in the sense that opacity is still enforced even when the mechanism is discovered or published by the designer. Existing works that have investigated this synthesis problem are either only sound or have limited applicability as we show in this work. For this reason, and more importantly, to better solve the synthesis problem, a new approach is proposed upon an improved greedy criterion. We show that the proposed algorithm is both sound and complete, and can be used to completely solve the synthesis problem for the PP-enforcing insertion function. With slight modifications of our algorithm, infinite-step opacity and $ K$ -step opacity can also be enforced under publicly-known insertion mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the distributed robust suboptimal consensus control problem of uncertain linear multiagent systems, with both $H_{2}$ and $H_\infty$ performance requirements. A novel two-step complementary design approach is proposed. In the first step, a distributed control law is designed for the nominal multiagent system to achieve consensus with a prescribed $H_{2}$ performance. In the second step, an extra control input, depending on some carefully chosen residual signals indicating the modeling mismatch, is designed to complement the $H_{2}$ performance by providing robustness guarantee in terms of $H_\infty$ requirement with respect to disturbances or uncertainties. The proposed complementary design approach provides an additional degree of freedom for design, having two separate controls to deal with the $H_{2}$ performance and the robustness of consensus, respectively. Thereby, it does not need to make much tradeoff, and can be expected to be much less conservative than the tradeoff design, such as the mixed $H_{2}/H_\infty$ control method. Besides, this complementary approach will recover the achievable $H_{2}$ performance when external disturbances or uncertainties do not exist. The effectiveness of the theoretical results and the advantages of the complementary approach are validated via numerical simulations.},

We propose an event-triggered sliding mode observer to estimate the states in the practical sense, i.e., arbitrary steady-state bound can be achieved for the estimation error irrespective of the disturbance signal. A new sliding mode observer is proposed with the discontinuous output error injection vector of the same order as that of the disturbance vector; therefore the observer can be represented by an interconnection of continuous and discontinuous dynamics. Two scenarios are considered for implementing this observer in the event-triggering framework, viz., the actuator side implementation and the sensor side implementation, in which the observer is run at the actuator and sensor sides, respectively. However, the event-triggering mechanism in both cases is placed in the sensor end to regulate the transmission of output/estimated values. It is shown under the observability assumption that the event-triggered observer estimates the states practically with intermittent communication and disturbance input. Finally, we take a practical example to illustrate the state estimation using the proposed sliding mode observer.},

A system augmentation approach is used to obtain an equivalent augmented system, in which the input and (controller gain)-output matrices are separated to facilitate the parameterization of controller gains. Under the augmented system characterization, several new necessary and sufficient stability conditions are established for the concerned closed-loop systems. An iterative LMI-based algorithm is proposed to design an asynchronous S-OF controller. A D-K optimization approach is used to improve its feasibility by finding more appropriate initial values.

  abstract     = {In this note, we develop an adaptive observer for a class of nonlinear systems with switched unknown parameters to estimate the states and parameters simultaneously. The main challenge lies in how to eliminate the disturbance effect of zero-input responses caused by the switching on the parameter estimation. These responses depend on the unknown states at switching instants (SASI) and constitute an additive disturbance to the parameter estimation, which obstructs parameter convergence to zero. Our solution is to treat the zero-input responses as excitations instead of disturbances. This is realized by first augmenting the system parameter with the SASI and then developing an estimator for the augmented parameter using the dynamic regression extension and mixing technique. Thanks to its property of element-wise parameter adaptation, the system parameter estimation is decoupled from the SASI. As a result, the estimation errors of system states and parameters converge to zero asymptotically. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed adaptive observer is guaranteed in the presence of disturbances and noise. A numerical example validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the equilibrium regulation problem of a class of uncertain linear systems with stochastic input delay, where the delay is modeled as a Markov process with finite states. Our approach is based on the partial differential equation backstepping method. We first consider the Markov delay with finite known states. An adaptive controller is designed to achieve global almost sure asymptotic convergence. Then, the Markov delay with finite unknown states is discussed. Owing to the unknown Markov delay resulting in the single distributed actuator state being unmeasured, the update law is redesigned, and only the local almost sure asymptotic stability is proved. In the control design, we adopt a constant-time-horizon-prediction-based control law to robustly compensate for the stochastic delay, which requires that the constant be close enough to all the Markov process states. Then, through Lyapunov functional analysis, we prove the almost sure boundedness of all the signals. Moreover, stochastic Barbalat&#39;s lemma is applied to realize equilibrium regulation. Finally, to show the effectiveness of our results, a numerical example is given.},

  abstract     = {This article considers perception-driven control of a mobile robot for path tracking where perception is performed by a machine learning system. The robot is subject to passive attacks and evasion attacks on image transmission. To defeat the passive attacks, we adopt chaotic encryption technique to disguise pixels of plain images in real time, and construct a bank of fuzzy unknown input observers to decrypt the cipher pixels in parallel. We characterize the security level of the proposed chaotic cryptographic scheme. As for the path tracking, we derive a set of linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions of the existence of a robust controller, which renders the output zeroing manifold attractive and invariant by using internal model technique, and also attenuates the effects of the evasion attacks and learning errors of the machine learning system by reducing $\mathcal {L}_{2}$ gain. Simulations are conducted in the CARLA simulator to demonstrate robust path tracking and secure image transmission.},

The derived stability criteria are all necessary and sufficient for absorbing CT-MCs and set absorbing CT-MCs, where Lyapunov functions can be constructed in a polynomial amount of time with respect to the cardinality of state spaces. Furthermore, the gap between Lyapunov functions of the CT-MCs and of the discrete-time Markov chains is bridged by the feature that the length of the sampling period in the sampled-data CT-MCs does not affect the reachability. The results presented here provide a novel insight for efficient analysis and synthesis of large-scale CT-MCs in the same manner as in dynamic systems.

The system input and output are assumed to be measured subject to additive zero-mean white noise with known covariance. From the measured big data set, an approximated representation of the true behavior of the system is constructed using the statistical properties of measurement noise. The proposed construction method has no structural constraint on the representation. When the size of the measured dataset is large, the proposed approximate representation converges in probability to one that represents the true behavior of the system. This allows data-driven simulation and control to be performed using simple convex quadratic programming algorithms. Furthermore, a Kalman filter-like algorithm is developed for better prediction of future output. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed method and its efficacy under high measurement noise levels.},

With the ISP method, frequency response data are obtained using least-square estimators, which reduces to discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) if the sampling is periodic. Then, with a careful use of the statistics of the sampled data, consistency of the identified model is established when the sampling rates at the input and output channels are nonuniform, asynchronous, and slow. It is further revealed that, if the noise signals at the input and output channels are uncorrelated with respect to the sampling moments, their estimates in the frequency domain are asymptotically uncorrelated. In that case, the proposed algorithms asymptotically reduce to the existing frequency-domain identification algorithms.},

In the literature, despite considering an unknown objective function in the real-time optimization problem, it is mandatory to know whether the extremum point is a maximum or a minimum, which is characterized by means of the Hessian sign of the nonlinear scalar map. This article proposes that the process of extremum seeking occurs independently of the Hessian sign information. The key idea is to combine the classical extremum seeking approach with a switching monitoring function-based scheme. The switching algorithm will drive the closed-loop system to the unknown extremum, neglecting if it is a maximum or a minimum equilibrium point. Theoretical results are rigorously justified and simulation examples show the robustness properties of the proposed recipe even when the changes of the Hessian sign occur in “on-the-fly” fashion, showing the adaptability of the proposed method to solve distinct online minimizing and maximizing problems in sequence.},

The pursuer aims to protect a goal region from the evader. The game is solved in an analytical approach instead of solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations numerically. First, an evasion region is introduced, based on which a pursuit strategy guaranteeing the winning of a simple-motion pursuer under specific conditions is proposed. Motivated by the simple-motion pursuer, a strategy for a Dubins-car pursuer is proposed when the pursuer–evader configuration satisfies separation condition (SC) and interception orientation (IO) . The necessary and sufficient condition on capture radius, minimum turning radius, and speed ratio to guarantee the pursuit winning is derived. When the IO is deviated (Non-IO), a heading adjustment pursuit strategy is proposed, and the condition to achieve IO within a finite time is given. Based on it, a two-step pursuit strategy is proposed for the SC and Non-IO case. A nonconvex optimization problem is introduced to give a condition guaranteeing the winning of the pursuer. A polynomial equation gives a lower bound of the nonconvex problem, providing a sufficient and efficient pursuit winning condition. Finally, we extend to multiplayer games by collecting pairwise outcomes for pursuer–evader matchings. Simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Control barrier functions (CBFs) ensure the safety of controlled dynamical systems by enforcing forward invariance of safe subsets of the state space. First-order CBFs are applicable for systems where the control input appears in the first time derivative of the controlled output. High-order CBFs (HOCBFs) extend the notion of CBFs to systems of any order, following a procedure reminiscent of the recursive design of a control Lyapunov function in backstepping. Asymptotic stability of compact safe sets for Lipschitz continuous HOCBF-based controllers has recently been reported in the literature. In this article, we extend this result by establishing sufficient conditions for uniform asymptotic stability of closed, but not necessarily compact, safe sets. Moreover, we show that uniform asymptotic stability holds for differential inclusions that correspond to allowing the control input to take on arbitrary values that satisfy the HOCBF-induced input constraints. This result circumvents the need to establish continuity properties of optimization-based safeguarding control laws. Sufficient conditions for input-to-state stability are also established, by constructing a vector comparison system from the worst case evolution of the HOCBF along the disturbed versions of the aforementioned differential inclusions. The theoretical results are illustrated by two case studies.},

In this article, we study discrete-time consensus-seeking dynamics on the Stiefel manifold and identify conditions on the network topology to ensure convergence to a global consensus state. We further prove a (local) linear convergence rate to the consensus state that is on par with the well-known rate in the Euclidean space.

In this article, the fault detector is said to be optimal if the missed detection rate (MDR) is minimal under a given false alarm rate. In theory, the relationship between the MDR and the residual parameter matrix is analyzed, which reveals how the dimension of a residual affects the MDR for the first time. When the fault amplitude is known, the optimal fault detector is derived, which is infeasible in practical applications. Next, a new recursive and feasible FD method is presented, where the residual parameter matrix gradually tends to the theoretically optimal one.

In particular, we introduce the GenFlow algorithm and its momentum variant that provably converge to the optimal solution of objective functions satisfying the Polyak–Łojasiewicz inequality in a fixed time. Moreover, for functions that admit nondegenerate saddle points, we show that for the proposed GenFlow algorithm, the time required to evade these saddle points is uniformly bounded for all initial conditions. Finally, for strongly convex–strongly concave minimax problems whose optimal solution is a saddle point, a similar scheme is shown to arrive at the optimal solution again in a fixed time. The superior convergence properties of our algorithm are validated experimentally on a variety of benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of optimally augmenting an actuator redundant system with additional actuators, so that the energy required to meet a given control objective is minimized. We study this actuator selection problem in two distinct cases; first, in the case where the control objective of the system is not known a priori, and second, in the case where the control objective is a linear state-feedback control law. In the latter scenario, knowledge of the system&#39;s state and input matrices is required to solve the corresponding actuator selection problem. However, we relax this requirement by exploiting trajectory data gathered from the system, and using them to iteratively approximate the antistabilizing solution of an associated algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). Notably, the proposed iterative procedure is proved to be small-disturbance input-to-state stable even though the ARE associated with it entails no strictly positive-definite constant term; a result that significantly extends prior work. Finally, to further exploit the obtained trajectory data, we show that these can be used to perform online actuator fault detection without knowledge of the system&#39;s matrices, and with complexity lower than that of existing methods. Simulations showcase the theoretical findings.},

Each agent only has access to a noisy estimate on the gradient of its own objective function, and can only communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying directed graph. To handle this problem, a distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm is adopted. Existing works on distributed algorithms involving stochastic gradients only provide convergence results in expectation. Different from them, we study the convergence of the algorithm in high probability, i.e., the asymptotic convergence rate of the algorithm is characterized by the natural logarithm of the failure probability&#39;s inverse. Under mild assumptions on the graph connectivity, we prove that for the general nonconvex objective function, the average of gradients&#39; norm squared converges in high probability. Furthermore, we also consider the case where the objective function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition. In this case, the difference between the objective function and its minimum value converges in high probability, and the convergence rate is faster than that in the general nonconvex case. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we initiate an important class of vertex-marked directed graphs, referred to as the strong structurally observable graphs (SSOGs), to be the fundamental structural architectures ensuring the observability of several prevalent types of discrete-time iteration systems. This article also answers the minimal control node problem of SSOGs by carrying out two explicit formulas and the corresponding polynomial-time algorithms. Primitively, by exploring the strong structural observability of Boolean networks, an underlying class of SSOGs is proposed as an extended counterpart of network structures of observable conjunctive Boolean networks, while we call for particular attention to network structures instead of node dynamics. With such a class of SSOGs, we justify that a general class of discrete-time iterative systems can also be well addressed. In our formulation, the robustness against the uncertainties in nodal dynamics is achieved by merely exploiting the information on network structures. Two minimal synthesis strategies are, respectively, established to render a directed graph strongly structurally observable in a polynomial amount of time via placing a minimal number of sensors or controlling the nodes. Notably, apart from explicitly calculating the minimal set of control nodes, the structural insights are also leveraged to account for the close relations between the observability of considered iteration systems and observed-path-compatible paths and cycles in the network structures. For certain special yet worthy cases, the SSOGs are specialized in the strong structural observability of finite-field networks and derive the minimum pinned node theorem of Boolean networks with a biological case study as an efficient demonstration.},

Our proposed cooperative coverage control law enables the constrained sensor networks to minimize the overall intertemporal cost of the distributed attention factors throughout the mission domain, while avoiding unforeseen obstacles, by just local information. The mobility constraint of the mobile sensors includes nonzero velocity and bounded turning rate, where the unforeseen obstacles, the mission domain, and the sensory range are considered to be arbitrary compact sets. The viable detection domain is proposed based on viability theory, which is the largest set of states within the sensory domain, and the designed control strategy enables the mobile sensor to detect any target point inside it in a finite time while avoiding obstacles. Effective algorithms capable of reconstructing the viable detection domain are derived, with which both the noncooperative and cooperative coverage control strategies are developed, and their corresponding coverage performances are analytically evaluated.

This article studies the design schemes of reference governors for collisions-free leader–following coordination (CF-LFC) of nonlinear multiagent systems under unreliable communications. The “unreliability” is characterized as irregular topology switchings (e.g., due to communication failures, adversarial attacks, or other agents&#39; blockages), which will often cause large transient coordination errors and further result in interagent collisions. To address it, an event-triggered reference governor is proposed, which dominates agents to perform the leader–following task if the tracking error meets the closed-loop system performance requirement, and otherwise the agents will temporarily “forget” the task and focus on avoiding collisions. By constructing heterogeneous Lyapunov functions, it is shown that the reference governor can achieve the CF-LFC despite the presence of topology switchings. Also, for a special class of nonlinear systems with strict-feedback form, a nonevent-triggered reference governor is further proposed by reconstructing the controller with a high-order integrator of barrier function as the control gain to adaptively adjust the transient tracking errors.},

Our first result involving the P-F operator provides a convex formulation to the optimal control problem in the dual space of densities. This convex formulation of the stochastic optimal control problem leads to an infinite-dimensional convex program. The finite-dimensional approximation of the convex program is obtained using a data-driven approximation of the linear operators. Our second results demonstrate using the Koopman operator, dual to the P-F operator, for the stochastic optimal control design. We show that the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation can be expressed using the Koopman operator. We provide an iterative procedure along the lines of a popular policy iteration algorithm based on the data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for solving the HJB equation. Finally, we present examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed framework and verify the convergence rates for the operator and optimal control numerically.},

We define an index of the instability margin called “ robust instability radius (RIR) ” as the smallest $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ -norm of a stable perturbation that stabilizes a given unstable system. This article has two main contributions. It is first shown that the problem of finding the exact RIR via the small-gain condition can be transformed into the problem of maximizing the phase change rate at the peak frequency with a phase constraint. Then, we show that the maximum is attained by a constant or a first-order all-pass function and derive conditions, under which the RIR can be exactly characterized, in terms of the phase change rate.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the stabilization problem for a class of feedforward nonlinear systems via pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) controllers. First, a state observer, which features a dynamic predictor and a jumping update, is designed such that the unavailable full system state can be accurately estimated. With the obtained state estimations, a reference signal is also constructed. Second, a three-level-state-dependent PWM controller is proposed, which switches among three prescribed states during each cycle and can be determined by two key variables, namely, the duty cycle and the sign of the pulse. It is then demonstrated that the two controller variables can be both expressed in the form of the reference signal, and the design of the controller variables depends on a key parameter that regulates the reference signal. Furthermore, it is shown that the stabilization problem can be cast into a selection problem of the key parameter. By resorting to the Lyapunov stability theory, rigorous stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system is performed. Finally, a resonant circuit system for liquid level control and a numerical example are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PWM control method.},

First, an attack signal estimator is designed, which theoretically realizes the unbiased estimation of attack signals. Then, the alert, whether the sensor is attacked, is described as a hypothesis testing problem from the perspective of average malicious disturbance power, and a novel attack detection algorithm is designed on this basis. Based on the objective of minimizing the fusion error of each fusion center at each time, an efficient sensor fusion algorithm is proposed. The problem of solving the optimal fusion coefficient matrix is transformed into a linear programming problem, which is solved by the method of Lagrange multipliers. The theoretical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the computational efficiency without compromising the estimation performance. Finally, an example of vehicle target state estimation is given to illustrate the effect of the proposed method.},

To this end, we propose to model this identification problem as a Riemannian nonlinear optimization (RNLO) problem, where the stability is ensured through a certain Riemannian manifold and the prior knowledge is expressed as nonlinear constraints defined on this manifold. To solve this RNLO, we apply the Riemannian sequential quadratic optimization (RSQO) that was proposed by Obara, Okuno, and Takeda (2022) most recently. RSQO performs quite well with theoretical guarantee to find a point satisfying the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of RNLO. In this article, we demonstrate that the identification problem can be indeed solved by RSQO more effectively than competing algorithms.},

The extension relies on explicitly involving the tracking error in the feedback control law: it is shown that including this term along with its appropriate extra adaptive gain allows one to handle possibly unstable reference dynamics. Owing to its stabilizing nature, the proposed framework is referred to as model reference adaptive stabilizing control. Such an extension turns out to be particularly useful in leaderless consensus of heterogeneous uncertain agents, since the literature has discussed that leaderless adaptation may not avoid unstable closed-loop dynamics. In such consensus setting, the framework, referred to as model reference adaptive stabilizing consensus, generalizes the existing MRAC-based consensus schemes and can achieve consensus when state-of-the-art MRAC-based schemes may fail.},

Suppose that in the system there are some sequences of events that are undesirable to happen, which we call the fault pattern . We want to determine whether the occurrence of the fault pattern can be determined before some sequences—-which we call the critical pattern and may cause fatal consequences after the fault pattern—are completed. Both fault and critical patterns are assumed to be regular and, hence, are described by the languages accepted by finite automata. We propose a novel notion of pattern–pattern diagnosability (PP-diagnosability), which requires that the occurrence of a fault pattern can always be detected before the completion of a critical pattern thereafter. The properties of PP-diagnosability, and the relations between PP-diagnosability and conventional diagnosability are studied. Then, we propose a method to verify PP-diagnosability using a structure called the pattern–pattern verifier . The complexity of the proposed method is polynomial in the number of states of the plant and the two pattern automata.},

To guarantee the consensus convergence of disturbed first- and second-order MASs, two distributed sliding manifolds with respect to an odd function are first devised in this article. Second, two types of event-triggered mechanisms, i.e., a static event-triggering mechanism and a dynamic event-triggering mechanism, are established to improve the utilization efficiency of network resources and avoid the continuous communication with neighbors. In both event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) strategies, the fully distributed event-triggered SMC laws without global information of the multiagent networks are proposed, and they can ensure the state trajectories of disturbed first- and second-order MASs to reach the average consensus. Meanwhile, the finite-time reachability of the specified sliding manifold can be guaranteed and Zeno behavior can be also averted. Third, taking advantage of the Lyapunov stability theory and SMC, sufficient conditions for the average consensus of single- and double-integrator continuous-time MASs are established. At the end, in order to show the validity of the proposed event-triggered SMC strategies, a numerical simulation and comparative study are offered.},

The design and analysis innovations include the following: 1) by using a scaling transformation with its gain being online tuned dynamically, we convert the original system with constant coefficients into one with dynamic coefficients, allowing for casting the design procedure within several matrix pencil structures; 2) to deal with discontinuous yet time-varying perturbations arising from the corrupted feedback signals, we insert static damping terms into matrix pencils to ensure that the resulting algorithm is sufficiently robust; and 3) to save communication resources more efficiently as well as to enlarge execution intervals between each information transmission, double-side dynamic event-triggering mechanisms are proposed, where the triggering thresholds are designed as monotonically nonincreasing functions. The resultant control scheme is essentially of linear feedback form without involving any recursiveness, rendering it structurally simple and computational low-complex. In addition, the design parameters consist of the maximum/minimum generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pencils formulated to capture the detailed structure of the uncertainty terms, which consequently leads to control algorithms with low conservativeness and sufficient robustness to mismatched uncertainties and corrupted outputs/inputs.

In particular, assuming the agents interact by exchanging flows , which modify their states, our framework guarantees that the sum of the states of agents participating in the network is preserved. To this end, agents maintain a state variable for each of their neighbors. Upon the disconnection of a neighbor, such a variable is used to completely eliminate the effect of previous interaction with disconnected agents from the overall system.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the distributed leader-following fault-tolerant consensus control problem of uncertain nonlinear delayed multiagent systems with hybrid faults including actuator faults and sensor faults. The faults are described as unknown time-varying functions, which can cause uncertain changes in the fault coefficients of sensors and actuators. In this case, we put forward a novel distributed consensus algorithm. First, we transform the consensus problem into the stability one of a single system by utilizing the sensor fault model and directed topology. Then, the dynamic gain is devised to compensate for uncertain parameters. Based on the backstepping control method, a distributed dynamic controller is designed via measurement data of nonideal sensors. By means of a new Lyapunov function, it is strictly proved that the designed controller can render all agents realizing the full-state consensus in the global sense. Moreover, the proposed algorithm allows that nonlinear dynamics include the state delays, and can be expanded to a fully distributed result. Finally, an example of application in chemical reactor systems is presented to confirm the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

Customers arrive to one side and match with queued customers on the opposite side. A gatekeeper who has complete knowledge of the number of customers decides to accept or reject each arrival. The difference between customer types is defined by the customer&#39;s profit to the gatekeeper. Assuming no matching time between the two-sided customers, we show that the optimal admission control policy for maximizing the long-run average profit per unit time has a threshold structure. Furthermore, we also explore more selective (bias) optimal policies when the average optimal policy is not unique. Finally, using the abovementioned results, we provide an efficient iterative algorithm to produce the optimal control policy.},

In contrast with the existing solutions that work for weekly nonlinear systems or rely on available knowledge of the system nonlinearities, it is applicable to the lower-triangular systems with unknown multiplicative and additive nonlinearities, unmatched disturbances, and time-varying parameters. Moreover, it preserves the unique simplicity of PI control and funnel control, without the needs for function approximation, parameter identification, disturbance estimation, derivative calculation, or command filtering.

First, we propose an algebraic condition for node localizability, based on which a distributed node localizability checking algorithm is proposed.

Our approach begins with the construction of a bounded value function, whose strict $p$ super-level set is equal to the $p$ -reach-avoid set. This value function is then reduced to a twice continuously differentiable solution to a system of equations. The system of equations facilitates the construction of a semidefinite program using sum-of-squares decomposition for multivariate polynomials and thus, the transformation of nonconvex reach-avoid problems into a convex optimization problem. We would like to point out that our approach can straightforwardly be specialized to address classical safety verification by, a.o., stochastic barrier certificate methods and reach-avoid analysis for ordinary differential equations.

We consider both cases where data collected from the source system is noiseless and noisy. For each case, by leveraging the data collected from the source system and a priori knowledge on the maximum distance of the two systems, we find a suitable, and relatively small, compact set of systems that contains the actual target system, and then provide a controller that stabilizes the compact set. In particular, the controller can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Feasibility of those LMIs is discussed in details.

Changing the values of many nodes from 0 to 1 (or from 1 to 0) is called the state-flipped control. The concepts of fixed point, reachable sets, and finite-time global stabilization of PBNs under state-flipped control are proposed. Several necessary and sufficient conditions for global stabilization are also derived based on the reachable sets of a given state. Furthermore, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, namely, $Q$ -learning ( $Q$ L) is presented to design a flip sequence for any state that steers the state to a given destination state, thereby achieving finite-time global stabilization via state-flipped control. In addition, the process of finding the minimum flip set is proposed under the semitensor product and $Q$ L methods.

  abstract     = {This article studies the problem of distributed formation maneuver control of multiagent systems via complex Laplacian. We will show how to change the translation, scaling, rotation, and also the shape of formation continuously by only tuning the positions of the leaders in both 2-D and 3-D spaces, where the rotation of formation in the 3-D space is realized by changing the yaw angle, pitch angle, and roll angle of formation sequentially. Compared with real-Laplacian-based methods, the first advantage of the proposed complex-Laplacian-based approach is that each follower requires fewer neighbors and lesser communication. The second advantage is that nonconvex and nongeneric nominal configurations are allowed and the uniqueness of the complex-constraint-based target formation can be guaranteed by the noncollocated nominal agents. The third advantage is that more formation shapes can be realized by only tuning the positions of the leaders. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.},

A smart sensor observes a dynamic system, and sends its local state estimate to a remote estimator (RE). To save energy, multihop networks are deployed to relay data packets from the smart sensor to the RE. The smart sensor needs to decide the hop number communicating with the RE by adjusting its transmission power. To minimize the estimation error and the energy consumption, the transmission scheduling is formulated as a modified Markov decision process (MDP) by incorporating historical actions into the state. A sufficient condition is constructed to guarantee that the MDP has an optimal deterministic and stationary policy. The optimal policy&#39;s structure is further obtained to reduce the computation complexity. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm, i.e., dueling double Q-network, is introduced to obtain a near-optimal policy. Finally, a simulation example is provided to illustrate the developed results.},

Precisely, for the long-range weight function, we show that the flock converges to flocking exponentially fast when the size of the reaction delay is relatively small. Our condition is independent of the initial data of the flock. In contrast to the known flocking conditions for all-to-all interactions, our result may show the distinctive effectiveness of the HL structure.

In particular, the saturation level for each agent is not symmetric, while the saturation levels associated with distinct agents are nonidentical. Both the continuous- and discrete-time cases are considered. For both the saturated multiagent systems, it is proven with the nonlinear contraction analysis that the conventional distributed protocols are sufficient for the achievement of the consensus given a uniformly jointly strongly connected topology condition, which does not require persistent connectivity. This thus confirms the tolerance of the multiagent consensus to generic input saturation constraints with the nonidentical asymmetric levels.

Under reasonable assumptions, there exists a semipermeable surface, which is part of the barrier surface separating the winning regions for the evader and pursuers. The winning strategies are designed for both sides of players in their corresponding winning regions.

Since it is difficult to obtain the mode information of the system directly in practice, a hidden Markov model is adopted to facilitate subsequent works. The hidden state represents the actual system dynamics that cannot be known exactly, but can be observed by the detector. Considering the multi-disturbance phenomenon, one of which is norm bounded and another is produced by an exogenous system, a composite $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ control scheme based on disturbance observer is designed to improve the antidisturbance ability of the system. In addition, with the help of multi-sensor approach, a detection scheme, revealing the attacker&#39;s tactics and determining which sensor is assaulted, is presented to withstand replay attacks. Then, a composite disturbance observer-based controller, ensuring that the resulting system is stochastically stable with an expected $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ performance under replay attacks, is designed by solving convex optimization problems.

Unlike most existing event-triggered control results with only the inputs being triggered, here we introduce a triggering mechanism into the control law and the parameter estimator simultaneously, so that the communication resources are saved. It is worth noting that under the proposed triggering conditions, there are some challenges and difficulties in directly applying the backstepping technique, as the intermittent (triggering) parameter adaptive law introduces additional sampling errors. To address this issue, a decomposition technique for the event-triggered adaptive law and a new lemma for handling the event error are introduced, with which the execution error is gracefully counteracted with a properly designed compensation unit. Moreover, to ensure the flexible prescribed tracking performance, we incorporate a series of functional transformations into the control design. It is shown that, with the fixed control structure, only by adjusting the key parameters and time-varying function, the proposed control can generate multiple kinds of prescribed performance behaviors, which is more general and flexible than the existing prescribed performance controls. The effectiveness of our control scheme is verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the discrete-time rational expectations model with state delays. In particular, the dynamic equation relies both on the history of states and the conditional expectation of the future states. The novelty of this article lies in transforming the solvability of the rational expectations model to that of the forward and backward stochastic difference equations (FBSDEs). The main contribution is to obtain the (unique) solvability and the explicit solutions for the FBSDEs in both finite horizon and infinite horizon. This accordingly gives the explicit solution of the rational expectations model. The key technology is to establish a nonhomogeneous relationship between forward and backward processes of the FBSDEs.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns adaptive iterative learning control (AILC) for nonsquare multiple-input--multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. With newly introduced techniques in dealing with the nonsquare input distribution matrix, a novel robust AILC (RAILC) approach is proposed. The method is not only effective to address the perfect trajectory tracking problem for both underactuated or overactuated systems, but also shows impressive robustness and adaptiveness to various system uncertainties and external disturbances, including matched and mismatched, parametric and nonparametric as well as input distribution uncertainties. Inspired by the proposed RAILC design framework, a new unified AILC algorithm is then developed for a generic class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems with either square or nonsquare input distribution matrices. The work is novel, which contributes significantly not only to refine the theory of AILC but also to widen the application scope. The convergence properties of the proposed control algorithms are analyzed rigorously under the framework of composite energy function methodology, and their effectiveness have been verified through two illustrated examples.},

Compared with the previous analyses based on complex analysis and Cauchy&#39;s residue theorem, the analysis results derived from the simplified method are more explicit, thorough, and require less restrictive assumptions. For continuous-time filtering systems, our simplified analysis reveals that apart from the nonminimum phase zero sets reported in the previous literature, the value and boundedness of filtering sensitivity integrals are also determined by the leading coefficients, relative degrees, minimum phase zeros, and poles of plants and filters. By invoking the simplified method, a comprehensive analysis of the discrete-time filtering sensitivity integrals is conducted for the first time.

Following an emulation approach, it is required the availability of a convergent state observer and of a global asymptotic stabilizer in continuous time, generally depending on the estimated state and on the measured output. We then introduce time sampling, quantizations on the input, observed state and output signals, and a periodic event-triggered mechanism to update the control law only when necessary. The proposed methodology guarantees practical stabilization of the system with state convergence to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin by using finite data and a reduced number of control updates, which is desirable in digital and networked contexts with limited bandwidth. Numerical simulations on an actuated inverted pendulum show the potential of the approach.},

However, such an assumption means these protocols may only work if the agents&#39; initial state values are set within a small enough neighborhood of the origin. This article develops a novel neural-network-based consensus protocol for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems. It is strictly proven that the state of each agent is constrained in a solvable compact set for arbitrary initial condition. By introducing the method of designing an internal plant for each agent, the interaction terms of nonlinearities are avoided in the consensus analysis, and the problem of solving the compact set is much simplified. It is also noted that the implementation of the protocol relies on only local interactions of agents&#39; real states, instead of internal plant states. Integrating the adaptive and nonsmooth control techniques, the negative effect from approximation errors can be eliminated and the complete consensus can be reached.},

This article proposes a composite error learning framework for adaptive robot control under discontinuous friction, where an HFF control structure with forward and inverse models is introduced to mimic the cerebellar motor learning control mechanism, and a composite learning technique with memory regressor extension is employed to capture the robot dynamics. Using discontinuous Lyapunov analysis with Filippov&#39;s differential inclusion, we rigorously prove that semiglobal stability of the closed-loop system is ensured without high feedback gains, and exponential parameter convergence (implying accurate robot modeling) is guaranteed by a weakened condition of interval excitation.

We show that the proposed scheduler is indexable and suboptimal. We derive an upper and a lower bound of the proposed scheduler and give stability conditions for estimation error. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to existing policies, the proposed scheduler achieves estimation performance very close to the optimal at a much lower computation time.},

First, a new preset-time and preset-accuracy Zeno-free event-triggered observer that requires neither each agent to access the human agent information nor the first $(n-1)$ derivatives of the human agent output is designed by using a preset-time and preset-accuracy convergence performance function. Based on this observer, a preset-time and preset-accuracy intrusion-tolerant controller is put forward for every follower agent, wherein the preset-time convergence and steady-state cluster consensus accuracy are assigned a priori. It is worth mentioning that the control strategy is designed in the form of a transformed error, which not only avoids the infinite gain at the preset-time instant but also operates continuously even beyond the preset-time interval. Meanwhile, the preset time and preset accuracy are not affected by the initial conditions, so that the performance function can be preset arbitrarily. To confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results, the proposed strategy for cluster consensus control with preset time and preset accuracy is applied to a single link manipulator system.},

However, the defender does not know the exact goal of the attacker but only the prior of the possible attacker goals. Here, we model one period with a constant threshold as a Bayesian game and use the Bayesian Nash equilibrium concept to find the distribution for the choice of the threshold in that period, which takes the defender&#39;s uncertainty about the attacker into account. To obtain the equilibrium distribution, the defender minimizes its cost consisting of the cost for false alarms and the cost induced by the attack. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a moving target defense and formulate a linear program to determine the moving target defense. Furthermore, we present a closed-form solution for the special case when the defender knows the attacker&#39;s goals. The results are numerically evaluated on a four-tank process.},

The former is effective for systems with a relatively low state space dimension and the latter is developed for high-dimensional problems. The deep learning method is applied to a New England 10-generator power system model. A feedforward neural network is trained to approximate the corresponding Zubov&#39;s equation solution. The network characterizes the system&#39;s domain of attraction.

  abstract     = {This article investigates adaptive identification and prediction problems for stochastic dynamical systems with saturated output observations, which arise from various fields in engineering and social systems, but up to now still lack comprehensive theoretical studies including guarantees for the estimation performance needed in practical applications. With this impetus, this article has made the following main contributions. First, to introduce an adaptive two-step quasi-Newton algorithm to improve the performance of the identification, which is applicable to a typical class of nonlinear stochastic systems with outputs observed under possibly varying saturation. Second, to establish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and adaptive predictors, and to prove the asymptotic normality, under the weakest possible nonpersistent excitation condition, which can be applied to stochastic feedback systems with general nonstationary and correlated system signals or data. Third, to establish useful probabilistic estimation error bounds for any given finite length of data, using either martingale inequalities or Monte Carlo experiments. A numerical example is also provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed identification algorithm.},

  abstract     = {State estimation over a communication channel, in which sensory information of a stochastic source is transmitted in real-time by an encoder to a decoder that estimates the state of the source, is one of the basic problems in networked control systems. In this article, we investigate the performance of state estimation under two primary network imperfections: packet loss and time delay. To that end, we make a causal frequency-distortion tradeoff that is defined between the packet rate and the mean square error, when the source and the channel are modeled by a partially observable Gauss–Markov process and a fixed-delay packet-erasure channel, under two distinct communication protocols: one with and one without packet-loss detection. We prove the existence of a globally optimal policy profile, and show that this policy profile is composed of a symmetric threshold scheduling policy and a non-Gaussian linear estimation policy, which are used by the encoder and the decoder, respectively. Our structural results assert that the scheduling policy is expressible in terms of $\boldsymbol{\mathit {3d-1}}$ variables related to the source and the channel, where $\boldsymbol{\mathit {d}}$ is the time delay, and that the estimation policy incorporates no residuals related to signaling. The key finding is that packet-loss detection does not increase the performance of the underlying networked system in the sense of the causal frequency-distortion tradeoff. We prove this by showing that the globally optimal policy profile remains exactly the same under both of the communication protocols.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many reactive trajectory planning approaches were suggested in the literature because of their inherent immediate adaption in the ever more demanding cluttered and unpredictable environments of robotic systems. However, typically those approaches are only locally reactive without considering global path planning and no guarantees for simultaneous collision avoidance and goal convergence can be given. In this article, we study a recently developed circular field (CF)-based motion planner that combines local reactive control with global trajectory generation by adapting an artificial magnetic field such that multiple trajectories around obstacles can be evaluated (cf., Becker et al., 2021). In particular, we provide a mathematically rigorous analysis of this planner for static environments in the horizontal plane to ensure safe motion of the controlled robot. Contrary to existing results, the derived collision avoidance analysis covers the entire CF motion planning algorithm including attractive forces for goal convergence and is not limited to a specific choice of the rotation field, i.e., our guarantees are not limited to a specific potentially suboptimal trajectory. Our Lyapunov-type collision avoidance analysis is based on the definition of an (equivalent) 2-D auxiliary system, which enables us to provide tight, if and only if conditions for the case of a collision with point obstacles. Furthermore, we show how this analysis naturally extends to multiple obstacles and we specify sufficient conditions for goal convergence. Finally, we provide challenging simulation scenarios with multiple nonconvex point cloud obstacles and demonstrate collision avoidance and goal convergence.},

  abstract     = {We consider an entropy-regularized version of optimal density control of deterministic discrete-time linear systems. Entropy regularization, or a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) method for optimal control, has attracted much attention especially in reinforcement learning due to its many advantages, such as a natural exploration strategy. Despite the merits, high-entropy control policies induced by the regularization introduce probabilistic uncertainty into systems, which severely limits the applicability of MaxEnt optimal control to safety-critical systems. To remedy this situation, we impose a Gaussian density constraint at a specified time on the MaxEnt optimal control to directly control state uncertainty. Specifically, we derive the explicit form of the MaxEnt optimal density control. In addition, we also consider the case where density constraints are replaced by fixed-point constraints. Then, we characterize the associated state process as a pinned process, which is a generalization of the Brownian bridge to linear systems. Finally, we reveal that the MaxEnt optimal density control gives the so-called Schrödinger bridge associated with a discrete-time linear system.},

Then, we prove that under uniform Lipschitz backward distinguishability, the maps $(T_{k})_{k \in \mathbb {N}}$ become uniformly Lipschitz injective after a certain time if the target dynamics are pushed sufficiently fast. This leads to an arbitrarily fast discrete observer after a certain time, which exhibits similarities with the famous high-gain observer for continuous-time systems. Input-to-state stability of the estimation error with respect to uncertainties, input disturbances, and measurement noise is then shown. Next, under the milder backward distinguishability, we show the injectivity of the maps $(T_{k})_{k \in \mathbb {N}}$ after a certain time for a generic choice of the target filter dynamics.

Then, a novel singularity-free outer-loop maneuvering control law is proposed, whose ISS property is proved under the above extended ISS theory framework. Then, the geometric maneuvering controller is designed for thrust and torque inputs by combining such outer-loop control law with the existing attitude controller, and the interconnected closed-loop system is proved to be uniformly asymptotically stable.

  abstract     = {Compound matrices have found applications in many fields of science including systems and control theory. In particular, a sufficient condition for $k$ -contraction is that a logarithmic norm (also called matrix measure) of the $k$ -additive compound of the Jacobian is uniformly negative. However, this computation may be difficult to perform analytically and expensive numerically because the $k$ -additive compound of an $n\times n$ matrix has dimensions $\binom{n}{k}\times \binom{n}{k}$ . This article establishes a duality relation between the $k$ and $(n-k)$ compounds of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ . This duality relation is used to derive a sufficient condition for $k$ -contraction that does not require the computation of any $k$ -compounds. These theoretical results are demonstrated by deriving a sufficient condition for $k$ -contraction of an $n$ -dimensional Hopfield network that does not require to compute any compounds. In particular, for $k=2$ this sufficient condition implies that the network is 2-contracting and thus admits a strong asymptotic property: every bounded solution of the network converges to an equilibrium point, that may not be unique. This is relevant, for example, when using the Hopfield network as an associative memory that stores patterns as equilibrium points of the dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis problem of the interconnection of homogeneous linear time-invariant systems such that the frequency response satisfies magnitude constraints is investigated. To this end, the usual synthesis approach of traditional filters, viewed as the interconnection of integrators $\frac{1}{s}$ , is revisited based on the linear fractional transformation representation and the $\lbrace x,y,z\rbrace$ -dissipative characterization. This approach, based on convex optimization, consists of two steps: the magnitude synthesis and the spectral factorization steps. When the systems are modeled by a lossless dissipative transfer function $T(s)$ , it is demonstrated that each step can be extended. However, a factorization error appears when considering a general dissipative $T(s)$ , preventing the direct extension of the two-step approach. It is then revealed how to overcome this issue by coupling both steps, generalizing thereby the usual synthesis approach. Finally, the interest of this work is illustrated through two applications: the design of $LC$ -bandpass filters and the weighted $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ -control of interconnected homogeneous systems.},

We propose a prescribed-time safety (PTSf) design which enforces safety only for a finite time of interest to the user. While traditional CBF designs would keep the system away from the safe set longer than necessary, our PTSf design lets the system reach the boundary of the safe set by the prescribed time and obey the operator&#39;s intent thereafter. To emphasize the capability of our design for safety constraints with high relative degrees, we focus our exposition on strict-feedback systems where the safety condition is defined for the state furthest from the control input. In contrast to existing CBF-based methods for high relative degree constraints, our approach involves choosing explicitly specified gains (instead of class $\mathcal {K}$ functions), and, with the aid of backstepping, operates in the entirety of the original safe set with no additional restriction on the initial conditions. With QP being employed in the design, in addition to backstepping and CBFs with a PTSf property, we refer to our design as a QP-backstepping PT-CBF design. We include some numerical examples to illustrate the performance of our design.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of stabilizing a class of degenerate stochastic processes, which are constrained to a bounded Euclidean domain or a compact smooth manifold, to a given target probability density. This stabilization problem arises in the field of swarm robotics, for example, in applications where a swarm of robots is required to cover an area according to a target probability density. Most existing works on modeling and control of robotic swarms that use partial differential equation (PDE) models assume that the robots&#39; dynamics are holonomic and, hence, the associated stochastic processes have generators that are elliptic. We relax this assumption on the ellipticity of the generator of the stochastic processes, and consider the more practical case of the stabilization problem for a swarm of agents whose dynamics are given by a controllable driftless control-affine system. We construct state-feedback control laws that exponentially stabilize a swarm of nonholonomic agents to a target probability density that is sufficiently regular. State-feedback laws can stabilize a swarm only to target probability densities that are positive everywhere. To stabilize the swarm to probability densities that possibly have disconnected supports, we introduce a semilinear PDE model of a collection of interacting agents governed by a hybrid switching diffusion process. The interaction between the agents is modeled using a (mean-field) feedback law that is a function of the local density of the swarm, with the switching parameters as the control inputs. We show that under the action of this feedback law, the semilinear PDE system is globally asymptotically stable about the given target probability density. The stabilization strategies with and without agent interactions are verified numerically for agents that evolve according to the Brockett integrator; the strategy with interactions is additionally verified for agents that evolve according to an underactuated system on the sphere $S^{2}$ .},

We consider an extension of a standard Stackelberg game, called a discrete-time dynamic Stackelberg game , that has an underlying state space that affects the leader&#39;s rewards and available strategies and evolves in a Markovian manner depending on both the leader and follower&#39;s selected strategies. Although standard Stackelberg games have been utilized to improve scheduling in security domains, their deployment is often limited by requiring complete information of the follower&#39;s utility function. In contrast, we consider scenarios where the follower&#39;s utility function is unknown to the leader; however, it can be linearly parameterized. Our objective is then to provide an algorithm that prescribes a randomized strategy to the leader at each step of the game based on observations of how the follower responded in previous steps. We design an online learning algorithm that, with high probability, is no-regret , i.e., achieves a regret bound (when compared to the best policy in hindsight), which is sublinear in the number of time steps; the degree of sublinearity depends on the number of features representing the follower&#39;s utility function. The regret of the proposed learning algorithm is independent of the size of the state space and polynomial in the rest of the parameters of the game. We show that the proposed learning algorithm outperforms existing model-free reinforcement learning approaches.},

Here, we solve the optimal, linear, output feedback problem in which the controller is autonomous, achieves pattern generation, and minimizes the $L_{2}$ norm of the transient portion of the impulse response. Our result reveals the optimal control architecture comprising a linear quadratic regulator and a Kalman filter, along with additional feedback/feedforward to/from a pattern generator, with gains constrained by the regulator equation and its dual, respectively. In contrast to the standard output regulation, the pattern generator is embedded in the feedback loop, allowing the reference signals to be modified autonomously in response to disturbances.

  abstract     = {A stochastic, hybrid algorithm for global almost sure unanimous decision making in multiagent systems is introduced. Homogeneous agents communicate over an undirected connected graph to make a unanimous selection among a finite set of decision states. The agents have inertia corresponding to stable, linear, and continuous-time dynamics. The algorithm equips each agent with a logic variable and designs logic-variable reset rules to ensure eventual unanimity. These resets occur randomly in time. They are randomly assigned among those indices of the decision states that nearly minimize the value of a function that quantifies the mismatch between the average of the agent states, or a local estimate thereof, and the corresponding decision state. In order to satisfy regularity properties that confer robustness, the resulting update rule corresponds to an inclusion, i.e., a set-valued mapping. Global almost sure decision making is established using a classical Lyapunov function argument that has recently been extended to stochastic hybrid inclusions.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the constrained nonsmooth distributed optimization problems (DOPs) of general linear multiagent systems. Our problem involves the general linear dynamics of agents, and the cost functions are nondifferentiable. Moreover, the decisions of agents are constrained by both local and coupled inequalities. Without considering the general linear dynamics, the nonsmooth cost functions, and/or the inequality constraints, existing distributed algorithms are ineffective for our problem. Besides, due to the general linear dynamics, the decisions of agents cannot be determined directly by their control inputs, while the optimal solution must satisfy the constraints. Therefore, it is not easy to design algorithms for our problem. In addition, noteworthily, the global Lipschitz continuity of gradients is an indispensable condition for existing results of DOPs with physical systems. However, the subgradients of nonsmooth cost functions are not Lipschitz continuous, which consequently puts up barriers to algorithm analysis. Based on state/output feedback, subgradient descents, and primal-dual methods, we develop two distributed algorithms. Compared with existing algorithms for DOPs with physical systems, our algorithms are fully distributed. By set-valued Lasalle invariance principle and convex analysis, we analyze the two algorithms rigorously. The first algorithm can solve strictly convex DOPs, in contrast to most results of DOPs with physical systems. The second algorithm only depends on the output information, different from many related algorithms. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to smart grids. With the methods, doubly-fed induction generators can achieve the optimal economic dispatch autonomously.},

Here, the fixed-order $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ -conic design problem is posed as a series of convergent approximations. The resulting synthesis algorithm uses all controller parameters as explicit design variables, and is guaranteed to find a feasible controller under mild assumptions. This improves performance over previous $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ -conic designs while permitting controller dimension and communication structure to be arbitrarily chosen, which allows reduced-order and sparse distributed designs. The relationship between variable structure and computational complexity is explored, and the main algorithm is applied to numerical examples.},

A new approach called bumpless transfer model predictive control (BT-MPC) is proposed, which simultaneously optimizes the stabilization performance and bumpless transfer performance in a receding horizon manner. By a scenario-based control law, the fixed-duration transition progress is generalized to the mutable-duration one, so that the BTC scheme can be applied to MJLSs. Compared with existing BTC approaches, BT-MPC avoids the requirement of predesigned controller gains or gain variations, thereby reducing the conservatism and simplifying the parameter tuning. The recursive feasibility of BT-MPC and the mean-square stability of the underlying systems are theoretically guaranteed, and a simulation example is provided to validate the developed results.},

To find the possible control sequences, a truth matrix reflecting the relationship between state pairs and control inputs is constructed. Using the truth matrix, necessary and sufficient conditions for several types of observability are given. Based on criteria for observability and some matrix discriminants, the realizability of observability decomposition is discussed. Notably, the proposed method is applicable to the observability decomposition under different definitions of observability, while the existing result is valid for only one type of observability.

The leaders are moving in the space and their positions determine a time-varying target formation, which may differ from the desired formation by a translation and a rotation. The followers, which can sense the local displacements with regard to their neighboring agents, track the moving target formation by controlling several interagent distance constraints. In case the followers are modeled by single integrators and the leaders are moving with bounded uniformly continuous velocities, we propose formation tracking control laws for followers with and without information on the exact upper bound of the leaders&#39; velocities. Furthermore, another formation tracking law is proposed for double-integrator followers when the leaders are moving with the same constant velocity. In all cases, we provide sufficient conditions on the bound of the initial conditions so that the time-varying target formation is asymptotically achieved. Simulation results are then given to support the mathematical analysis.},

However, state costs under the embedding may not exactly match the original costs and even assume unrealistic values. In this work, we derive a constructive sufficient condition to devise an exact embedding solution rendering the embedded state cost to match the original system. Furthermore, since, in this case, the embedding implies a transition from the discrete to continuous action space, the correlation between the obtained continuous action and an equivalent desired discrete action is investigated using a maximum a posteriori probability-based method. Finally, some examples, including mammalian cell-cycle network, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

One key contribution of that paper was to establish a set of necessary conditions on the excitation and measurement pattern (EMP) that guarantee generic identifiability: all sources must be excited and all sinks measured, and all other nodes must be either excited or measured. In this article, we show that two other types of nodes, which are defined by the local topology of the network, play an essential rôle in the search for a valid EMP, i.e., one that guarantees generic identifiability. We have called these nodes dources and dinks. We show that a network is generically identifiable only if, in addition to the abovementioned conditions, all dources are excited and all dinks are measured. We also show that sources and dources are the only nodes in a network that always need to be excited, and that sinks and dinks are the only nodes that need to be measured for an EMP to be valid.},

The manifolds are outfitted with geometric features styled “dimples” and “pimples” that characterize the absence of flatness. The signs of interagent couplings together with these geometric features give rise to stable polarization under various sufficient conditions.

  abstract     = {In automatic negotiation, an automated agent is trained to negotiate on behalf of a human negotiator. We consider that the domain of negotiations is known to both the agent and its opponents. In this setting, a greedy concession algorithm (GCA) is employed to find an optimal policy for the agent when the agent&#39;s belief about the opponent is known. However, the GCA is computationally expensive to certain class of policies. In this article, we propose a reverse GCA that is computationally less expensive for such class of policies. We also provide an alternate proof to establish that the GCA is a dynamic programming principle.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the stability analysis and $H_\infty$ controller synthesis problems for networked systems with random transmission delays and packet dropouts that are subject to noisy sampling intervals. The sampling errors and transmission delays are described by an independent and identically distributed sequence of continuous random variables and the transmission delays are assumed to be smaller than the noisy sampling intervals. First, a closed-loop discrete-time stochastic framework for networked system that allows investigating noisy sampling intervals, random transmission delays, and packet dropouts simultaneously is established. To render the discrete-time stochastic system suitable for stability analysis and synthesis, an equivalent yet tractable stochastic augmented model is then reformulated with the help of matrix exponential computation. Based on this augmented model, a stability condition involving the expectation of a nonlinear and random coupling matrix is derived. By recurring to the law of total expectation and Kronecker product operation, the expectation operation of the coupling matrix subject to high nonlinearity and multiple randomness is decoupled. Subsequently, a controller algorithm is designed such that the exponential mean-square stability of the original discrete-time stochastic system with a prescribed $H_\infty$ performance is guaranteed. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the controller design algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This note investigates the decentralized stabilization problem for a class of interconnected systems in the presence of non-triangular structural uncertainties and time-varying parameters, where each subsystem exchanges information only with its neighbors and only intermittent (rather than continuous) states and input are to be utilized. Thus far to the best of authors&#39; knowledge, no solution exists priori to this work, despite its high prevalence in practice. Two globally decentralized adaptive control schemes are presented based on the backstepping technique: the first one is developed in a continuous fashion by combining the philosophy of the modified congelation of variables-based approach with the special treatment of non-triangular structural uncertainties, which avoids the derivative of time-varying parameters and eliminates the limitation of the triangular condition, thus largely broadens the scope of application. By making use of the important property that the partial derivatives of the constructed virtual controllers in each subsystem are all constants, the second scheme is developed through directly replacing the states in the preceding scheme with the triggered ones. Consequently, the non-differentiability issue of the virtual controllers stemming from intermittent state feedback is completely obviated. The internal signals under both schemes are rigorously shown to be globally uniformly bounded with the aid of several novel lemmas, while the stabilization performance can be enhanced by appropriately adjusting design parameters. Moreover, the interevent intervals are ensured to be lower bounded by a positive constant. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the benefits and efficiency of the proposed method.},

The specified-time convergence of the system and the asymptotic optimality of the solution generated by the system are proved based on the Lyapunov theory.

Second, by solely making use of the digital states of both the agent and the distributed observer, a certainty equivalence control law is synthesized featuring a time-varying feedforward gain. It is rigorously proven that, with this time-varying feedforward gain, the proposed control approach can achieve exponential convergence of the tracking errors given arbitrary time-varying leader&#39;s signal, and the upper bound for the sampling intervals is explicitly given. Third, for the class of chain-integrator multiagent systems, the proposed control approach does not need any restriction on the upper bound of the sampling intervals, and thus would be more practical in certain application scenarios from the perspective of energy saving. The performance of the proposed control approach is validated by the simulation results of inverter-based distributed generation systems.},

However, due to the inherent uncertainty, it is hard to obtain the algebraic expression of an stochastic LCN. A unified paradigm for the transition analysis of LCNs with stochastic and deterministic dynamics is provided in this research. First, the algebraic expression of LCN with deterministic dynamics is reviewed. Second, the algebraic expression of LCN with stochastic dynamics is considered, where the nonequivalence between the dispersed form and the integrated form is proposed. Then, the reason for the nonequivalence is provided. After that, a consistency condition is presented to bridge the gap between the independent model and the conditionally independent model. Finally, we specifically point out that probabilistic LCN satisfies the consistency criteria, allowing one to calculate the probabilistic LCN transition matrix by using a power-reducing operator.},

Our goal is to design a boundary controller to exponentially stabilize the coupled system. For that, we propose a controller whose design is based on the backstepping method. Under this controller, we analyze the stability of the closed loop in the $H^{1}$ sense. A set of (highly coupled) backstepping kernel equations is derived, and their well-posedness is shown in the appropriate spaces by an infinite induction energy series, which has not been used before in this setting. Moreover, we show the invertibility of transformations by displaying the inverse transformations, as required for closed-loop well-posedness and stability. Finally, a numerical simulation is implemented, and the result illustrates that the control law designed by the backstepping transformation can stabilize the mixed PDE system exponentially.},

Under some minor assumptions for the controlled Markov process, we establish the dynamic programming principle, based on which we prove that the value function is a classical solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation on a discrete lattice space. We then prove that there exists an optimal deterministic Markov control under the compactness assumption of control domain.

However, when switching faults occur due to parameter errors, the noncentrally synergistic property can lead to the unwinding problem or, in some cases, destabilize the desired set. In this work, a hybrid controller is first proposed based on a novel centrally synergistic family of potential functions on $\mathbb {S}^{n}$ , which is generated from a basic potential function through angular warping. The synergistic parameter can be explicitly expressed if the warping angle has a positive lower bound at the undesired critical points of the family. Next, the proposed approach induces a new quaternion-based controller for global attitude tracking. It has three advantageous features over the existing synergistic designs: it is consistent, i.e., free from the ambiguity of unit quaternion representation; it is switching fault tolerant, i.e., the desired closed-loop equilibria remain asymptotically stable even when the switching mechanism does not work; and it relaxes the assumption on the parameter of the basic potential function in the literature. Comprehensive simulation confirms the high robustness of the proposed centrally synergistic approach compared with the existing noncentrally synergistic approaches.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical flow networks serve as macroscopic models for, e.g., transportation networks, queuing networks, and distribution networks. While the flow dynamics in such networks follow the conservation of mass on the links, the outflow from each link is often nonlinear due to, e.g., flow capacity constraints and simultaneous service rate constraints. Such nonlinear constraints imply a limit on the magnitude of exogenous inflow that is able to be accommodated by the network before it becomes overloaded and its state trajectory diverges. This article shows how the strong integral input-to-state stability (Strong iISS) property allows for quantifying the effects of the exogenous inflow on the flow dynamics. The Strong iISS property enables a unified stability analysis of classes of dynamical flow networks that were only partly analyzable before, such as networks with cycles, multicommodity flow networks, and networks with nonmonotone flow dynamics. We present sufficient conditions on the maximum magnitude of exogenous inflow to guarantee input-to-state stability for a dynamical flow network, and we also present cases when this sufficient condition is necessary.

The measurement likelihood is modeled as a mixture of two Gaussian distributions and a Student&#39;s t distribution, respectively. The unknown covariance of multiplicative noise is modeled as an inverse Gamma/Wishart distribution and the initial condition is formulated as the nominal covariance. By using robust design and choosing hierarchical priors, two variational Bayesian-based robust Kalman filters are proposed. The stability and convergence of the proposed filters and the covariance parameters are analyzed. The lower and upper bounds are also provided to guarantee the performance of the proposed filters.

  abstract     = {Optimization-based state estimation is useful for handling of constrained linear or nonlinear dynamical systems. It has an ideal form, known as full information estimation (FIE), which uses all past measurements to perform state estimation, and also a practical counterpart, known as moving-horizon estimation (MHE), which uses most recent measurements of a limited length to perform the estimation. This work reveals a generic link from robust stability of FIE to that of MHE, showing that the former implies at least a weaker robust stability of MHE, which implements a long enough horizon. The implication strengthens to strict robust stability of MHE if the corresponding FIE satisfies a mild Lipschitz continuity condition. The revealed implications are then applied to derive new sufficient conditions for robust stability of MHE, which further reveals an intrinsic relation between the existence of a robustly stable FIE/MHE and the system being incrementally input/output-to-state stable.},

This can be achieved by selecting a proper stage cost and terminal cost for the OCP. A very useful particular case of OCP is a model predictive control (MPC) scheme where a deterministic (possibly nonlinear) model is used to reduce the computational complexity. This observation leads us to parameterize an MPC scheme fully, including the cost function. In practice, reinforcement learning algorithms can then be used to tune the parameterized MPC scheme. We verify the developed theorems analytically in an LQR case and we investigate some other nonlinear examples in simulations.},

Then backstepping is applied to obtain a control law guaranteeing closed-loop stability of the origin in the $L^{2}$ sense. Arbitrarily rapid stabilization can be achieved by adjusting control parameters, and has not been achieved in previous results. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Available underapproximation methods applicable to continuous-time linear systems typically assume the ability to compute transition matrices and their integrals exactly, which is not feasible in general, and/or suffer from high computational costs. In this note, we attempt to overcome these drawbacks for a class of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, where we propose a novel method to underapproximate finite-time forward reachable sets and tubes, utilizing approximations of the matrix exponential and its integral. In particular, we consider the class of continuous-time LTI systems with an identity input matrix and initial and input values belonging to full-dimensional sets that are affine transformations of closed unit balls. The proposed method yields computationally efficient underapproximations of reachable sets and tubes, when implemented using zonotopes, with first-order convergence guarantees in the sense of the Hausdorff distance. To illustrate its performance, we implement our approach in three numerical examples, where linear systems of dimensions ranging between 2 and 200 are considered.},

A novel controller is articulated, which switches between the linear feedback control and finite-time feedback control relying on the size of system error. Sufficient criteria for achieving stochastic synchronization are derived, and the analytical estimates of TC and EC for synchronization are further obtained. Especially, we show that a reduction in TC will lead to an increase in EC, i.e., there is a tradeoff between TC and EC. Afterward, we further report that different optimal values of the steepness exponent and control strength should be taken to minimize the total costs of time and energy with the different performance indices.},

The observed system is jointly observable, i.e., each agent can only access a part of the measurement output of the observed system and cannot recover the full state by itself. The full state estimation has to be achieved by network communication of neighboring agents. In contrast to existing works, the salient feature of this work is that the developed approach can deal with jointly connected switching networks and thus is more resilient to unreliable communication. First, we propose a new observability decomposition method for linear systems in modal canonical form. Then, we design distributed observers for both the continuous-time system and the discrete-time system. Based on the common Lyapunov function approach, we show that the switched estimation error system is asymptotically stable and thus, the full state estimation can be achieved under jointly connected switching networks.},

In many practical scenarios, agents may not be willing to share their optimization variables with others. For this reason, we propose a distributed algorithm that does not require the agents to share their optimization variables with each other; instead, each agent maintains a local estimate of the global constraint functions and shares the estimate only with its neighbors. These local estimates of constraint functions are updated using a consensus-type algorithm, whereas the local optimization variables of each agent are updated using a first-order method based on noisy estimates of gradient. We prove that, when the agents adopt the proposed algorithm, their optimization variables converge with probability 1 to an optimal point of an approximated problem based on the penalty method.},

The synthesized supervisor, also a TA, is controllable, maximally permissive, and guarantees a nonblocking and safe supervised plant. The use of real-valued clocks in TA makes it a practical modeling framework; however, the infinite state space brings challenges.

In this article, by introducing a suitable information structure for adaptive games, we will show that a theory can be established on adaptive strategies that are designed based on both the certainty equivalence principle and the diminishing excitation technique. Under almost the same physical structure conditions as those in the traditional known parameters case, it is shown that the closed-loop adaptive game systems will be globally stable and asymptotically reach the Nash equilibrium.},

Distinguished from the classical value-iteration approaches, we develop an asynchronous online algorithm based on policy iteration integrated with a multipolicy improvement method of policy switching. A sequence of monotonically improving solutions to the forecast-horizon sub-MDP is generated by updating the current solution only at the currently visited state, building in effect a rolling-horizon control policy for the MDP over infinite horizon. Feedbacks from “supervisors,” if available, can be also incorporated while updating. We focus on the convergence issue with a relation to the transition structure of the MDP. Either a global convergence to an optimal forecast-horizon policy or a local convergence to a “locally-optimal” fixed-policy in a finite time is achieved by the algorithm depending on the structure.},

This article presents a framework for codesigning a sparse sensing network with the least precise sensors and the filter that guarantees the prescribed $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ estimation accuracy.

  abstract     = {Security issues in cyber–physical systems have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this article, a security problem in a remote estimation application is considered, where an attacker tries to degrade estimation performance via malicious attacks. In our scenario, a smart sensor transmits its innovation to a remote estimator with a residue-based false data detector. Instead of assuming that the attacker launches a consecutive man-in-the-middle attack, we consider the case with intermittent attacks. Reverse attack is a simple attack strategy, which enables an attacker to change signs of the innovation sequences. Therefore, owing to the abovementioned reasons, an event-triggered reverse attack strategy is proposed to degrade the system performance. First, the stealthiness of the event-triggered linear deception attack strategy is studied. Then, the evolution of the estimation error covariance is computed and the reverse attack is proven to be the optimal linear deception attack. We demonstrate that our event-triggered reverse attack is more destructive than a random reverse attack. Furthermore, a convex optimization problem is established to design event-triggered parameters. Comparisons of attack strategies are provided in a numerical example to validate the superiority of the reverse attack.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a distributed zeroth-order policy optimization method for multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). Existing MARL algorithms often assume that every agent can observe the states and actions of all the other agents in the network. This can be impractical in large-scale problems, where sharing the state and action information with multihop neighbors may incur significant communication overhead. The advantage of the proposed zeroth-order policy optimization method is that it allows the agents to compute the local policy gradients needed to update their local policy functions using local estimates of the global accumulated rewards that depend on partial state and action information only and can be obtained using consensus. Specifically, to calculate the local policy gradients, we develop a new distributed zeroth-order policy gradient estimator that relies on one-point residual-feedback which, compared to existing zeroth-order estimators that also rely on one-point feedback, significantly reduces the variance of the policy gradient estimates improving, in this way, the learning performance. We show that the proposed distributed zeroth-order policy optimization method with constant stepsize converges to the neighborhood of a policy that is a stationary point of the global objective function. The size of this neighborhood depends on the agents&#39; learning rates, the exploration parameters, and the number of consensus steps used to calculate the local estimates of the global accumulated rewards. Moreover, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate that our new zeroth-order policy gradient estimator is more sample-efficient compared to other existing one-point estimators.},

Specifically, the robot should arrive at a certain level set of the field and repeatedly sweep it afterward. The field data come exclusively from online and pointwise measurements of the field value at the current location of the robot. An additional problem is related to the significant uncertainty on the field and the medium, including their variation with time and the effect of the medium on the robot&#39;s motion. The conditions for the accomplishability of the mission objective are found under these uncertainties and constraints on the kinematics of the robot. A navigation algorithm is presented that solves the mission with a slight enhancement of these necessary conditions.

As the problem size becomes large, it will inevitably suffer from the communication bottleneck since each node that exchanges messages potentially transmits large amounts of information to its neighbors. To handle the issue, we design an online stochastic gradient algorithm with compressed communication when the knowledge of the gradient is available. We obtain the regret bounds for both nonconvex and convex cost functions, which can reach almost the same order of classic distributed optimization algorithms with exact communication. To resolve the scenario when the information of gradients is not accessible, a bandit version of the previous algorithm is then proposed. Explicit regret bounds of the bandit algorithm are also established for both nonconvex and convex cost functions. The result reveals that the performance of the bandit-feedback method is almost close to that of the gradient-feedback method. Several numerical experiments corroborate the main theoretical findings obtained in this article and exemplify a remarkable speedup when compared to existing distributed algorithms with exact communication.},

Theoretical insights into these algorithms can often be acquired from analyzing those of linear quadratic control. However, most of the existing literature only considers the optimization landscape for static full-state or output feedback policies (controllers). In this article, we investigate the more challenging case of dynamic output-feedback policies for linear quadratic regulation (abbreviated as dLQR ), which is prevalent in practice but has a rather complicated optimization landscape. We first show how the dLQR cost varies with the coordinate transformation of the dynamic controller, and then, derive the optimal transformation for a given observable stabilizing controller. One of our core results is the uniqueness of the stationary point of dLQR when it is observable, which provides an optimality certificate for solving dynamic controllers using policy gradient methods. Moreover, we establish conditions under which dLQR and linear quadratic Gaussian control are equivalent, thus providing a unified viewpoint of optimal control of both deterministic and stochastic linear systems. These results further shed light on designing policy gradient algorithms for more general decision-making problems with partially observed information.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the stability problem for event-triggered nonlinear control systems is addressed in the presence of stochastic denial of service attacks on the communication network. Dynamic event-triggered control and periodic event-triggered control are considered under the stochastic attacks. The stochastic attacks are modeled by a stochastic hybrid timer and a logic variable which is used to identify whether the network is attacked or not. Then, the entire closed-loop system can be modeled into the framework of stochastic hybrid systems. Uniform global asymptotic stability in probability is concluded for the resulting stochastic system by proving that the equilibrium set is uniformly globally stable in probability and each neighborhood of the equilibrium set is uniformly globally recurrent. A nonlinear system example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the robust cooperative output regulation problem for multiagent systems (MASs) with general heterodirectional hyperbolic PIDE–ODE agents is considered. This setup also covers networks of ODEs with arbitrarily long input and output delays. The output of the agents can be defined at all boundaries and in-domain and may depend on the ODE state while disturbances act on the agents in-domain, at the boundaries, the output, and the ODE. The communication network is described by a constant digraph and if its Laplacian is reducible, then heterogeneous agents are permitted also in the nominal case. The solution is based on the cooperative internal model principle, which requires to include a diffusively driven internal model in the controller. The corresponding state feedback regulator design starts with a local backstepping stabilization of the coupled hyperbolic PIDE–ODE systems. It is shown that the remaining simultaneous stabilization of the MAS can be traced back to the simultaneous stabilization of the finite-dimensional cooperative internal model. Solvability conditions in terms of the network topology and the agents&#39; transfer behavior are presented. The new design method is applied to the formation control of a platoon of uncertain heavy ropes carrying loads to verify its applicability. Simulations confirm the synchronization performance achieved by the resulting networked controller.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized optimization is gaining increased traction due to its widespread applications in large-scale machine learning and multiagent systems. The same mechanism that enables its success, i.e., information sharing among participating agents, however, also leads to the disclosure of individual agents&#39; private information, which is unacceptable when sensitive data are involved. As differential privacy is becoming a de facto standard for privacy preservation, recently results have emerged integrating differential privacy with distributed optimization. However, directly incorporating differential privacy design in existing distributed optimization approaches significantly compromises optimization accuracy. In this article, we propose to redesign and tailor gradient methods for differentially private distributed optimization, and propose two differential-privacy oriented gradient methods that can ensure both rigorous $\epsilon$ -differential privacy and optimality. The first algorithm is based on static-consensus-based gradient methods, and the second algorithm is based on dynamic-consensus (gradient-tracking) based distributed optimization methods and, hence, is applicable to general directed interaction graph topologies. Both algorithms can simultaneously ensure almost sure convergence to an optimal solution and a finite privacy budget, even when the number of iterations goes to infinity. To the best of authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first time that both goals are achieved simultaneously. Numerical simulations using a distributed estimation problem and experimental results on a benchmark dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

In this setup, the two-level system in the cavity can work as a photon source, and the photon emitted into the waveguide can reinteract with the cavity-QED system many times after the transmission and reflection in the waveguide, during which the feedback can tune the number of the photons in and out of the cavity. We analyze the dynamics of two-photon processes in this coherent feedback network in two scenarios: the continuous mode coupling scheme and the discrete periodic mode coupling scheme between the waveguide and cavity. The difference of these coupling schemes is due to their relative scales and the number of semitransparent mirrors for coupling. Specifically, in the continuous mode coupling scheme, the generation of two-photon states is influenced by the length of the feedback loop by the waveguide and the coupling strength between the waveguide and the cavity-QED system. By tuning the length of the waveguide and the coupling strength, we are able to generate two-photon states efficiently. In the discrete periodic mode coupling scheme, the Rabi oscillation in the cavity can be stabilized and there are no notable two-photon states in the waveguide.},

Since it is well known that this problem is generically NP-hard, several relaxations have been proposed in the literature. However, while these approaches work well for low-dimensional systems with few subsystems, they scale poorly with both the number of subsystems and their memory. To address this difficulty, we propose a computationally efficient alternative, based on embedding the data in the manifold of positive semidefinite matrices, and using a manifold metric there to perform the identification. Our main result shows that, under dwell-time assumptions, the proposed algorithm is convergent, in the sense that it is guaranteed to identify the system for suitably low noise. In scenarios with larger noise levels, we provide experimental results showing that the proposed method outperforms existing ones. This article concludes by illustrating these results with academic examples and a nontrivial application: action video segmentation.},

The latter is addressed by resorting to the Lagrange duality theory, which allows to prove the existence of solutions. Finally, a numerical algorithm to solve the dual problem is presented.

Data-based tests are then developed to analyze whether the unknown system is stable, or to verify whether a stabilizing dynamic feedback controller exists. If so, stabilizing controllers are computed using the data. In order to do this, we employ the behavioral approach to systems and control, meaning a departure from existing methods in data driven control. Our results heavily rely on a characterization of asymptotic stability of systems in AR form using the notion of quadratic difference form as a natural framework for Lyapunov functions of autonomous AR systems. We introduce the concepts of informative data for quadratic stability and quadratic stabilization in the context of input–output AR systems and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties to hold.

  abstract     = {This article presents a method of efficiently computing inner and outer approximations of forward reachable sets for nonlinear control systems with changed dynamics and control authority, given an a priori computed reachable set for the nominal system. The method functions by shrinking or inflating a precomputed reachable set based on prior knowledge of the system&#39;s trajectory deviation growth dynamics, depending on whether an inner approximation or outer approximation is desired. These dynamics determine an upper bound on the minimal deviation between two trajectories emanating from the same point that are generated by control inputs from the nominal and diminished set of control inputs, respectively. The dynamics depend on the given Hausdorff distance bound between the nominal set of admissible controls and the possibly unknown impaired space of admissible controls. Because of its computational efficiency compared to direct computation of the off-nominal reachable set, this procedure can be applied to on-board fault-tolerant path planning and failure recovery. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not require convexity of the reachable sets unlike our previous work, thereby making it suitable for general use. We raise a number of implementational considerations for our algorithm, and we present three illustrative examples, namely, an application to the heading dynamics of a ship, a lower triangular dynamical system, and a system of coupled linear subsystems.},

The main contribution of this article is to introduce a stochastic optimal control problem as a dual to the nonlinear filtering problem. The mathematical statement of the dual relationship between the two problems is given in the form of a duality principle. The constraint for the optimal control problem is the backward stochastic differential equation introduced in the companion paper. The optimal control solution is obtained from an application of the maximum principle, and subsequently used to derive the equation of the nonlinear filter. The proposed duality is shown to be an exact extension of the classical Kalman–Bucy duality, and different from other types of optimal control and variational formulations given in literature.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the development and use of duality theory for a hidden Markov model (HMM) with white noise observations. The main contribution of this work is to introduce a backward stochastic differential equation as a dual control system. A key outcome is that stochastic observability (resp. detectability) of the HMM is expressed in dual terms: as controllability (resp. stabilizability) of the dual control system. All aspects of controllability, namely, definition of controllable space and controllability gramian, along with their properties and explicit formulas, are discussed. The proposed duality is shown to be an exact extension of the classical duality in linear systems theory. One can then relate and compare the linear and the nonlinear systems. A side-by-side summary of this relationship is given in a tabular form (Table II).},

We focus first on quadratic problems with a time-varying linear term, and use digital control tools (a robust internal model principle) to propose a novel online algorithm that can achieve zero tracking error by modeling the cost with a dynamical system. We prove the convergence of the algorithm for both strongly convex and convex problems. We further discuss the sensitivity of the proposed method to model uncertainties and quantify its performance. We discuss how the proposed algorithm can be applied to general (nonquadratic) problems using an approximate model of the cost, and analyze the convergence leveraging the small gain theorem. We present numerical results that showcase the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over previous methods for both quadratic and nonquadratic problems.},

  abstract     = {Online optimization has recently opened avenues to study optimal control for time-varying cost functions that are unknown in advance. Inspired by this line of research, we study the distributed online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with unknown dynamics. Consider a multiagent network where each agent is modeled as an LTI system. The network has a global time-varying quadratic cost, which may evolve adversarially and is only partially observed by each agent sequentially. The goal of the network is to collectively 1) estimate the unknown dynamics and 2) compute local control sequences competitive to the best centralized policy in hindsight, which minimizes the sum of network costs over time. This problem is formulated as a regret minimization. We propose a distributed variant of the online LQR algorithm, where agents compute their system estimates during an exploration stage. Each agent then applies distributed online gradient descent on a semidefinite programming whose feasible set is based on the agent system estimate. We prove that with high probability, the regret bound of our proposed algorithm scales as $O(T^{2/3}\log T)$ , implying the consensus of all agents over time. We also provide simulation results verifying our theoretical guarantee.},

The main contribution of this article is to propose a control strategy such that each vehicle in a leaderless platoon keeps a desired distance from its preceding vehicle, determined based on the constant time-gap spacing policy, and simultaneously, all the vehicles reach consensus upon their speeds. Moreover, whereas each vehicle needs access to the information of some neighboring vehicles (via a communication network) to achieve speed consensus, we assume that it has access to the relative distance of just one possible preceding vehicle (using a radar/lidar).

By employing the Lyapunov function method, we prove that the exponential convergence of the proposed boundary observer design scheme is guaranteed when the observer gains satisfy a set of matrix inequality conditions.

Interestingly, the proposed recursive PI algorithm is new in the present context of continuous-time time-delay systems, even when the model knowledge is assumed known.

The proposed design methodology is based on a discontinuous transformation of the perturbed nonholonomic system to which an adaptive multiple-surface sliding mode technique is applied. The generation of a sliding mode allows to eliminate the effect of matched uncertainties, while a suitable function approximation technique enables to deal with the residual uncertainties, which are unmatched. The control problem is solved by choosing a particular sliding manifold upon which a second-order sliding mode is enforced via a continuous control with discontinuous derivative. A positive feature of the present proposal, apart from the fact of being capable of dealing with the presence of both matched and unmatched uncertainties, is that no knowledge of the bounds of the unmatched uncertainty terms is required. Moreover, the fact of producing a continuous control makes the proposed approach particularly appropriate in nonholonomic applications, such as those of mechanical nature.},

First, the existing results only apply to static, connected, and undirected graphs while the result of this article applies to jointly strongly connected switching graphs, which can be disconnected at every time instant. Second, the existing results are asymptotic or ultimately uniformly bounded, while our result guarantees the exponential convergence when the exosystem is known.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose novel sufficient conditions for verifying reach-avoid properties of continuous-time systems modeled by ordinary differential equations. Given a system, an initial set, a safe set, and a target set of states, we say that the reach-avoid property holds if, for all initial conditions in the initial set, any trajectory of the system starting at them will eventually, i.e., in unbounded yet finite time, enter the target set while remaining inside the safe set until that first target hit (that is, if the system starting from the initial set can reach the target set safely). Based on a discount value function, two sets of quantified constraints are derived for verifying the reach-avoid property via the computation of exponential/asymptotic guidance-barrier functions (they form a barrier escorting the system to the target set safely at an exponential or asymptotic rate). It is interesting to find that one set of constraints whose solution is termed exponential guidance-barrier functions is just a simplified version of the existing one derived from the moment based method, while the other one whose solution is termed asymptotic guidance-barrier functions is completely new. Furthermore, built upon this new set of constraints, we derive a set of more expressive constraints, which includes the aforementioned two sets of constraints as special instances, providing more chances for verifying the reach-avoid property successfully. Finally, several examples demonstrate the theoretical developments and performance of proposed sufficient conditions using semidefinite programming methods.},

As a key system characterization, the relative degrees are directly defined for noncanonical nonlinear time-varying systems, and at the same time, the necessary time-varying parameter conditions are specifically derived for different system dynamics. Then, robust adaptive feedback linearization-based control designs are studied for noncanonical nonlinear systems with time-varying dynamics under different relative degree conditions. The designs ensure that all closed-loop system signals are bounded and the output tracking error is small in the mean.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the distributed output feedback leader–following consensus problem for high-order nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with time delays and disturbances under the directed network. Using sampled relative outputs to neighbors and the discrete control input, the continuous-discrete time compensator is constructed in each agent to compensate for the consensus errors, where the sampling time instants can be asynchronous and aperiodic without exceeding an explicit upper bound of sampling intervals. Based on the compensator, we propose a codesign algorithm for constructing the dynamic event-triggered protocol with a corresponding event-triggering mechanism, which is a combination of discrete-time control input, continuous dynamic variables of each agent&#39;s own compensator, and a given threshold. The proposed methods cannot only achieve consensus tracking under the effects of time delays in states and communications but also implement the discrete-time execution of measurement, communication, and control. Based on the novel lemmas, it is proved that the resulting closed-loop consensus error system is globally stable. Finally, a simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a distributionally robust stochastic model predictive control (DR-SMPC) algorithm to address the problem of multiple two-sided chance constrained discrete-time linear systems corrupted by additive noise. The prevalent mechanism to cope with two-sided chance constraints is the so-called risk allocation approach, which conservatively approximates the two-sided chance constraints with two single chance constraints by applying Bool&#39;s inequality. In this proposed DR-SMPC framework, an exact second-order cone approach is adopted to abstract the multiple two-sided chance constraints by considering the first and second moments of the noise. With the proposed DR-SMPC algorithm, the worst-case probability of violating safety constraints is guaranteed to be within a prespecified maximum value. By flexibly adjusting this prespecified maximum probability, the feasible region of the initial state can be increased for the SMPC problem. The recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed DR-SMPC are rigorously established by introducing a binary initialization strategy for the nominal state. A simulation study of a single spring and double mass system was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DR-SMPC algorithm.},

Data-based probabilistic safe controllers are designed for the cases where the noise pdf is 1) zero-mean Gaussian with a known covariance, 2) zero-mean Gaussian with an uncertain covariance, and 3) zero-mean non-Gaussian with an unknown distribution. Easy-to-check-model-based conditions for guaranteeing probabilistic safety are provided for the first case by introducing probabilistic $\lambda$ -contractive sets. These results are then extended to the second and third cases by leveraging distributionally-robust probabilistic safe control and conditional-value-at-risk-based probabilistic safe control, respectively. Data-based implementations of these probabilistic safe controllers are then considered. Moreover, an upper bound on the minimal risk level, under which the existence of a safe controller is guaranteed, is learned using collected data.

The reputation is then used to weigh the neighbors&#39; values in the update of its state. Under mild assumptions, we show that: 1) the proposed method converges exponentially to the consensus of the regular agents; 2) if a regular agent identifies a neighbor as an attacked node, then it is indeed an attacked node; 3) if the consensus value of the normal nodes differs from that of any of the attacked nodes&#39; values, then the reputation that a regular agent assigns to the attacked neighbors goes to zero. Further, we extend our method to achieve resilience in scenarios where there are noisy nodes, dynamic networks, and stochastic node selection. Finally, we illustrate our algorithm with several examples, delineating some attacks that can be dealt with by the current proposal but not by the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Next, we derive the optimal value of the MCP with forbidden nodes. The optimal value is determined by an optimal solution for constrained maximum matching, and this result includes that of the standard MCP in the previous work.

The service provider is adversarial in the sense that it can infer the users&#39; private information based on the shared useful information. To minimize the privacy leakage while maintaining a desired level of utility, the users carefully perturb the useful information via a probabilistic privacy mapping before sharing it. We focus on the setting in which the adversary attempting an inference attack on the users&#39; privacy has biased information about the statistical correlation between the private and useful variables. This information asymmetry between the users and the limited adversary is shown to lead to better privacy guarantees. We first identify assumptions on the adversary&#39;s information so that the inference costs are well-defined. Then, we characterize the impact of the information asymmetry and show that it increases the inference costs for the adversary. We further formulate the design of the privacy mapping against a limited adversary as a difference of convex functions program and solve it via the concave–convex procedure. When the adversary&#39;s information is not precisely available, we adopt a Bayesian view and represent the adversary&#39;s information by a probability distribution. In this case, the expected cost for the adversary does not admit a closed-form expression, and we establish and maximize a lower bound of it.

Since the actual system state and the quantized state may not always be in the same operating region due to quantization-induced uncertainties, the operating modes of the PWA system and the controller that depends on the quantized states may be asynchronous. Aiming at reducing the computational cost and the conservatism of the results, a mapping region-based algorithm is first proposed to determine the reachable dwelling regions for the quantized state. By using a convex combination model to approximate the quantization-induced uncertainties, a novel piecewise Lyapunov function taking into consideration the uncertainties is then proposed. It is shown that with the newly proposed Lyapunov function, the desired asynchronous controller can be obtained and the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. A simulated chemical reactor example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed asynchronous control approach.},

  abstract     = {This note presents a reformed state-estimator-based adaptive control strategy for uncertain delayed semi-Markovian jump systems (DSMJS) via sliding-mode technique. In comparison to most literature results requiring exact prior knowledge of system time delay, a linear state estimator not linking any control inputs is developed to cope with the case with unknown state delays. By virtue of the acquired state estimation, the establishment of both a new switching surface of linear-type (SSL) and the involved adaptive controller is provided, and the devised controller could not only admit the assigned SSL&#39;s reachability in limited time but also operate on the DSMJS as desired despite the hidden actuator failures and unknowable time delays. Also, a new sufficient stochastic stability criterion serving as a crucial solution to the control parameters of the resultant plant is inferred. The method also holds in a similar fashion for uncertain plants with no time delays and/or no switching case. Eventually, the raised method is verified by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Fictitious play is a popular learning algorithm in which players that utilize the history of actions played by the players and the knowledge of their own payoff matrix can converge to the Nash equilibrium under certain conditions on the game. We consider the presence of an intelligent player that has access to the entire payoff matrix for the game. We show that by not conforming to fictitious play, such a player can achieve a better payoff than the one at the Nash Equilibrium. This result can be viewed both as a fragility of the fictitious play algorithm to a strategic intelligent player and an indication that players should not throw away additional information they may have, as suggested by classical fictitious play.},

  abstract     = {Information design in an incomplete information game involves a designer that aims to influence players&#39; actions through signals generated from a designed probability distribution to optimize its objective function. For quadratic design objective functions, if the players have quadratic payoffs that depend on the players&#39; actions and an unknown payoff-relevant state, and signals on the state that follow a Gaussian distribution conditional on the state realization, the information design problem is a semidefinite program (SDP) (Ui, 2020). In this note, we seek to characterize the optimal information design analytically by leveraging the SDP formulation, when the design objective is to maximize social welfare or the agreement among players&#39; action. We show that full information disclosure maximizes social welfare when there is a common payoff state, the payoff dependencies among players&#39; actions are homogeneous, or when the signals are public. When the objective is to maximize the agreement among players&#39; actions, not revealing any information is optimal. When the objective is a weighted combination of social welfare and agreement terms, we establish a threshold weight below which full information disclosure is optimal under public signals for games with homogeneous payoffs. Numerical results corroborate the analytical results, and identify partial information disclosure structures that are optimal.},

  abstract     = {The Bellman operator constitutes the foundation of dynamic programming (DP). An alternative is presented by the Gauss–Seidel operator, whose evaluation, differently from that of the Bellman operator where the states are all processed at once, updates one state at a time while incorporating into the computation the interim results. The provably better convergence rate of DP methods based on the Gauss–Seidel operator comes at the price of an inherent sequentiality, which prevents the exploitation of modern multicore systems. In this work, we propose a new operator for DP, namely, the mini-batch Bellman operator , which aims at realizing the tradeoff between the better convergence rate of the methods based on the Gauss–Seidel operator and the parallelization capability offered by the Bellman operator. After the introduction of the new operator, a theoretical analysis for validating its fundamental properties is conducted. Such properties allow one to successfully deploy the new operator in the main DP schemes, such as value iteration and modified policy iteration. We compare the convergence of the DP algorithm based on the new operator with its earlier counterparts, shedding light on the algorithmic advantages of the new formulation and the impact of the batch-size parameter on the convergence. Finally, an extensive numerical evaluation of the newly introduced operator is conducted. In accordance with the theoretical derivations, the numerical results show the competitive performance of the proposed operator and its superior flexibility, which allows one to adapt the efficiency of its iterations to different structures of MDPs and hardware setups.},

First, the optimization is further performed by considering a class of upper bounds and minimizing the traces of these bounds in two stages (in terms of a gain matrix and then with respect to a scalar parameter). Second, this article provides conditions under which the optimal trace value is controlled, and hence, the proposed algorithm in the work by Lu et al. (2019), namely the optimal upper bound interval Kalman filter (OUBIKF), is ensured to perform with stability (i.e., without width explosion of the resulting interval estimators). Also under these conditions, the OUBIKF algorithm, having a similar structure of the standard Kalman filter, is ensured to get a smaller trace upper bound of the covariance matrices in the correction step than the one in the prediction step.

During the past decades, great efforts have been devoted to improving the transient performance and robustness of the system, which are very crucial in plenty of application scenarios. To motivate corresponding research, an online trajectory planning method is proposed for a class of underactuated mechanical systems in this article. Specifically, reference trajectories are first generated for actuated states. Based on that, appropriate online adjustments are made to these reference trajectories, so as to realize efficient stabilization of the unactuated states. Different from traditional offline planning methods, the proposed one utilizes real-time feedback to counteract various unfavorable conditions, which endows it stronger robustness and better transient performance. Rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is performed to show that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable around the desired equilibrium point. Finally, the proposed method is applied to two underactuated mechanical systems, with simulation/experiment results provided to demonstrate its superior performance.},

Low-complexity PPC is a control methodology whose strongest feature is its adaptation-free structural simplicity: uncertainty can be handled without estimation of unknown parameters nor approximation structures (neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, etc.) being involved in the control design. While the state of the art has focused on strict- and pure-feedback MASs, i.e., dynamics including a chain of integrators with powers equal to one: in this note, we show that the same low-complexity can be retained for more general integrator dynamics (with positive-odd-integer powers). To this purpose, several new technical tools are proposed to handle the challenges caused by the presence of high powers in the integrators both in leader and follower agents.

This work incorporates the practical inexact policy evaluation into a simultaneous policy update paradigm to reach the Nash equilibrium of the nonlinear zero-sum games. In the proposed algorithm, the restriction of precise policy evaluation is removed by bounded evaluation error characterized by Hamiltonian without sacrificing convergence guarantees. By exploiting Fréchet differential, the practical iterative process of value function with estimation error is converted into the Newton&#39;s method with variable steps, which are inversely proportional to evaluation errors. Accordingly, we construct a monotone scalar sequence that shares the same Newton&#39;s method with the value sequence to bound the error of the value function, which enjoys an exponential convergence rate. Numerical results show its convergence in affine systems, and the potential to cope with general nonlinear plants.},

Although it is desirable to obtain exact parameter estimation, most adaptive schemes need the persistency of excitation (PE) condition on the regressor to be satisfied. In the recent years, the so-called dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure was developed to provide an alternative in the design of adaptive laws with conditions different from PE. When met, the improvement in parameter estimation is remarkable, but when not, adaptation can simply stop, which might be unacceptable for control purposes. This article proposes for the first time a composite scheme, which combines the standard gradient adaptive law with a DREM-based additional term with the following properties: 1) Trajectory tracking for joint desired positions and velocities is guaranteed; 2) in the absence of PE, if a new condition that can partially be verified online for the additional DREM-based term is matched, then exact parameter estimation takes place in finite time. Simulation results are in good accordance with the developed theory.},

Given an autonomous system and a prescribed set of input links, where each input link has a nonnegative cost, the problems include selecting the minimum cost of input links and selecting the input links with the smallest possible cost while bounding their cardinality to achieve system structural controllability. Current studies show that in the dedicated input case, the former problem is polynomially solvable by some graph-theoretic algorithms, while the general nontrivial constrained case is largely unexplored. We show that these problems can be formulated as equivalent integer linear programming (ILP) problems. Subject to the “source strongly connected component grouped input constraint,” which contains the dedicated input one as a special case, we demonstrate that the constraint matrices of these ILPs are totally unimodular . This property allows us to solve these ILPs efficiently via their linear programming (LP) relaxations, leading to a unifying algebraic method for these problems with polynomial time complexity. We further show that these problems can be solved in strongly polynomial time, independent of the size of the costs and cardinality bounds. Finally, we provide an example to illustrate the power of the proposed method.},

Standard POMDP techniques are shown to offer bounded-error solutions to these entropy-regularized POMDPs, with exact solutions possible when the regularization involves the joint entropy of the state, observation, and control trajectories.

The existing distributed optimization algorithms (DOAs) cannot be directly applied to DOPs over the time-varying network with communication delays. In this article, by adding new virtual agents and redefining communication links, some delay properties are realized and existing DOAs can then be reused to solve the DOPs. Thus, a generic algorithm framework is established, which can apply to many important DOAs, such as the mirror descent algorithm and dual averaging algorithm, to solve DOPs over the time-varying network with communication delays. The convergence results of the DOAs are established and verified under the generic algorithm framework.},

Under the assumptions of static and undirected communication topologies, and smooth and bounded delays, we propose a distributed smooth, time-varying control law which achieves the goal of acquiring a global formation pattern in a common consensus point for both position and orientation. The controller is a combination of a simple proportional-plus-damping (PD) scheme and a simple globally exponentially convergent velocity observer. Consensus is reached independently of all initial conditions.

Note that the existing related results only meet one or two demands at most, which are essentially not applicable to this problem. In this article, a novel dynamic triggering condition is first presented, which is independent of the relative information among neighboring agents, providing potential opportunities to conquer the difficulties caused by the interaction of the aforementioned three demands. Based on the proposed triggering condition, a framework on fully distributed adaptive consensus protocol with discrete communication and control updating is established. The thorough analysis of the adaptive gain is made by introducing a virtual adaptive gain to generate the Lyapunov function candidate, which significantly facilitates the consensus verification. Finally, numerical examples and comparisons are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive dynamic event-triggered protocols.},

The resulting protocol-induced communication graph become time-varying and even disconnected, even though the original graph is assumed to be strongly connected. The aim of the addressed problem is to develop a distributed algorithm in the partial-decision information setting such the convergence of NE can be guaranteed under the $B$ -strong connectivity of graphs and the row-stochasticity of weighted adjacency matrix. The sufficient condition on the convergence of the NE is derived for the algorithm with diminishing step-sizes. Some discussions are provided on convergence rate of the proposed algorithm.

In particular, the $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ -norm of bilinear systems is known to capture robustness and performance properties analogous to its linear counterpart and provide valuable insights for identifying which edges are most sensitive to attacks. The exact optimization problem is combinatorial in the number of edges, and brute-force approaches show poor scalability. However, we show that the $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ -norm as a cost function is supermodular and, therefore, allows for efficient greedy approximations of the optimal solution.

Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve a sublinear expected regret bound while preserving the privacy of uncorrupted players. We use the Kullback–Leibler divergence to analyze the privacy bound in a statistical sense. Furthermore, we present a tradeoff between the expected regret and the statistical privacy, to obtain a constant privacy bound when the regret bound is sublinear.},

To simplify the complexities arising from the time-varying TPs in the Markov chain, the TPs in this study are reasonably considered to be finite piecewise-homogeneous. The variations of TPs are stochastic and governed by a higher level transition probability (HTP) matrix. It is acceptable for both the TP matrix and HTP matrix to be partly unknown, which makes the system closer to reality and more complex to investigate. In this context, our goal lies in constructing a common sliding-mode surface to avoid the effects of switching among sequential subsystems and piecewise homogeneous TPs on the convergence of the sliding-mode surface. Additionally, we aim to design an appropriate SMC law to guarantee the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode in a finite-time interval. Through the linear matrix inequalities, sufficient criteria are offered to make the closed-loop dynamic system stochastically admissible. Finally, the numerical result will show that the presented SMC strategy is valid.},

This article considers the finite dimensional estimation algebras derived from a nonlinear filtering system with state dimension n, linear rank n-1, and constant Wong matrix. Related theories of the underdetermined partial differential equations and the Euler operator are applied to classify the estimation algebras. It is proved that the Mitter conjecture holds and the dimension of the finite dimensional estimation algebras must be 2n or 2n+1 with the abovementioned conditions. Therefore, we can construct the explicit solution of filtering systems by Wei–Norman approach. This result is of great significance because it is the first classification of nonmaximal rank finite dimensional estimation algebras with arbitrary state dimension.},

Our condition connects some of the properties of the system with those of its proper part.

Under the assumption that each node-specific function is smooth and strongly convex, we show that the FRSD iterate sequence converges with a linear rate to the optimal consensus solution. In contrast to the existing methods for directed networks, FRSD enjoys linear convergence without employing a gradient tracking (GT) technique explicitly, rather it implements GT implicitly with the use of a novel momentum term, which leads to a significant reduction in communication and storage overhead for each node when FRSD is implemented for solving high-dimensional problems over small-to-medium scale networks.

It is seen that the proposed matrix pencil-based approach greatly reduces design conservatism and algebraic complexity compared with prior results on dynamic high-gain scaling-based control designs.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the problem of controlling the group behavior of a large number of dynamic systems that are constantly interacting with each other. These systems are assumed to have identical dynamics (e.g., flocks of birds, UAV swarms) and their group behavior can be modeled by a distribution. Thus, this problem can be viewed as an optimal control problem over the space of distributions. We propose a novel algorithm to compute a feedback control strategy so that, when adopted by the agents, the distribution of them would be transformed from an initial one to a target one over a finite-time window. Our method is built on the optimal transport theory but differs significantly from existing work in this area in that our method models the interactions among agents explicitly. From an algorithmic point of view, our algorithm is based on the generalized proximal gradient descent algorithm and has a convergence guarantee with a sublinear rate. We further extend our framework to account for the scenarios where the agents are from multiple species. In the linear quadratic setting, the solution is characterized by a system of coupled Riccati equations, which can be solved in closed form. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate our framework.},

With our method, each agent solves for its control inputs without solving for the control inputs of other agents, allowing for efficient optimization by each agent, unlike some other distributed methods. Furthermore, our method attains the linear convergence to the optimal control inputs in convex model predictive control problems, improving upon the sublinear convergence rates provided by some other distributed methods such as dual decomposition methods. Moreover, our algorithm provides a closed-loop controller for convex model predictive control problems with affine constraints.

Then, we propose a set-based approach, which exploits a new iterative scheme over hybrid state sets of the product system, to compute the maximal HCI set. To ensure the termination of the iterative scheme within a finite number of steps, we propose two alternative approaches to compute approximations of the maximal HCI set.

Such models are interesting since they may arise through the use of modern machine learning methods for system identification, or as closed-loop solutions in certain classes of model predictive control (MPC) problems. A key idea in the proposed approach is to use piecewise affine Lyapunov functions parametrized as ReLU NNs, and similarly parameterized controllers. This compatible representation between the Lyapunov function and the dynamics simplifies the automation of analysis of and controller synthesis for learned models. Our method of verifying a candidate Lyapunov function is faster than methods based on mixed integer programming. We “learn” controllers and Lyapunov functions using both weight updates and network architecture search, without gradients. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on examples involving learned models, explicit MPC controllers, and constrained controller synthesis.},

The main contribution is that several computationally efficient procedures are presented to reduce the number of controlled nodes and to determine a minimal set of controlled nodes without using the brute-force searches. The primary objective is to identify a minimal set of nodes that need to be controlled in the structural controllers for the strong structural stabilization of BNs when network structures is available yet nodal dynamics are unknown. To this end, a theorem shows this minimum controlled node problem can be addressed by seeking the minimum feedback vertex set of network structure. The subsequent part concentrates on designing distributed pinning controllers that merely rely on the node-to-node information exchanges for the global stabilization of BNs with the full knowledge of the nodal dynamics. Several sufficient conditions are provided by utilizing the irreducibility and activation–inhibition network structures to reduce the conservatism. Notably, we claim that, for regulatory BNs without positive cycles, the minimal set of pinned nodes can be determined with a linear amount of time subject to the total number of logical operators in the nodal dynamics. Finally, the effectiveness of these results are validated by three case studies.},

In this setting, upon the occurrence of each event, the sensor reading may be nondeterministic due to measurement noises or possible sensor failures. Existing works on this topic mainly consider specific types of unreliable sensors such as the cases of intermittent sensors failures, permanent sensor failures or their combinations. In this work, we propose a novel uniform framework for diagnosability of DES subject to, not only sensor failures, but also a very general class of unreliable sensors. Our approach is to use linear temporal logic (LTL) with semantics on infinite traces to describe the possible behaviors of the sensors. A new notion of $\varphi$ -diagnosability is proposed as the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a diagnoser, when the behaviors of sensors satisfy the LTL formula $\varphi$ . An effective approach is provided to verify this notion. We show that, our new notion of $\varphi$ -diagnosability subsumes all existing notions of robust diagnosability of DES subject to sensor failures. Furthermore, the proposed framework is user-friendly and flexible since it supports an arbitrary user-defined unreliable sensor type based on the specific scenario of the application. As examples, we provide two new notions of diagnosability, which have never been investigated in the literature, using our uniform framework.},

For a linear feedback law to be feasible for a self-powered control system, its feedback signal must be colocated with the control inputs, and its input–output mapping must satisfy an associated passivity constraint. The imposition of such a feedback law can be viewed equivalently as the imposition of a linear passive shunt admittance at the actuation ports of the plant. In this article, we consider the use of actively-controlled electronics to impose a self-powered linear feedback law. To be feasible, it is insufficient that the imposed admittance be passive, because parasitic losses must additionally be overcome. We derive sufficient feasibility conditions, which explicitly account for these losses. In the finite-dimensional, time-invariant case, the feasibility condition distills to a more conservative version of the positive-real lemma, which is parametrized by various loss parameters. Three examples are given, in which this condition is used to determine the least-efficient loss parameters necessary to realize a desired feedback law.},

To solve this problem, we propose an asynchronous penalized proximal gradient (Asyn-PPG) algorithm, a variant of classical proximal gradient method, with the presence of the asynchronous updates of the agents and uniform communication delays in the network. Specifically, we consider a slot-based asynchronous network, where the whole time domain is split into sequential time slots and each agent is permitted to execute multiple updates during a slot by accessing the historical state information of the agents. By the Asyn-PPG algorithm, an explicit convergence rate can be guaranteed based on deterministic analysis.

In this article, we consider the problem of designing policies for MDPs and POMDPs with objectives and constraints in terms of dynamic coherent risk measures rather than the traditional total expectation, which we refer to as the constrained risk-averse problem . Our contributions can be described as follows: first, for MDPs, under some mild assumptions, we propose an optimization-based method to synthesize Markovian policies. We then demonstrate that such policies can be found by solving difference convex programs (DCPs). We show that our formulation generalize linear programs for constrained MDPs with total discounted expected costs and constraints; second, for POMDPs, we show that, if the coherent risk measures can be defined as a Markov risk transition mapping, an infinite-dimensional optimization can be used to design Markovian belief-based policies. For POMDPs with stochastic finite-state controllers (FSCs), we show that the latter optimization simplifies to a (finite dimensional) DCP. We incorporate these DCPs in a policy iteration algorithm to design risk-averse FSCs for POMDPs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method with numerical experiments involving conditional-value-at-risk and entropic-value-at-risk risk measures.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the discrete-time stochastic optimal control problems with recursive utilities under weakened convexity assumption. A new stochastic maximum principle is established. Moreover, by constructing two new adjoint equations and two new variational equations for the backward stochastic difference equation, we obtain the second-order necessary optimality condition of quasi-singular control. Finally, as an illustration, a discrete-time mean-variance portfolio selection mixed with a recursive utility functional optimization problem is solved.},

  abstract     = {It is shown that strong convexity/concavity of a component of the vector field, as a function of the state variables, induces the same property on the corresponding component of the flow , as a function of the initial condition. Such an inherited property is then instrumental, for instance, for establishing several instability theorems, the proofs of which rely precisely on consequences of convexity/concavity of the flow with respect to the initial condition. Furthermore, the property of convexity/concavity permits the construction of a canonical Chetaev function to certify instability without explicitly resorting to the computation of the flow. Finally, necessary conditions for continuous stabilizability are derived, hence putting the properties of convexity/concavity of the vector field in relation to the well-known Brockett&#39;s theorem.},

  abstract     = {Control barrier function quadratic programs (QP) safety filters are pointwise minimizers of the control effort at a given state, i.e., myopically optimal at each time. But are they optimal over the entire infinite time horizon? What does it mean for a controlled system to be “optimally safe” as opposed to, conventionally “optimally stable?” When disturbances, deterministic and stochastic, have unknown upper bounds, how should safety be defined to allow a graceful degradation under disturbances? Can safety filters be designed to guarantee such weaker safety properties as well as the optimality of safety over the infinite time horizon? We pose and answer these questions for general systems affine in control and disturbances and illustrate the answers using several examples. In the process, using the existing QP safety filters, as well as more general safety-ensuring feedbacks, we generate entire families of safety filters that are optimal over the infinite horizon although they are conservative (favoring safety over “liveness”) relative to the standard QP.},

  abstract     = {In the absence of persistency of excitation (PE), referring to adaptive control systems as “uniformly asymptotically stable” typically indicates insufficient understanding of stability concepts. While the state is indeed regulated to zero and the parameter estimate has some limit, namely, the overall state converges to some equilibrium, the equilibrium reached is not unique (and not even necessarily stable) but is dependent on the initial condition. The equilibrium set in the absence of PE is not uniformly attractive (from an open set containing the equilibrium set); hence, uniform asymptotic stability does not hold and KL estimates are unavailable for the full state. In this article, we pursue an adaptive control design with KL guarantees on the regulated state, something that is possible but previously unachieved with smooth, time-invariant and nonhybrid adaptive controllers. This property is referred to as uniform global asymptotic output stability, where the regulated state is thought of as a system output. We provide designs for systems with a matched uncertainty and systems in the parametric strict feedback form. We assume no a priori known bound for the parameters. To guarantee KL estimates in the absence of PE, our designs employ time-invariant nonlinear damping terms, which depend both on the state and the parameter estimate. With an example, we illustrate the theory.},
