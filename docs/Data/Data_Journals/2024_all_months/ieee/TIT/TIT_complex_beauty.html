  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of sequentially detecting a change in the joint distribution of multiple data sources under a sampling constraint. Specifically, the channels or sources generate observations that are independent over time, but not necessarily across channels. The joint distribution of an unknown subset of sources changes at an unknown time instant. Moreover, there is a hard constraint that only a fixed number of sources can be sampled at each time instant, but the sources can be selected dynamically based on the already collected data. The goal is to sequentially observe the sources according to the constraint, and stop sampling as quickly as possible after the change while controlling the false alarm rate below a user-specified level. Thus, a policy for this problem consists of a joint sampling and change-detection rule. A non-randomized policy is studied, and an upper bound is established on its worst-case conditional expected detection delay with respect to both the change point and the observations from the affected sources before the change. In certain cases, this rule achieves first-order asymptotic optimality as the false alarm rate tends to zero, simultaneously under every possible post-change distribution and among all schemes that satisfy the same sampling and false alarm constraints. These general results are subsequently applied to the problems of (i) detecting a change in the marginal distributions of (not necessarily independent) information sources, and (ii) detecting a change in the covariance structure of Gaussian information sources.},

  abstract     = {This work explores the fundamental problem of the recoverability of a sparse tensor being reconstructed from its compressed embodiment. We present a generalized model of block-sparse tensor recovery as a theoretical foundation, where concepts involving a holistic mutual incoherence property (MIP) of the measurement matrix set are defined. A representative algorithm based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) framework, called tensor generalized block OMP (T-GBOMP), is applied to the theoretical framework for analyzing both noiseless and noisy recovery conditions. Specifically, we present an exact recovery condition (ERC) and sufficient conditions for establishing it with consideration of different degrees of restriction. Reliable reconstruction conditions, in terms of the residual convergence, the estimated error and a signal-to-noise ratio bound, are established to reveal the computable theoretical interpretability based on the newly defined MIP. The flexibility of tensor recovery is highlighted, i.e., the reliable recovery can be guaranteed by optimizing the MIP of the measurement matrix set. Analytical comparisons demonstrate that the theoretical results developed are tighter and less restrictive than existing ones (if any). Further discussions provide tensor extensions for several classic greedy algorithms, indicating that the results derived are universal and applicable to all these tensorized variants.},

In this regard, an equivalent reformulation of the MLE problem is introduced, and two iterative algorithms are proposed for the optimization of the equivalent statistical learning framework. Both strategies are based on the Majorization Minimization (MM) paradigm and hence enjoy nice properties such as monotonicity and ensured convergence to a stationary point of the equivalent MLE problem. The proposed framework is also extended to deal with MLE of other practically relevant covariance structures, namely, the banded Toeplitz, block Toeplitz, and Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz. Through numerical simulations, it is shown that the new methods provide excellent performance levels in terms of both mean square estimation error (which is very close to the benchmark Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB)) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, especially in comparison with state-of-the art strategies. Moreover, the estimation task is accomplished with a remarkable reduction in computational complexity compared with a standard approach relying on a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) solver.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new performance bound for estimation problems where the parameter to estimate lies in a Riemannian manifold (a smooth manifold endowed with a Riemannian metric) and follows a given prior distribution. In this setup, the chosen Riemannian metric induces a geometry for the parameter manifold, as well as an intrinsic notion of the estimation error measure. Performance bounds for such error measure were previously obtained in the non-Bayesian case (when the unknown parameter is assumed to deterministic), and referred to as intrinsic Cramér-Rao bound. The presented result then appears either as: a) an extension of the intrinsic Cramér-Rao bound to the Bayesian estimation framework; b) a generalization of the Van-Trees inequality (Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound) that accounts for the aforementioned geometric structures. In a second part, we leverage this formalism to study the problem of covariance matrix estimation when the data follow a Gaussian distribution, and whose covariance matrix is drawn from an inverse Wishart distribution. Performance bounds for this problem are obtained for both the mean squared error (Euclidean metric) and the natural Riemannian distance for Hermitian positive definite matrices (affine invariant metric). Numerical simulation illustrate that assessing the error with the affine invariant metric is revealing of interesting properties of the maximum a posteriori and minimum mean square error estimator, which are not observed when using the Euclidean metric.},

Our focus is on the performance analysis of their two tightest convex relaxation based heuristics, the so-called $\ell _{1}$ and the nuclear norm ( $\ell _{1}^{*}$ ) minimizations. We examine two standard types of phase transitions (PTs): 1) general PT, obtained by enforcing sparsity as a fundamental form of structuring, and 2) nonnegative PT, achieved by imposing nonnegativity as an additional form of structuring alongside sparsity. We establish explicit relations between the CS and LRR PTs. Our analysis reveals that the nonnegative PT essentially interpolates between the general and the binary CS PT, in a manner that can be explicitly characterized. Quite surprisingly, although the phase transitions themselves admit fairly complicated mathematical formulations, their relations can be expressed in a very neat and elegant way. This ultimately allows to quickly assess and compare the effects additional presence/absence of the nonnegativity has on $\ell _{1}$ and $\ell _{1}^{*}$ .},

Binary sequences with large merit factor are important in digital communications because they allow the efficient separation of signals from noise. It is a longstanding open question whether the maximum merit factor is asymptotically unbounded and, if so, what is its limiting value. Attempts to answer this question over almost sixty years have identified certain classes of binary sequences as particularly important: skew-symmetric sequences, symmetric sequences, and anti-symmetric sequences. Using only elementary methods, we find an exact formula for the mean and variance of the reciprocal merit factor of sequences in each of these classes, and in the class of all binary sequences. This provides a much deeper understanding of the distribution of the merit factor in these four classes than was previously available. A consequence is that, for each of the four classes, the merit factor of a sequence drawn uniformly at random from the class converges in probability to a constant as the sequence length increases.},

This complements results on other two constructions of non-weakly regular bent functions, the generalized Maiorana-McFarland construction and the semi-direct sum, for which vectorial versions are presented and the properties of their duals are investigated in the literature. The distribution of the values of the Walsh transform of vectorial bent functions (with non-weakly regular components) is then analysed in detail. Among others, a condition on the values of the Walsh transform of a vectorial bent function from $\mathbb {F}_{p}^{n}$ to $\mathbb {F}_{p}^{m}$ is presented, which implies that $m \le \lceil n/2\rceil $ . This refines a classical result by Nyberg, which states that for an $(n,m)$ bent function, n even, with only regular components, m can be at most $n/2$ .

It supports 80-bit and 128-bit keys, which are referred to as PRESENT-80 and PRESENT-128, respectively. Up to now, linear cryptanalysis is the most effective method on attacking this cipher, especially when accelerated with the pruned Walsh transform. Combing pruned Walsh transform with multiple linear attacks, one can recover the right key for 28-round PRESENT-80 and −128. Later, this method is further improved with affine pruned Walsh transform by adding more zeros in the Walsh spectrum through rejecting some data. This leads to the 29-round attack on PRESENT-128 with full codebook, which is not regarded as a valid attack in the literature. In this paper, we follow the affine pruned Walsh transform accelerated linear method, and propose 29-round attacks on both PRESENT-80 and PRESENT-128 without using full codebook. Both attacks rely on a statistical model depicting distributions of the experimental correlation when some data are artificially rejected in its computation. Besides, detailed analysis of complexity reduction for each linear hull used in attacking PRESENT is also provided and supported by an automatic tool. Our 29-round attack on PRESENT-80 mainly benefits from this tool. According to our knowledge, both attacks are the best ones on PRESENT so far.},

  abstract     = {Linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) over integer residue rings are widely used to generate pseudorandom number, such as ZUC algorithm, truncated LCGs, truncated MRGs. Truncated Galois LFSRs are an important way to generate pseudorandom sequences. Methods to predict the whole sequences by the truncated sequences of the truncated Galois LFSRs are not only a crucial aspect of evaluating their security but also important concerns in their design. This paper studies the predictability of truncated Galois LFSRs. When the modulus and the state transition matrix are known, we first propose a lattice-based method to recover the initial state by the high-order truncated sequences, then discuss the condition that recovering the initial state by the low-order truncated sequences is meaningful, and finally solve the low-order case by transforming it into the high-order case. When the modulus and the state transition matrix are unknown, we generalize our recent work, using the resultant, the greatest common factor, and Kannan’s embedding technique in turn to recover the modulus, the characteristic polynomial, and the initial state. Moreover, we heuristically show that the state transition matrix can be successfully recovered only when all registers output sufficiently long truncated sequences. Experiments have verified the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract     = {How to evaluate the security of Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) block ciphers against impossible differential (ID) cryptanalysis is a valuable problem. In this paper, a series of methods for bounding the length of IDs of SPN block ciphers are proposed. Firstly, we propose the definitions of minimal representative set and partition table. Therefore, an improved partition-first implementation strategy for bounding the length of IDs is given. Secondly, we introduce a new definition of ladder and propose the ladder-first implementation strategy for bounding the length of IDs. In order to be able to apply ladder-first implementation strategy in practice, the methods for determining ladders and integrating a ladder into searching models are given. Thirdly, a heuristic algorithm called dynamic-ladder-partition implementation strategy is proposed. According to our experimental results, dynamic-ladder-partition implementation strategy is more suitable for SPN ciphers whose number of elements in partition tables is little. Fourthly, rotation-equivalence ID sets of ciphers are explored to reduce the number of models that need to be considered. As applications, we show that 9-round PRESENT, 5-round AES, 6-round Rijndael-160, 7-round Rijndael-192, 7-round Rijndael-224 and 7-round Rijndael-256 do not have any ID under the sole assumption that the round keys are uniformly random. What’s more, we obtain that 8-round GIFT-64, 12-round GIFT-128 and 14-round SKINNY-128 do not have any ID under the assumptions that GIFT and SKINNY are Markov ciphers and the round keys are uniformly random. Our methods fill crucial gaps on bounding the length of IDs with the differential properties of S-boxes considered. They enhance our confidence in the security and are valuable, especially for designers.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the achievable region of a K-user discrete memoryless (DM) multiple access wiretap (MAC-WT) channel, where each user transmits both secret and open (i.e., non-confidential) messages. All these messages are intended for the legitimate receiver (Bob), while the eavesdropper (Eve) is only interested in the secret messages. In the achievable coding strategy, the confidential information is protected by open messages and also by the introduction of auxiliary messages. When introducing an auxiliary message, one has to ensure that, on one hand, its rate is large enough for protecting the secret message from Eve and, on the other hand, the resulting sum rate (together with the secret and open message rate) does not exceed Bob’s decoding capability. This yields an inequality structure involving the rates of all users’ secret, open, and auxiliary messages. To obtain the rate region, the auxiliary message rates must be eliminated from the system of inequalities. A direct application of the Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure is elusive since a) it requires that the number of users K is explicitly given, and b) even for small $K = 3, 4, \ldots $ , the number of inequalities becomes extremely large. We prove the result for general K through the combined use of Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure and mathematical induction. This paper adopts the strong secrecy metric, characterized by information leakage. To prove the achievability under this criterion, we analyze the resolvability region of a K-user DM-MAC channel (not necessarily a wiretap channel). In addition, we show that users with zero secrecy rate can play different roles and use different strategies in encoding their messages. These strategies yield non-redundant (i.e., not mutually dominating) rate inequalities. By considering all possible coding strategies, we provide a new achievable region for the considered channel, and show that it strictly improves those already known in the existing literature by considering a specific example.},

The eavesdropper Eve is not allowed to get any information about the private data of Alice or Bob. When Alice and Bob are honest-but-curious users, we propose a protocol that satisfies 1-private (neither Alice nor Bob colludes with Eve) OT requirements for the binary erasure symmetric broadcast channel, in which the channel provides dependent erasure patterns to Bob and Eve. We find that when the erasure probabilities of the channel are within a certain range, the derived lower and upper bounds on the wiretapped OT capacity meet. Our results generalize and improve upon the results on 1-private wiretapped OT capacity by Mishra et al. Finally, we propose a protocol for a larger class of wiretapped channels and derive a lower bound on the wiretapped OT capacity.},

The proposed algorithm recursively calibrates the diagonal bias of the sum of squared network adjacency matrices by leveraging the closed-form bias formula and iteratively updates the subspace estimator using the most recent estimated bias. Correspondingly, we establish a complete recipe for the entrywise subspace estimation theory for the proposed algorithm, including a sharp entrywise subspace perturbation bound and the entrywise eigenvector central limit theorem. Leveraging these results, we settle two multiple network inference problems: the exact community detection in multilayer stochastic block models and the hypothesis testing of the equality of membership profiles in multilayer mixed membership models. Our proof relies on delicate leave-one-out and leave-two-out analyses that are specifically tailored to block-wise symmetric random matrices and a martingale argument that is of fundamental interest for the entrywise eigenvector central limit theorem.},

Specifically, we aim to ascertain the minimal sample size required to guarantee a benign local landscape surrounding global minima in high dimensions. Let n and d denote the sample size and input dimension, respectively. We first explore the local convexity and establish that when $n=o(d\log d)$ , for almost every fixed point in the local ball, the Hessian matrix has negative eigenvalues, provided d is sufficiently large. We next consider the one-point convexity and show that, as long as $n=\omega (d)$ , with high probability, the landscape is one-point strongly convex in the local annulus: $\{w\in \mathbb {R}^{d}: o_{d}({1})\leqslant \|w-w^{*}\|\leqslant c\}$ , where $w^{*}$ is the ground truth and c is an absolute constant. This implies that gradient descent, initialized from any point in this domain, can converge to an $o_{d}({1})$ -loss solution exponentially fast. Furthermore, we show that when $n=o(d\log d)$ , there is a radius of $\widetilde {\Theta } \left ({{\sqrt {1/d}}}\right)$ such that one-point convexity breaks down in the corresponding smaller local ball. This indicates an impossibility to establish a convergence to the exact $w^{*}$ for gradient descent under limited samples by relying solely on one-point convexity.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, characterizing the precise asymptotic risk of regularized estimators in high-dimensional regression has emerged as a prominent research area. This literature focuses on the proportional asymptotics regime, where the number of features and samples diverge proportionally. Much of this work assumes i.i.d. Gaussian entries in the design. Concurrently, researchers have explored the universality of these findings, discovering that results based on the i.i.d. Gaussian assumption extend to other settings, including i.i.d. sub-Gaussian designs. However, universality results examining dependent covariates have predominanatly focused on correlation-based dependence or structured forms of dependence allowed by right-rotationally-invariant designs. In this paper, we challenge this limitation by investigating dependence structures beyond these established classes. We identify a class of designs characterized by a block dependence structure where results based on i.i.d. Gaussian designs persist. Formally, we establish that the optimal values of regularized empirical risk and the risk associated with convex regularized estimators, such as the Lasso and the ridge, converge to the same limit under block-dependent designs as for i.i.d. Gaussian entry designs. Our dependence structure differs significantly from correlation-based dependence and enables, for the first time, asymptotically exact risk characterization in prevalent high-dimensional nonlinear regression problems.},

The key challenge in most approximation methods is the need to tackle the intractable normalization constant present in the candidate distributions used to model the data. This intractability is especially common in distributions of manifold-valued random variables such as rotation matrices, orthogonal matrices etc. In this paper, we focus on the distributional approximation problem in Lie groups since they are frequently encountered in many applications including but not limited to, computer vision, robotics, medical imaging and many more. We present a novel Stein’s operator on Lie groups leading to a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which is a normalization-free loss function. We present several theoretical results characterizing the properties of this new KSD on Lie groups and its minimizer namely, the minimum KSD estimator (MKSDE). Properties of MKSDE are presented and proved, including strong consistency, CLT and a closed form of the MKSDE for the von Mises-Fisher and in general, the exponential family on $\mathop {\mathrm {SO}}\nolimits (N)$ . Finally, we present several experimental results depicting advantages of MKSDE over maximum likelihood estimation.},

One sampling scheme is Nyström sampling, which assumes known distances between the anchors and between the anchors and the n points, while the distances among the n points are unknown. For this scheme, a simple adaptation of the Nyström method, which is often used for kernel approximation, is a viable technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the n points. In this manuscript, we propose a modified version of Nyström sampling, where the distances from every node to one central node are known, but all other distances are incomplete. In this setting, the standard Nyström approach is not applicable, necessitating an alternative technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the n points. We show that this problem can be framed as the recovery of a low-rank submatrix of a Gram matrix. Using synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can exactly recover configurations of points given sufficient distance samples. This underscores that, in contrast to methods that rely on global sampling of distance matrices, the task of estimating the configuration of points can be done efficiently via structured sampling with well-chosen reliable anchors. Finally, our main analysis is grounded in a specific centering of the points. With this in mind, we extend previous work in Euclidean distance geometry by providing a general dual basis approach for points centered anywhere.},

Unlike the estimation theory, the minimax separation rate reveals a nontrivial interaction between sparsity and the choice of function space. We also investigate adaptation to sparsity and establish an adaptive testing rate for a generic function space; adaptation is possible in some spaces while others impose an unavoidable cost.

  abstract     = {The early solution path, which tracks the first few variables that enter the model of a selection procedure, is of profound importance to scientific discoveries. In practice, it is often statistically hopeless to identify all the important features with no false discovery, let alone the intimidating expense of experiments to test their significance. Such realistic limitation calls for statistical guarantee for the early discoveries of a model selector. In this paper, we focus on the early solution path of best subset selection (BSS), where the sparsity constraint is set to be lower than the true sparsity. Under a sparse high-dimensional linear model, we establish the sufficient and (near) necessary condition for BSS to achieve sure early selection, or equivalently, zero false discovery throughout its early path. Essentially, this condition boils down to a lower bound of the minimum projected signal margin that characterizes the gap of the captured signal strength between sure selection models and those with spurious discoveries. Defined through projection operators, this margin is insensitive to the restricted eigenvalues of the design, suggesting the robustness of BSS against collinearity. Moreover, our model selection guarantee tolerates reasonable optimization error and thus applies to near best subsets. Finally, to overcome the computational hurdle of BSS under high dimension, we propose the “screen then select” (STS) strategy to reduce dimension for BSS. Our numerical experiments show that the resulting early path exhibits much lower false discovery rate (FDR) than LASSO, MCP and SCAD, especially in the presence of highly correlated design. We also investigate the early paths of the iterative hard thresholding algorithms, which are greedy computational surrogates for BSS, and which yield comparable FDR as our STS procedure.},

In this work we introduce a model of optical fibre that can describe memory effects for long transmission lines. We then solve its quantum capacity, two-way quantum capacity, and secret-key capacity exactly. By doing so, we show that — due to the memory cross-talk between the transmitted signals — reliable quantum communication is attainable even for highly noisy regimes where it was previously considered impossible.},

  abstract     = {We prove the first non-trivial one-shot inner bounds for sending quantum information over an entanglement unassisted two-sender quantum multiple access channel (QMAC) and an unassisted two-sender two-receiver quantum interference channel (QIC). Previous works only studied the unassisted QMAC in the limit of many independent and identical uses of the channel also known as the asymptotic iid limit, and did not study the unassisted QIC at all. We employ two techniques, rate splitting and successive cancellation, in order to obtain our inner bound. Rate splitting was earlier used to obtain inner bounds, avoiding time sharing, for classical channels in the asymptotic iid setting. Our main technical contribution is to extend rate splitting from the classical asymptotic iid setting to the quantum one-shot setting. In the asymptotic iid limit our one-shot inner bound for QMAC approaches the rate region of Yard et al., (2005). For the QIC we get novel non-trivial rate regions in the asymptotic iid setting. All our results also extend to the case where limited entanglement assistance is provided, in both one-shot and asymptotic iid settings. The limited entanglement results for one-setting for both QMAC and QIC are new. For the QIC the limited entanglement results are new even in the asymptotic iid setting.},

This solves a long-standing open problem proposed in [J. Phys. A, 40, 7937, 2007]. We further construct a three-dimensional space whose locally distinguishable basis is unique and apply the uniqueness property to the task of state transformation. We also construct a three-dimensional locally distinguishable multipartite space assisted with entanglement. On the other hand, we show that four-dimensional indistinguishable bipartite subspace under one-way LPCC exists. Our work offers profound insights and introduces a theoretical tool for understanding the local distinguishability of subspace. As a consequence, every qutrit channel has optimal environment-assisting classical capacity, and the environment-assisted classical capacity of every rank-three channel is at least $\log _{2} 3$ . We also show that every two-qutrit state can be converted into a generalized classical state near the quantum-classical boundary by an entanglement-breaking channel.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the covariance-based activity detection problem in a multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple base stations (BSs), and the BSs cooperatively detect the active devices based on the received signals. While the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the single-cell scenario has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper aims to analyze the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the multi-cell massive MIMO system. Specifically, this paper demonstrates a quadratic scaling law in the multi-cell system, under the assumption that the path-loss exponent of the fading channel $\gamma \gt 2$ . This finding shows that, in the multi-cell massive MIMO system, the maximum number of active devices that can be correctly detected in each cell increases quadratically with the length of the signature sequence and decreases logarithmically with the number of cells (as the number of antennas tends to infinity). Moreover, in addition to analyzing the scaling law for the signature sequences randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere, the paper also establishes the scaling law for signature sequences based on a finite alphabet, which are easier to generate and store. Finally, this paper proposes two efficient accelerated coordinate descent (CD) algorithms with a convergence guarantee for solving the device activity detection problem. The first algorithm reduces the complexity of CD by using an inexact coordinate update strategy. The second algorithm avoids unnecessary computations of CD by using an active set selection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in terms of computational efficiency and detection error probability.},

Let C be a linear $[n,k,d]_{q}$ code, such that, between d and $d\left ({{1+\frac {1}{q-1}}}\right)-1$ , the largest weight of codewords in C is the weight $d\left ({{1+\frac {1}{q-1}}}\right)-1-v$ , then $k \leq n-d\left ({{1+\frac {1}{q-1}}}\right)+2+v$ . Some infinite families of linear codes with arbitrary minimum distances attaining this bound are constructed. This bound is stronger than the Singleton bound for linear codes. Hence we prove that there is no codeword of weights in the range $\left [{{\frac {qd}{q-1}-v,\frac {qd}{q-1}-1}}\right]$ for a linear $[n,k,d]_{q}$ code, if $v=\frac {qd}{q-1}+k-n-2 \geq 2$ . This is the first such kind of result, which concludes vanishing partial weight distributions from four parameters $n,k,d$ and q. Then we give vanishing partial weight distribution results for many best known linear codes, some almost MDS codes, general small Griesmer defect codes, some BCH codes, and some cyclic codes.

Additionally, we refine an existing randomized algorithm to output the codewords on the list, which enhances its success probability and reduces its running time. Lastly, we establish list-size bounds for a fixed decoding parameter. Notably, our results demonstrate that FRS codes asymptotically attain the generalized Singleton bound for a list of size 2 over a relatively small alphabet, marking the first explicit instance of a code with this property.},

  abstract     = {Error-correcting codes over the real field are studied which can locate outlying computational errors when performing approximate computing of real vector-matrix multiplication on resistive crossbars. Prior work has concentrated on locating a single outlying error and, in this work, several classes of codes are presented which can handle multiple errors. It is first shown that one of the known constructions, which is based on spherical codes, can in fact handle multiple outlying errors. A second family of codes is then presented with 0–1 paritycheck matrices which are sparse and disjunct; such matrices have been used in other applications as well, especially in combinatorial group testing. In addition, a certain class of the codes that are obtained through this construction is shown to be efficiently decodable. As part of the study of sparse disjunct matrices, this work also contains improved lower and upper bounds on the maximum Hamming weight of the rows in such matrices.},

Linear complementary dual codes (LCD codes) have been widely applied in data storage, communication systems, consumer electronics, and cryptography. Given these exciting applications of squares and LCD codes, we mainly focus on the squares of LCD cyclic codes in this paper. It will be proved that the square of an LCD cyclic code is still an LCD cyclic code. As a subclass of cyclic codes, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes (BCH codes) have explicit defining sets that include consecutive integers, which gives an advantage of analyzing the parameters of BCH codes and their related codes. We will investigate the squares $\mathcal {C}^{2}(t)$ and $\mathcal {C}^{2}(t)^{c}$ of the primitive LCD BCH codes $\mathcal {C}(t)$ and their complements $\mathcal {C}(t)^{c}$ , respectively, where $\mathcal {C}(t)=\mathcal {C}_{(q,q^{m}-1,2t,-t+1)}$ is the BCH code of length $q^{m}-1$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with designed distance $2t$ . Two sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee that $\mathcal {C}^{2}(t) \ne \Bbb \{\textbf {0}\}$ and $\mathcal {C}^{2}(t)^{c} \ne \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ are proposed by giving restrictions on designed distances. Furthermore, the dimensions and lower bounds on minimum distances of $\mathcal {C}^{2}(t)$ and $\mathcal {C}^{2}(t)^{c}$ are presented in some cases. The parameters of the squares of the complements of the Melas codes $M(q,m)$ are also investigated.},

The total bandwidth resulting from these schemes is greater than that incurred during trivial repair; however, this is particularly relevant in the context of leakage-resilient secret sharing. In that framework, our results provide attacks showing that k-out-of-n Shamir’s Secret Sharing over prime fields for small k is not leakage-resilient, even when the parties leak only a constant number of bits. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such attacks. Our results are derived from a novel connection between exponential sums and the repair of RS codes. Specifically, we establish that non-trivial bounds on certain exponential sums imply the existence of explicit nonlinear repair schemes for RS codes over prime fields.},

  abstract     = {The self-orthogonality and divisibility are two important properties of linear codes. It is interesting to establish relationship between them. By the well-known Gleason-Pierce-Ward Theorem, all self-dual divisible codes have been totally classified. However, the relationship between the self-orthogonality and divisibility of a q-ary linear codes is known only for $q=2,3$ by Huffman and Pless in 2003. It has remained open for more than 20 years to consider other cases. The purpose of this paper is to settle this open problem under certain conditions and construct new families of self-orthogonal codes. Let q be a power of an odd prime p. Firstly, we prove that any p-divisible code containing the all-1 vector over the finite field ${\mathbb {F}}_{q}$ is self-orthogonal. More generally, it is concluded that any p-divisible $[n,k]$ linear code over ${\mathbb {F}}_{q}$ containing codewords of weight n is monomially equivalent to an $[n,k]$ self-orthogonal code over ${\mathbb {F}}_{q}$ . This result provides a very efficient way to find self-orthogonal codes from p-divisible codes. Secondly, we apply this result to construct self-orthogonal codes with excellent parameters or nice applications. For one thing, we use this result to study the self-orthogonality of generalized Reed-Muller codes, certain projective two-weight codes, and Griesmer codes. For another thing, by this useful result as well as the extending and augmentation techniques for linear codes, we construct eight new families of self-orthogonal divisible codes. These self-orthogonal codes and their duals contain many optimal or almost optimal codes. Besides, some self-orthogonal codes support combinatorial designs and some of them are proved to be optimal or almost optimal locally recoverable codes.},

  abstract     = {In response to the evolving landscape of data storage, researchers have increasingly explored non-traditional platforms, with DNA-based storage emerging as a cutting-edge solution. Our work is motivated by the potential of in-vivo DNA storage, known for its capacity to store vast amounts of information efficiently and confidentially within an organism’s native DNA. While promising, in-vivo DNA storage faces challenges, including susceptibility to errors introduced by mutations. One way to understand the long-term effect of such mutations on the stored information is to investigate the frequency of k-tuples after multiple mutations. Drawing inspiration from related works, we generalize results from the study of duplication systems, particularly focusing on the frequency (or proportion) of k-tuples. We provide a general method for the analysis of mutation systems through the construction of a specialized matrix, dubbed substitution matrix, and the identification of its eigenvectors. Specifically, we derive an expression for the expected frequency of k-tuples. In the context of duplication errors, we leverage existing results on the almost sure convergence of the frequency of k-tuples. This allows us to equate the expected frequency of k-tuples to the limiting frequency of k-tuples. In addition, we demonstrate the convergence in probability of the frequency of k-tuples under certain assumptions.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a novel data-driven methodology for designing neural polar decoders for channels with and without memory is proposed. The methodology is suitable for the case where the channel is given as a “black-box” and the designer has access to the channel for generating observations of its inputs and outputs, but does not have access to the explicit channel model. The proposed method leverages the structure of the successive cancellation (SC) decoder to devise a neural SC (NSC) decoder. The NSC decoder uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the core elements of the original SC decoder, the check-node, the bit-node and the soft-decision. Along with the NSC, we devise additional NN that embeds the channel outputs into the input space of the SC decoder. The proposed method is supported by theoretical guarantees that include the consistency of the NSC. Additionally, the computational complexity of the NSC decoder does not increase with the channel’s memory size and is given by $O(mdN\log N)$ , where N is the block length, and d and m represent the dimensions of the input and the hidden units of the implemented NNs, respectively. This sets its main advantage over successive cancellation trellis (SCT) decoder for finite state channels (FSCs) that has complexity of $O(|{\mathcal {S}}|^{3} N\log N)$ , where $|{\mathcal {S}}|$ denotes the number of channel states. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on memoryless channels and on channels with memory. The empirical results are compared with the analytic polar decoder, given by the SC and SCT decoders. We further show that our algorithms are applicable for the case where there SC and SCT decoders are not applicable.},

  abstract     = {In applications of group testing in networks, e.g. identifying individuals who are infected by a disease spread over a network, exploiting correlation among network nodes provides fundamental opportunities in reducing the number of tests needed. We model and analyze group testing on n correlated nodes whose interactions are specified by a graph G. We model correlation through an edge-faulty random graph formed from G in which each edge is dropped with probability $1-r$ , and in the newly formed graph, all nodes in the same component have the same state. We consider three classes of graphs: cycles and trees, d-regular graphs and stochastic block models or SBM, and obtain lower and upper bounds on the number of tests needed to identify the defective nodes. Roughly speaking, we use correlation among the states of the nodes to transform the problem into that of a smaller graph with independent node states. This enhancement is quantified through the ratio of the diminished node count to the overall count of nodes, n; thus, a lower ratio signifies superior performance. The lower bounds are derived by illustrating a strong dependence of the number of tests needed on the expected number of components. In this regard, we establish a new approximation for the distribution of component sizes in “d-regular trees” which may be of independent interest and leads to a lower bound on the expected number of components in d-regular graphs. The upper bounds are found by forming dense subgraphs in which nodes are more likely to be in the same state. When G is a cycle or tree, we show an improvement by a factor of $\log (1/r)$ . For grid, a graph with almost $2n$ edges, the improvement is by a factor of $(1-r) \log (1/r)$ , indicating drastic improvement compared to trees.

  abstract     = {Entropy comparison inequalities are obtained for the differential entropy $h(X+Y)$ of the sum of two independent random vectors $X,Y$ , when one is replaced by a Gaussian. For identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$ , these are closely related to bounds on the entropic doubling constant, which quantifies the entropy increase when adding an independent copy of a random vector to itself. Consequences of both large and small doubling are explored. For the former, lower bounds are deduced on the entropy increase when adding an independent Gaussian, while for the latter, a qualitative stability result for the entropy power inequality is obtained. In the more general case of non-identically distributed random vectors $X,Y$ , a Gaussian comparison inequality with interesting implications for channel coding is established: For additive-noise channels with a power constraint, Gaussian codebooks come within a $\frac {\mathsf { snr}}{3{\mathsf { snr}}+2}$ factor of capacity. In the low-SNR regime this improves the half-a-bit additive bound of Zamir and Erez. Analogous results are obtained for additive-noise multiple access channels, and for linear, additive-noise},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a memoryless source model in the asymptotic limit of large block-lengths. The perception measure is based on a divergence between the distributions of the source and reconstruction sequences conditioned on the encoder output, first proposed by Mentzer et al. We consider the case when there is no shared randomness between the encoder and the decoder and derive a single-letter characterization of the RDP function, for the case of discrete memoryless sources. This is in contrast to the marginal-distribution metric case (introduced by Blau and Michaeli), whose RDP characterization remains open when there is no shared randomness. The achievability scheme is based on lossy source coding with a posterior reference map. For the case of continuous valued sources under the squared error distortion measure and the squared quadratic Wasserstein perception measure, we also derive a single-letter characterization and show that the decoder can be restricted to a noise-adding mechanism. Interestingly, the RDP function characterized for the case of zero perception loss coincides with that of the marginal metric, and further zero perception loss can be achieved with a 3-dB penalty in minimum distortion. Finally we specialize to the case of Gaussian sources, and derive the RDP function for Gaussian vector case and propose a reverse water-filling type solution. We also partially characterize the RDP function for a mixture of Gaussian vector sources.},

  abstract     = {In the classical lossy source coding problem, one encodes long blocks of source symbols that enables the distortion to approach the ultimate Shannon limit. Such a block-coding approach introduces large delays, which is undesirable in many delay-sensitive applications. We consider the zero-delay case, where the goal is to encode and decode a finite-alphabet Markov source without any delay. It has been shown that this problem lends itself to stochastic control techniques, which lead to existence, structural, and general structural approximation results. However, these techniques so far have only resulted in computationally prohibitive algorithmic implementations for code design. To address this problem, we present a practically implementable reinforcement learning design algorithm and rigorously prove its asymptotic optimality. In particular, we show that a quantized Q-learning algorithm can be used to obtain a near-optimal coding policy for this problem. The proof builds on recent results on quantized Q-learning for weakly Feller controlled Markov chains whose application necessitates the development of supporting technical results on regularity and stability properties, and relating the optimal solutions for discounted and average cost infinite horizon criteria problems. These theoretical results are supported by simulations.},

A toy example is provided to demonstrate that the exact version of iSCRA-TL1 can successfully reconstruct the true sparse signal, but almost all the present sequential convex relaxation algorithms starting from an optimal solution of the $\ell _{1}$ -norm minimization fail to recover it. To provide theoretical guarantees for iSCRA-TL1, we introduce two new types of null space properties, restricted null space property (RNSP) and sequential restricted null space property (SRNSP), and prove that they are both weaker than the common stable NSP, while their robust versions are not stronger than the existing robust NSP. Then, we justify that under a suitable (robust) SRNSP, iSCRA-TL1 can identify the support of the true r-sparse signal or the index set of the first r largest (in modulus) entries of the true nearly r-sparse signal via at most r truncated $\ell _{1}$ -norm minimization, and the error bound of its final output from the true (nearly) r-sparse signal is also quantified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequential convex relaxation algorithm to recover the support of the true (nearly) sparse signal under a weaker NSP condition within a specific number of steps, provided that the classical $\ell _{1}$ -norm minimization problem lacks the good robustness.},

The focus is on the min-CuSum algorithm, which raises an alarm as soon as a CuSum statistic that corresponds to one of the post-change alternatives exceeds a certain threshold. We obtain, under certain assumptions, non-asymptotic upper bounds on its conditional probability of misidentification given that a false alarm did not occur. When, in particular, the data are generated over independent channels and the change can occur in only one of them, its worst-case—with respect to the change point—conditional probability of misidentification given that there was not a false alarm is shown to decay exponentially fast in the threshold. As a corollary, in this setup, the min-CuSum is shown to asymptotically minimize Lorden’s detection delay criterion, simultaneously for every post-change scenario, within the class of schemes that satisfy prescribed bounds on both the false alarm rate and the worst-case conditional probability of misidentification, in a regime where the latter does not go to zero faster than the former.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. We address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE as the dimensions of the signal and the observation grow proportionally. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (‘state evolution’) that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.},

The first family of linear codes is constructed from monomial functions over finite fields. The weight distribution of the codes is determined in some cases. The codes are proved to be both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal under certain conditions. The localities of the codes and their duals are also studied and we obtain an infinite family of optimal or almost optimal locally recoverable codes.

This family of codes is also proved to be both optimally or almost optimally extendable and self-orthogonal. Besides, this family of codes has been proven to have locality 2 or 3 under certain conditions. Particularly, we derive two infinite families of optimal locally recoverable codes.

Our approach involves maintaining a list of weight- $2p$ solution vectors to a partial syndrome decoding problem and then creating new vectors by identifying pairs of vectors that collide in p positions. By gradually increasing the parity-check condition by one and repeating this process iteratively, we find the final solution(s). We show that our novel algorithm performs better than other ISDs in the memory-restricted scenario when applied to McEliece.

Previously this problem was solved by Xia et al. only for $p=2$ and $p=3$ in a series of papers. The main difficulty of this problem for $p \ge 5$ , as pointed out by Xia et al., is to count the number of codewords of “pure weight” 5 in p-ary Zetterberg codes. It turns out this counting problem can be transformed by the MacWilliams identity into counting codewords of weight at most 5 in p-ary Melas codes, the most difficult of which is related to a K3 surface well studied in the literature and can be computed. When $p \ge 7$ , the theory of elliptic curves over finite fields also plays an important role in the resolution of this problem.},

  abstract     = {The index coding problem is concerned with broadcasting encoded information to a collection of receivers in a way that enables each receiver to discover its required data based on its side information, which comprises the data required by some of the others. Given the side information map, represented by a graph in the symmetric case and by a digraph otherwise, the goal is to devise a coding scheme of minimum broadcast length. We present a general method for developing efficient algorithms for approximating the index coding rate for prescribed families of instances. As applications, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms that approximate the index coding rate of graphs and digraphs on n vertices to within factors of $O(n/\log ^{2} n)$ and $O(n/\log n)$ respectively. This improves on the approximation factors of $O(n/\log n)$ for graphs and $O(n \cdot \log \log n/\log n)$ for digraphs achieved by Blasiak, Kleinberg, and Lubetzky. For the family of quasi-line graphs, we exhibit a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the index coding rate to within a factor of 2. This improves on the approximation factor of $O(n^{2/3})$ achieved by Arbabjolfaei and Kim for graphs on n vertices taken from certain sub-families of quasi-line graphs. Our approach is applicable for approximating a variety of additional graph and digraph quantities to within the same approximation factors. Specifically, it captures every graph quantity sandwiched between the independence number and the clique cover number and every digraph quantity sandwiched between the maximum size of an acyclic induced sub-digraph and the directed clique cover number.},

  abstract     = {We discuss network tomography in stochastic environments. In real-world communication networks, routing may exhibit stochastic behavior due to load balancing mechanisms and other factors, and the states of network components, such as links, may fluctuate. In such environments, identifying the internal state of the network from end-to-end measurements typically requires a huge number of measurements. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a network tomography method that efficiently narrows down the state with a limited number of measurements by repeatedly updating the posterior information of the network state. In our method, we introduce the mutual information as an indicator of the effectiveness of the measurement. This allows us to design a combination of measurement paths that is critically effective for state identification, thereby significantly reducing redundant measurements that would generate excessive costs. We show that our method theoretically guarantees the approximation ratio $(1-1/\mathrm {e})$ on the basis of submodularity analysis. Numerical evaluations show that our method can identify network states with far fewer measurements than existing methods.},

Our contribution is an iterative coded computing mechanism with linear communication complexity, termed Double Lagrange Coding, which allows iterative scalable multi-party polynomial computations without degrading the parallelization gain, adversary tolerance, and dropout resilience throughout the iterations. While providing strong multi-round information-theoretic privacy guarantees, our framework achieves equal adversary tolerance, resilience to user dropouts, and model accuracy to the state-of-the-art, while reducing the communication overhead from quadratic to linear. In doing so, our framework addresses a key technical challenge in collaborative privacy-preserving machine learning, while paving the way for large-scale privacy-preserving iterative algorithms for deep learning and beyond.},

The problem is studied in the finite-blocklength regime. In this regime, the use of auxiliary random variables subject to Markov chain conditions in the corresponding asymptotic bounds has proven to make most existing proof techniques insufficient. However, two recently proposed proof techniques – one for the achievability side based on Poisson matching, and another for the converse side based on reverse hypercontractivity – allow us to overcome these issues to some extent. Based on these techniques, novel one-shot and second-order achievability and converse bounds are derived for the problem. While the second-order bounds do not coincide, leaving a precise second-order characterization of the problem an open issue, they improve upon the previously known tightest bounds. The second-order bounds are demonstrated for two simple sources: the binary symmetric source and the Gaussian symmetric source. For the binary source, we find that the gap between the two bounds is mainly due to an unwanted constant in the converse bound, and the non-convexity of the achievability bound.},

  abstract     = {In this work, fundamental limits and optimal mechanisms of privacy-preserving data release that aims to minimize the privacy leakage under utility constraints of a set of multiple tasks are investigated. While the private feature to be protected is typically determined and known by the sanitizer, the target task is usually unknown. To address the lack of information on the specific task, utility constraints laid on a set of multiple possible tasks are considered. The mechanism protects the specific privacy feature of the to-be-released data while satisfying utility constraints of all possible tasks in the set. First, the single-letter characterization of the rate-leakage-distortion region is derived, where the utility of each task is measured by a distortion function. It turns out that the minimum privacy leakage problem with log-loss distortion constraints and the unconstrained released rate is a non-convex optimization problem. Second, focusing on the case where the raw data consists of multiple independent components, we show that the above non-convex optimization problem can be decomposed into multiple parallel privacy funnel (PF) problems with different weightings. We explicitly derive the optimal solution to each PF problem when the private feature is a component-wise deterministic function of a data vector. The solution is characterized by a leakage-free threshold: when the utility constraint is below the threshold, the minimum leakage is zero; once the required utility level is above the threshold, the privacy leakage increases linearly. Finally, we show that the optimal weighting of each privacy funnel problem can be found by solving a linear program (LP). A sufficient released rate to achieve the minimum leakage is also derived. Numerical results are shown to illustrate the robustness of our approach against the task non-specificity.},

  abstract     = {The inference of a large symmetric signal-matrix $\boldsymbol{S} \in \mathbb {R}^{N\times N}$ corrupted by additive Gaussian noise, is considered for two regimes of growth of the rank M as a function of N. For sub-linear ranks $M=\Theta (N^{\alpha })$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ the mutual information and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) are derived for two classes of signal-matrices: (a) $\boldsymbol{S} =\boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{X} ^{\intercal } $ with entries of $\boldsymbol{X} \in \mathbb {R}^{N\times M}$ independent identically distributed; (b) $\boldsymbol{S} $ sampled from a rotationally invariant distribution. Surprisingly, the formulas match the rank-one case. Two efficient algorithms are explored and conjectured to saturate the MMSE when no statistical-to-computational gap is present: (1) Decimation Approximate Message Passing; (2) a spectral algorithm based on a Rotation Invariant Estimator. For linear ranks $M=\Theta (N)$ the mutual information is rigorously derived for signal-matrices from a rotationally invariant distribution. Close connections with scalar inference in free probability are uncovered, which allow to deduce a simple formula for the MMSE as an integral involving the limiting spectral measure of the data matrix only. An interesting issue is whether the known information theoretic phase transitions for rank-one, and hence also sub-linear-rank, still persist in linear-rank. Our analysis suggests that only a smoothed-out trace of the transitions persists. Furthermore, the change of behavior between low and truly high-rank regimes only happens at the linear scale $\alpha = 1$ .},

This family of distances is particularly useful as it takes into consideration the fact that covariance matrices lie in the Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices, thereby including a variety of commonly used metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, Jeffreys’ divergence, and the log-Euclidean distance. Moreover, a statistical analysis of the asymptotic behavior of this class of distance estimators has also been conducted. Specifically, we present a central limit theorem that establishes the asymptotic Gaussianity of these estimators and provides closed form expressions for the corresponding means and variances. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed consistent estimator over conventional plug-in estimators in multivariate analytical contexts. Additionally, the central limit theorem derived in this study provides a robust statistical framework to assess of accuracy of these estimators.},

  abstract     = {Flow-based generative models enjoy certain advantages in computing the data generation and the likelihood, and have recently shown competitive empirical performance. Compared to the accumulating theoretical studies on related score-based diffusion models, analysis of flow-based models, which are deterministic in both forward (data-to-noise) and reverse (noise-to-data) directions, remain sparse. In this paper, we provide a theoretical guarantee of generating data distribution by a progressive flow model, the so-called JKO flow model, which implements the Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme in a normalizing flow network. Leveraging the exponential convergence of the proximal gradient descent (GD) in Wasserstein space, we prove the Kullback-Leibler (KL) guarantee of data generation by a JKO flow model to be $O(\varepsilon ^{2})$ when using $N \lesssim \log (1/\varepsilon)$ many JKO steps (N Residual Blocks in the flow) where $\varepsilon $ is the error in the per-step first-order condition. The assumption on data density is merely a finite second moment, and the theory extends to data distributions without density and when there are inversion errors in the reverse process where we obtain KL- $\mathcal {W}_{2}$ mixed error guarantees. The non-asymptotic convergence rate of the JKO-type $\mathcal {W}_{2}$ -proximal GD is proved for a general class of convex objective functionals that includes the KL divergence as a special case, which can be of independent interest. The analysis framework can extend to other first-order Wasserstein optimization schemes applied to flow-based generative models.},

Recent theoretical work showed that approximate leave-one-out cross validation (ALO) is a computationally efficient and statistically reliable estimate of LO (and OO) for generalized linear models with differentiable regularizers. For problems involving non-differentiable regularizers, despite significant empirical evidence, the theoretical understanding of ALO’s error remains unknown. In this paper, we present a novel theory for a wide class of problems in the generalized linear model family with non-differentiable regularizers. We bound the error $|{\mathrm { ALO}}-{\mathrm { LO}}|$ in terms of intuitive metrics such as the size of leave-i-out perturbations in active sets, sample size n, number of features p and regularization parameters. As a consequence, for the $\ell _{1}$ -regularized problems, we show that $|{\mathrm { ALO}}-{\mathrm { LO}}| \xrightarrow {p\rightarrow \infty } 0$ while $n/p$ and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are bounded.},

This work shows that the only prior distribution on X that induces linearity in the conditional median is Gaussian. Along the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is demonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for all y, then X must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we consider other $L^{p}$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \in [{1,2}]$ , Gaussian is the only prior distribution that induces a linear optimal Bayesian estimator, and for $p \in (2,\infty)$ , infinitely many prior distributions on X can induce linearity.

  abstract     = {This work considers two related learning problems in a federated attack-prone setting – federated principal components analysis (PCA) and federated low rank column-wise sensing (LRCS). The node attacks are assumed to be Byzantine which means that the attackers are omniscient and can collude. We introduce a novel provably Byzantine-resilient communication-efficient and sample-efficient algorithm, called Subspace-Median, that solves the PCA problem and is a key part of the solution for the LRCS problem. We also study the most natural Byzantine-resilient solution for federated PCA, a geometric median based modification of the federated power method, and explain why it is not useful. Our second main contribution is a complete alternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization (altGDmin) algorithm for Byzantine-resilient horizontally federated LRCS and sample and communication complexity guarantees for it. Extensive simulation experiments are used to corroborate our theoretical guarantees. The ideas that we develop for LRCS are easily extendable to other LR recovery problems as well.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of binary hypothesis testing. Given Z coming from either $\mathbb {P}^{\otimes m}$ or $\mathbb {Q}^{\otimes m}$ , to decide between the two with small probability of error it is sufficient, and in many cases necessary, to have $m\asymp 1/\varepsilon ^{2}$ , where $\varepsilon $ measures the separation between $\mathbb {P}$ and $\mathbb {Q}$ in total variation ( $\textsf {TV}$ ). Achieving this, however, requires complete knowledge of the distributions and can be done, for example, using the Neyman-Pearson test. In this paper we consider a variation of the problem which we call likelihood-free hypothesis testing, where access to $\mathbb {P}$ and $\mathbb {Q}$ is given through n i.i.d. observations from each. In the case when $\mathbb {P}$ and $\mathbb {Q}$ are assumed to belong to a non-parametric family, we demonstrate the existence of a fundamental trade-off between n and m given by $nm\asymp n_{\textsf {GoF}}^{2}(\varepsilon)$ , where $n_{\textsf {GoF}}(\varepsilon)$ is the minimax sample complexity of testing between the hypotheses $H_{0}:\, \mathbb {P}=\mathbb {Q}$ vs $H_{1}:\, \textsf {TV}(\mathbb {P},\mathbb {Q})\geq \varepsilon $ . We show this for three families of distributions, in addition to the family of all discrete distributions for which we obtain a more complicated trade-off exhibiting an additional phase-transition. Our results demonstrate the possibility of testing without fully estimating $\mathbb {P}$ and $\mathbb {Q}$ , provided $m \gg 1/\varepsilon ^{2}$ .},

  abstract     = {A continuity structure of correlations among arms in multi-armed bandit can bring a significant acceleration of exploration and reduction of regret, in particular, when there are many arms. However, it is often latent in practice. To cope with the latent continuity, we consider a transfer learning setting where an agent learns the structural information, parameterized by a Lipschitz constant and an embedding of arms, from a sequence of past tasks and transfers it to a new one. We propose a simple but provably-efficient algorithm to accurately estimate and fully exploit the Lipschitz continuity at the same asymptotic order of lower bound of sample complexity in the previous tasks. The proposed algorithm is applicable to estimate not only a latent Lipschitz constant given an embedding, but also a latent embedding, while the latter requires slightly more sample complexity. To be specific, we analyze the efficiency of the proposed framework in two folds: (i) our regret bound on the new task is close to that of the oracle algorithm with the full knowledge of the Lipschitz continuity under mild assumptions; and (ii) the sample complexity of our estimator matches with the information-theoretic fundamental limit. Our analysis reveals a set of useful insights on transfer learning for latent Lipschitz continuity. From a numerical evaluation based on real-world dataset of rate adaptation in time-varying wireless channel, we demonstrate the theoretical findings and show the superiority of the proposed framework compared to baselines.},

  abstract     = {It has been observed that the performances of many high-dimensional estimation problems are universal with respect to underlying sensing (or design) matrices. Specifically, matrices with markedly different constructions seem to achieve identical performance if they share the same spectral distribution and have “generic” singular vectors. We prove this universality phenomenon for the case of convex regularized least squares (RLS) estimators under a linear regression model with additive Gaussian noise. Our main contributions are two-fold: (1) We introduce a notion of universality classes for sensing matrices, defined through a set of deterministic conditions that fix the spectrum of the sensing matrix and precisely capture the notion of generic singular vectors; (2) We show that for all sensing matrices that lie in the same universality class, the dynamics of the proximal gradient descent algorithm for solving the regression problem, as well as the performance of RLS estimators themselves (under additional strong convexity conditions) are asymptotically identical. In addition to including i.i.d. Gaussian and rotational invariant matrices as special cases, our universality class also contains highly structured, strongly dependent, and even (nearly) deterministic matrices. Examples of the latter include randomly signed versions of incoherent tight frames and randomly subsampled Hadamard transforms. As a consequence of this universality principle, the asymptotic performance of regularized linear regression on many structured matrices constructed with limited randomness can be characterized by using the rotationally invariant ensemble as an equivalent yet mathematically more tractable surrogate.},

  abstract     = {We consider the rate-limited quantum-to-classical optimal transport in terms of output-constrained rate-distortion coding for both finite-dimensional and continuous-variable quantum-to-classical systems with limited classical common randomness. The main coding theorem provides a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region of a lossy quantum measurement source coding for an exact construction of the destination distribution (or the equivalent quantum state) while maintaining a threshold of distortion from the source state according to a generally defined distortion observable. The constraint on the output space fixes the output distribution to an IID predefined probability mass function. Therefore, this problem can also be viewed as information-constrained optimal transport which finds the optimal cost of transporting the source quantum state to the destination classical distribution via a quantum measurement with limited communication rate and common randomness. We develop a coding framework for continuous-variable quantum systems by employing a clipping projection and a dequantization block and using our finite-dimensional coding theorem. Moreover, for the Gaussian quantum systems, we derive an analytical solution for rate-limited Wasserstein distance of order 2, along with a Gaussian optimality theorem, showing that Gaussian measurement optimizes the rate in a system with Gaussian quantum source and Gaussian destination distribution. The results further show that in contrast to the classical Wasserstein distance of Gaussian distributions, which corresponds to an infinite transmission rate, in the Quantum Gaussian measurement system, the optimal transport is achieved with a finite transmission rate due to the inherent noise of the quantum measurement imposed by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.},

Our bounds are expressed in terms of measured (for the one-shot bounds) and sandwiched (for the asymptotic bounds) channel Rényi mutual information of order between 1/2 and 1. The bounds are not comparable with some previously established bounds for general channels, yet they are tight (for rates close to capacity) when the channel is classical.

Furthermore, this characterization can be incorporated into the associated distance enumerators, enabling us to construct semidefinite constraints that lead to SDP bounds on the minimum distance or size of CWS-type quantum codes. We illustrate several instances where SDP bounds outperform LP bounds, and there are even cases where LP fails to yield meaningful results, while SDP consistently provides tighter and relevant bounds.

The dynamical process is modeled by a Gauss-Markov process, and the lossy channel by a packet-erasure channel with ideal feedback. We suppose that data is communicated in the format of packets with negligible quantization error. In such a networked control system, whenever a packet loss occurs, there exists a tradeoff between transmitting new sensory information with a lower success probability and retransmitting previously failed sensory information with a higher success probability. In essence, an inherent tradeoff between freshness and reliability. To address this tradeoff, we consider a linear-quadratic-regulator performance index, which penalizes state deviations and control efforts over a finite horizon, and jointly design optimal encoding and decoding policies for the encoder and the decoder, which are collocated with the sensor and the actuator, respectively. Our emphasis here lies specifically on designing switching and control policies, rather than error-correcting codes. We show that the optimal encoding policy is a threshold switching policy and the optimal decoding policy is a certainty-equivalent control policy. In addition, we determine the equations that the encoder and the decoder need to solve in order to implement the optimal policies. More specifically, we show that the encoder must solve the Kalman filtering equations, a mismatch linear equation, and a Bellman optimality equation, while the decoder must solve a linear filtering equation and an algebraic Riccati equation.},

In this work, we focus on regular LDPC codes over integer residue rings and analyze their performance with respect to the Lee metric. Their error-correction performance is studied over two channel models, in the Lee metric. The first channel model is a discrete memoryless channel, whereas in the second channel model an error vector is drawn uniformly at random from all vectors of a fixed Lee weight. It is known that the two channel laws coincide in the asymptotic regime, meaning that their marginal distributions match. For both channel models, we derive upper bounds on the block error probability in terms of a random coding union bound as well as sphere packing bounds that make use of the marginal distribution of the considered channels. We estimate the decoding error probability of regular LDPC code ensembles over the channels using the marginal distribution and determining the expected Lee weight distribution of a random LDPC code over a finite integer ring. By means of density evolution and finite-length simulations, we estimate the error-correction performance of selected LDPC code ensembles under belief propagation decoding and a low-complexity symbol message passing decoding algorithm and compare the performances. The analysis developed in this paper may serve to design regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over integer residue rings for storage and cryptographic application.},

To this end, we introduce the notion of irregular-pair-distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy in terms of the shortest length of the irregular-pair-distance codes. We then simplify these bounds and employ these general results to specific functions including pair-locally binary functions, pair weight functions and pair weight distribution functions.

Dimakis et al. considered the problem of repairing the erasure of a single coordinate and proved a lower bound on the amount of data transmission that is needed for the repair. A minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code with repair degree d is an MDS array code that achieves this lower bound for the repair of any single erased coordinate from any d out of $n-1$ remaining coordinates. An MSR code has the optimal access property if the amount of accessed data is the same as the amount of transmitted data in the repair procedure. The sub-packetization $\ell $ and the field size q are of paramount importance in MSR code constructions. For optimal-access MSR codes, Balaji et al. proved that $\ell \geq s^{\left \lceil {{ n/s }}\right \rceil }$ , where $s = d-k+1$ . Rawat et al. showed that this lower bound is attainable for all admissible values of d when the field size is exponential in n. After that, tremendous efforts have been devoted to reducing the field size. However, so far, reduction to a linear field size is only available for $d\in \{k+1,k+2,k+3\}$ and $d=n-1$ . In this paper, we construct the first class of explicit optimal-access MSR codes with the smallest sub-packetization $\ell = s^{\left \lceil {{ n/s }}\right \rceil }$ for all d between $k+1$ and $n-1$ , resolving an open problem in the survey (Ramkumar et al., Foundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory: Vol. 19: No. 4). We further propose another class of explicit MSR code constructions (not optimal-access) with an even smaller sub-packetization $s^{\left \lceil {{ n/(s+1)}}\right \rceil }$ for all admissible values of d, making significant progress on another open problem in the survey. Previously, MSR codes with $\ell =s^{\left \lceil {{ n/(s+1)}}\right \rceil }$ and $q=O(n)$ were only known for $d=k+1$ and $d=n-1$ . The key insight that enables a linear field size in our construction is to reduce $\binom {n}{r}$ global constraints of non-vanishing determinants to $O_{s}(n)$ local ones, which is achieved by carefully designing the parity check matrices.},

  abstract     = {BCH codes are an interesting class of cyclic codes due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. In the past sixty years, a lot of progress on the study of BCH codes has been made, but little is known about the properties of their duals. Recently, in order to study the duals of BCH codes and the lower bounds on their minimum distances, a new concept called dually-BCH code was proposed by (Gong et al., 2022). In this paper, the lower bounds on the minimum distances of the duals of narrow-sense BCH codes with length $\frac {q^{m}-1}{\lambda }$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ are developed, where $\lambda $ is a positive integer satisfying $\lambda =q^{s}-1$ and $s\, |\,m$ , or $\lambda \, |\, q-1$ . In addition, the sufficient and necessary conditions in terms of the designed distances for these codes being dually-BCH codes are presented. Our lower bounds on the minimum distances of the duals of BCH codes include the bounds stated in (Gong et al., 2022) as a special case. Moreover, our lower bounds improve the bounds stated in (Gong et al., 2022), the classical Sidel’nikov bound, and the Carlitz-Uchiyama bound when the designed distances of the BCH codes are in some ranges. Several examples show that our proposed lower bounds are good in some cases.},

  abstract     = {A new type of analog error-correcting codes (Analog ECCs) has been proposed by Roth recently. The codes can correct errors of unlimited magnitudes even though the codeword is affected not only by such errors, but also by ubiquitous noise of limited magnitudes. The codes have the potential to accelerate the widely used vector-matrix multiplication in machine learning via their implementation in nanoscale analog circuits. Several Analog ECCs, which mainly focus on correcting or detecting a single unlimited-magnitude error, have been proposed. This paper explores the analysis and constructions of Analog ECCs in multiple ways. It presents a linear-programming based algorithm that computes the m-heights of Analog ECCs efficiently, which can be used to determine the error correction/detection capabilities of the codes. It then presents a family of Analog ECCs based on permutations, and proves that the time complexity for determining the m-heights of such codes can be further reduced substantially. The analysis forms a basis for the time-complexity tradeoff between the searching of codes and the verification of their performance. The paper then presents a number of newly discovered codes based on such a search and verification process, which achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Linear real-valued computations over distributed datasets are common in many applications, most notably as part of machine learning inference. In particular, linear computations that are quantized, i.e., where the coefficients are restricted to a predetermined set of values (such as ±1), have gained increasing interest lately due to their role in efficient, robust, or private machine learning models. Given a dataset to store in a distributed system, we wish to encode it so that all such computations could be conducted by accessing a small number of servers, called the access parameter of the system. Doing so relieves the remaining servers to execute other tasks. Minimizing the access parameter gives rise to an access-redundancy tradeoff, where a smaller access parameter requires more redundancy in the system, and vice versa. In this paper, we study this tradeoff and provide several explicit low-access schemes for $\{\pm 1\}$ quantized linear computations based on covering codes in a novel way. While the connection to covering codes has been observed in the past, our results strictly outperform the state-of-the-art for two-valued linear computations. We further show that the same storage scheme can be used to retrieve any linear combination with two distinct coefficients—regardless of what those coefficients are—with the same access parameter. This universality result is then extended to all possible quantizations with any number of values; while the storage remains identical, the access parameter increases according to a new additive-combinatorics property we call coefficient complexity. We then turn to study the coefficient complexity—we characterize the complexity of small sets of coefficients, provide bounds, and identify coefficient sets having the highest and lowest complexity. Interestingly, arithmetic progressions have the lowest possible complexity, and some geometric progressions have the highest possible complexity, the former being particularly attractive for its common use in uniform quantization.},

Here, the support is specified as the sum of two sets: a set of $2^{2i-1}-2^{i-1}$ elements, and a subspace of dimension $m-2i-s$ , specified by a basis. In some detail, for designed distance $6\cdot 2^{j}$ , $j\in \{0,\ldots ,m-4\}$ , we have a deterministic algorithm for even $m\geq 4$ , and a probabilistic algorithm with success probability $1-O(2^{-m})$ for odd $m\gt 4$ . For designed distance $28\cdot 2^{j}$ , $j\in \{0,\ldots , m-6\}$ , we have a probabilistic algorithm with success probability $\geq \frac {1}{3}-O(2^{-m/2})$ for even $m\geq 6$ . Finally, for designed distance $120\cdot 2^{j}$ , $j\in \{0,\ldots , m-8\}$ , we have a deterministic algorithm for $m\geq 8$ divisible by 4. We also show how Gold functions can be used to find the support of minimum-weight words for designed distance $d(m,s,i)$ (for $i\in \{0,\ldots ,\lfloor m/2\rfloor \}$ , and $s\leq m-2i$ ) whenever $2i|m$ . Our construction builds on results of Kasami and Lin, who proved that for extended binary BCH codes of designed distance $d(m,s,i)$ (for integers $m\geq 2$ , $0\leq i\leq \lfloor m/2\rfloor $ , and $0\leq s\leq m-2i$ ), the minimum distance equals the designed distance. The proof of Kasami and Lin makes use of a non-constructive existence result of Berlekamp, and a constructive “down-conversion theorem” that converts some words in BCH codes to lower-weight words in BCH codes of lower designed distance. Our main contribution is in replacing the non-constructive counting argument of Berlekamp by a low-complexity algorithm. In one aspect, the current paper extends the results of Grigorescu and Kaufman, who presented explicit minimum-weight codewords for extended binary BCH codes of designed distance exactly 6 (and hence also for designed distance $6\cdot 2^{j}$ , by a well-known “up-conversion theorem”), as we cover more cases of the minimum distance. In fact, we prove that the codeword constructed by Grigorescu and Kaufman is a special case of the current construction. However, the minimum-weight codewords we construct do not generate the code, and are not affine generators, except, possibly, for a designed distance of 6.},

Moreover, these algebraic expressions are derived through $\Gamma $ -calculus techniques which provide implicit recursive formulas for these polynomials. Our main contribution consists in a fine combinatorial analysis of these inductive relations and for the first time to derive closed formulas for the leading coefficients of these polynomials expressions. Building upon these explicit formulas we revisit the so-called “MMSE conjecture” from Ledoux (2016) which asserts that two distributions on the real line with the same entropy along the heat flow must coincide up to translation and symmetry. Our approach enables us to provide new conditions on the source distributions ensuring that the MMSE conjecture holds and to refine several criteria proved in Ledoux (2016). As illustrating examples, our findings cover the cases of uniform and Rademacher distributions, for which previous results in the literature were inapplicable.},

  abstract     = {Information projections have found important applications in probability theory, statistics, and related areas. In the field of hypothesis testing in particular, the reverse information projection (RIPr) has recently been shown to lead to growth-rate optimal (GRO) e-statistics for testing simple alternatives against composite null hypotheses. However, the RIPr as well as the GRO criterion are undefined whenever the infimum information divergence between the null and alternative is infinite. We show that in such scenarios, under some assumptions, there still exists a measure in the null that is closest to the alternative in a specific sense. Whenever the information divergence is finite, this measure coincides with the usual RIPr. It therefore gives a natural extension of the RIPr to certain cases where the latter was previously not defined. This extended notion of the RIPr is shown to lead to optimal e-statistics in a sense that is a novel, but natural, extension of the GRO criterion. We also give conditions under which the (extension of the) RIPr is a strict sub-probability measure, as well as conditions under which an approximation of the RIPr leads to approximate e-statistics. For this case we provide tight relations between the corresponding approximation rates.},

For any source, a prefix code is competitively optimal if it has a nonnegative competitive advantage over all other prefix codes. In 1991, Cover proved that Huffman codes are competitively optimal for all dyadic sources, namely sources whose symbol probabilities are negative integer powers of 2. We prove the following asymptotic converse: As the source size grows, the probability a Huffman code for a randomly chosen non-dyadic source is competitively optimal converges to zero. We also prove: (i) For any non-dyadic source, a Huffman code has a positive competitive advantage over a Shannon-Fano code; (ii) For any source, the competitive advantage of any prefix code over a Huffman code is strictly less than $\frac {1}{3}$ ; (iii) For each integer $n\gt 3$ , there exists a source of size n and some prefix code whose competitive advantage over a Huffman code is arbitrarily close to $\frac {1}{3}$ ; and (iv) For each positive integer n, there exists a source of size n and some prefix code whose competitive advantage over a Shannon-Fano code becomes arbitrarily close to 1 as $n\to \infty $ .},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of coding for classical broadcast channels, which entails maximizing the success probability that can be achieved by sending a fixed number of messages over a broadcast channel. For point-to-point channels, Barman and Fawzi found a $(1-e^{-1})$ -approximation algorithm running in polynomial time, and showed that it is NP-hard to achieve a strictly better approximation ratio. Furthermore, these algorithmic results were at the core of the limitations they established on the power of non-signaling assistance for point-to-point channels. It is natural to ask if similar results hold for broadcast channels, exploiting links between approximation algorithms of the channel coding problem and the non-signaling assisted capacity region. In this work, we make several contributions on algorithmic aspects and non-signaling assisted capacity regions of broadcast channels. For the class of deterministic broadcast channels, we describe a $(1-e^{-1})^{2}$ -approximation algorithm running in polynomial time, and we show that the capacity region for that class is the same with or without non-signaling assistance. Finally, we show that in the value query model, we cannot achieve a better approximation ratio than $\Omega \left ({{\frac {1}{\sqrt {m}}}}\right)$ in polynomial time for the general broadcast channel coding problem, with m the size of one of the outputs of the channel.},

We first consider the case where the number of matched pairs of sequences between the databases is known. In this case, the task is to accurately find the matched pairs of sequences among all possible matches between the sequences in the two databases. We analyze the performance of the GLRT by Unnikrishnan and explicitly characterize the tradeoff between the mismatch and false reject probabilities under each hypothesis in both large and small deviations regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the optimality of Unnikrishnan’s GLRT test under the generalized Neyman-Person criterion for both regimes and illustrate our theoretical results via numerical examples. Subsequently, we generalize our achievability analyses to the case where the number of matched pairs is unknown, and an additional error probability needs to be considered. When one of the two databases contains a single sequence, the problem of statistical sequence matching specializes to the problem of multiple classification introduced by Gutman, (1989). For this special case, our result for the small deviations regime strengthens previous result of Zhou et al., (2020) by removing unnecessary conditions on the generating distributions.},

  abstract     = {Fourier phase retrieval (PR) is a severely ill-posed inverse problem that arises in various applications. To guarantee a unique solution and relieve the dependence on the initialization, background information can be exploited as a structural prior. However, the requirement for the background information may be challenging when moving to high-resolution imaging. At the same time, the previously proposed projected gradient descent (PGD) method also demands much background information. In this paper, we present an improved theoretical result about the demand for the background information, along with two Douglas Rachford (DR) based methods. Analytically, we demonstrate that the background information required to ensure a unique solution can be decreased by nearly $1/2$ for the 2-D signals compared to the 1-D signals. By generalizing the results into d-dimension, we show that the length of the background information more than $\left ({{2^{\frac {d+1}{d}}-1}}\right)$ folds of the signal is sufficient to ensure uniqueness. At the same time, we also analyze the stability and robustness of the model when the measurements and background information are corrupted by noise. Furthermore, two methods called Background Douglas Rachford (BDR) and Convex Background Douglas Rachford (CBDR) are proposed. BDR, which is a kind of non-convex method, is proven to have the local R-linear convergence rate under mild assumptions. Instead, the CBDR method uses the techniques of convexification and can be proven to have a global convergence guarantee as long as the background information is sufficient. To support this, a new property called F-RIP is established. We test the performance of the proposed methods through simulations as well as real experimental measurements, and demonstrate that they achieve a higher recovery rate with less background information compared to the PGD method.},

  abstract     = {At CRYPTO 2018, Todo et al. proposed an effective fast correlation attack using multiple linear approximations, and gave effective attacks on the Grain-like stream ciphers with the same size of LFSR and key. However, many stream ciphers require that the size of LFSR must be at least twice the key size. For this type of stream ciphers, we propose an improved fast correlation attack using multiple linear approximations. The main idea is to reduce the number of attacked bits of parity-check equations by XORing the same linear approximation at different clocks, and then further bypass some unknown variables of parity-check equations by multiple linear approximations with an expected probability. Finally, full unknown variables are recovered by solving systems of linear equations. SOSEMANUK is one of the finalists in the eSTREAM project. The best absolute correlation of linear approximations of SOSEMANUK we found is 2−20.84, which improves the linear approximations with current best absolute correlation of 2−21.41. Finally, the improved fast correlation attack method is applied to SOSEMANUK, and a fast correlation attack with time/data/memory complexity of $O(2^{139.75})/O(2^{139.37})/O(2^{139.37})$ is given, and the success probability is 0.99. It improves the current best fast correlation attack with time/data/memory complexity of $O(2^{147.88})/O(2^{145.5})/O(2^{147.1})$ (ASIACRYPT 2008). For the optional key size ranging from 128-bit to 256-bit of SOSEMANUK, our attack result shows that SOSEMANUK can only guarantee the security of 139-bit key. In addition, we declare that our new fast correlation attack method can be applied to the linear analysis of other LFSR-based stream ciphers.},

For this problem, we propose a new class of LDP schemes achieving the exactly optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT), with the communication cost less than or equal to the size of the input data. Moreover, it is shown as a simple corollary that one-bit communication is sufficient for achieving the exactly optimal PUT for a high privacy regime if the input data size is an even number. The main idea is to decompose a block design scheme proposed by Park et al. (2023), based on the combinatorial concept called resolution. We call the resultant decomposed LDP scheme with shared randomness as a resolution of the original block design scheme. A resolution of a block design scheme has a communication cost less than or equal to that of the original block design scheme. Also, the resolution of a block design scheme is exactly optimal whenever the original block design scheme is exactly optimal. Accordingly, we provide two resolutions of the exactly optimal subset selection scheme proposed by Ye and Barg (2018), called the Baranyai’s resolution and the cyclic shift resolution. We show that the Baranyai’s resolution achieves the minimum communication cost among all exactly optimal resolutions of block design schemes. One drawback of the Baranyai’s resolution is that its explicit structure is unknown in general. In contrast, the cyclic shift resolution has an explicit structure, but its communication cost can be larger than that of the Baranyai’s resolution. To complement this, we also suggest resolutions of other block design schemes achieving the exactly optimal PUT for some input data size and privacy budget. Those require the minimum communication cost as the Baranyai’s resolution and have explicit structures as the cyclic shift resolution.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT) with selfish transmitters, i.e., who are each solely interested in maximizing their individual secrecy rate. The question then arises as to whether selfish transmitters can increase their individual secrecy rate by participating in a collective, i.e, multiple access, protocol instead of operating on their own. If yes, the question arises whether there is a protocol that satisfies all the participating transmitters simultaneously, in the sense that no transmitter has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. Utilizing coalitional game theory, these questions are addressed for the degraded GMAC-WT with an arbitrary number of transmitters and for the non-degraded GMAC-WT with two transmitters. In particular, for the degraded GMAC-WT, cooperation is shown to be in the best interest of all transmitters, and the existence of protocols that incentivize all transmitters to participate is established. Furthermore, a unique, fair, stable, and achievable secrecy rate allocation is determined. For the non-degraded GMAC-WT, depending on the channel parameters, there are cases where cooperation is not in the best interest of all transmitters, and cases where it is. In the latter cases, a unique, fair, stable, and achievable secrecy rate allocation is determined.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of deciding whether two random databases $\textsf {X}\in {\mathcal { X}} ^{n\times d}$ and $\textsf {Y}\in {\mathcal { Y}} ^{n\times d}$ are statistically dependent or not. This is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem, where under the null hypothesis, these two databases are statistically independent, while under the alternative, there exists an unknown row permutation $\sigma $ , such that $\textsf {X}$ and $\textsf {Y}^{\sigma } $ , a permuted version of $\textsf {Y}$ , are statistically dependent with some known joint distribution, but have the same marginal distributions as the null. We characterize the thresholds at which optimal testing is information-theoretically impossible and possible, as a function of n, d, and some spectral properties of the generative distributions of the datasets. For example, we prove that if a certain function of the eigenvalues of the likelihood function and d, is below a certain threshold, as $d\to \infty $ , then weak detection (performing slightly better than random guessing) is statistically impossible, no matter what the value of n is. This mimics the performance of an efficient test that thresholds a centered version of the log-likelihood function of the observed matrices. We also analyze the case where d is fixed, for which we derive strong (vanishing error) and weak detection lower and upper bounds.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized generalized approximate message-passing (GAMP) is proposed for compressed sensing from distributed generalized linear measurements in a tree-structured network. Consensus propagation is used to realize average consensus required in GAMP via local communications between adjacent nodes. Decentralized GAMP is applicable to all tree-structured networks that do not necessarily have central nodes connected to all other nodes. State evolution is used to analyze the asymptotic dynamics of decentralized GAMP for zero-mean independent and identically distributed Gaussian sensing matrices. The state evolution recursion for decentralized GAMP is proved to have the same fixed points as that for centralized GAMP when homogeneous measurements with an identical dimension in all nodes are considered. Furthermore, existing long-memory proof strategy is used to prove that the state evolution recursion for decentralized GAMP with the Bayes-optimal denoisers converges to a fixed point. These results imply that the state evolution recursion for decentralized GAMP with the Bayes-optimal denoisers converges to the Bayes-optimal fixed point for the homogeneous measurements when the fixed point is unique. Numerical results for decentralized GAMP are presented in the cases of linear measurements and clipping. As examples of tree-structured networks, a one-dimensional chain and a tree with no central nodes are considered.},

  abstract     = {We study best arm identification in a restless multi-armed bandit setting with finitely many arms. The discrete-time data generated by each arm forms a homogeneous Markov chain taking values in a common, finite-state space. The state transitions in each arm are captured by an ergodic transition probability matrix (TPM) that is a member of a single-parameter exponential family of TPMs. The real-valued parameters of the arm TPMs are unknown and belong to a given space. Given a function f defined on the common state space of the arms, the goal is to identify the best arm—the arm with the largest average value of f evaluated under the arm’s stationary distribution—with the fewest number of samples, subject to an upper bound on the decision’s error probability (i.e., the fixed-confidence regime). A lower bound on the growth rate of the expected stopping time is established in the asymptote of a vanishing error probability. Furthermore, a policy for best arm identification is proposed, and its expected stopping time is proved to have an asymptotic growth rate that matches the lower bound. It is demonstrated that tracking the long-term behavior of a certain Markov decision process and its state-action visitation proportions are the key ingredients in analyzing the converse and achievability bounds. It is shown that under every policy, the state-action visitation proportions satisfy a specific approximate flow conservation constraint and that these proportions match the optimal proportions dictated by the lower bound under any asymptotically optimal policy. The prior studies on best arm identification in restless bandits focus on independent observations from the arms, rested Markov arms, and restless Markov arms with known arm TPMs. In contrast, this work is the first to study best arm identification in restless bandits with unknown arm TPMs.},

Our analysis provides sharp characterizations of its performance, backed by matching upper and lower bounds possessing an identical exponent with the same leading constant. The key to our results is a novel truncated $\ell _{2}$ perturbation analysis for eigenvectors, coupled with a new analysis idea of eigenvectors truncation.},

Traditional methods often encounter difficulties when attempting to identify changepoints in the presence of heavy-tailed distribution. This paper focuses on the study of high-dimensional linear models with multiple structural changes in the presence of heavy-tailed errors, especially for those errors without moment conditions. We first propose a robust method that simultaneously estimates regression coefficient and changepoint by incorporating $\ell _{1}$ norm penalized Wilcoxon rank loss minimization for single changepoint estimation. Furthermore, we extend it to multiple changepoints estimation based on a novel two-step moving window mechanism that combines fast coarse grid screening and an efficient refinement. Our method exhibits robustness against heavy-tailed random errors while maintaining high efficiency for normal random errors. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds with a near-oracle rate for the estimates of both the coefficient and the changepoint under weak conditions on the random error distribution. Numerical results provide evidence for the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

It has been conjectured that this problem is, with high probability, satisfiable (SAT; that is, there exists an ellipsoid passing through all n points) for $\alpha \lt 1/4$ , and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) for $\alpha \gt 1/4$ . In this work we give a precise analytical argument, based on the non-rigorous replica method of statistical physics, that indeed predicts a SAT/UNSAT transition at $\alpha = 1/4$ , as well as the shape of a typical fitting ellipsoid in the SAT phase (i.e., the lengths of its principal axes). Besides the replica method, our main tool is the dilute limit of extensive-rank “HCIZ integrals” of random matrix theory. We further study different explicit algorithmic constructions of the matrix characterizing the ellipsoid. In particular, we show that a procedure based on minimizing its nuclear norm yields a solution in the whole SAT phase. Finally, we characterize the SAT/UNSAT transition for ellipsoid fitting of a large class of rotationally-invariant random vectors. Our work suggests mathematically rigorous ways to analyze fitting ellipsoids to random vectors, which is the topic of a companion work.},

These situations arise when an agent is unable to observe the most recent state of the system due to latency or lossy channels, yet the agent must still make real-time decisions. This paper introduces a theoretical investigation into efficient RL in control systems where agents must act with delayed and missing state observations. We present algorithms and establish near-optimal regret upper and lower bounds, of the form $\tilde {\mathcal {O}}(\sqrt {{\mathrm { poly}}(H) SAK})$ , for RL in the delayed and missing observation settings. Here S and A are the sizes of state and action spaces, H is the time horizon and K is the number of episodes. Despite impaired observability posing significant challenges to the policy class and planning, our results demonstrate that learning remains efficient, with the regret bound optimally depending on the state-action size of the original system. Additionally, we provide a characterization of the performance of the optimal policy under impaired observability, comparing it to the optimal value obtained with full observability. Numerical results are provided to support our theory.},

We introduce the tropical counterparts of three classical non-adaptive algorithms (COMP, DD and SCOMP), and analyse their behaviour through both simulations and bounds on error probabilities. By comparing the results of the tropical and classical algorithms, we gain insight into the extra information provided by learning the outcomes (Ct levels) of the tests. We show that in a limiting regime the tropical COMP algorithm requires as many tests as its classical counterpart, but that for sufficiently dense problems tropical DD can recover more information with fewer tests, and can be viewed as essentially optimal in certain regimes.},

The goal is to reliably identify all of the semi-defective sets using as few tests as possible, and we refer to this problem as Concomitant Group Testing (ConcGT). We derive a variety of algorithms for this task, focusing primarily on the case that there are two semi-defective sets. Our algorithms are distinguished by (i) whether they are deterministic (zero-error) or randomized (small-error), and (ii) whether they are non-adaptive, fully adaptive, or have limited adaptivity (namely, 2 or 3 stages). Both our deterministic adaptive algorithm and our randomized algorithms (non-adaptive or limited adaptivity) are order-optimal in broad scaling regimes of interest, and improve significantly over baseline results that are based on solving a more general problem as an intermediate step (e.g., hypergraph learning).},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning, or domain adaptation, is concerned with machine learning problems in which training and testing data come from possibly different probability distributions. In this work, we give an information-theoretic analysis of the generalization error and excess risk of transfer learning algorithms. Our results suggest, perhaps as expected, that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $D(\mu \|\mu &#39;)$ plays an important role in the characterizations where $\mu $ and $\mu &#39;$ denote the distribution of the training data and the testing data, respectively. Specifically, we provide generalization error and excess risk upper bounds for learning algorithms where data from both distributions are available in the training phase. Recognizing that the bounds could be sub-optimal in general, we provide improved excess risk upper bounds for a certain class of algorithms, including the empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm, by making stronger assumptions through the central condition. To demonstrate the usefulness of the bounds, we further extend the analysis to the Gibbs algorithm and the noisy stochastic gradient descent method. We then generalize the mutual information bound with other divergences such as $\phi $ -divergence and Wasserstein distance, which may lead to tighter bounds and can handle the case when $\mu $ is not absolutely continuous with respect to $\mu &#39;$ . Several numerical results are provided to demonstrate our theoretical findings. Lastly, to address the problem that the bounds are often not directly applicable in practice due to the absence of the distributional knowledge of the data, we develop an algorithm (called InfoBoost) that dynamically adjusts the importance weights for both source and target data based on certain information measures. The empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the high-dimensional double sparse structures, where the parameter of interest simultaneously encourages group-wise and element-wise sparsity. By combining the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and its variants, we develop a novel lower bound technique for the metric entropy of the parameter space, specifically tailored for the double sparse structure over $\ell _{u}(\ell _{q})$ -balls with $u,q \in [0,2$ ). We give lower bounds on the estimation error using an information-theoretic approach, leveraging the proposed technique and Fano’s inequality. To complement the lower bounds, we establish matching upper bounds through a direct analysis of constrained least-squares estimators and utilizing results from empirical processes. A significant discovery is that a phase transition phenomenon exists on the minimax rates for $u,q \in (0, 2)$ . Furthermore, we extend the theoretical findings to the double sparse regression models and determine the minimax rates for estimation error. A novel Double Sparse Iterative Hard Thresholding (DSIHT) procedure is developed, with minimax optimality guaranteed. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the underlying distribution from iid samples is a classical and important problem in statistics. When the alphabet size is large compared to number of samples, a portion of the distribution is highly likely to be unobserved or sparsely observed. The missing mass, defined as the sum of probabilities $\Pr (x)$ over the missing letters x, and the Good-Turing estimator for missing mass have been important tools in large-alphabet distribution estimation. In this article, given a positive function g from $[{0,1}]$ to the reals, the missing g-mass, defined as the sum of $g(\Pr (x))$ over the missing letters x, is introduced and studied. The missing g-mass can be used to investigate the structure of the missing part of the distribution. Specific applications for special cases such as order- $\alpha $ missing mass ( $g(p)=p^{\alpha }$ ) and the missing Shannon entropy ( $g(p)=-p\log p$ ) include estimating distance from uniformity of the missing distribution and its partial estimation. Minimax estimation is studied for order- $\alpha $ missing mass for integer values of $\alpha $ and exact minimax convergence rates are obtained. Concentration is studied for a class of functions g and specific results are derived for order- $\alpha $ missing mass and missing Shannon entropy. Sub-Gaussian tail bounds with near-optimal worst-case variance factors are derived. Two new notions of concentration, named strongly sub-Gamma and filtered sub-Gaussian concentration, are introduced and shown to result in right tail bounds that are better than those obtained from sub-Gaussian concentration.},

One question that was left open is how they handle worst-case or adversarial errors, i.e. what is the order of magnitude of the smallest weight of an error pattern that will be wrongly decoded. We initiate such a study involving a simple hard-decision and deterministic version of a renormalisation decoder. We exhibit an uncorrectable error pattern whose weight scales like $d^{1/2}$ and prove that the decoder corrects all error patterns of weight less than $\frac {5}{6} d^{\, \log _{2}(6/5)}$ , where d is the minimum distance of the toric code.},

New upper and lower bounds on the optimal tradeoff between Normalized Delivery Time (NDT) and computation load are presented. The upper bound strictly improves over the previous reported upper bounds and is based on two novel interference alignment (IA) schemes tailored to the interference cancellation capabilities of the nodes. Our second IA scheme additionally applies a zero-forcing strategy that allows to accumulate all interference at any of the nodes on the same (small) subspace, leaving the remaining space for useful signals. The lower bound is proved through information-theoretic converse arguments based on carefully chosen multi-access channel (MAC) type arguments and by finding solutions to the optimization problems resulting from these arguments. The lower bound matches an existing upper bound based on zero-forcing and interference cancellation (but no IA) in the regime where each node can store at least half of the files. While optimal in this regime, zero-forcing and interference cancellation are not sufficient to obtain the optimal NDT in scenarios where each node cannot store half of the files. This follows from the previously established optimal NDT under zero-forcing and interference cancellation and our new IA-schemes.},

  abstract     = {The problem of correcting deletions and insertions has recently received significantly increased attention due to the DNA-based data storage technology, which suffers from deletions and insertions with extremely high probability. In this work, we study the problem of constructing non-binary burst-deletion/insertion correcting codes. Particularly, for the quaternary alphabet, our designed codes are suited for correcting a burst of deletions/insertions in DNA storage. Non-binary codes correcting a single deletion or insertion were introduced by Tenengolts (1984), and the results were extended to correct a fixed-length burst of deletions or insertions by Schoeny et al. (2017). Recently, Wang et al. (2021) proposed constructions of non-binary codes of length n, correcting a burst of length at most two for q-ary alphabets with redundancy $\log n+O(\log q \log \log n)$ bits, for arbitrary even q. The common idea in those constructions is to convert non-binary sequences into binary sequences, and the error decoding algorithms for the q-ary sequences are mainly based on the success of recovering the corresponding binary sequences, respectively. In this work, we look at a natural solution that the error detection and correction algorithms are performed directly over q-ary sequences, and for certain cases, our codes provide a more efficient encoder with lower redundancy than the best-known encoder in the literature. Particularly, (Single-error correction codes) We first present a new version of non-binary VT codes that are capable of correcting a single deletion or single insertion, providing an alternative simpler and more efficient encoder of the construction by Tenengolts (1984). Our construction is based on the differential vector, and the codes are referred to as the differential VT codes. In addition, we provide linear-time algorithms that encode user messages into these codes of length n over the q-ary alphabet for $q \geqslant 2$ with at most $\lceil \log _{q} n\rceil +1$ redundant symbols, while the optimal redundancy required is at least $\log _{q} n+\log _{q} (q-1)$ symbols. Our designed encoder reduces the redundancy of the best-known encoder of Tenengolts (1984) by at least 2 redundant symbols or equivalently $2\log _{2} q$ bits. (Burst-error correction codes) We use the idea of the binary shifted VT codes to define the q-ary differential shifted VT codes, and propose non-binary codes correcting a burst of up to two deletions (or two insertions) with redundancy $\log n+3\log \log n+ O(\log q)$ bits, which improves a recent result of Wang et al. (2021) with redundancy $\log n+O(\log q \log \log n)$ bits for all $q\geqslant 8$ . We then extend the construction to design non-binary codes correcting a burst of either exactly or at most t deletions (or insertions) for arbitrary $t\geqslant 2$ .},

  abstract     = {Higher order MDS codes are an interesting generalization of MDS codes recently introduced by Brakensiek et al., (2023). In later works, they were shown to be intimately connected to optimally list-decodable codes and maximally recoverable tensor codes. Therefore (explicit) constructions of higher order MDS codes over small fields is an important open problem. Higher order MDS codes are denoted by $\rm {MDS}(\ell)$ where $\ell $ denotes the order of generality, $\rm {MDS}(2)$ codes are equivalent to the usual MDS codes. The best prior lower bound on the field size of an ${[}n,k{]}$ - $\rm {MDS}(\ell)$ codes is $\Omega _{\ell } (n^{\ell -1})$ , whereas the best known (non-explicit) upper bound is $O_{\ell } (n^{k(\ell -1)})$ which is exponential in the dimension. In this work, we nearly close this exponential gap between upper and lower bounds. We show that an ${[}n,k{]}$ - $\rm {MDS}(3)$ codes requires a field of size $\Omega _{k}(n^{k-1})$ , which is close to the known upper bound. Using the connection between higher order MDS codes and optimally list-decodable codes, we show that even for a list size of 2, a code which meets the optimal list-decoding Singleton bound requires exponential field size; this resolves an open question by Shangguan and Tamo, (2020). We also give explicit constructions of ${[}n,k{]}$ - $\rm {MDS}(\ell)$ code over fields of size $n^{(\ell k)^{O(\ell k)}}$ . The smallest non-trivial case where we still do not have optimal constructions is ${[}n,3{]}$ - $\rm {MDS}(3)$ . In this case, the known lower bound on the field size is $\Omega (n^{2})$ and the best known upper bounds are $O(n^{5})$ for a non-explicit construction and $O(n^{32})$ for an explicit construction. In this paper, we give an explicit construction over fields of size $O(n^{3})$ which comes very close to being optimal.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the secure aggregation problem for federated learning under an information theoretic cryptographic formulation, where distributed training nodes (referred to as users) train models based on their own local data and a curious-but-honest server aggregates the trained models without retrieving other information about users’ local data. Secure aggregation generally contains two phases, namely key sharing phase and model aggregation phase. Due to the common effect of user dropouts in federated learning, the model aggregation phase should contain two rounds, where in the first round the users transmit masked models and, in the second round, according to the identity of surviving users after the first round, these surviving users transmit some further messages to help the server decrypt the sum of users’ trained models. The objective of the considered information theoretic formulation is to characterize the capacity region of the communication rates from the users to the server in the two rounds of the model aggregation phase, assuming that key sharing has already been performed offline in prior. In this context, Zhao and Sun completely characterized the capacity region under the assumption that the keys can be arbitrary random variables. More recently, an additional constraint, known as “uncoded groupwise keys,” has been introduced. This constraint entails the presence of multiple independent keys within the system, with each key being shared by precisely $\mathsf S$ users, where $\mathsf S$ is a defined system parameter. The capacity region for the information theoretic secure aggregation problem with uncoded groupwise keys was established in our recent work subject to the condition ${\mathsf S}\gt {\mathsf K}-{\mathsf U}$ , where $\mathsf K$ is the number of total users and $\mathsf U$ is the designed minimum number of surviving users (which is another system parameter). In this paper we fully characterize the capacity region for this problem by matching a new converse bound and an achievable scheme. Experimental results over the Tencent Cloud show the improvement on the model aggregation time compared to the original secure aggregation scheme.},

  abstract     = {The class of $\ell $ -maximum distance separable ( $\ell $ -MDS) codes is a generalization of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that has attracted a lot of attention due to its applications in several areas such as secret sharing schemes, index coding problems, informed source coding problems and combinatorial t-designs. In this paper, for $\ell =1$ , we completely solve a conjecture recently proposed by Heng et al. (Discrete Mathematics, 346 (10) : 113538, 2023) and obtain infinite families of 1-MDS codes with general dimensions holding 2-designs. These later codes are also proved to be optimal locally recoverable codes. For general positive integers $\ell $ and $\ell &#39;$ , we construct new $\ell $ -MDS codes from known $\ell &#39;$ -MDS codes via some classical propagation rules involving the extended, expurgated, and $({\mathbf {u}},{\mathbf {u}}+{\mathbf {v}})$ constructions. Finally, we study some general results including characterization, weight distributions, and bounds on maximum lengths of $\ell $ -MDS codes, which generalize, simplify, or improve some known results in the literature.},

  abstract     = {An edit refers to a single insertion, deletion, or substitution. This paper aims to construct binary codes that can correct two edits. To do this, a necessary and sufficient condition for a code to be two-edit correctable is provided, showing that a code is a two-edit correcting code if and only if it can correct two deletions, up to two substitutions, and one deletion and up to one substitution, separately. This criterion allows for the construction of two-edit correcting codes leveraging these three types of error correcting codes. In the field of constructing codes for correcting two deletions, we present a construction with $4\log n+O(\log \log n)$ redundant bits that can be viewed as a subcode proposed by Guruswami and Håstad, and provide an alternative proof. Moreover, our two-deletion correcting codes can also correct up to two substitutions after making a slight modification. In the field of constructing codes for correcting one deletion and up to one substitution, we present a construction with $4 \log n+O(\log \log n)$ redundant bits, which outperforms the best previously known results $6 \log n+O(1)$ . Leveraging these codes, we obtain a construction of two-edit correcting codes with $6 \log n+O(\log \log n)$ redundant bits. This outperforms the best previously known result, which requires at least $8\log n$ redundant bits. Moreover, we also consider the list-decoding problem under the two-edit channel and construct a two-edit list-decodable code with a list size of two employing $4 \log n+O(\log \log n)$ redundant bits.},

These codes are a type of storage codes that can handle any multi-set of t requests, comprised of s distinct information symbols. Importantly, PIR codes and batch codes are special cases of $(s,t)$ -batch codes.

Specifically, we establish a lower bound on the number of redundancy symbols required and present several constructions of $(s,t)$ -batch codes.

  abstract     = {An $(n, k, d; r)_{q}$ -locally repairable code (LRC) is called a Singleton-optimal LRC if it achieves the Singleton-type bound. Analogous to the classical MDS conjecture, the maximal length problem of Singleton-optimal LRCs has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. In this paper, we give an improved upper bound for the length of q-ary Singleton-optimal LRCs with disjoint repair groups such that $(r+1)\mid n$ based on the parity-check matrix approach. In particular, for any Singleton-optimal $(n, k, d; r)_{q}$ -LRCs, we show that: 1) $n\le q+d-4$ , when $r=2$ and $d=3e+8$ with $e\ge 0$ ; 2) $n\leq (r+1)\left \lfloor {{\frac {2(q^{2}+q+1)}{r(r+1)} +e+1}}\right \rfloor $ , when $d\ge 8$ and $\max \left \{{{3,\frac {d-e-6}{e+1}}}\right \}\le r\le \frac {d-e-3}{e+1}$ for any $0\le e\le \left \lfloor {{\frac {d-6}{4} }}\right \rfloor $ . Furthermore, we establish equivalent connections between the existence of Singleton-optimal $(n,k,d;r)_{q}$ -LRCs for $d=6, r=3$ and $d=7, r=2$ with disjoint repair groups and some subsets of lines in finite projective space with certain properties. Consequently, we prove that the length of q-ary Singleton-optimal LRCs with minimum distance $d=6$ and locality $r=3$ is upper bounded by $O(q^{1.5})$ . We construct Singleton-optimal $(8\le n\le q+1,k,d=6,r=3)_{q}$ -LRC with disjoint repair groups such that $4\mid n$ and determine the exact value of the maximum code length for some specific q.

While this condition yields examples where feedback is beneficial, it does not offer explicit structural properties of such service times. In this paper, we show that full feedback increases capacity whenever the service time has bounded support. This is achieved by investigating a generalized notion of feedback, with full feedback and weak feedback as particular cases.},

  abstract     = {We study channel simulation under common randomness assistance in the finite-blocklength regime and identify the smooth channel max-information as a linear program one-shot converse on the minimal simulation cost for fixed error tolerance. We show that this one-shot converse can be achieved exactly using no-signaling-assisted codes, and approximately achieved using common randomness-assisted codes. Our one-shot converse thus takes on an analogous role to the celebrated meta-converse in the complementary problem of channel coding, and we find tight relations between these two bounds. We asymptotically expand our bounds on the simulation cost for discrete memoryless channels, leading to the second-order as well as the moderate-deviation rate expansion, which can be expressed in terms of the channel capacity and channel dispersion known from noisy channel coding. Our bounds imply the well-known fact that the optimal asymptotic rate of one channel to simulate another under common randomness assistance is given by the ratio of their respective capacities. Additionally, our higher-order asymptotic expansion shows that this reversibility falls apart in the second order. Our techniques extend to discrete memoryless broadcast channels. In stark contrast to the elusive broadcast channel capacity problem, we show that the reverse problem of broadcast channel simulation under common randomness assistance allows for an efficiently computable single-letter characterization of the asymptotic rate region in terms of the broadcast channel’s multipartite mutual information.},

In this study, a non-trivial generalization of the guesswork called guessing cost (also referred to as cost of guessing) is introduced, and an optimal strategy for finding the $\rho $ -th moment of guessing cost is provided for a random variable defined on a finite set whereby each choice is associated with a positive finite cost value (unit cost corresponds to the original guesswork). Moreover, we drive asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the logarithm of guessing cost moments. Similar to previous studies on the guesswork, established bounds on the moments of guessing cost quantify the accumulated cost of guesses required for correctly identifying the unknown choice and are expressed in terms of Rényi’s entropy. Moreover, new random variables are introduced to establish connections between the guessing cost and the guesswork, leading to induced strategies. Establishing this implicit connection helped us obtain improved bounds for the non-asymptotic region. As a consequence, we establish the guessing cost exponent in terms of Rényi entropy rate on the moments of the guessing cost using the optimal strategy by considering a sequence of independent random variables with different cost distributions. Finally, with slight modifications to the original problem, these results are shown to be applicable for bounding the overall repair bandwidth for distributed data storage systems backed up by base stations and protected by bipartite graph codes.},

  abstract     = {Non-uniform sampling selects samples at irregular intervals for concise signal representation. Prior works on non-uniform sampling predominantly focused on maximizing reconstruction accuracy or optimizing sample size. However, a trade-off exists between the two factors, as increasing the sample size can improve the reconstruction accuracy, but it decreases the bandwidth efficiency. The reverse is true for under-sampling. Thus, it is important to balance the two factors. This motivates us to consider CAISOS, a CArdinalIty conStraint nOn-uniform Sampling problem that aims to select at most k sample points of a given time-varying signal such that the regenerated signal has the maximum reconstruction accuracy. Applications of CAISOS include fixed-rate sampling and signal compression in the time domain, such as in robotics and fixed-rate speech encoders. It proposes an integer linear programming model to address CAISOS and shows that the time complexity of the same increases exponentially with increasing signal size. It further proves that CAISOS is an NP-complete problem by showing that it is both NP and NP-hard by using a polynomial-time reduction from the 0/1 knapsack problem. Thus, the paper proposes a polynomial time heuristic based on the least-cost branch-and-bound approximation to solve CAISOS. Finally, it demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches through simulation by comparing them with the existing counterparts using various time-varying signals available in multiple databases.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Source Coding (DSC), a scheme that encodes multiple correlated sources separately while decoding their bitstreams jointly, is an important branch of network information theory. Due to the advantages of shifting complexity burden from the encoder to the decoder and canceling the flow of data across terminals, DSC has potential applications in many scenarios, e.g., wireless sensor network, distributed genome data compression, etc. There are two forms (lossless and lossy) of DSC. Overlapped arithmetic codes, featured by overlapped intervals, are a variant of arithmetic codes that can implement distributed lossless compression, or the so-called Slepian-Wolf coding. For uniform binary sources, an overlapped arithmetic code is essentially a nonlinear many-to-one mapping that partitions source space into unequal-sized cosets. To analyze overlapped arithmetic codes, two theoretical tools have been proposed, i.e., Coset Cardinality Spectrum (CCS) and Hamming Distance Spectrum (HDS). The former describes how source space is partitioned into cosets (equally or unequally), and the latter describes how codewords are structured within each coset (densely or sparsely). However, until now, these two tools are almost parallel to each other, and it seems that there is no intersection between them. The main contribution of this paper is tightly bridging HDS with CCS. Specifically, HDS can be quickly and accurately calculated with CCS in some cases. In addition, the paper also proves the necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of HDS and reveals the close relation between divergent HDS and polynomial division. All theoretical analyses are verified by experimental results.},

  abstract     = {One-bit quantization with time-varying sampling thresholds (also known as random dithering) has recently found significant utilization potential in statistical signal processing applications due to its relatively low power consumption and low implementation cost. In addition to such advantages, an attractive feature of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is their superior sampling rates as compared to their conventional multi-bit counterparts. This characteristic endows one-bit signal processing frameworks with what one may refer to as sample abundance. We show that sample abundance plays a pivotal role in many signal recovery and optimization problems that are formulated as (possibly non-convex) quadratic programs with linear feasibility constraints. Of particular interest to our work are low-rank matrix recovery and compressed sensing applications that take advantage of one-bit quantization. We demonstrate that the sample abundance paradigm allows for the transformation of such problems to merely linear feasibility problems by forming large-scale overdetermined linear systems—thus removing the need for handling costly optimization constraints and objectives. To make the proposed computational cost savings achievable, we offer enhanced randomized Kaczmarz algorithms to solve these highly overdetermined feasibility problems and provide theoretical guarantees in terms of their convergence, sample size requirements, and overall performance. Several numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Isogeny-based cryptography is famous for its short key size. As one of the most compact digital signatures, SQIsign (Short Quaternion and Isogeny Signature) is attractive among post-quantum cryptography, but it is inefficient compared to other post-quantum competitors because of complicated procedures in the ideal-to-isogeny translation, which is the efficiency bottleneck of the signing phase. In this paper, we recall the current implementation of SQIsign and mainly focus on how to improve the execution of the ideal-to-isogeny translation in SQIsign. Specifically, we demonstrate how to utilize the reduced Tate pairing to save one of the two elliptic curve discrete logarithms. In addition, the efficient implementation of the remainder discrete logarithm computation is explored. We speed up other procedures in the ideal-to-isogeny translation with various techniques as well. It should be noted that our improvements also benefit the performance of key generation and verification in SQIsign. In the instantiation with $ {p_{1973}}$ , the improvements lead to a speedup of 5.47%, 8.80% and 25.34% for key generation, signature and verification, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In many existing communication models, the channel state (i.e., busy or idle) is conveyed to the sampler via ACKs which are often assumed to be instantaneous. Previous literature shows that in this ideal feedback setting, an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the age of information (AoI), should not sample when the channel is busy, and therefore, must always wait for the ACK of the previous sample before taking the next sample. However, this may not be optimal when the feedback channel (backward channel) has a random delay. In this work, we study the structure of the optimal sampling policy to minimize the AoI when the channel state (forward channel state) is not immediately perceived by the sampler due to random delays in the feedback channel. In this setting, we show that it is not always optimal to wait for ACKs before sampling, and thus, early sampling with the available channel state information may be better. We show that, under certain conditions on the distribution of the ACK delays, the (asymptotically) optimal sampling policy reduces to a mixture of two threshold policies.},

  abstract     = {Gradient coding is a method for mitigating straggling servers in a centralized computing network that uses erasure-coding techniques to distributively carry out first-order optimization methods. Randomized numerical linear algebra uses randomization to develop improved algorithms for large-scale linear algebra computations. In this paper, we propose a method for distributed optimization that combines gradient coding and randomized numerical linear algebra. The proposed method uses a randomized $\ell _{2}$ -subspace embedding and a gradient coding technique to distribute blocks of data to the computational nodes of a centralized network, and at each iteration the central server only requires a small number of computations to obtain the steepest descent update. The novelty of our approach is that the data is replicated according to importance scores, called block leverage scores, in contrast to most gradient coding approaches that uniformly replicate the data blocks. Furthermore, we do not require a decoding step at each iteration, avoiding a bottleneck in previous gradient coding schemes. We show that our approach results in a valid $\ell _{2}$ -subspace embedding, and that our resulting approximation converges to the optimal solution.},

Nevertheless, we also show that the computation of the MMSE is a $\# P_{1}$ complete problem on the set of strictly positive, polynomial-time computable, continuous spectral densities. This means that if, as widely assumed, $FP_{1} \neq \# P_{1}$ , then there exist strictly positive, polynomial-time computable continuous spectral densities for which the computation of the MMSE is not polynomial-time computable.

  abstract     = {Secure aggregation, which is a core component of federated learning, aggregates locally trained models from distributed users at a central server. The “secure” nature of such aggregation consists of the fact that no information about the local users’ data must be leaked to the server except the aggregated local models. In order to guarantee security, some keys may be shared among the users (this is referred to as the key sharing phase). After the key sharing phase, each user masks its trained model which is then sent to the server (this is referred to as the model aggregation phase). This paper follows the information theoretic secure aggregation problem originally formulated by Zhao and Sun, with the objective to characterize the minimum communication cost from the $\mathsf K$ users in the model aggregation phase. Due to user dropouts, which are common in real systems, the server may not receive all messages from the users. A secure aggregation scheme should tolerate the dropouts of at most ${\mathsf K}-{\mathsf U}$ users, where $\mathsf U$ is a system parameter. The optimal communication cost is characterized by Zhao and Sun, but with the assumption that the keys stored by the users could be any random variables with arbitrary dependency. On the motivation that uncoded groupwise keys are more convenient to be shared and could be used in large range of applications besides federated learning, in this paper we add one constraint into the above problem, namely, that the key variables are mutually independent and each key is shared by a group of $\mathsf S$ users, where $\mathsf S$ is another system parameter. To the best of our knowledge, all existing secure aggregation schemes (with information theoretic security or computational security) assign coded keys to the users. We show that if ${\mathsf S}\gt {\mathsf K}-{\mathsf U}$ , a new secure aggregation scheme with uncoded groupwise keys can achieve the same optimal communication cost as the best scheme with coded keys; if ${\mathsf S}\leq {\mathsf K}-{\mathsf U}$ , uncoded groupwise key sharing is strictly sub-optimal. Finally, we also implement our proposed secure aggregation scheme into Amazon EC2, which are then compared with the existing secure aggregation schemes with offline key sharing.},

In this framework, the generalization error of an algorithm is linked to a variable-size ‘compression rate’ of its input data. This is shown to yield bounds that depend on the empirical measure of the given input data at hand, rather than its unknown distribution. Our new generalization bounds that we establish are tail bounds, tail bounds on the expectation, and in-expectations bounds. Moreover, it is shown that our framework also allows to derive general bounds on any function of the input data and output hypothesis random variables. In particular, these general bounds are shown to subsume and possibly improve over several existing PAC-Bayes and data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bounds that are recovered as special cases, thus unveiling a unifying character of our approach. For instance, a new data-dependent intrinsic dimension-based bound is established, which connects the generalization error to the optimization trajectories and reveals various interesting connections with the rate-distortion dimension of a process, the Rényi information dimension of a process, and the metric mean dimension.},

In the information era, to face the big data challenges that stem from functional data analysis very recently, we propose a novel distributed gradient descent functional learning (DGDFL) algorithm to tackle functional data across numerous local machines (processors) in the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Based on integral operator approaches, we provide the first theoretical understanding of the DGDFL algorithm in many different aspects of the literature. On the way of understanding DGDFL, firstly, a data-based gradient descent functional learning (GDFL) algorithm associated with a single-machine model is proposed and comprehensively studied. Under mild conditions, confidence-based optimal learning rates of DGDFL are obtained without the saturation boundary on the regularity index suffered in previous works in functional regression. We further provide a semi-supervised DGDFL approach to weaken the restriction on the maximal number of local machines to ensure optimal rates. To our best knowledge, the DGDFL provides the first divide-and-conquer iterative training approach to functional learning based on data samples of intrinsically infinite-dimensional random functions (functional covariates) and enriches the methodologies for functional data analysis.},

  abstract     = {Recent results established that EM enjoys global convergence for Gaussian Mixture Models. For Mixed Linear Regression, however, only local convergence results have been established, and those only for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In this work, we completely characterize the global optimality of EM: we show that starting from any randomly initialized point, the EM algorithm converges to the true parameter ${\beta }^{*}$ at the minimax statistical rates under all SNR regimes. Toward this goal, we first show the global convergence of the EM algorithm at the population level. Then we provide a complete characterization of statistical and computational behaviors of EM under all SNR regimes with finite samples. In particular: (i) When the SNR is sufficiently large, the EM updates converge to the true parameter $ {\beta }^{*}$ at the standard parametric convergence rate $O((d/n)^{1/2})$ after $O(\log (n/d))$ iterations. (ii) In the regime where the SNR is above $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ and below some constant, the EM iterates converge to a $O({\mathrm { SNR}}^{-1} (d/n)^{1/2})$ neighborhood of the true parameter, when the number of iterations is of the order $O({\mathrm { SNR}}^{-2} \log (n/d))$ . (iii) In the low SNR regime where the SNR is below $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ , we show that EM converges to a $O((d/n)^{1/4})$ neighborhood of the true parameters, after $O((n/d)^{1/2})$ iterations. By providing tight convergence guarantees of the EM algorithm in middle-to-low SNR regimes, we reveal that in low SNR, EM changes rate, matching the $n^{-1/4}$ rate of the MLE, a behavior that previous work had been unable to show.},

In many real world applications, however, an agent can observe only a score that represents the quality of the whole trajectory, which is referred to as the trajectory-wise reward. In such a situation, it is difficult for standard RL methods to well utilize trajectory-wise reward, and large bias and variance errors can be incurred in policy evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm, called Pessimistic vAlue iteRaTion with rEward Decomposition (PARTED), which decomposes the trajectory return into per-step proxy rewards via least-squares-based reward redistribution, and then performs pessimistic value iteration based on the learned proxy reward. To ensure the value functions constructed by PARTED are always pessimistic with respect to the optimal ones, we design a new penalty term to offset the uncertainty of the proxy reward. We first show that our PARTED achieves an $\tilde {\mathcal {O}}(dH^{3}/\sqrt {N})$ suboptimality for linear MDPs, where d is the dimension of the feature, H is the episode length, and N is the size of the offline dataset. We further extend our algorithm and results to general large-scale episodic MDPs with neural network function approximation. To the best of our knowledge, PARTED is the first offline RL algorithm that is provably efficient in general MDP with trajectory-wise reward.},

These games are played among n randomly drawn agents from the population. The agents in our model can be individuals, sports teams, or even Wall Street fund managers. Formally, we postulate that the likelihoods of outcomes of games are governed by the parametric Bradley-Terry-Luce (or multinomial logit) model, where the probability of an agent beating another is the ratio between its skill level and the pairwise sum of skill levels, and the skill parameters are drawn from an unknown, non-parametric skill density of interest. The above problem is, in essence, to learn a distribution from noisy and quantized observations. We propose a surprisingly simple and tractable algorithm that learns the skill density with near-optimal minimax mean squared error scaling as $n^{-1+\varepsilon }$ , for any $\varepsilon \gt 0$ , so long as the density is smooth. Our approach brings together prior work on learning skill parameters from pairwise comparisons with kernel density estimation from non-parametric statistics. We then prove information theoretic lower bounds which establish minimax near-optimality of the skill parameter estimation technique used in our algorithm. These bounds utilize a continuum version of Fano’s method along with a careful covering argument. Furthermore, we show that estimation error bounds for the skill density translate to theoretical guarantees on estimating the differential entropy and other bounded statistics of the skill density. Finally, we apply our algorithm to data from soccer world cups and leagues, cricket world cups, and even mutual funds. We find that the differential entropy of a learnt distribution provides a quantitative measure of overall skill in a tournament, which in turn can provide explanations for popular beliefs about perceived qualities of sporting and other tournaments.},

We address the nonlinearity of this spatio-temporal transition operator recovery problem by a suitable embedding into block-Hankel matrices, transforming it to a low-rank matrix completion problem, even when A has full rank. For both a uniform and an adaptive random space-time sampling model, we quantify the recoverability of the transition operator via suitable measures of incoherence of these block-Hankel embedding matrices. For graph transition operators these measures of incoherence depend on the interplay between the dynamics and the graph topology. We develop a suitable non-convex iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, establish its quadratic local convergence, and show that, in optimal scenarios, no more than ${\mathcal {O}}(rn \log (nT))$ space-time samples are sufficient to ensure accurate recovery of a rank-r operator A of size $n \times n$ . We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed IRLS algorithm with space complexity of order $O(r n T)$ and per-iteration time complexity linear in n, and confirm in numerical experiments that for several graph transition operators, the theoretical findings accurately track empirical phase transitions.},

We design an algorithm that achieves global convergence from any arbitrary initialization, and works even when local data volume is highly unbalanced – there could exist clients that contain $O(1)$ data points only. Our algorithm is intended for the scenario where the parameter server can recruit one client per cluster referred to as “anchor clients”, and each anchor client possesses $\tilde {\Omega }(k)$ data points. Our algorithm first runs moment descent on this set of anchor clients to obtain coarse model estimates. Subsequently, every client alternately estimates its cluster labels and refines the model estimates based on FedAvg or FedProx. A key innovation in our analysis is a uniform estimate of the clustering errors, which we prove by bounding the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of general polynomial concept classes based on the theory of algebraic geometry.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the uniformity testing problem for high-dimensional discrete distributions (multinomials) under sparse alternatives. Specifically, we derive sharp detection thresholds for testing, based on n samples, whether a discrete distribution supported on d elements differs from the uniform distribution in at most s (out of the d) coordinates and is $\varepsilon $ -far (in total variation distance) from uniformity. Our results reveal various interesting phase transitions which depend on the interplay of the sample size n and the signal strength $\varepsilon $ with the dimension d and the sparsity level s. For instance, if the sample size is less than a threshold (which depends on d and s), then all tests are asymptotically powerless, irrespective of the magnitude of the signal strength. On the other hand, if the sample size is above the threshold, then the detection boundary undergoes a further phase transition depending on the signal strength. Here, a $\chi ^{2}$ -type test attains the detection boundary in the dense regime, whereas in the sparse regime a Bonferroni correction of two maximum-type tests and a version of the Higher Criticism test is optimal up to sharp constants. These results combined provide a complete description of the phase diagram for the sparse uniformity testing problem across all regimes of the parameters n, d, s, and $\varepsilon $ . One of the challenges in dealing with multinomials is that the parameters are always constrained to lie in the simplex. This results in a layered phase transition phenomenon in the parameter space. Specifically, there is a critical sample complexity (depending only on d) below which all tests are asymptotically powerless irrespective of the signal strength and above which there is a critical threshold for the signal strength that determines testability.},

  abstract     = {The $\Sigma $ -QMAC problem is introduced, involving S servers, K classical ( $\mathbb {F}_{d}$ ) data streams, and T independent quantum systems. Data stream ${\mathsf { W}}_{k}, k\in [K]$ is replicated at a subset of servers $\mathcal {W}(k)\subset [S]$ , and quantum system ${\mathcal {Q}}_{t}, t\in [T]$ is distributed among a subset of servers ${\mathcal {E}}(t)\subset [S]$ such that Server $s\in {\mathcal {E}}(t)$ receives subsystem ${\mathcal {Q}}_{t,s}$ of ${\mathcal {Q}}_{t}=({\mathcal {Q}}_{t,s})_{s\in {\mathcal {E}}(t)}$ . Servers manipulate their quantum subsystems according to their data and send the subsystems to a receiver. The total download cost is $\sum _{t\in [T]}\sum _{s\in {\mathcal {E}}(t)}\log _{d}|{\mathcal {Q}}_{t,s}|$ qudits, where $|{\mathcal {Q}}|$ is the dimension of ${\mathcal {Q}}$ . The states and measurements of $({\mathcal {Q}}_{t})_{t\in [T]}$ are required to be separable across $t\in [T]$ throughout, but for each $t\in [T]$ , the subsystems of ${\mathcal {Q}}_{t}$ can be prepared initially in an arbitrary (independent of data) entangled state, manipulated arbitrarily by the respective servers, and measured jointly by the receiver. From the measurements, the receiver must recover the sum of all data streams. Rate is defined as the number of dits ( $\mathbb {F}_{d}$ symbols) of the desired sum computed per qudit of download. The capacity of $\Sigma $ -QMAC, i.e., the supremum of achievable rates is characterized for arbitrary data and entanglement distributions ${\mathcal {W}}, {\mathcal {E}}$ . For example, in the symmetric setting with $K={\binom {S}{\alpha }}$ data-streams, each replicated among a distinct $\alpha $ -subset of $[S]$ , and $T={\binom {S}{\beta }}$ quantum systems, each distributed among a distinct $\beta $ -subset of $[S]$ , the capacity of the $\Sigma $ -QMAC is $\frac {1}{\beta T}\sum _{\gamma = (\alpha +\beta -S)^{+}}^{\min (\alpha,\beta)} \min (\beta,2\gamma) \cdot \binom {\alpha }{\gamma }\cdot \binom {S-\alpha }{\beta -\gamma }$ . Coding based on the N-sum box abstraction is optimal in every case. Notably, for every $S\neq 3$ there exists an instance of the $\Sigma $ -QMAC where S-party entanglement is necessary to achieve the fully entangled capacity.},

We demonstrate that if one stabilizer generator of a distance-3 CSS code measured using the flagged circuit has and only has two distinct qubit supports with certain stabilizers of opposite types, then the number of stabilizers required for the second round of measurements can be reduced. The number of these stabilizers depends on the weight of the measured generator. This novel strategy utilizes past syndrome information and elements from the stabilizer group, enabling the implementation of a flag-FTEC protocol for distance-3 CSS codes with lower-depth syndrome extraction circuits compared to previously flag fault-tolerant protocol if the total weight of these stabilizers is less than that of stabilizer generators. Based on our strategy, we also improve the flag-FTEC protocol for cyclic CSS codes of distance 3, which requires fewer stabilizer measurements. We utilize the $[[{14,2,3}]]$ CSS code, $[[{15,1,3}]]$ quantum Reed-Muller code and $[[{15,7,3}]]$ cyclic CSS code to demonstrate how the strategy operates. Furthermore, we also provide a low-depth flagged syndrome extraction strategy for a $[[{19,1,5}]]$ CSS-type code.},

They developed the min-max probability of error criterion for choosing an index code from the set of bandwidth-optimal linear index codes. Motivated by the above works, this paper deals with single uniprior ICPs over binary-input continuous-output channels. Minimizing the average probability of error is introduced as a criterion for further selection of index codes which is shown to be equivalent to minimizing the total number of transmissions used for decoding the message requests at all the receivers. An algorithm that generates a spanning tree with a lower value of this metric than the optimal star graph is also presented. A couple of lower bounds for the total number of transmissions, used by any optimal index code, are derived, and two classes of ICPs for which these bounds are tight are identified. An improvement of the proposed algorithm for information-flow graphs with bridges and a generalization of the improved algorithm for information-flow graphs obtainable as the union of strongly connected sub-graphs are presented, and some optimality results are derived.},

  abstract     = {The automorphism ensemble (AE) decoding framework for polar codes attracts much attention recently. It decodes multiple permuted codewords with successive cancellation (SC) decoders in parallel and hence has lower latency compared to successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. However, the AE decoding framework is ineffective for permutations falling into the lower-triangular affine (LTA) automorphism group, as they are invariant under SC decoding. Therefore, the block lower-triangular affine (BLTA) group was discovered to achieve better AE decoding performance. However, the equivalence of the BLTA group and the complete affine automorphism group was unresolved. Additionally, some automorphisms in BLTA group are also SC-invariant, thus are redundant in AE decoding. In this paper, we prove that BLTA group coincides with the complete automorphisms of decreasing polar codes that can be formulated as affine transformations. Also, we find a necessary and sufficient condition related to the block lower-triangular structure of transformation matrices to identify SC-invariant automorphisms. Furthermore, We present an algorithm that efficiently identifies all SC-invariant affine automorphisms under specific constructions.},

In this paper, we employ the polynomial method to address a question proposed by Barg and Zémor in 2022, demonstrating that the BCH family of storage codes on triangle-free Cayley graphs achieves a unit rate. Furthermore, we generalize the construction of the BCH family and obtain more storage codes of unit rate on triangle-free graphs. We also compare the BCH family with the other known constructions by examining the rate of convergence of $1/(1-R(C_{n}))$ with respect to the length n, where $R(C_{n})$ is the rate of code $C_{n}$ . At last, we reveal a connection between the storage codes on triangle-free graphs and the Ramsey number $R(3,t)$ , which leads to an upper bound for the rate of convergence of $1/(1-R(C_{n}))$ .},

  abstract     = {Modern large-scale distributed storage systems use erasure codes to protect against node failures with low storage overhead. In practice, the failure rate and other factors of storage devices in the system may vary significantly over time, and leads to changes of the ideal code parameters. To maintain the storage efficiency, this requires the system to adjust parameters of the currently used codes. The changing process of code parameters on encoded data is called code conversion. As an important class of storage codes, locally repairable codes (LRCs) can repair any codeword symbol using a small number of other symbols. This feature makes LRCs highly efficient for addressing single node failures in the storage systems. In this paper, we investigate the code conversions for locally repairable codes in the merge regime. We establish a lower bound on the access cost of code conversion for general LRCs and propose a construction of LRCs that can perform code conversions with access cost matching this bound. This construction yields a family of LRCs with optimal conversion processes over a field size linear in the code length. As a special case, it provides a family of RS codes with optimal conversion processes, which could be of particular practical interest.},

A code is called $(p,L)_{q}$ -list-decodable if every radius pn Hamming ball contains less than L codewords; $(p,\ell ,L)_{q}$ -list-recoverability is a generalization where we place radius pn Hamming balls on every point of a combinatorial rectangle with side length $\ell $ and again stipulate that there be less than L codewords. Our main contribution is to precisely calculate the maximum value of p for which there exist infinite families of positive rate $(p,\ell ,L)_{q}$ -list-recoverable codes, the quantity we call the zero-rate threshold. Denoting this value by $p_{*}$ , we in fact show that codes correcting a $p_{*}+\varepsilon $ fraction of errors must have size $O_{\varepsilon }(1)$ , i.e., independent of n. Such a result is typically referred to as a “Plotkin bound.” To complement this, a standard random code with expurgation construction shows that there exist positive rate codes correcting a $p_{*}-\varepsilon $ fraction of errors. We also follow a classical proof template (typically attributed to Elias and Bassalygo) to derive from the zero-rate threshold other tradeoffs between rate and decoding radius for list-decoding and list-recovery. Technically, proving the Plotkin bound boils down to demonstrating the Schur convexity of a certain function defined on the q-simplex as well as the convexity of a univariate function derived from it. We remark that an earlier argument claimed similar results for q-ary list-decoding; however, we point out that this earlier proof is flawed.},

  abstract     = {The problem of transmitting a parameter value over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered, where, in addition to the transmitter and the receiver, there is a helper that observes the noise non-causally and provides a description of limited rate $R_{\mathrm {h}}$ to the transmitter and/or the receiver. We derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal achievable $\alpha $ -th moment of the estimation error and show that they coincide for small values of $\alpha $ and for high values of $R_{\mathrm {h}}$ . The upper bound relies on a recently proposed channel-coding scheme that effectively conveys $R_{\mathrm {h}}$ bits essentially error-free and the rest of the rate—over the same AWGN channel without help, with the error-free bits being allocated to the most significant bits of the quantized parameter. We then concentrate on the setting with a total transmit energy constraint, for which we derive achievability results for both channel coding and parameter modulation for several scenarios: when the helper assists only the transmitter or only the receiver and knows the noise, and when the helper assists the transmitter and/or the receiver and knows both the noise and the message. In particular, for the message-informed helper that assists both the receiver and the transmitter, it is shown that the error probability in the channel-coding task decays doubly exponentially. Finally, we translate these results to those for continuous-time power-limited AWGN channels with unconstrained bandwidth. As a byproduct, we show that the capacity with a message-informed helper that is available only at the transmitter can exceed the sum of the capacity without help and the help rate $R_{\mathrm {h}}$ .},

More specifically, the channel is given by $\boldsymbol {y}(t) =\boldsymbol {x}(t) +\boldsymbol {z}(t)$ , where the channel input $\{\boldsymbol {x}(t) \}$ satisfies average power constraint P and the noise $\{\boldsymbol {z}(t)\}$ is a first-order autoregressive moving average (ARMA(1,1)) Gaussian process satisfying $\boldsymbol {z}^{\prime } (t)+\kappa \boldsymbol {z}(t)=(\kappa +\lambda)\boldsymbol {w}(t)+\boldsymbol {w}^{\prime } (t)$ , where $\kappa \gt 0,~\lambda \in \mathbb {R}$ and $\{\boldsymbol {w}(t) \}$ is a white Gaussian process with unit double-sided spectral density. We show that the feedback capacity of this channel is equal to the unique positive root of the equation $P(x+\kappa)^{2} = 2x(x+\vert \kappa +\lambda \vert)^{2}$ when $-2\kappa \lt \lambda \lt 0$ and is equal to $P/2$ otherwise. Among many others, this result shows that, as opposed to a discrete-time additive Gaussian channel, feedback may not increase the capacity of a continuous-time additive Gaussian channel even if the noise process is colored. The formula enables us to conduct a thorough analysis of the effect of feedback on the capacity for such a channel. We characterize when the feedback capacity equals or doubles the non-feedback capacity; moreover, we disprove continuous-time analogues of the half-bit bound and Cover’s $2P$ conjecture for discrete-time additive Gaussian channels.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the third-order characteristic of nonsingular discrete memoryless channels and the Gaussian channel with a maximal-power constraint. The third-order term in our expansions employs a new quantity here called the channel skewness, which affects the approximation accuracy more significantly as the error probability decreases. For the Gaussian channel, evaluating Shannon’s 1959 random coding bound and Vazquez-Vilar’s 2021 meta-converse bound in the central limit theorem (CLT) regime enables exact computation of the channel skewness. For discrete memoryless channels, this work generalizes Moulin’s 2017 bounds on the asymptotic expansion of the maximum achievable message set size for nonsingular channels from the CLT regime to include the moderate deviations (MD) regime, thereby refining Altuğ and Wagner’s 2014 MD result. For an example binary symmetric channel and most practically important $(n, \epsilon)$ pairs, including $n \in [{100, 500}]$ and $\epsilon \in [10^{-10}, 10^{-1}]$ , an approximation up to the channel skewness is the most accurate among several expansions in the literature. A derivation of the third-order term in the type-II error exponent of binary hypothesis testing in the MD regime is also included; the resulting third-order term is similar to the channel skewness.},

  abstract     = {Sorting is the task of ordering n elements using pairwise comparisons. It is well known that $m=\Theta (n\log n)$ comparisons are both necessary and sufficient when the outcomes of the comparisons are observed with no noise. In this paper, we study the sorting problem when each comparison is incorrect with some fixed yet unknown probability p. Unlike the common approach in the literature which aims to minimize the number of pairwise comparisons m to achieve a given desired error probability, we consider randomized algorithms with expected number of queries $\textsf {E}[M]$ and aim at characterizing the maximal sorting rate $\frac {n\log n}{\mathop {\mathrm {\textsf {E}}}\nolimits [M]}$ such that the ordering of the elements can be estimated with a vanishing error probability asymptotically. The maximal rate is referred to as the noisy sorting capacity. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the noisy sorting capacity. The two lower bounds — one for fixed-length algorithms and one for variable-length algorithms — are established by combining the insertion sort algorithm with the well-known Burnashev-Zigangirov algorithm for channel coding with feedback. Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithms are universal in the sense that they do not require the knowledge of p, while maintaining a strictly positive sorting rate. Moreover, we derive a general upper bound on the noisy sorting capacity, along with an upper bound on the maximal rate that can be achieved by sorting algorithms that are based on insertion sort.},

This paper presents a novel approach, which is based on bringing about some transformation in the PNB-based attack procedure that significantly improves upon existing attacks. Unlike previous methods that focused on finding PNBs for the entire linear combination of multiple bits of output difference, we separately identify PNBs for each output difference bit that constitutes the linear combination. This divide-and-conquer approach helps to reduce the number of operations to observe the PNB-based differential-linear correlation, providing significant gain in the attack complexity. Specifically, we present an attack on 7-round ChaCha256 that is 213.91 times faster than the existing best attack. We are able to produce the first-ever attack on the 7.5-round ChaCha256. Apart from these, this idea also provides significant improvement on 7.25-round ChaCha256, as well as the 6-round and 6.5 round versions of ChaCha128.},

In particular, the Nth 2-adic complexity has not been studied for any promising candidate of a pseudorandom sequence of finite length N. Also nothing seems be known for a part of the period of length N of any cryptographically interesting periodic sequence. Here we introduce the first method for this aperiodic case. More precisely, we study the relation between Nth maximum-order complexity and Nth 2-adic complexity of binary sequences and prove a lower bound on the Nth 2-adic complexity in terms of the Nth maximum-order complexity. Then any known lower bound on the Nth maximum-order complexity implies a lower bound on the Nth 2-adic complexity of the same order of magnitude. In the periodic case, one can prove a slightly better result. The latter bound is sharp, which is illustrated by the maximum-order complexity of $\ell $ -sequences. The idea of the proof helps us to characterize the maximum-order complexity of periodic sequences in terms of the unique rational number defined by the sequence. We also show that a periodic sequence of maximal maximum-order complexity must be also of maximal 2-adic complexity.},

Each user involved in the training process only downloads and updates the submodel relevant to the user’s local data, which significantly reduces the communication cost compared to classical federated learning (FL). However, the index of the submodel updated by the user and the values of the updates reveal information about the user’s private data. In order to guarantee information-theoretic privacy in FSL, the model is stored at multiple non-colluding databases, and the user sends queries and updates to each database in such a way that no information is revealed on the updating submodel index or the values of the updates. In this work, we consider the practical scenario where the multiple non-colluding databases are allowed to have arbitrary storage constraints. The goal of this work is to develop read-write schemes and storage mechanisms for FSL that efficiently utilize the available storage in each database to store the submodel parameters in such a way that the total communication cost is minimized while guaranteeing information-theoretic privacy of the updating submodel index and the values of the updates. As the main result, we consider both heterogeneous and homogeneous storage constrained databases, and propose private read-write and storage schemes for the two cases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a security evaluation framework for AND-RX ciphers against impossible differential cryptanalysis is proposed. This framework is constructed based on three different methods towards finding the theoretical upper boundary, theoretical lower boundary, and practical boundary of impossible differential distinguishers (short for ID) respectively. The provable security boundary (upper boundary) can be calculated with two round-function-related matrices through a few matrix multiplications, this calculation is beyond actual input and output differences. For searching longer IDs (lower boundary), an automatic method is proposed. With this method, given the input and output difference, all the possible direct and indirect contradictions are detected. For the practical boundary, a method of approximating all the potential longest IDs with concrete differential trails is introduced. The three boundaries validate the correctness from each other. According to our result, on the one hand, the boundaries derived with well-designed ID-construction methods can already reach the practical boundary for some block ciphers and it is unlikely to be improved based on known construction methods or future unknown construction methods. On the other hand, for those ciphers whose current best result does not reach our boundary, longer IDs can be discovered with this framework. The correctness is validated by a series of applications. For the provable security boundary, four family ciphers-SIMON, Simeck, Friet-PC and SAND are investigated. For SIMON and Simeck, the lengths of current longest IDs have reached their provable security boundaries. For Friet-PC and SAND, there is a gap between the provable security boundary and current best results. With the automatic searching method, some longer IDs on Friet-PC and SAND are discovered. For Friet-PC, 128 11-round IDs are discovered, while the previous best differential distinguisher is 9-round. For SAND64, 256 11-round IDs are proposed. For SAND128, 456 14-round IDs are presented. Both results extend previous longest IDs by one round and all these newly proposed distinguishers reached corresponding provable security boundaries. For Simeck, the length of longest IDs has not been improved. However, more distinguishers of the same length are discovered. For Simeck64, the increased ratio for the quantity can reach 300%. Besides, the practical boundary of SIMON is investigated, the results indicate that for SIMON, the practical boundary is identical with the provable security boundary or the boundary derived with the automatic searching method.},

  abstract     = {The $\boldsymbol {\beta } $ -model for random graphs is commonly used for representing pairwise interactions in a network with degree heterogeneity. Going beyond pairwise interactions, Stasi et al. (2014) introduced the hypergraph $\boldsymbol {\beta } $ -model for capturing degree heterogeneity in networks with higher-order (multi-way) interactions. In this paper we initiate the rigorous study of the hypergraph $\boldsymbol {\beta } $ -model with multiple layers, which allows for hyperedges of different sizes across the layers. To begin with, we derive the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates and establish their minimax rate optimality. We also derive the limiting distribution of the ML estimates and construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the model parameters. Next, we consider the goodness-of-fit problem in the hypergraph $\boldsymbol {\beta } $ -model. Specifically, we establish the asymptotic normality of the likelihood ratio (LR) test under the null hypothesis, derive its detection threshold, and also its limiting power at the threshold. Interestingly, the detection threshold of the LR test turns out to be minimax optimal, that is, all tests are asymptotically powerless below this threshold. The theoretical results are further validated in numerical experiments. In addition to developing the theoretical framework for estimation and inference for hypergraph $\boldsymbol {\beta } $ -models, the above results fill a number of gaps in the graph $\boldsymbol {\beta } $ -model literature, such as the minimax optimality of the ML estimates and the non-null properties of the LR test, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been studied before.},

We investigate the sample complexities required to guarantee a predefined estimation error of the best linear coefficients for two widely-used policy evaluation algorithms: the temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm and the two-timescale linear TD with gradient correction (TDC) algorithm. In both the on-policy setting, where observations are generated from the target policy, and the off-policy setting, where samples are drawn from a behavior policy potentially different from the target policy, we establish the first sample complexity bound with high-probability convergence guarantee that attains the optimal dependence on the tolerance level. We also exhibit an explicit dependence on problem-related quantities, and show in the on-policy setting that our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound on crucial problem parameters, including the choice of the feature map and the problem dimension.},

  abstract     = {Learning the sparse network-structured dependence among nodes from multivariate point process data $\{{ {T}}_{i}\}_{i\in \mathcal {V} }$ has wide applications in information transmission, social science, and computational neuroscience. This paper develops new continuous-time stochastic models of the conditional intensity functions $\{\lambda _{i}(t | \mathscr {F} _{t}): t\ge 0\}_{i\in \mathcal {V} }$ , dependent on past event counts of parent nodes, to uncover the network structure within an array of non-stationary multivariate counting processes $\{\boldsymbol {N}(t): t\ge 0\}$ for $\{{ {T}}_{i}\}_{i\in \mathcal {V} }$ . The stochastic mechanism is crucial for statistical inference of graph parameters relevant to structure recovery but does not satisfy the key assumptions of commonly used processes like the Poisson process, Cox process, Hawkes process, queuing model, and piecewise deterministic Markov process. We introduce a new marked point process for intensity discontinuities, derive compact representations of their conditional distributions, and demonstrate the cyclicity property of ${N}(t)$ driven by recurrence time points. These new theoretical properties enable us to establish statistical consistency and convergence properties of the proposed penalized M-estimators for graph parameters under mild regularity conditions. Simulation evaluations demonstrate computational simplicity and increased estimation accuracy compared to existing methods. Real multiple neuron spike train recordings are analyzed to infer connectivity in neuronal networks.},

However, in many real-world applications, additional information about the users, such as user profiles, might be publicly available. In this paper, we introduce the attributed graph alignment problem, where additional user information, referred to as attributes, is incorporated to assist graph alignment. We establish both the achievability and converse results on recovering vertex correspondence exactly, where the conditions match for certain parameter regimes. Our results span the full spectrum between models that only consider user-user connections and models where only attribute information is available.},

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that PICO slashes the communication cost while achieving equal computational complexity, adversary resilience, robustness to client dropouts, and model accuracy to the state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments demonstrate up to $91\times $ reduction in the communication overhead, and up to $8\times $ speed-up in the wall-clock training time compared to the state-of-the-art. As such, PICO addresses a key technical challenge in multi-party collaborative learning, paving the way for future large-scale privacy-preserving learning frameworks.},

Gaussian entries, the asymptotic distribution of the estimate at any iteration of the algorithm can be exactly characterized in the large system limit as $M/N\to \delta \in (0,\infty)$ via a scalar recursion referred to as state evolution. In this paper, we show that appropriate functionals of the iterates, in fact, concentrate around their limiting values predicted by these asymptotic distributions with rates exponentially fast in N for a large class of AMP-style algorithms, including those that are used when high-dimensional generalized linear regression models are assumed to be the data-generating process, like the generalized AMP algorithm, or those that are used when the measurement matrix is assumed to be rotationally invariant instead of i.i.d.

Active learning uses feedback to label the most informative data points and significantly reduce the training set size. Many heuristics for selecting data points have been developed in recent years which are usually tailored to a specific task and a general unified framework is lacking. In this work, the individual setting is considered and an active learning criterion is proposed. Motivated by universal source coding, the proposed criterion attempts to find data points which minimize the Predictive Normalized Maximum Likelihood (pNML) regret on an un-labelled test set. It is shown that for binary classification and linear regression, the resulting criterion coincides with well-known active learning criteria and thus represents a unified information theoretic active learning approach for general hypothesis classes. Finally, it is shown using real data that the proposed criterion performs better than other active learning criteria in terms of sample complexity.},

We consider a variant of the trace reconstruction problem where the goal is to recover a “density map” that indicates the locations of each length-k substring throughout s. We show that when $k = c \log n$ where c is constant, $\epsilon ^{-2}\cdot \text { poly} (n)$ traces suffice to recover the density map with error at most $\epsilon $ . As a result, when restricted to a set of source strings whose minimum “density map distance” is at least $1/\text {poly}(n)$ , the trace reconstruction problem can be solved with polynomially many traces.},

Focusing on Mahalanobis and Itakura-Saito distances, we generalize fundamental existing results and characterize a class of distributions of positive reals with a scale parameter, including the gamma distribution as a special case. We also generalized these results to general model classes characterized by one-dimensional Bregman divergence.

We show that QPP can be equivalently formulated in terms of the Datta–Leditzky information spectrum divergence, thus providing the first operational interpretation thereof. We reformulate this divergence as a semi-definite program and derive several properties of it, which are then used to prove convexity, composability, and post-processing of QPP mechanisms. Parameters that guarantee QPP of the depolarization mechanism are also derived. We analyze the privacy-utility tradeoff of general QPP mechanisms and, again, study the depolarization mechanism as an explicit instance. The QPP framework is then applied to privacy auditing for identifying privacy violations via a hypothesis testing pipeline that leverages quantum algorithms. Connections to quantum fairness and other quantum divergences are also explored and several variants of QPP are examined.},

The paper considers two communication models – one-way classical communication and one-way quantum communication, and derives upper bounds on the optimal common randomness rates for both models. We show that in the case of classical communication, quantum isotropic states have no advantage over noisy classical correlation. In the case of quantum communication, we demonstrate that the common randomness rate can be increased by using superdense coding on quantum isotropic states.

In particular, for N-dimensional quantum states of rank r, our proposed quantum algorithms for computing the von Neumann entropy, trace distance and fidelity within additive error $\varepsilon $ have time complexity of $\tilde {O}(r/\varepsilon ^{2})$ , $\tilde {O}(r^{5}/\varepsilon ^{6})$ and $\tilde {O}(r^{6.5}/\varepsilon ^{7.5})$ , respectively. By contrast, prior quantum algorithms for the von Neumann entropy and trace distance usually have time complexity $\Omega (N)$ , and the prior best one for fidelity has time complexity $\tilde {O}(r^{12.5}/\varepsilon ^{13.5})$ . The key idea of our quantum algorithms is to extend block-encoding from unitary operators in previous work to quantum states (i.e., density operators). It is realized by developing several convenient techniques to manipulate quantum states and extract information from them. The advantage of our techniques over the existing methods is that no restrictions on density operators are required; in sharp contrast, the previous methods usually require a lower bound on the minimal non-zero eigenvalue of density operators.},

An approximate algorithm is proposed to compute information rates in $O(m \sqrt {m \log (m)})$ time with an asymptotically negligible error with respect to block length m. Information rates of the nanopore sequencer are studied by choosing parameters of the channel model based on the Scrappie simulator, yielding insights into the fundamental performance of DNA storage systems with nanopore sequencing as the reading process.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides capacity results for multi-user mm-wave hybrid-beamforming, and presents optimal joint beam allocation and user scheduling algorithms. We characterize the downlink capacity of a practical system with quantized analog beamforming code-books under the constraint that users cannot be scheduled at the same time if they are closer together than a beam width in angle. We show that the capacity region is determined by a small number of linear inequality constraints. We also present capacity-achieving scheduling algorithms that provide beam allocations guaranteeing that user rate requirements are met within each resource block. In particular, we propose “sand-filling” algorithms that are provably optimal and which have linear complexity. Intuitively, our schemes can be viewed in terms of filling containers with coloured sand, in such a way that the colours at any given height do not conflict with the colours in the other containers at the same height, where the containers represent the RF chains (i.e. the beamforming resources), and the coloured sand represents the users (and their rate requirements). We show a numerical example where the capacity of our scheme is 82% higher than a traditional resource partitioning scheme.},

  abstract     = {Let $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ be the finite field with q elements and m be a positive integer. The $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ -linear low-rank parity-check (LRPC) codes have been used in many cryptographic schemes. Motivated by recent attacks on those schemes, this paper generalizes LRPC codes based on 3-tensors in $\mathbb {F}_{q}^{m \times m \times m}$ . The generalized LRPC codes are mostly $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ -linear matrix codes, while a particular choice of the 3-tensor is isomorphic to the original $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ -linear LRPC codes. We first introduce a bilinear T-product over $\mathbb {F}_{q}^{m}$ associated with a 3-tensor $T\in \mathbb {F}_{q}^{m \times m \times m} $ . Based on the T-product, we propose a generic method to expand $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ -linear matrix code from dimension k to dimension $km$ and then use the method to generalize LRPC codes. Finally, we propose two probabilistic polynomial-time decoding algorithms for the generalized LRPC codes under different circumstances. We provide estimates of their decoding failure rates, which, confirmed by experimental results, are almost the same as that of decoding $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ -linear LRPC codes.},

It is applicable to a wide range of settings, e.g. asymmetric channels, channels with state and/or cost constraints, and the Wyner-Ziv problem, and can provably achieve the capacity. For the channel with state (Gelfand-Pinsker) setting, the proposed coding scheme has two advantages. First, it achieves the capacity of any channel with state (e.g. asymmetric channels). Second, simulation results show that the proposed code achieves a smaller error rate compared to the nested linear codes. We also discuss a sparse construction where the belief propagation algorithm can be applied to improve the coding efficiency.},

In many cases, our scheme outperforms previous schemes in the literature. Furthermore, we provide a characterization of evaluation schemes for general linear codes.

Previous constructions of network MDS codes, which are applicable to general single-source multicast networks, require large field sizes. In this paper, for two specific classes of network topologies, we derive upper and lower bounds on the minimum field size of the corresponding network MDS codes and present explicit constructions. The proposed upper bounds significantly improve upon the previous ones and differ from the lower bounds only by a small factor, which is asymptotically no more than 2. Additionally, we extend the concept of linear network error-correction coding from the scalar case to the vector case, and demonstrate a class of networks in which the minimum field size of the vector network MDS code is substantially smaller than that of the scalar case.},

Suppose there are two players A and B. Player A has access to $X_{1},X_{2},\ldots $ and player B has access to $Y_{1},Y_{2},\ldots $ . Without communication, what joint probability distributions can players A and B jointly simulate? That is, if $k,m$ are fixed positive integers, what probability distributions on $\{1,\ldots ,m\}^{2}$ are equal to the distribution of $(f(X_{1},\ldots ,X_{k}),\,g(Y_{1},\ldots ,Y_{k}))$ for some $f,g\colon \mathbb {R}^{k}\to \{1,\ldots ,m\}$ ?

Previously, it was not even known if this number of samples $m^{2}$ would be finite or not, except when $m\leq 2$ . Consequently, a straightforward brute-force search deciding whether or not a probability distribution on $\{1,\ldots ,m\}^{2}$ is within distance $0\lt \varepsilon \lt |\rho |$ of being noninteractively simulated from k correlated Gaussian samples has run time bounded by $(5/\varepsilon )^{m(\log (\varepsilon /2) / \log |\rho |)^{m^{2}}}$ , improving a bound of Ghazi, Kamath and Raghavendra. A nonlinear central limit theorem (i.e. invariance principle) of Mossel then generalizes this result to decide whether or not a probability distribution on $\{1,\ldots ,m\}^{2}$ is within distance $0\lt \varepsilon \lt |\rho |$ of being noninteractively simulated from k samples of a given finite discrete distribution $(X,Y)$ in run time that does not depend on k, with constants that again improve a bound of Ghazi, Kamath and Raghavendra.},

The GWIGF of a transformed random variable has been obtained in terms of the GWIGF of a known distribution. Several bounds of the GWIGF have been proposed. We have obtained sufficient conditions under which the GWIGFs of two distributions are comparable. Further, we have established a connection between the weighted varentropy and varentropy with proposed GWIGF. An upper bound for GWIGF of the sum of two independent random variables is derived. The effect of general weighted relative information generating function (GWRIGF) for two transformed random variables under strictly monotone functions has been studied. Further, these information generating functions are studied for escort, generalized escort and mixture distributions. Specially, we propose weighted $\beta $ -cross informational energy and establish a close connection with GWIGF for escort distribution. The residual versions of the newly proposed generating functions are considered and several similar properties have been explored. A non-parametric estimator of the residual general weighted information generating function is proposed. A simulated data set and two real data sets are considered for the purpose of illustration.

  abstract     = {Horstein, Burnashev, Shayevitz and Feder, Naghshvar et al. and others have studied sequential transmission of a k-bit message over the binary symmetric channel (BSC) with full, noiseless feedback using posterior matching. Yang et al. provide an improved lower bound on the achievable rate using martingale analysis that relies on the small-enough difference (SED) partitioning introduced by Naghshvar et al. SED requires a relatively complex encoder and decoder. To reduce complexity, this paper replaces SED with relaxed constraints that admit the small enough absolute difference (SEAD) partitioning rule. The main analytical results show that achievable-rate bounds higher than those found by Yang et al. (2021) are possible even under the new constraints, which are less restrictive than SED. The new analysis does not use martingale theory for the confirmation phase and applies a surrogate channel technique to tighten the results. An initial systematic transmission further increases the achievable rate bound. The simplified encoder associated with SEAD has a complexity below order $O(K^{2})$ and allows simulations for message sizes of at least 1000 bits. For example, simulations achieve 99% of of the channel’s 0.50-bit capacity with an average block size of 200 bits for a target codeword error rate of $10^{-3}$ .},

Hence, our results verify an intimate connection among information theory, optimal transport, and concentration of measure or isoperimetric inequalities. In the concentration regime, the corresponding variational formula is in fact a dimension-free bound in the sense that this bound is valid for any dimension. A cardinality bound for the alphabet of the auxiliary random variable in the expression of the asymptotic isoperimetric exponent is provided, which makes the expression computable by a finite-dimensional program for the finite alphabet case. We lastly apply our results to obtain an isoperimetric inequality in the classic isoperimetric setting, which is asymptotically sharp under certain conditions.

  abstract     = {The capacity of finite state channels (FSCs) with feedback has been expressed by a limit of a sequence of multi-letter expressions. Despite many efforts, a closed-form single-letter capacity characterization remains unknown to date. In this paper, the feedback capacity is studied from a fundamental algorithmic point of view by addressing the question of whether or not the capacity can be algorithmically computed. To this aim, the concept of Turing machines is used, which provides fundamental performance limits of digital computers. It is shown that the feedback capacity of FSCs is not Banach-Mazur computable and therefore also not Borel-Turing computable. It is further shown that it is even impossible to approximate the feedback capacity function of FSCs by a computable function. As a consequence, it is shown that computable achievability and converse can never be tight, which means that there are FSCs for which it is impossible to find computable tight upper and lower bounds. Furthermore, it is shown that the feedback capacity cannot be characterized as the maximization of a finite-letter formula of entropic quantities.},

In this paper, we construct vector quantizers with periodic properties, where the error is uniformly distributed over the n-ball, or any other prescribed set. We then prove upper and lower bounds on the entropy of the quantized signals. We also discuss how our construction can be applied to give a randomized quantization scheme with a nonuniform error distribution.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the concept of (normal) bent partitions, which are partitions of elementary abelian groups having similar properties to spreads, has been introduced by Anbar and Meidl. A large number of bent partitions, so-called generalized semifield spreads, can be obtained from semifields with certain properties. A strongly related concept, namely Latin square partial difference set packings (LP-packings) in finite abelian groups, has also been introduced recently by Jedwab and Li. The examples for LP-packings in an elementary abelian group are obtained from spreads. LP-packings yield bent partitions (not only for elementary abelian groups). In this paper, we first point out that conversely, generalized semifield spreads yield LP-packings. As a result, there is a huge amount of LP-packings in elementary abelian groups, other than spreads. With some examples from ternary bent functions, we then show that normal bent partitions and LP-packings are not the same concept. Finally, we extend the lifting procedure from spreads to LP-packings in nonelementary abelian groups to a lifting procedure from some generalized spreads to LP-packings in nonelementary abelian groups and in larger elementary abelian groups. This potentially yields bent partitions other than generalized semifield spreads.},

This is the first time such a reduction (classical or quantum) has been obtained. Our reduction adapts to linear codes the Stehlé-Steinfield-Tanaka-Xagawa’ re-interpretation of Regev’s quantum reduction from finding short lattice vectors to solving the Closest Vector Problem. The Hamming metric is a much coarser metric than the Euclidean metric and this adaptation has needed several new ingredients to make it work. For instance, in order to have a meaningful reduction it is necessary in the Hamming metric to choose a very large decoding radius and this needs in many cases to go beyond the radius where decoding is always unique. Another crucial step for the analysis of the reduction is the choice of the errors that are being fed to the decoding algorithm. For lattices, errors are usually sampled according to a Gaussian distribution. However, it turns out that the Bernoulli distribution (the analogue for codes of the Gaussian) is too much spread out and cannot be used, as such, for the reduction with codes. This problem was solved by using instead a truncated Bernoulli distribution.},

This paper reveals a fascinating relationship between Gold functions and Golay-Davis-Jedwab (GDJ) Boolean functions to design sequences with low correlation and low PAPR, which is the first of its kind. The bent and semi-bent properties of the Gold functions are utilized to derive the correlation of the resultant binary spreading sequence sets, while the complementary properties of the GDJ Boolean functions are used to derive the low PAPR. Based on this idea we propose three new sets of binary spreading sequences with low PAPR and low correlation. The proposed sequence sets have the potential to be used as spreading sequences in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). They have a very large set size, which in turn results in a high overloading factor as compared to the existing sequence sets with the same length and the same correlation, which are generated through systematic constructions.},

  abstract     = {The problem of quickest change detection (QCD) in autoregressive (AR) models is investigated. A system is being monitored with sequentially observed samples. At some unknown time, a disturbance signal occurs and changes the distribution of the observations. The disturbance signal follows an AR model, which is dependent over time. Before the change, observations only consist of measurement noise, and are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). After the change, observations consist of the disturbance signal and the measurement noise, are dependent over time, which essentially follow a continuous-state hidden Markov model (HMM). The goal is to design a stopping time to detect the disturbance signal as quickly as possible subject to false alarm constraints. Existing approaches for general non-i.i.d. settings and discrete-state HMMs cannot be applied due to their high computational complexity and memory consumption, and they usually assume some asymptotic stability condition. In this paper, the asymptotic stability condition is firstly theoretically proved for the AR model by a novel design of forward variable and auxiliary Markov chain. A computationally efficient Ergodic CuSum algorithm that can be updated recursively is then constructed and is further shown to be asymptotically optimal. The data-driven setting where the disturbance signal parameters are unknown is further investigated, and an online and computationally efficient gradient ascent CuSum algorithm is designed. The algorithm is constructed by iteratively updating the estimate of the unknown parameters based on the maximum likelihood principle and the gradient ascent approach. The lower bound on its average running length to false alarm is also derived for practical false alarm control. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

These applications often utilize Gaussian mixtures as initial approximations that are updated recursively. A key challenge in these recursive processes stems from the exponential increase in the mixture’s order, resulting in intractable inference. To overcome the difficulty, the Gaussian mixture reduction (GMR), which approximates a high order Gaussian mixture by one with a lower order, can be used. Although existing clustering-based methods are known for their satisfactory performance and computational efficiency, their convergence properties and optimal targets remain unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based GMR method based on composite transportation divergence (CTD). We develop a majorization-minimization algorithm for computing the reduced mixture and establish its theoretical convergence under general conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many existing clustering-based methods are special cases of ours, effectively bridging the gap between optimization-based and clustering-based techniques. Our unified framework empowers users to select the most appropriate cost function in CTD to achieve superior performance in their specific applications. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing its potential in various domains.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the use of recently proposed optimal transport-based multivariate goodness-of-fit (GoF) test statistics, namely rank energy and its variant the soft rank energy derived from entropy-regularized optimal transport, for unsupervised non-parametric change point detection (CPD) in multivariate time series data. We show that the soft rank energy enjoys both fast rates of statistical convergence and robust continuity properties which lead to strong performance on real datasets. Our analyses remove the need for resampling and out-of-sample extensions previously required to obtain such rates. Our theoretical results show that the rank energy suffers from the curse of dimensionality in statistical estimation and moreover can signal a change point from arbitrarily small perturbations, which leads to a high rate of false alarms in CPD. Additionally, under mild regularity conditions, we quantify the discrepancy between soft rank energy and rank energy in terms of the regularization parameter. Finally, we show our approach performs favorably in numerical experiments compared to several other optimal transport-based methods as well as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which is a popular multivariate GoF statistic.},

A nontrivial family of such functionals has recently been constructed, but their previously known characterisations have so far only made it possible to evaluate them in very simple cases. In this paper we derive a new regularised formula for these functionals in terms of a subadditive upper bound, complementing the previously known superadditive lower bound. The upper and lower bounds evaluated on tensor powers differ by a logarithmically bounded term, which provides a bound on the convergence rate. In addition, we find that on states satisfying a certain sparsity constraint, the upper bound is equal to the value of the corresponding additive entanglement measure, therefore the regularisation is not needed for such states, and the evaluation is possible via a single-letter formula. Our results provide explicit bounds on the success probability of transformations by local operations and classical communication and, due to the additivity of the entanglement measures, also on the strong converse exponent for asymptotic transformations.},

  abstract     = {A set of classical or quantum states is equivalent to another one if there exists a pair of classical or quantum channels mapping either set to the other one. For dichotomies (pairs of states), this is closely connected to (classical or quantum) Rényi divergences (RD) and the data-processing inequality: If a RD remains unchanged when a channel is applied to the dichotomy, then there is a recovery channel mapping the image back to the initial dichotomy. Here, we prove for classical dichotomies that equality of the RDs alone is already sufficient for the existence of a channel in any of the two directions and discuss some applications. In the quantum case, all families of quantum RDs are seen to be insufficient because they cannot detect anti-unitary transformations. Thus, including anti-unitaries, we pose the problem of finding a sufficient family. It is shown that the Petz and maximal quantum RD are still insufficient in this more general sense and we provide evidence for sufficiency of the minimal quantum RD. As a side result of our techniques, we obtain an infinite list of inequalities fulfilled by the classical, the Petz quantum, and the maximal quantum RDs. These inequalities are not true for the minimal quantum RDs. Our results further imply that any sufficient set of conditions for state transitions in the resource theory of athermality must be able to detect time-reversal.},

  abstract     = {The reconstruction of quantum states from experimental measurements, often achieved using quantum state tomography (QST), is crucial for the verification and benchmarking of quantum devices. However, performing QST for a generic unstructured quantum state requires an enormous number of state copies that grows exponentially with the number of individual quanta in the system, even for the most optimal measurement settings. Fortunately, many physical quantum states, such as states generated by noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computers, are usually structured. In one dimension, such states are expected to be well approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a matrix/bond dimension independent of the number of qubits, therefore enabling efficient state representation. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether efficient QST can be performed for these states in general. In other words, there exist no rigorous bounds on the number of state copies required for reconstructing MPO states that scales polynomially with the number of qubits. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and establish theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of MPOs using tools from compressive sensing and the theory of empirical processes. We begin by studying two types of random measurement settings: Gaussian measurements and Haar random projective measurements. We show that the information contained in an MPO with a constant bond dimension can be preserved using a number of random measurements that depends only linearly on the number of qubits, assuming no statistical error of the measurements. We then study MPO-based QST with Haar random projective measurements that can in principle be implemented on quantum computers. We prove that only a polynomial number of state copies in the number of qubits is required to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state. Remarkably, such recovery can be achieved by measuring the state in each random basis only once, despite the large statistical error associated with the outcome of each measurement. Our work may be generalized to accommodate random local or t-design measurements that are more practical to implement on current quantum computers. It may also facilitate the discovery of efficient QST methods for other structured quantum states.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic recording devices are still competitive in the storage density race with solid-state devices thanks to new technologies such as two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR). TDMR offers remarkable storage density increase without the need for new magnetic materials; however, advanced data processing schemes are needed to guarantee reliability. Data patterns where a bit is surrounded by complementary bits at the four positions with Manhattan distance 1 on the TDMR grid are called plus isolation (PIS) patterns, and they are error-prone. Recently, we introduced lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes, namely optimal plus LOCO (OP-LOCO) codes, with minimal redundancy that prevent these patterns from being written in a TDMR device. However, in the high-density regime or the low-energy regime (as the device ages), additional error-prone patterns emerge, specifically data patterns where a bit is surrounded by complementary bits at only three positions with Manhattan distance 1, and we call them incomplete plus isolation (IPIS) patterns. In this paper, we present capacity-achieving codes that forbid both PIS and IPIS patterns in TDMR systems with wide read heads. Because of their shape, we collectively call the PIS and IPIS patterns rotated T isolation (RTIS) patterns, and we call the new codes optimal T LOCO (OT-LOCO) codes. We analyze OT-LOCO codes and derive their simple encoding-decoding rule that allows reconfigurability. We also present a novel bridging idea for these codes to further increase the rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that OT-LOCO codes not only remarkably outperform OP-LOCO codes, but also entirely eliminate media noise effects, resulting from error-prone data patterns, at practical TD densities in the range [0.6, 0.8) with high rates in the range [0.81, 0.83]. At the TD density of 0.8, the OT-LOCO code of rate 0.8267 achieves a frame error rate (bit error rate) performance gain of about 1.15 orders (1.23 orders) of magnitude for all TDMR down (horizontal) tracks compared with the uncoded setting. To further preserve the storage capacity, we suggest using OP-LOCO codes, which have higher rates than OT-LOCO codes, early in the device lifetime, then employing the reconfiguration property to switch to OT-LOCO codes later in the device lifetime. While the point of reconfiguration on the density/energy axis is decided manually at the moment, the next step is to use machine learning to make that decision based on the TDMR device status. Moreover, we introduce another coding scheme to remove RTIS patterns in TDMR systems which offers lower complexity, lower error propagation, and track separation, at the expense of a limited rate loss.},

  abstract     = {Hermitian hulls of linear codes are interesting for theoretical and practical reasons alike. In terms of recent application, linear codes whose hulls meet certain conditions have been utilized as ingredients to construct entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes. This family of quantum codes is often seen as a generalization of quantum stabilizer codes. Theoretically, compared with the Euclidean setup, the Hermitian case is much harder to deal with. Hermitian hulls of MDS linear codes with low dimensions have been explored, mostly from generalized Reed-Solomon codes. Characterizing Hermitian hulls which themselves are MDS appears to be more involved and has not been extensively studied. This paper introduces some tools to study linear codes whose Hermitian hulls are MDS. Using the tools, we then propose explicit constructions of such codes. We consider Hermitian hulls of both Reed-Solomon and non Reed-Solomon types of linear MDS codes. We demonstrate that, given the same Hermitian hull dimensions, the codes from our constructions have dimensions which are larger than those in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of deriving upper bounds on the parameters of sum-rank-metric codes, with focus on their dimension and block length. The sum-rank metric is a combination of the Hamming and the rank metric, and most of the available techniques to investigate it seem to be unable to fully capture its hybrid nature. In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on sum-rank-metric graphs, in which the vertices are tuples of matrices over a finite field, and where two such tuples are connected when their sum-rank distance is equal to one. We establish various structural properties of sum-rank-metric graphs and combine them with eigenvalue techniques to obtain bounds on the cardinality of sum-rank-metric codes. The bounds we derive improve on the best known bounds for several choices of the parameters. While our bounds are explicit only for small values of the minimum distance, they clearly indicate that spectral theory is able to capture the nature of the sum-rank-metric better than the currently available methods. They also allow us to establish new non-existence results for (possibly nonlinear) MSRD codes.},

  abstract     = {Doeblin coefficients are a classical tool for analyzing the ergodicity and exponential convergence rates of Markov chains. Propelled by recent works on contraction coefficients of strong data processing inequalities, we investigate whether Doeblin coefficients also exhibit some of the notable properties of canonical contraction coefficients. In this paper, we present several new structural and geometric properties of Doeblin coefficients. Specifically, we show that Doeblin coefficients form a multi-way divergence, exhibit tensorization, and possess an extremal trace characterization. We then show that they also have extremal coupling and simultaneously maximal coupling characterizations. By leveraging these characterizations, we demonstrate that Doeblin coefficients act as a nice generalization of the well-known total variation (TV) distance to a multi-way divergence, enabling us to measure the “distance” between multiple distributions rather than just two. We then prove that Doeblin coefficients exhibit contraction properties over Bayesian networks similar to other canonical contraction coefficients. We additionally derive some other results and discuss an application of Doeblin coefficients to distribution fusion. Finally, in a complementary vein, we introduce and discuss three new quantities: max-Doeblin coefficient, max-DeGroot distance, and min-DeGroot distance. The max-Doeblin coefficient shares a connection with the concept of maximal leakage in information security; we explore its properties and provide a coupling characterization. On the other hand, the max-DeGroot and min-DeGroot measures extend the concept of DeGroot distance to multiple distributions.},

The Markov chain on a tree is shown to possess a global Markov property based on graph separation; this property plays a key role in our proofs.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the secrecy results for the two-way wiretap channel (TW-WC) with an external eavesdropper under a strong secrecy metric. Employing non-adaptive coding, we analyze the information leakage and the decoding error probability, and derive inner bounds on the secrecy capacity regions for the TW-WC under strong joint and individual secrecy constraints. For the TW-WC without cost constraint, both the secrecy and error exponents could be characterized by the conditional Rényi mutual information in a concise and compact form. And, some special cases secrecy capacity region and sum-rate capacity results are established, demonstrating that adaption is useless in some cases or the maximum sum-rate that could be achieved by non-adaptive coding. For the TW-WC with cost constraint, we consider the peak cost constraint and extend our secrecy results by using the constant composition codes. Accordingly, we characterize both the secrecy and error exponents by a modification of Rényi mutual information, which yields inner bounds on the secrecy capacity regions for the general discrete memoryless TW-WC with cost constraint. Our method works even when a pre-noisy processing is employed based on a conditional distribution in the encoder and can be easily extended to other multi-user communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {We consider communication over channels whose statistics are not known in full, but can be parameterized as a finite family of memoryless channels. A typical approach to address channel uncertainty is to design codes for the worst channel in the family, resulting in the well-known compound channel capacity. Although this approach is robust, it may suffer a significant loss of performance if the capacity-achieving distribution of the worst channel attains low rates over other channels. In this work, we cope with channel uncertainty through the lens of competitive analysis. The main idea is to optimize a relative metric that compares the performance of the designed code and a clairvoyant code that has access to the true channel. To allow communication rates that adapt to the channel at use, we consider rateless codes with a fixed number of message bits and random decoding times. We propose two competitive metrics: the competitive ratio between the expected rates of the two codes, and a regret defined as the difference between the expected rates. The competitive ratio, for instance, provides a percentage guarantee on the expected rate of the designed code when compared to the rate of the clairvoyant code that knows the channel at hand. Our main results are single-letter expressions for the optimal competitive-ratio and regret, expressed as a max-min or min-max optimization. Several examples illustrate the benefits of the competitive analysis approach to code design compared to the compound channel.},

Our approach integrates nonlinear Bayesian filtering methods into mathematical neuroscience by establishing the state-space representation for the SDNF models with the delays. This allows to formulate the filtering problem in order to reconstruct the average membrane potential from incomplete data available from measurement devices. Additionally, when the state-space model is set up, the unknown system parameters can be estimated in a systematic way, for example, by using the method of maximum likelihood. In this paper, we derive for the first time the SDNF-oriented adaptive Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with the space-dependent delays in order to calibrate the SDNF models and to reconstruct the average membrane potential from incomplete data collected. The main benefit of the novel methodology is that both problems–the state and parameter estimation–are solved in parallel. The numerical experiments are provided to illustrate a performance of the novel methodology.},

Furthermore, if the energy sum of the most significant $\sqrt {k}$ elements in $\mathbf {x}$ is comparable to $\| \mathbf {x}\|^{2}$ , the SPR algorithm can exactly recover $\mathbf {x}$ with $\Omega (k \log n)$ magnitude-only samples, which attains the information-theoretic sampling complexity for sparse phase retrieval.

  abstract     = {Traditional machine learning techniques require centralizing all training data on one server or data hub. However, with the development of communication technologies and a huge amount of decentralized data on many clients, collaborative machine learning has become the main interest while providing privacy-preserving frameworks. Federated learning (FL) provides such a solution to learn a shared model while keeping training data at local clients. On the other hand, in a wide range of machine learning and signal processing applications, the desired solution naturally has a certain structure that can be framed as sparsity with respect to a certain dictionary. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with sparsity constraints and solving it efficiently has been one of the primary research topics in the traditional centralized setting. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework, federated gradient matching pursuit (FedGradMP), to solve the sparsity constrained minimization problem in the FL setting. We also generalize our algorithms to accommodate various practical FL scenarios when only a subset of clients participate per round, when the local model estimation at clients could be inexact, or when the model parameters are sparse with respect to general dictionaries. Our theoretical analysis shows the linear convergence of the proposed algorithms. A variety of numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the great potential of the proposed framework – fast convergence both in communication rounds and computation time for many important scenarios without intricate parameter tuning.},

This would allow to break the McEliece scheme as soon as the code rate is large enough and would break all instances of the CFS signature scheme. We give for the first time a positive answer for this problem when the code is a generic alternant code and when the code field size $q$ is small: $q \in \{2,3\}$ and for all regimes of other parameters for which the aforementioned distinguisher works. This breakthrough has been obtained by two different ingredients: (i) a way of using code shortening and the component-wise product of codes to derive from the original alternant code a sequence of alternant codes of decreasing degree up to getting an alternant code of degree 3 (with a multiplier and support related to those of the original alternant code); (ii) an original Gröbner basis approach which takes into account the non standard constraints on the multiplier and support of an alternant code which recovers in polynomial time the relevant algebraic structure of an alternant code of degree 3 from the mere knowledge of a basis for it.},

  abstract     = {SNOW-V and SNOW-Vi are two new LFSR-based stream ciphers of the SNOW family designed for the 5G mobile communication system. Correlation attack is a well-known cryptanalysis tool for LFSR-based stream ciphers. The first step of a correlation attack is to establish a linear approximation of the cipher with high correlation. The process can be modeled and solved by automatic techniques. How to efficiently model the 8-bit S-box and how to give an effective search strategy are two challenges to automatically search for linear approximations of SNOW-V-like ciphers. For the first problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer dimension reduction method for modeling large S-boxes with Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). It can transform the problem of modeling a high-dimensional set into sub-problems of modeling some low-dimensional sets. For the second problem, we propose an efficient heuristic MILP search algorithm for SNOW-V-like ciphers, which is applied to searching for the linear approximations of SNOW-V, SNOW-Vi, SNOW-Vi $_{\boxplus _{32},\boxplus _{8}}$ , SNOW-Vi $_{\boxplus _{16},\boxplus _{16}}$ and SNOW-Vi $_{\sigma _{0}}$ ciphers with high absolute correlations. Then we get the best absolute correlations of these ciphers at present, where the linear approximation of SNOW-Vi with the absolute correlation $2^{-45.796}$ improves the absolute correlation $2^{-47.76}$ proposed at EUROCRYPT 2022 by Shi et al. and the absolute correlation $2^{-47.567}$ proposed at DCC 2022 by Zhou et al. Thus, a correlation attack with time/data/memory complexity of $2^{243.79}/2^{235.08}/2^{235.08}$ is got. It is also the best state recovery attack at present. Thirdly, to simplify the search algorithm of the linear approximations of SNOW-V, we give two sufficient conditions under which a linear approximation of SNOW-Vi is also a linear approximation of SNOW-V. It can be proved that the correlation attack on SNOW-V has the same attack complexity as SNOW-Vi. Finally, for SNOW-Vi $_{\boxplus _{32},\boxplus _{8}}$ and SNOW-Vi $_{\sigma _{0}}$ , we give the best state recovery attacks so far. The current best state recovery attacks of SNOW-Vi $_{\boxplus _{32},\boxplus _{8}}$ and SNOW-Vi $_{\sigma _{0}}$ can be reduced by a factor of 264 and 262, respectively. We also give the first attack on SNOW-Vi $_{\boxplus _{16},\boxplus _{16}}$ . We emphasize that the new heuristic MILP model can be applied to the security evaluation of correlation attacks on the LFSR-based stream cipher structures. In addition, note that the existing fast correlation attacks, including our attacks do not threaten the security of SNOW-V-like ciphers because of the design constraint that the maximum length of keystream for a single pair of key and IV vectors is 264.},

By imposing restrictions on permutations $\pi $ of $\mathbb {F}_{2}^{n/2}$ , we specify the conditions so that Maiorana-McFarland bent functions $f(x,y)=x\cdot \pi (y) + h(y)$ admit a unique $\mathcal {M}$ -subspace of dimension $n/2$ . On the other hand, we show that permutations $\pi $ with linear structures give rise to Maiorana-McFarland bent functions that do not have this property. In this way, we contribute to the classification of Maiorana-McFarland bent functions, since the number of $\mathcal {M}$ -subspaces of a fixed dimension is invariant under equivalence. Additionally, we give several generic methods of specifying permutations $\pi $ so that $f\in \mathcal {M}$ admits a unique $\mathcal {M}$ -subspace. Most notably, using the knowledge about $\mathcal {M}$ -subspaces, we show that using the bent 4-concatenation of four suitably chosen Maiorana-McFarland bent functions on $\mathbb {F}_{2}^{n-2}$ , one can in a generic manner generate bent functions on $\mathbb {F}_{2}^{n}$ outside the completed Maiorana-McFarland class $\mathcal {M}^{\#}$ for any even $n\geq 8$ . Remarkably, with our construction methods, it is possible to obtain inequivalent bent functions on $\mathbb {F}_{2}^{8}$ not stemming from the two primary classes, the partial spread class $\mathcal {PS}$ and $\mathcal {M}$ . In this way, we contribute to a better understanding of the origin of bent functions in eight variables, since only a small fraction of about 276 bent functions stems from $\mathcal {PS}$ and $\mathcal {M}$ , whereas their total number on $\mathbb {F}_{2}^{8}$ is approximately 2106.},

The second construction deals with a bent function $g\colon {\mathbb {F}} _{p^{m}}\to {\mathbb {F}} _{p}$ and a suitable subspace of derivatives of $g$ , i.e., functions of the form $g(y+a)-g(y)$ for some $a\in {\mathbb {F}} _{p^{m}}^{\star} $ . We also provide a sound generalization of the recently introduced concept of non-covering permutations. Some important structural properties of this class of permutations are derived in this context. The most remarkable observation is that the class of non-covering permutations includes all APN power permutations (characterized by having two-to-one derivatives). Finally, the last construction combines the previous two methods (direct sum, non-covering permutations and subspaces of derivatives), using a bent function in the Maiorana-McFarland class, to construct minimal codes (even those violating the Ashikhmin-Barg bound) with larger dimensions. This last method proves to be highly flexible since it can lead to several non-equivalent codes, depending to a great extent on the choice of the underlying non-covering permutation.},

  abstract     = {The K User Linear Computation Broadcast (LCBC) problem is comprised of d dimensional data (from $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ ), that is fully available to a central server, and K users, who require various linear computations of the data, and have prior knowledge of various linear functions of the data as side-information. The optimal broadcast cost is the minimum number of q-ary symbols to be broadcast by the server per computation instance, for every user to retrieve its desired computation. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost is called the capacity. The main contribution of this paper is the exact capacity characterization for the $K=3$ user LCBC for all cases, i.e., for arbitrary finite fields $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ , arbitrary data dimension d, and arbitrary linear side-informations and demands at each user. A remarkable aspect of the converse (impossibility result) is that unlike the 2 user LCBC whose capacity was determined previously, the entropic formulation (where the entropies of demands and side-informations are specified, but not their functional forms) is insufficient to obtain a tight converse for the 3 user LCBC. Instead, the converse exploits functional submodularity. Notable aspects of achievability include sufficiency of vector linear coding schemes, subspace decompositions that parallel those found previously by Yao Wang in degrees of freedom (DoF) studies of wireless broadcast networks, and efficiency tradeoffs that lead to a constrained waterfilling solution. Random coding arguments are invoked to resolve compatibility issues that arise as each user has a different view of the subspace decomposition, conditioned on its own side-information.},

Both MP and GGASP codes achieve the recovery threshold of Entangled Polynomial Codes for robustness against stragglers, but MP codes can decode below this recovery threshold depending on the set of worker nodes which fails.

  abstract     = {We introduce a family of information leakage measures called maximal $(\alpha,\beta)$ -leakage ( $\text{M}\alpha $ beL), parameterized by real numbers $\alpha $ and $\beta $ greater than or equal to 1. The measure is formalized via an operational definition involving an adversary guessing an unknown (randomized) function of the data given the released data. We obtain a simplified computable expression for the measure and show that it satisfies several basic properties such as monotonicity in $\beta $ for a fixed $\alpha $ , non-negativity, data processing inequalities, and additivity over independent releases. We highlight the relevance of this family by showing that it bridges several known leakage measures, including maximal $\alpha $ -leakage $(\beta =1)$ , maximal leakage $(\alpha =\infty,\beta =1)$ , local differential privacy (LDP) $(\alpha =\infty,\beta =\infty)$ , and local Rényi differential privacy (LRDP) $(\alpha =\beta)$ , thereby giving an operational interpretation to local Rényi differential privacy. We also study a conditional version of $\text{M}\alpha $ beL on leveraging which we recover differential privacy and Rényi differential privacy. A new variant of LRDP, which we call maximal Rényi leakage, appears as a special case of $\text{M}\alpha $ beL for $\alpha =\infty $ that smoothly tunes between maximal leakage ( $\beta =1$ ) and LDP ( $\beta =\infty $ ). Finally, we show that a vector form of the maximal Rényi leakage relaxes differential privacy under Gaussian and Laplacian mechanisms.},

Recent research provides a fundamental understanding of the conditions under which privacy attacks, in the form of database matching, are successful in the presence of obfuscation. Motivated by synchronization errors stemming from the sampling of time-indexed databases, this paper presents a unified framework considering both obfuscation and synchronization errors and investigates the matching of databases under noisy entry repetitions. By investigating different structures for the repetition pattern, replica detection and seeded deletion detection algorithms are devised and sufficient and necessary conditions for successful matching are derived. Finally, the impacts of some variations of the underlying assumptions, such as the adversarial deletion model, seedless database matching, and zero-rate regime, on the results are discussed. Overall, our results provide insights into the privacy-preserving publication of anonymized and obfuscated time-indexed data as well as the closely related problem of the capacity of synchronization channels.},

Under the alternative, there exists a planted $k_{ \mathsf {R}} \times k_{ \mathsf {L}}$ bipartite subgraph with edge density $p&amp;gt;q$ . We characterize the statistical and computational barriers for this problem. Specifically, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds, and design and analyze optimal algorithms matching those bounds, in both the dense regime, where $p,q = \Theta \left ({1}\right)$ , and the sparse regime where $p,q = \Theta \left ({n^{-\alpha }}\right), \alpha \in \left ({0,2}\right]$ . We also consider the problem of testing in polynomial-time. As is customary in similar structured high-dimensional problems, our model undergoes an “easy-hard-impossible” phase transition and computational constraints penalize the statistical performance. To provide an evidence for this statistical computational gap, we prove computational lower bounds based on the low-degree conjecture, and show that the class of low-degree polynomials algorithms fail in the conjecturally hard region.},

Firstly, we develop a group coordinate descent(GCD) algorithm to simultaneously complete group selection and group estimation, and prove the convergence to the proposed GCD algorithm under mild conditions. Secondly, we apply the training set and group estimations to obtain class probability estimators, choose the Bayes classifier to identify class index information, and introduce the testing set and a few measures to assess multi-category prediction performance. Simulations show that the proposed methods outperform LASSO/SCAD/MCP penalized MLM, 3 deep learning methods and 3 machine learning methods in terms of Kappa, PDI(polytomous discrimination index), Optimal or Average Accuracy. Finally, we combine group penalized MLM with 58 technical indicators to predict up trends, sideways trends and down trends for stock returns, and show that the proposed methods outperform the other 9 methods in terms of Accuracy, PDI, Kappa and HUM. Therefore, the proposed method can not only accommodate the correlation information, but also improve multi-category prediction performance by shrinking group coefficients.},

Specifically, the generalization gap of a decoder is the difference between empirical and expected bit-error-rate(s). We present new theoretical results which bound this gap and show the dependence on the decoder complexity, in terms of code parameters (blocklength, message length, variable/check node degrees), decoding iterations, and the training dataset size. Results are presented for both regular and irregular parity-check matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first set of theoretical results on generalization performance of neural network based decoders.

Our interest is in the asymptotics as the error probability vanishes. We provide an asymptotic lower bound on the growth rate of the expected stopping time of any algorithm. Furthermore, we show that for any algorithm whose upper bound on the expected stopping time matches with the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant (almost-optimal algorithm), the ratio of any two consecutive communication time instants must be bounded, a result that is of independent interest. We thereby infer that an algorithm can communicate no more sparsely than at exponential time instants in order to be almost-optimal. For the class of almost-optimal algorithms, we present the first-of-its-kind asymptotic lower bound on the expected number of communication rounds until stoppage. We propose a novel algorithm that communicates at exponential time instants, and demonstrate that it is asymptotically almost-optimal.},

Our study reveals that all local minima share a common structure that partially identifies the cluster centers (i.e., means of the Gaussian components) of the true location mixture. Specifically, each local minimum can be represented as a non-overlapping combination of two types of sub-configurations: 1) fitting a single mean estimate to multiple Gaussian components; or 2) fitting multiple estimates to a single true component. These results apply to settings where the true mixture components satisfy a certain separation condition, and are valid even when the number of components is over- or under-specified. We also present a more fine-grained analysis for the setting of one-dimensional GMMs with three components, which provide sharper approximation error bounds with improved dependence on the separation parameter.},

This becomes unwieldy, especially with a large number of machines. In this paper, we delve into semi-supervised sparse statistical inference in a distributed setup. An efficient multi-round distributed debiased estimator, which integrates both labeled and unlabelled data, is developed. We will show that the additional unlabeled data helps to improve the statistical rate of each round of iteration. Our approach offers tailored debiasing methods for $M$ -estimation and generalized linear models according to the specific form of the loss function. Our method also applies to a non-smooth loss like absolute deviation loss. Furthermore, our algorithm is computationally efficient since it requires only one estimation of a high-dimensional inverse covariance matrix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by presenting simulation studies and real data applications that highlight the benefits of incorporating unlabeled data.},

  abstract     = {The fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy is a distinguishability measure that has appeared in a variety of contexts in prior work on quantum information, including resource theories like thermodynamics and coherence. Here we provide a comprehensive study of this quantity. First we prove that it satisfies several basic properties, including the data-processing inequality. We also establish connections between the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and other widely used information-theoretic quantities, including smooth min-relative entropy and smooth sandwiched Rényi relative entropy, of which the sandwiched Rényi relative entropy and smooth max-relative entropy are special cases. After that, we use these connections to establish the second-order asymptotics of the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and all smooth sandwiched Rényi relative entropies, finding that the first-order term is the quantum relative entropy and the second-order term involves the quantum relative entropy variance. Utilizing the properties derived, we also show how the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy provides one-shot bounds for operational tasks in general resource theories in which the target state is mixed, with a particular example being randomness distillation. The above observations then lead to second-order expansions of the upper bounds on distillable randomness, as well as the precise second-order asymptotics of the distillable randomness of particular classical–quantum states. Finally, we establish semi-definite programs for smooth max-relative entropy and smooth conditional min-entropy, as well as a bilinear program for the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy, which we subsequently use to explore the tightness of a bound relating the last to the first.},

  abstract     = {Suppose two separated parties, Alice and Bob, share a bipartite quantum state or a classical correlation called a seed, and they try to generate a target classical correlation by performing local quantum or classical operations on the seed, i.e., any communications are not allowed. We consider the following fundamental problem about this setting: whether Alice and Bob can use a given seed to generate a target classical correlation. We show that this problem has rich mathematical structures. Firstly, we prove that even if the seed is a pure bipartite state, the above decision problem is already NP-hard and a similar conclusion can also be drawn when the seed is also a classical correlation, implying that this problem is hard to solve generally. Furthermore, we prove that when the seed is a pure quantum state, solving the problem is equivalent to finding out whether the target classical correlation has some diagonal form of positive semi-definite factorizations that matches the seed pure state, revealing an interesting connection between the current problem and optimization theory. Based on this observation and other insights, we give several necessary conditions where the seed pure state has to satisfy to generate the target classical correlation, and it turns out that these conditions can also be generalized to the case that the seed is a mixed quantum state. Lastly, since diagonal forms of positive semi-definite factorizations play a crucial role in solving the problem, we develop an algorithm that can compute them for an arbitrary classical correlation, which has decent performance on the cases we test.},

In this paper, we consider the analysis and design of IRS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secure communications. We first investigate the fundamental limits of IRS-aided wiretap MIMO communications by determining the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and secrecy outage probability (SOP), which are not yet available in the literature. For that purpose, we derive the central limit theorem (CLT) for the joint distribution of the mutual information (MI) statistics over IRS-aided MIMO wiretap channels by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT). The CLT is then used to obtain the closed-form expressions for ESR and SOP, which are also extended to the scenario with multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Based on the theoretical results, algorithms for maximizing the artificial noise (AN)-aided ESR and minimizing SOP are proposed. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithms.},

IRSA-based schemes are considered here as an instance of the class of unsourced slotted random access codes, operating over a frame partitioned in time slots, and are obtained by concatenation of a medium access control layer code over the entire frame and a physical layer code over each slot. In this framework, an asymptotic analysis is carried out in presence of both collisions and slot decoding errors due to channel noise, which allows the derivation of density-evolution equations, asymptotic limits for minimum packet loss probability and average load threshold, and a converse bound for threshold values. This analysis is exploited as a tool for the evaluation of performance limits in terms of minimum signal-to-noise ratio required to achieve a given packet loss probability, and also provides convergence boundary limits that hold for any IRSA scheme with given physical layer coding scheme. The tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency is numerically evaluated comparing some known coding options, including those achieving random coding bounds at slot level. It is shown that IRSA-based schemes have a convergence boundary limit within few dB from the random coding bound when the number of active transmitters is sufficiently large.},

Precisely speaking, we present an explicit construction of a $q$ -ary 2-deletion correcting code with redundancy $5\log n+10\log \log n + 3\log q+O(1)$ where $q$ is assumed to be a constant with respect to $n$ . Using a minor modification to the original construction, we obtain an efficiently encodable $q$ -ary 2-deletion code that is efficiently list-decodable. Similarly, we show that our construction of list-decodable code requires a smaller redundancy compared to any existing list-decodable codes. To obtain our sketches, we transform a $q$ -ary codeword to a binary string which can then be used as an input to the underlying base binary sketch. This is then complemented with additional $q$ -ary sketches that the original $q$ -ary codeword is required to satisfy. In other words, we build our codes via a binary 2-deletion code as a black-box. Finally we utilize the binary 2-deletion code proposed by Guruswami and Håstad to our construction to obtain the main result of this paper.},

In this paper, an explicit formula, in some cases an upper bound, for the number of orbits of $\mathcal {G}$ on $\mathcal {C}\backslash \{\mathbf{ 0\}}$ is established. An explicit upper bound on the number of non-zero weights of $\mathcal {C}$ is consequently derived and a necessary and sufficient condition for the code $\mathcal {C}$ meeting the bound is exhibited. Many examples are presented to show that our new upper bounds are tight and are strictly less than the upper bounds in [Chen and Zhang, IEEE-TIT, 2023]. In addition, for two special classes of cyclic codes, smaller upper bounds on the number of non-zero weights of such codes are obtained by replacing $\mathcal {G}$ with larger subgroups of the automorphism groups of these codes. As a byproduct, our main results suggest a new way to find few-weight cyclic codes.},

Explicit constructions of such codes are scarce in the literature. In particular, known constructions of convolutional codes with rate $k/n$ and a maximum distance profile require a field of size at least exponential in $n$ for general code parameters. At the same time, the only known lower bound on the field size is the trivial bound that is linear in $n$ . In this paper, we show that a finite field of size $\Omega _{L}(n^{L-1})$ is necessary for constructing convolutional codes with rate $k/n$ and a maximum distance profile of length $L$ . As a direct consequence, this rules out the possibility of constructing convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile of length $L\geq 3$ over a finite field of size $O(n)$ . Additionally, we also present an explicit construction of convolutional code with rate $k/n$ and a maximum profile of length $L=1$ over a finite field of size $O(n^{\min \{k,n-k\}})$ , achieving a smaller field size than known constructions with the same profile length.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a novel framework for implementing error-correction in constrained systems. The main idea of our scheme, called Quantized-Constraint Concatenation (QCC), is to employ a process of embedding the codewords of an error-correcting code in a constrained system as a (noisy, non-invertible) quantization process. This is in contrast to traditional methods, such as concatenation and reverse concatenation, where the encoding into the constrained system is reversible. The possible number of channel errors QCC is capable of correcting is linear in the block length $n$ , improving upon the $O(\sqrt {n})$ possible with the state-of-the-art known schemes. For a given constrained system, the performance of QCC depends on a new fundamental parameter of the constrained system – its covering radius. Motivated by QCC, we study the covering radius of constrained systems in both combinatorial and probabilistic settings. We reveal an intriguing characterization of the covering radius of a constrained system using ergodic theory. We use this equivalent characterization in order to establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the covering radius.},

  abstract     = {Real-world distributed storage systems (DSSs) are heterogeneous because storage nodes may have unequal per-symbol storage costs, and network links may have unequal per-symbol transmission costs. For some general classes of heterogeneous DSSs, the optimal tradeoff between storage and repair costs achievable by functional repair codes is known (at least numerically). However, it is unclear whether exact-repair codes can achieve any point of such an optimal storage-repair tradeoff curve, especially at the point of the minimum storage cost. In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to the question by constructing the so-called heterogeneous minimum storage repair (HMSR) codes for both the average and worst-case repair costs. To optimize storage and repair costs, a heterogeneous DSS may need to adopt irregular array codes and repair a node by downloading unequal numbers of symbols from helper nodes. However, our results show that for almost all heterogeneous DSSs, exact-repair HMSR codes are regular array codes covering an adequately chosen set of nodes. Specifically, exact-repair HMSR codes are designed by stacking conventional MSR codes and applying different repair schemes to different layers. Still, this does not work for every heterogeneous DSS. It is proven that using regular or linear irregular array codes for constructing exact-repair HMSR codes is insufficient in some cases.},

  abstract     = {Spectral bounds form a powerful tool to estimate the minimum distances of quasi-cyclic codes. They generalize the defining set bounds of cyclic codes to those of quasi-cyclic codes. Based on the eigenvalues of quasi-cyclic codes and the corresponding eigenspaces, we provide an improved spectral bound for quasi-cyclic codes. Numerical results verify that the improved bound outperforms the Jensen bound in almost all cases. Based on the improved bound, we propose a general construction of quasi-cyclic codes with excellent designed minimum distances. For the quasi-cyclic codes produced by this general construction, the improved spectral bound is always sharper than the Jensen bound.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel communication channel, called the absorption channel, inspired by information transmission in neurons. Our motivation comes from in-vivo nano-machines, emerging medical applications, and brain-machine interfaces that communicate over the nervous system. For any given finite alphabet, we give codes that can correct absorption errors. For the binary alphabet, we show that the known binary (multiple-)deletion correcting codes already provide a good solution. For a single-absorption error, we show that the Varshamov-Tenengolts codes provide a near-optimal code in our setting. When the alphabet size $q$ is at least 3, we construct a single-absorption correcting code whose redundancy is at most $3\log _{q}(n)+O_{q}(1)$ . Then, based on this code and ideas introduced by Gabrys et al. (2022), we give a second construction of single-absorption correcting codes with redundancy $\log _{q}(n)+12\log _{q}\log _{q}(n)+O_{q}(1)$ , which is optimal up to an $O\left ({\log _{q}\log _{q}(n)}\right)$ . Here, $O_{q}(1)$ denotes a number dependent on $q$ but independent of the code-length $n$ . Finally, we apply the syndrome compression technique with pre-coding to obtain a subcode of the single-absorption correcting code. This subcode can combat multiple absorption errors and has low redundancy. For each setup, efficient encoders and decoders are provided.},

  abstract     = {Subfield codes of linear codes over finite fields have recently received much attention since they can produce optimal codes, which may have applications in secret sharing, authentication codes and association schemes. In this paper, we first present a construction framework of 3-dimensional linear codes ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ parameterized by any two functions $f, g$ over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ , and then study the properties of six types of ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}$ , its punctured code ${\mathcal{ C}}^{\ast}_{f,g}$ and their corresponding subfield codes over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . The classification of ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}$ is based on special choices of $f,g$ as trace function, norm function, almost bent function, Boolean bent function or a combination of these functions. For the first two types of ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}$ , we explicitly determine the weight distributions and dualities of ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}, {\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}^{\ast}$ and their subfield codes over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ . The remaining four types of ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}$ are restricted to $q=2$ , and the weight distributions and dualities of the subfields code ${\mathcal{ C}}_{f,g}^{(q)}$ and ${\cal C_{f,g}^{\ast}}^{(q)}$ are completely determined. Most of the resultant linear codes (over $\mathbb {F}_{q^{m}}$ or over $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ ) have few weights. Some of them are optimal and some have the best-known parameters according to the tables maintained at https://www.codetables.de . In fact, 16 infinite families of optimal linear codes are produced in this paper. As a byproduct, a family of $[2^{4m-2},2m+1,2^{4m-3}]$ quaternary Hermitian self-orthogonal codes are obtained with $m \geq 2$ . As an application, we present several infinite families of 2-designs or 3-designs with some of the codes presented in this paper.},

For any given string $ \mathbf {s}$ , we provide a method to explicitly construct the set of all strings with the same prefix-suffix composition multiset as $ \mathbf {s}$ , as well as a formula for the size of this set. Furthermore, we construct two classes of composition codes that can respectively correct composition missing errors and mass-reducing substitution errors.

We represent the given PICOD problem using a hypergraph consisting of $m$ messages as vertices and the request-sets of the $n$ clients as hyperedges. A conflict-free coloring of a hypergraph is an assignment of colors to its vertices so that each hyperedge contains a uniquely colored vertex. We show that various parameters arising out of conflict-free colorings (and some new variants) of the PICOD hypergraph result in new upper bounds for the optimal PICOD length. Using these new upper bounds, we show the existence of single-request PICOD schemes with length $O(\log ^{2}\Gamma)$ , where $\Gamma $ is the maximum number of hyperedges overlapping with any hyperedge. For the $t$ -request PICOD scenario, we show the existence of PICOD schemes of length $\max (O(\log \Gamma \log m), O(t \log m))$ , under some mild conditions on the graph parameters. These results improve upon earlier work in general. We also show that our achievable lengths in the $t$ -request case are asymptotically optimal, up to a multiplicative factor of $\log t$ . Our existence results are accompanied by randomized constructive algorithms, which have complexity polynomial in the parameters of the PICOD problem, in expectation or with high probability.},

The need for such codes arises in many settings of practical interest, including wireless communication and flash memory systems. In many such settings, a smaller field size is achievable than that offered by MDS and other standard codes. We establish a connection between the minimum alphabet size of codes in this generalized setting and the combinatorial properties of the hypergraph that represents the pre-specified collection of erasure or error patterns. We also establish connections between error and erasure correcting codes in our generalized setting. Finally, we consider a variation of the problem that allows a small probability of decoding error and relate it to an approximate version of hypergraph coloring.},

These include the existence and uniqueness of minimum-degree annihilator skew polynomials and Lagrange interpolator skew polynomials. A general cubic-complexity sum-rank Welch-Berlekamp decoder and a quadratic-complexity sum-rank syndrome decoder (under some assumptions) are then provided over finite chain rings.

Known properties of star products also immediately yield a lower bound for the recovery threshold as well as an upper bound for the number of colluding workers the system can tolerate. Another bound on the recovery threshold is given by the decodability condition, which generalizes a bound for GASP codes. The framework produces many of the known SDMM schemes as special cases, thereby providing unification for the previous literature on the topic. Furthermore, error behavior specific to SDMM is discussed and interleaved codes are proposed as a suitable means for efficient error correction in the proposed model. Analysis of the error correction capability under natural assumptions about the error distribution is also provided, largely based on well-known results on interleaved codes. Error detection and other error distributions are also discussed.},

The signal model includes bandlimited functions with multi-band spectra. While in this well-studied setting delicate constructions provide sampling strategies that meet the information theoretic benchmark of Shannon and Landau, the sampling pattern that we consider provides, at the price of a logarithmic oversampling factor, a simple alternative that is accompanied by favorable a priori stability margins (snug frames). More generally, we also treat bandlimited functions with arbitrary compact spectra, and different measures of their complexity and approximation rates by integer tiles. At the technical level, we elaborate on recent work on relevant sampling, with the key difference that the reconstruction guarantees that we provide hold uniformly for all signals, rather than for a subset of well-concentrated ones.

  abstract     = {We propose a novel approach to concentration for non-independent random variables. The main idea is to “pretend” that the random variables are independent and pay a multiplicative price measuring how far they are from actually being independent. This price is encapsulated in the Hellinger integral between the joint and the product of the marginals, which is then upper bounded leveraging tensorisation properties. Our bounds represent a natural generalisation of concentration inequalities in the presence of dependence: we recover exactly the classical bounds (McDiarmid’s inequality) when the random variables are independent. Furthermore, in a “large deviations” regime, we obtain the same decay in the probability as for the independent case, even when the random variables display non-trivial dependencies. To show this, we consider a number of applications of interest. First, we provide a bound for Markov chains with finite state space. Then, we consider the Simple Symmetric Random Walk, which is a non-contracting Markov chain, and a non-Markovian setting in which the stochastic process depends on its entire past. To conclude, we propose an application to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, where our approach leads to an improved lower bound on the minimum burn-in period required to reach a certain accuracy. In all of these settings, we provide a regime of parameters in which our bound fares better than what the state of the art can provide.},

Inspired by the latest work (Cordero and Rodino, 2022), we revisit the notion of cross Wigner distribution in metaplectic transform domains by introducing two $2N\times 2N$ symplectic matrices rather than integrating them into one $4N\times 4N$ symplectic matrix. We style the derived general formulation as the cross metaplectic Wigner distribution and obtain its basic properties including time translation property, frequency modulation property, time translation and frequency modulation property, Moyal formula, complex conjugate symmetry, time reversal symmetry, and scaling property. We use it to define the so-called short-time metaplectic transform and clarify the equivalence between them. We establish the standard Heisenberg’s uncertainty principles for the cross metaplectic Wigner distribution, i.e., an attainable lower bound for two real-valued functions in cross metaplectic Wigner distribution domains and a sequence of attainable (unattainable) lower bounds for two complex-valued (one real-valued and the other complex-valued) functions in orthogonal, orthonormal, the minimum eigenvalue commutative and the maximum eigenvalue commutative cross metaplectic Wigner distribution domains. We further demonstrate the time-frequency superresolution superiority of the derived results over the conventional one through theoretical analyses and numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {The phase-shifting digital holography (PSDH) is a typical problem in holography. It is traditionally conducted by the measurements from multiple shots. The four- and three-shot approaches to PSDH are commonly utilized for the imaging of static objects. Unlike this, the imaging of dynamic objects requires that PSDH should be conducted by single-shot measurements. Motivated by this, we are interested in the single-shot phase retrieval (PR) problem for periodic signals. The reference wave we use for such a PR model is the plane reference wave, and the measurements are the single-shot intensities. A single-shot PR algorithm is established. Additionally, it is observed that what is required for the four- and three-shot approaches are essentially the intensity differences. From the perspective of intensity difference, the stability of the algorithm is systematically investigated. In particular, it is found that the stability depends on the correlation between the wave vector and sampling set. Based on the wave vector, the choice scheme for sampling set is designed such that the recovery is well-conditioned in the noisy setting. The simulation of image recovery confirms the correctness of related results.},

  abstract     = {With the growing practical applications of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), secure multi-party computation (MPC), and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK), there has been an increasing need to design and analyze symmetric primitives that have low multiplication complexity and depth. In this paper, we propose a permutation constructed upon a 4-round nonlinear feedback resistor over $ \mathbb {F}_{q}^{4}$ . Our proposed permutation has a multiplication depth of 2 and a multiplication complexity of 4. Significantly, its maximum differential/linear probability is bounded by $q^{-2}$ . Based on this nonlinear function, we propose a new family of block ciphers over $ \mathbb {F}_{q}^{16}$ called $ \mathsf {YuX}$ , whose decryption circuit is highly efficient for FHE evaluation. We further provide specific instantiations, denoted as $ \mathsf {Yu_{2}X}$ and $ \mathsf {Yu_{\mathrm {p}}X}$ , wherein $q$ takes the form of either $2^{n}$ or a prime $p$ , respectively. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive security analysis of $ \mathsf {YuX}$ within certain parameters against various cryptanalysis methods employing automatic analysis tools, including the differential attack, linear attack, impossible differential attack, zero-correlation attack, and integral attack, as well as Gröbner basis and linearization attacks. Our research indicates that $ \mathsf {YuX}$ maintains a robust security margin against those attacks. Finally, we present a detailed implementation of $ \mathsf {Yu_{2}X}$ and $ \mathsf {Yu_{\mathrm {p}}X}$ employing the BGV homomorphic encryption scheme. In comparison to ciphers over a field of characteristic 2, the outcomes evince that $ \mathsf {Yu_{2}X}$ -8 (over $ \mathbb {F}_{2^{8}}^{16}$ ) and $ \mathsf {Yu_{2}X}$ -16 (over $ \mathbb {F}_{2^{16}}^{16}$ ) achieve remarkably competitive throughputs, boasting performance approximately 12 times, 17 times, and 9 times superior to AES-128, CHAGHRI, and LowMC-128 (under 128-bit security), respectively. Furthermore, when juxtaposed with ciphers over a field of characteristic $p$ , the outcomes affirm that the throughput of $ \mathsf {Yu_{\mathrm {p}}X}$ -65537 (over $ \mathbb {F}_{65537}^{16}$ ) retains considerable competitiveness, registering an approximate fivefold enhancement relative to HERA. Evidently, $ \mathsf {YuX}$ exhibits superior throughput compared to a majority of symmetric ciphers within this category.},

  abstract     = {A secret sharing scheme enables the dealer to share a secret among $n$ parties. A classic secret sharing scheme takes the number $n$ of parties and the secret as the input. If $n$ is not known in advance, the classic secret sharing scheme may fail. Komargodski et al. (2016) first proposed the evolving secret sharing scheme that only takes the secret as the input. In the work Beimel and Othman (2020), Komargodski et al. (2016), and Komargodski and Paskin-Cherniavsky (2017), evolving threshold and ramp secret sharing schemes were extensively investigated. However, all of their constructions except for the first construction by Beimel and Othman (2020) are inspired by the scheme given by Komargodski et al. (2016), namely, these schemes rely on the scheme for st-connectivity which allows to generate infinite number of shares. In this work, we revisit evolving secret sharing schemes and present three constructions that take completely different approach. Our first scheme is an evolving $k$ -threshold secret sharing scheme with share size $k^{1+\epsilon }\log t$ for any constant $\epsilon \gt 0$ . Thus, our scheme achieves almost the same share size as by Komargodski et al. (2016). Moreover, our scheme is obtained by a direct construction while the scheme by Komargodski et al. (2016) that achieves the $(k-1)\log t$ share size is obtained by a recursive construction, which makes their structure complicated. Our second scheme is an evolving $k_{t}$ -threshold secret sharing scheme with any sequence $\{k_{t}\}_{t=1}^{\infty } $ of threshold values that has share size $t^{4}$ . This scheme improves the share size by $\log t$ given by Komargodski and Paskin-Cherniavsky (2017), where a dynamic evolving $k_{t}$ -threshold secret sharing scheme with the share size $O(t^{4}\log t)$ was proposed. In addition, we also show that if the threshold values $k_{t}$ grow in rate $\lfloor t^{\beta } \rfloor $ for a real $\beta \in (0,1)$ , then we have a dynamic evolving threshold secret sharing scheme with the share size $O(t^{4\beta })$ . Our last scheme is an evolving $(\alpha t,\beta t)$ -ramp secret sharing scheme with constant share size for some $\alpha ,\beta $ . One major feature of this ramp scheme is that it is multiplicative as the scheme is also an arithmetic secret sharing scheme. We note that the same technique by Komargodski and Paskin-Cherniavsky (2017) can also transform all of our schemes to a robust scheme as our scheme is linear.},

  abstract     = {Linear computation broadcast (LCBC) refers to a setting with d dimensional data stored at a central server, where K users, each with some prior linear side-information, wish to compute various linear combinations of the data. For each computation instance, the data is represented as a d-dimensional vector with elements in a finite field $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ where $p^{n}$ is a power of a prime. The computation is to be performed many times, and the goal is to determine the minimum amount of information per computation instance that must be broadcast to satisfy all the users. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost per computation instance is the capacity of LCBC. The capacity is known for up to $K=3$ users. Since LCBC includes index coding as a special case, large K settings of LCBC are at least as hard as the index coding problem. As such the general LCBC problem is beyond our reach and we do not pursue it. Instead of the general setting (all cases), by focusing on the generic setting (almost all cases) this work shows that the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC (where every user has $m&#39;$ dimensions of side-information and m dimensions of demand) for large number of users ( $K \geq d$ suffices) is $C_{g}=1/\Delta _{g}$ , where $\Delta _{g}=\min \left \{{\max \{0,d-m&#39;\}, \frac {dm}{m+m&#39;}}\right \}$ , is the broadcast cost that is both achievable and unbeatable asymptotically almost surely for large n, among all LCBC instances with the given parameters $p,K,d,m,m&#39;$ . Relative to baseline schemes of random coding or separate transmissions, $C_{g}$ shows an extremal gain by a factor of K as a function of number of users, and by a factor of $\approx d/4$ as a function of data dimensions, when optimized over remaining parameters. For arbitrary number of users, the generic capacity of the symmetric LCBC is characterized within a factor of 2.},

With top $r$ sparsification in FL, the users only upload the most significant $r$ fraction of updates, and download only the most significant $r&#39;$ fraction of parameters in order to reduce the communication cost. However, the values and the indices of the sparse updates and parameters leak information about the users’ private data. In this work, we consider an FL setting where $N$ non-colluding databases store the model to be trained, from which the users download and update sparse parameters privately, without revealing the values of the updates/parameters or their indices to the databases. We propose four schemes with different properties that are based on cross subspace alignment (CSA) and permutation techniques, to perform this task while achieving the minimum communication costs within the scope of CSA, and show that the information theoretic privacy of both the values and the positions of the sparse updates/parameters can be guaranteed. This is achieved at a considerable storage cost, though. To alleviate this, we generalize the schemes in such a way that the storage cost is reduced at the expense of a certain amount of information leakage, using a model segmentation mechanism. In general, we provide the trade-off between the communication cost, storage cost and information leakage in private FL with top $r$ sparsification.},

Existing studies on attributed graph alignment focus on either theoretical performance without computational constraints or empirical performance of efficient algorithms. This motivates us to investigate efficient algorithms with theoretical performance guarantee. In this paper, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms that exactly recover the vertex correspondence with high probability. The feasible region of the proposed algorithms is near optimal compared to the information-theoretic limits.

Typically, the graph is encoded as a matrix and eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix are then used to solve the given graph problem. Spectral algorithms have been successfully used for graph partitioning, hidden clique recovery and graph coloring. In this paper, we study the power of spectral algorithms using two matrices in a graph partitioning problem. We use two different matrices resulting from two different encodings of the same graph and then combine the spectral information coming from these two matrices. We analyze a two-matrix spectral algorithm for the problem of identifying latent community structure in large random graphs. In particular, we consider the problem of recovering community assignments exactly in the censored stochastic block model, where each edge status is revealed independently with some probability. We show that spectral algorithms based on two matrices are optimal and succeed in recovering communities up to the information theoretic threshold. Further, we show that for most choices of the parameters, any spectral algorithm based on one matrix is suboptimal. The latter observation is in contrast to our prior works (2022a, 2022b) which showed that for the symmetric Stochastic Block Model and the Planted Dense Subgraph problem, a spectral algorithm based on one matrix achieves the information theoretic threshold. We additionally provide more general geometric conditions for the (sub)-optimality of spectral algorithms.},

Among all the characteristics of an ideal nonparametric representation of high-dimensional complex data, sufficiency, low dimensionality and disentanglement are some of the most essential ones. We propose a deep dimension reduction approach to learning representations with these characteristics. The proposed approach is a nonparametric generalization of the sufficient dimension reduction method. We formulate the ideal representation learning task as that of finding a nonparametric representation that minimizes an objective function characterizing conditional independence and promoting disentanglement at the population level. We then estimate the target representation at the sample level nonparametrically using deep neural networks. We show that the estimated deep nonparametric representation is consistent in the sense that its excess risk converges to zero. Our extensive numerical experiments using simulated and real benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed methods have better performance than several existing dimension reduction methods and the standard deep learning models in the context of classification and regression.},

  abstract     = {Many data sources, including tracking social behavior to election polling to testing studies for understanding disease spread, are subject to sampling bias whose implications are not fully yet understood. In this paper we study estimation of a given feature (such as disease, or behavior at social media platforms) from biased samples, treating non-respondent individuals as missing data. Prevalence of the feature among sampled individuals has an upward bias under the assumption of individuals’ willingness to be sampled. This can be viewed as a regression model with symptoms as covariates and the feature as outcome. It is assumed that the outcome is unknown at the time of sampling, and therefore the missingness mechanism only depends on the covariates. We show that data, in spite of this, is missing at random only when the sizes of symptom classes in the population are known; otherwise data is missing not at random. With an information theoretic viewpoint, we show that sampling bias corresponds to external information due to individuals in the population knowing their covariates, and we quantify this external information by active information. The reduction in prevalence, when sampling bias is adjusted for, similarly translates into active information due to bias correction, with opposite sign to active information due to testing bias. We develop unified results that show that prevalence and active information estimates are asymptotically normal under all missing data mechanisms, when testing errors are absent and present respectively. The asymptotic behavior of the estimators is illustrated through simulations.},

  abstract     = {Since its development, the minimax framework has been one of the corner stones of theoretical statistics, and has contributed to the popularity of many well-known estimators, such as the regularized M-estimators for high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we will first show through the example of sparse Gaussian sequence model, that the theoretical results under the classical minimax framework are insufficient for explaining empirical observations. In particular, both hard and soft thresholding estimators are (asymptotically) minimax, however, in practice they often exhibit sub-optimal performances at various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. The first contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that this issue can be resolved if the signal-to-noise ratio is taken into account in the construction of the parameter space. We call the resulting minimax framework the signal-to-noise ratio aware minimaxity. The second contribution of this paper is to showcase how one can use higher-order asymptotics to obtain accurate approximations of the SNR-aware minimax risk and discover minimax estimators. The theoretical findings obtained from this refined minimax framework provide new insights and practical guidance for the estimation of sparse signals.},

  abstract     = {Quantum teleportation is a quantum communication primitive that allows a long-distance quantum channel to be built using pre-shared entanglement and one-way classical communication. However, the quality of the established channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In this work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of teleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state discrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding protocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success probability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in one-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover, our established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to show that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage for dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication capacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible information of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple proof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not provide any advantage in dense coding.},

We establish a one-shot error exponent bound and a one-shot strong converse bound on the approximation error measured in terms of the expected trace distance between the codebook-induced state and the true channel output state. When using independent and identically-distributed random codebook with a rate above the quantum mutual information $I(X{\,:\,}B)_{\rho} $ , we prove that the error decays exponentially with its error exponent expressed by the sandwiched Rényi information. On the other hand, when the rate of the codebook size is below the quantum mutual information, the error converges to one exponentially fast. Similar results are obtained using a random constant composition codebook, whereas the sandwiched Augustin information gives the error exponent. In addition to the above large deviation analysis, our results also hold in the moderate deviation regime.},

Inspired by the duality connections between the rate-distortion and channel coding problems in the classical setting, we propose a new formulation for the lossy quantum source coding problem. This formulation differs from the existing quantum rate-distortion theory in two aspects. Firstly, we require that the reconstruction of the compressed quantum source fulfill a global error constraint as opposed to the sample-wise local error criterion used in the standard rate-distortion setting. Secondly, to measure the reconstruction error, instead of a distortion observable, we employ the notion of a backward quantum channel which we refer to as a “posterior reference map”. Using these, we characterize the asymptotic performance limit in terms of single-letter coherent information of the given posterior reference map. We also develop analogous formulations for the quantum-classical and classical variants and characterize their asymptotic performance limits in terms of single-letter mutual information quantities with respect to appropriately defined channels analogous to the posterior reference map. We also provide various examples for the three formulations, and shed light on their connection to the standard rate-distortion formulation wherever possible.},

The error probabilities are then conditioned on a successful attempt, with inconclusive trials disregarded. We completely characterise this task in both the single-shot and asymptotic regimes, providing exact formulas for the optimal error probabilities. In particular, we prove that the asymptotic error exponent of discriminating any two quantum states $\rho $ and $\sigma $ is given by the Hilbert projective metric $D_{\max }(\rho \|\sigma ) + D_{\max }(\sigma \| \rho )$ in asymmetric hypothesis testing, and by the Thompson metric $\max \! \big \{ D_{\max }(\rho \|\sigma ),\, D_{\max }(\sigma \| \rho ) \big \}$ in symmetric hypothesis testing. This endows these two quantities with fundamental operational interpretations in quantum state discrimination. Our findings extend to composite hypothesis testing, where we show that the asymmetric error exponent with respect to any convex set of density matrices is given by a regularisation of the Hilbert projective metric. We apply our results also to quantum channels, showing that no advantage is gained by employing adaptive or even more general discrimination schemes over parallel ones, in both the asymmetric and symmetric settings. Our state discrimination results make use of no properties specific to quantum mechanics and are also valid in general probabilistic theories.},

Our work is motivated by the increasing experimental and technological relevance of CV systems in quantum information, quantum communication, quantum sensing, quantum simulations, quantum computing and error correction. We introduce two experimentally realisable schemes for obtaining classical shadows of CV (possibly non-Gaussian) quantum states using only randomised Gaussian unitaries and easily implementable Gaussian measurements such as homodyne and heterodyne detection. For both schemes, we show that $N=\mathcal {O}\left({\mathrm {poly}\left({\frac {1}{\epsilon },\log \left({\frac {1}{\delta }}\right),M_{n}^{r+\alpha },\log (m)}\right)}\right)$ samples of an unknown $m$ -mode state $\rho $ suffice to learn the expected value of any $r$ -local polynomial in the canonical observables of degree $\alpha $ , both with high probability $1-\delta $ and accuracy $\epsilon $ , as long as the state $\rho $ has moments of order $n&amp;gt;\alpha $ bounded by $M_{n}$ . By simultaneously truncating states and operators in energy and phase space, we are able to overcome new mathematical challenges that arise due to the infinite dimensionality of CV systems. We also provide a scheme to learn nonlinear functionals of the state, such as entropies over any small number of modes, by leveraging recent energy-constrained entropic continuity bounds. Finally, we provide numerical evidence of the efficiency of our protocols in the case of CV states of relevance in quantum information theory, including ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians of many-body systems and cat qubit states. We expect our scheme to provide good recovery in learning relevant states of 2D materials and photonic crystals.},

In this paper, we propose multi-access distributed computing (MADC) as a generalization of the original CDC model, where now mappers (nodes in charge of the map functions) and reducers (nodes in charge of the reduce functions) are distinct computing nodes that are connected through a multi-access network topology. Focusing on the MADC setting with combinatorial topology, which implies $\Lambda $ mappers and $K$ reducers such that there is a unique reducer connected to any $\alpha $ mappers, we propose a coded scheme and an information-theoretic converse, which jointly identify the optimal inter-reducer communication load, as a function of the computation load, to within a constant gap of 1.5. Additionally, a modified coded scheme and converse identify the optimal max-link communication load across all existing links to within a gap of 4.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a design criterion depending on a lattice’s volume and theta series, called the secrecy gain, was proposed to quantify the secrecy-goodness of the applied lattice code for the Gaussian wiretap channel. To address the secrecy gain of Construction A4 lattices from formally self-dual $ \mathbb {Z}_{4}$ -linear codes, i.e., codes for which the symmetrized weight enumerator (swe) coincides with the swe of its dual, we present new constructions of $ \mathbb {Z}_{4}$ -linear codes which are formally self-dual with respect to the swe. For even lengths, formally self-dual $ \mathbb {Z}_{4}$ -linear codes are constructed from nested binary codes and double circulant matrices. For odd lengths, a novel construction called odd extension from double circulant codes is proposed. Moreover, the concepts of Type I/II formally self-dual codes/unimodular lattices are introduced. Next, we derive the theta series of the formally unimodular lattices obtained by Construction A4 from formally self-dual $ \mathbb {Z}_{4}$ -linear codes and describe a universal approach to determine their secrecy gains. The secrecy gain of Construction A4 formally unimodular lattices obtained from formally self-dual $ \mathbb {Z}_{4}$ -linear codes is investigated, both for even and odd dimensions. Numerical evidence shows that for some parameters, Construction A4 lattices can achieve a higher secrecy gain than the best-known formally unimodular lattices from the literature. Results concerning the flatness factor, another security criterion widely considered in the Gaussian wiretap channel, are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In the reconstruction model, first proposed by Levenshtein in 2001, a word is transmitted over multiple identical noisy channels that output distinct erroneous words. Given the channels’ outputs, unique decoding of the transmitted word is guaranteed to succeed only if the number of the channels is greater than a specific value. Otherwise, there may be several transmitted words that lead to the same channels’ outputs. In this case, these words are recovered using a list decoder. Calculating the largest list size is a fundamental task when studying the list decoding problem. The present work takes the first steps towards studying list decoding of insertions and deletions under the reconstruction model. More specifically, it assumes that an arbitrary binary word is transmitted over $m~t$ -insertion (or $t$ -deletion) identical channels, and provides the largest list size for specific values of $m$ . These results are mainly achieved by investigating the largest intersection of $m~t$ -insertion (or $t$ -deletion) balls surrounding arbitrary binary words in the space.},

The field size over which streaming codes are constructed is an important factor in determining the implementation complexity. The best-known explicit rate-optimal streaming code, which covers all $\{a,b,\tau \}$ parameter choices, requires a field size of $q^{2}$ , where $q \ge \tau +b-a$ is a prime power. In this work, we present an explicit rate-optimal streaming code over a field of size $q^{2}$ , for prime power $q \ge \tau $ . This is the smallest known field size for an explicit rate-optimal construction that takes into account all $\{a,b,\tau \}$ parameters. We achieve this by modifying the non-explicit code construction due to Krishnan et al., without changing the field size.

In recent years, many scholars have studied the construction of MDS self-dual codes through TGRS code. Among these works, the number of twists is actually quite small, and an important step in showing a TGRS code is self-dual is to find its parity-check matrix. In this paper, we focus on the computation of parity-check matrices of TGRS codes with almost no restrictions on twist and hook vectors. By application of elementary row (column) operations in linear algebra, we present a unified but elementary approach to obtain the parity-check matrices of TGRS codes. This paper creates a foundation for further study of MDS self-dual TGRS codes on a much broader scope.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a deterministic algorithm for computing the entire weight distribution of polar codes. As the first step, we derive an efficient recursive procedure to compute the weight distribution that arises in successive cancellation decoding of polar codes along any decoding path. This solves the open problem recently posed by Polyanskaya, Davletshin, and Polyanskii. Using this recursive procedure, at code length $n$ , we can compute the weight distribution of any polar cosets in time $O(n^{2})$ . We show that any polar code can be represented as a disjoint union of such polar cosets; moreover, this representation extends to polar codes with dynamically frozen bits. However, the number of polar cosets in such representation scales exponentially with a parameter introduced herein, which we call the mixing factor. To upper bound the complexity of our algorithm for polar codes being decreasing monomial codes, we study the range of their mixing factors. We prove that among all decreasing monomial codes with rates at most 1/2, self-dual Reed-Muller codes have the largest mixing factors. To further reduce the complexity of our algorithm, we make use of the fact that, as decreasing monomial codes, polar codes have a large automorphism group. That automorphism group includes the block lower-triangular affine group (BLTA), which in turn contains the lower-triangular affine group (LTA). We prove that a subgroup of LTA acts transitively on certain subsets of decreasing monomial codes, thereby drastically reducing the number of polar cosets that we need to evaluate. This complexity reduction makes it possible to compute the weight distribution of polar codes at length $n=128$ .},

  abstract     = {Given a target distribution $\pi $ and an arbitrary Markov infinitesimal generator $L$ on a finite state space $\mathcal {X}$ , we develop three structured and inter-related approaches to generate new reversiblizations from $L$ . The first approach hinges on a geometric perspective, in which we view reversiblizations as projections onto the space of $\pi $ -reversible generators under suitable information divergences such as $f$ -divergences. With different choices of functions $f$ , we not only recover nearly all established reversiblizations but also unravel and generate new reversiblizations. Along the way, we unveil interesting geometric results such as bisection properties, Pythagorean identities, parallelogram laws and a Markov chain counterpart of the arithmetic-geometric-harmonic mean inequality governing these reversiblizations. This further serves as motivation for introducing the notion of information centroids of a sequence of Markov chains and to give conditions for their existence and uniqueness. Building upon the first approach, we view reversiblizations as generalized means. In this second approach, we construct new reversiblizations via different natural notions of generalized means such as the Cauchy mean or the dual mean. In the third approach, we combine the recently introduced locally-balanced Markov processes framework and the notion of convex *-conjugate in the study of $f$ -divergence. The latter offers a rich source of balancing functions to generate new reversiblizations.},

  abstract     = {One tuple of probability vectors is more informative than another tuple when there exists a single stochastic matrix transforming the probability vectors of the first tuple into the probability vectors of the other. This is called matrix majorization. Solving an open problem raised by Mu et al, we show that if certain monotones—namely multivariate extensions of Rényi divergences—are strictly ordered between the two tuples, then for sufficiently large $n$ , there exists a stochastic matrix taking the $n$ -fold Kronecker power of each input distribution to the $n$ -fold Kronecker power of the corresponding output distribution. The same conditions, with non-strict ordering for the monotones, are also necessary for such matrix majorization in large samples. Our result also gives conditions for the existence of a sequence of statistical maps that asymptotically (with vanishing error) convert a single copy of each input distribution to the corresponding output distribution with the help of a catalyst that is returned unchanged. Allowing for transformation with arbitrarily small error, we find conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for such catalytic matrix majorization. We derive our results by building on a general algebraic theory of preordered semirings recently developed by one of the authors. This also allows us to recover various existing results on majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime as well as relative majorization in a unified manner.},

We use $({\mathbf {s}}_{1}{\mathbf {s}}_{2};C_{1}, C_{2}; f)$ to denote the model in which it is assumed that $C_{1}\geq C_{2}$ by symmetry. The compression capacity for the model is defined as the maximum average number of times that the function $f$ can be compressed with zero error for one use of the system, which measures the efficiency of using the system. We fully characterize the compression capacities for all the four cases of the model $({\mathbf {s}}_{1}{\mathbf {s}}_{2};C_{1}, C_{2}; f)$ for ${\mathbf {s}}_{1}{\mathbf {s}}_{2}=00,01,10,11$ . Here, the characterization of the compression capacity for the case $(01;C_{1},C_{2};f)$ with $C_{1}&amp;gt;C_{2}$ is highly nontrivial, where a novel graph coloring approach is developed. Furthermore, we apply the compression capacity for $(01;C_{1},C_{2};f)$ to an open problem in network function computation that whether the best known upper bound of Guang et al. on computing capacity is in general tight. Up to now, we are not aware of any example for which this upper bound is not tight. By considering a network function computation model transformed from $(01;C_{1},C_{2};f)$ with $C_{1}&amp;gt;C_{2}$ , we give the answer that in general the upper bound of Guang et al. is not tight.},

This refined approach is illustrated with simplified/corrected proofs of the Liu-Viswanath extremal inequality and a vector generalization of Costa’s entropy power inequality. The power of this refinement is further demonstrated by characterizing two information-theoretic limits, namely, the capacity region of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel with private and common messages and the rate-distortion-equivocation function of vector Gaussian secure source coding, which have previously resisted the attack of the conventional approach.},

  abstract     = {We derive a new upper bound on the reliability function for channel coding over discrete memoryless channels. Our bounding technique relies on two main elements: (i) adding an auxiliary genie-receiver that reveals to the original receiver a list of codewords including the transmitted one, which satisfy a certain type property, and (ii) partitioning (most of) the list into subsets of codewords that satisfy a certain pairwise-symmetry property, which facilitates lower bounding of the average error probability by the pairwise error probability within a subset. We compare the obtained bound to the Shannon-Gallager-Berlekamp straight-line bound, the sphere-packing bound, and an amended version of Blahut’s bound. Our bound is shown to be at least as tight for all rates, with cases of stricter tightness in a certain range of low rates, compared to all three aforementioned bounds. Our derivation is performed in a unified manner which is valid for any rate, as well as for a wide class of additive decoding metrics, whenever the corresponding zero-error capacity is zero. We further present a relatively simple function that coincides with our bound for symmetric channels having binary input, and may be regarded as an approximation to the reliability function in other cases. We also present a dual form of the bound, and discuss a looser bound of a simpler form, which is analyzed for the case of the binary symmetric channel with maximum likelihood decoding.},

First, we give some readily-checked conditions on measurement noises and sensor deployment to guarantee the asymptotic identifiability of the model and show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. Then, we devise an estimator that owns the same asymptotic property as the ML one. Specifically, we prove that the negative log-likelihood function converges to a function, which has a unique minimum and positive definite Hessian at the true source’s position. Hence, it is promising to execute local iterations, e.g., the Gauss-Newton (GN) algorithm, following a consistent estimate. The main issue involved is obtaining a preliminary consistent estimate. To this aim, we construct a linear least-squares problem via algebraic operation and constraint relaxation and obtain a closed-form solution. We then focus on deriving and eliminating the bias of the linear least-squares estimator, which yields an asymptotically unbiased and further consistent estimate. Noting that the bias is a function of the noise variance, we further devise a consistent noise variance estimator that involves a 3-order polynomial rooting. Based on the preliminary consistent location estimate, a one-step GN iteration suffices to achieve the same asymptotic property as the ML estimator. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in the large sample case.},

The IP algorithm provides remedies for unpredictable numerical outcomes when a corresponding floating-point (FP) Levinson algorithm either overlooks zero principal minors (PMs) or applies a singularity skipping routine to a PM that is considered erroneously to be zero. The error-free computational edge of integer arithmetic is also applicable to a non-integer Toeplitz matrix by first scaling it up to an acceptably accurate integer matrix.

The focus is on scenarios where the noise is additive Gaussian with an arbitrary known covariance matrix. The goal is to characterize the probability of error and its behavior when a linear decoder (that is, a linear estimator followed by a sorting operation) is employed. First, a general expression is derived for the probability of error when a linear decoder is used. The derived expression holds for any continuous distribution of the input data vector, and when the noise has memory. Then, the rates of convergence of the probability of error in the low-noise and high-noise regimes are investigated when a simple linear decoder is used. It is shown that in the low-noise regime, the probability of error can quadratically increase with $n$ , and in the high-noise regime it behaves as $1-1/n!$ for several distributions of interest. Finally, upper and lower bounds on the probability of correctness with respect to $n$ are derived for the case of an i.i.d. data distribution and show that the rate of convergence is at least exponential in $n$ . The results showcase that the permutation recovery problem is noise dominated, which motivates the study of more relaxed versions of the permutation recovery problem that are also discussed.},

Moreover, the receiver learns only one of these messages. Oblivious Transfer combiners take $n$ instances of OT protocols as input, and produce an OT protocol that is secure if sufficiently many of the $n$ original OT instances are secure. We present new 1-out-of- $q$ OT combiners that are perfectly secure against active adversaries. Our combiners arise from secret sharing techniques. We show that given an $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ -linear secret sharing scheme on a set of $n$ participants and adversary structure $\mathcal {A}$ , we can construct an $n$ -server, 1-out-of- $q$ OT combiner that is secure against an adversary corrupting either Alice and a set of servers in $\mathcal {A}$ , or Bob and a set of servers $B$ with $\bar {B}\notin \mathcal {A}$ . If the normalized total share size of the scheme is $\ell $ , then the resulting OT combiner requires $\ell $ calls to OT protocols, and the total amount of bits exchanged during the protocol is $(q^{2}+q+1)\ell \log q$ . We also present a construction based on 1-out-of-2 OT combiners that uses the protocol of Crépeau, Brassard and Robert (FOCS 1986). This construction provides smaller communication costs for certain adversary structures, such as threshold ones: For any prime power $q\geq n$ , there are $n$ -server, 1-out-of- $q$ OT combiners that are perfectly secure against active adversaries corrupting either Alice or Bob, and a minority of the OT candidates, exchanging $O(qn\log q)$ bits in total.},

Since in most applications, the optimizer itself is of significantly more interest than the optimal value of the corresponding function, we will focus on computability of the optimizer. In fact, we will show that in various situations the optimizer is unattainable on Turing machines and consequently on digital computers. Moreover, even worse, there does not exist a Turing machine, which approximates the optimizer itself up to a certain constant error. We prove such results for a variety of well-known problems from very different areas, including artificial intelligence, financial mathematics, and information theory, often deriving the even stronger result that such problems are not Banach-Mazur computable, also not even in an approximate sense.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies suggested that the BitTorrent’s rarest-first (RF) protocol, owing to its work-conserving nature, can become unstable in the presence of non-persistent users. Consequently, for any provably stable protocol, many peers, at some point, have to be forced to hold off their file-download activity. In this work, we propose a tunable piece-selection policy that minimizes this (undesirable) requisite by combining the (work-conserving but not stabilizing) RF protocol with only an appropriate share of the (stabilizing but not work-conserving) mode-suppression (MS) protocol. We refer to this policy as “Rarest-First with Probabilistic Mode-Suppression” or simply RFwPMS. We study RFwPMS using a stochastic abstraction of the BitTorrent network that is general enough to capture a multi-swarm setting of non-persistent users—each swarm having its own altruistic preferences that may or may not overlap with those of other swarms. Using Lyapunov drift analysis, we show that for all kinds of inter-swarm behaviors and all arrival-rate configurations, RFwPMS is stable. Then, using the Kingman’s moment bound technique, we further show that the steady-state expected sojourn time of RFwPMS is independent of the arrival-rate in the single-swarm case (under a mild additional assumption). Finally, our simulation-based performance evaluation confirms our theoretical findings, and shows that the steady-state expected sojourn time is linear in the file-size (compared to our loose estimate of a polynomial with degree 6). Overall, an improved performance is observed in comparison to previously proposed stabilizing schemes like MS.},

In this paper we first present a geometric algorithm for computing an optimal power assignment over single Gaussian broadcast channel, which has linear complexity if all users are presorted either by weight or by noise. We also provide an intuitively appealing water-filling interpretation of this geometric algorithm. By leveraging such water-filling interpretation, we develop a water-filling algorithm for computing an optimal power assignment over parallel Gaussian broadcast channels, whose complexity is linear in the number of user-channel pairs if all users are presorted by weight. From these algorithmic studies, we derive clean and simple expressions of the maximum WSR in both integral forms and sum forms. By exploiting the rich property of those forms, we further give a linear-complexity algorithm for computing a power budget at the access point, subject to a given upper bound, which maximizes the difference between the maximum WSR and a linear cost of the power budget. The algorithmic studies in this paper also reveal that a single Gaussian broadcast channel can be decomposed into parallel Gaussian single-user channels which preserve the maximum WSR.},

  abstract     = {We consider the federated submodel learning (FSL) problem and propose an approach where clients are able to update the central model information theoretically privately. Our approach is based on private set union (PSU), which is further based on multi-message symmetric private information retrieval (MM-SPIR). The server has two non-colluding databases which keep the model in a replicated manner. With our scheme, the server does not get to learn anything further than the subset of submodels updated by the clients: the server does not get to know which client updated which submodel(s), or anything about the local client data. In comparison to the state-of-the-art private FSL schemes of Jia-Jafar and Vithana-Ulukus, our scheme does not require noisy storage of the model at the databases; and in comparison to the secure aggregation scheme of Zhao-Sun, our scheme does not require pre-distribution of client-side common randomness, instead, our scheme creates the required client-side common randomness via random symmetric private information retrieval (RSPIR) and one-time pads. Our system is initialized with a replicated storage of submodels and a sufficient amount of common randomness at the two databases on the server-side. The protocol starts with a common randomness generation (CRG) phase where the two databases establish common randomness at the client-side using RSPIR and one-time pads (this phase is called FSL-CRG). Next, the clients utilize the established client-side common randomness to have the server determine privately the union of indices of submodels to be updated collectively by the clients (this phase is called FSL-PSU). Then, the two databases broadcast the current versions of the submodels in the set union to clients. The clients update the submodels based on their local training data. Finally, the clients use a variation of FSL-PSU to write the updates back to the databases privately (this phase is called FSL-write).

  abstract     = {Consider Private Information Retrieval (PIR), where a client wants to retrieve one file out of $K$ files that are replicated in $N$ different servers and the client selection must remain private when up to $T$ servers may collude. Additionally, suppose that the client has noisy side information about each of the $K$ files, and the side information about a specific file is obtained by passing this file through one of $D$ possible discrete memoryless test channels, where $D\le K$ . While the statistics of the test channels are known by the client and by all the servers, the specific mapping $\boldsymbol { \mathcal {M}}$ between the files and the test channels is unknown to the servers. We study this problem under two different privacy metrics. Under the first privacy metric, the client wants to preserve the privacy of its desired file selection and the mapping $\boldsymbol { \mathcal {M}}$ . Under the second privacy metric, the client wants to preserve the privacy of its desired file and the mapping $\boldsymbol { \mathcal {M}}$ but is willing to reveal the index of the test channel that is associated to its desired file. For both of these two privacy metrics, we derive the optimal normalized download cost. Our problem setup generalizes PIR with colluding servers, PIR with private noiseless side information, and PIR with private side information under storage constraints.},

  abstract     = {Average consensus is a key component of multi-agent systems coordination, while data privacy becomes a serious concern. Through the information exchange process, the initial state of an agent may be disclosed to its neighbors. The existing privacy-preserving research mainly addressed the situation of single-neighbor eavesdropping and infinite-time consensus, and they cannot deal with the cases of multi-neighbors eavesdropping and collusion inference attack or ensuring finite-time consensus. In this paper, we prove that it is impossible to preserve a node’s data privacy if all of its neighbors collusively infer the data. Otherwise, we propose a privacy-preserving framework to support conventional average consensus, push-sum consensus, and finite-time average consensus, which integrates multiplying random variables, finite-time error compensation, and updating rule jump. In this paper, each agent exchanges data with its neighbors by multiplying a random variable to its real-time state at each iteration. To eliminate errors caused by the random multiplier, a finite-time error compensation term and updating rule jump are designed, which ensure the accuracy of consensus. We prove that the proposed framework can converge and preserve privacy facing collusion inference attacks in both finite-time and infinite-time consensus, while traditional adding-noise-based methods cannot solve the finite-time case. We also derive the analytical expressions of the maximum privacy disclosure probability for the initial state of each agent, and present the impact of multiplying random variables. Extensive case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Our study generalizes Shamir’s secret-sharing model in three directions. First, we allow a joint design of the protocols for the creation of the shares and the distribution of the shares, instead of constraining the model to independent designs. Second, instead of assuming that the participants and the dealer have access to information-theoretically secure channels at no cost, we assume that they have access to a public channel and correlated randomness. Third, motivated by a wireless network setting where the correlated randomness is obtained from channel gain measurements, we explore a distributed setting where the dealer is an entity made of multiple sub-dealers. Our main results are inner and outer regions for the achievable secret rates that the dealer and the participants can obtain in this model. To this end, we develop two new achievability techniques, a first one to successively handle reliability and security constraints in a distributed setting, and a second one to reduce a multi-dealer setting to multiple single-user dealer settings. Our results yield the capacity region for threshold access structures when the correlated randomness corresponds to pairwise secret keys shared between each sub-dealer and each participant, and the capacity for the all-or-nothing access structure in the presence of a single dealer and arbitrarily correlated randomness.},

To that end, in this paper, we introduce the framework of decentralized two-sided matching market under non stationary (dynamic) environments. We adhere to the serial dictatorship setting, where the demand-side agents have unknown and different preferences over the supply-side (arms), but the arms have fixed and known preference over the agents. We propose and analyze an asynchronous and decentralized learning algorithm, namely Non-Stationary Competing Bandits ( NSCB ), where the agents play (restrictive) successive elimination type learning algorithms to learn their preference over the arms. The complexity in understanding such a system stems from the fact that the competing bandits choose their actions in an asynchronous fashion, and the lower ranked agents only get to learn from a set of arms, not dominated by the higher ranked agents, which leads to forced exploration. With carefully defined complexity parameters, we characterize this forced exploration and obtain sub-linear (logarithmic) regret of NSCB . Furthermore, we validate our theoretical findings via experiments.},

  abstract     = {Communication efficient distributed mean estimation is an important primitive that arises in many distributed learning and optimization scenarios such as federated learning. Without any probabilistic assumptions on the underlying data, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation where the server has access to side information. We propose Wyner-Ziv estimators , which are communication and computationally efficient and near-optimal when an upper bound for the distance between the side information and the data is known. As a corollary, we also show that our algorithms provide efficient schemes for the classic Wyner-Ziv problem in information theory. In a different direction, when there is no knowledge assumed about the distance between side information and the data, we present an alternative Wyner-Ziv estimator that uses correlated sampling. This latter setting offers universal recovery guarantees , and perhaps will be of interest in practice when the number of users is large and keeping track of the distances between the data and the side information may not be possible. With this mean estimator at our disposal, we revisit basic problems in decentralized optimization and compression where our Wyner-Ziv estimator yields algorithms with almost optimal performance. First, we consider the problem of communication constrained distributed optimization and provide an algorithm which attains the optimal convergence rate by exploiting the fact that the gradient estimates are close to each other. Specifically, the gradient compression scheme in our algorithm first uses half of the parties to form side information and then uses our Wyner-Ziv estimator to compress the remaining half of the gradient estimates. Finally, we apply our Wynzer-Ziv estimators to the classic Wyner-Ziv compression problem in information theory to get compression schemes that are computationally efficient and are almost optimal under much more relaxed assumptions than the standard probabilistic setting.},

However, agnostic distributed learning is more common in practice, where the target regression may lie outside the kernel space. In this paper, we refine the excess risk bounds for DKRR and demonstrate that DKRR still achieve capacity-dependent optimal rates in the agnostic setting. Our theoretical findings indicate that the condition on the number of partitions not only influences computational efficiency but also impacts the range of situations where optimal rates are applicable. To relax the strict condition on the number of partitions, we first derive a sharper estimate for the difference between empirical and expected covariance operators. We then leverage additional unlabeled examples to reduce the label-independent error terms, further extending the optimal rates to more situations in the agnostic setting. In addition to the generalization error bounds in expectation, we also present refined excess risk bounds in high probability, where the optimal rates can also pertain to the agnostic setting. Finally, through both theoretical and empirical comparisons with related work, we demonstrate that our findings provide higher statistical applicability and computational advantages.},

We further show that this value cannot be improved. We prove an analogous result for a stronger form of identifiability known as “determinedness” along with a corresponding lower bound. This independence assumption almost surely holds if mixture components are chosen randomly from a $k$ -dimensional space.

In this work, we study a particular method of circuit knitting based on quasiprobability simulation of nonlocal gates with operations that act locally on the subcircuits. We investigate whether classical communication between these local quantum computers can help. We provide a positive answer by showing that for circuits containing $n$ nonlocal CNOT gates connecting two circuit parts, the simulation overhead can be reduced from $O(9^{n})$ to $O(4^{n})$ if one allows for classical information exchange. Similar improvements can be obtained for general Clifford gates and, at least in a restricted form, for other gates such as controlled rotation gates.},

Then, we modify this quantum algorithm to obtain another algorithm using $\widetilde O \left ({r^{2}/\varepsilon ^{5}}\right)$ samples of quantum states, which can be applied to quantum state certification. These algorithms have query/sample complexities that are independent of the dimension $N$ of quantum states, and their time complexities only incur an extra $O \left ({\log \left ({N}\right)}\right)$ factor.

It is well known that the optimal measurement under both the error-probability and log-loss criteria is a projection, while under an “erasure-distortion” criterion it is a three-outcome positive operator-valued measure (POVM). These results were derived separately. We present a unified approach which finds the optimal measurement under any distortion measure that satisfies a convexity relation with respect to the Bhattacharyya distance. Namely, whenever the measure is relatively convex (resp. concave), the measurement is the projection (resp. three-outcome POVM) above. The three above-mentioned results are obtained as special cases of this simple derivation. As for further measures for which our result applies, we prove that Rényi entropies of order 1 and above (resp. 1/2 and below) are relatively convex (resp. concave). A special setting of great practical interest, is the discrimination between two coherent-light waveforms. In a remarkable work by Dolinar it was shown that a simple detector consisting of a photon counter and a feedback-controlled local oscillator obtains the quantum-optimal error probability. Later it was shown that the same detector (with the same local signal) is also optimal in the log-loss sense. By applying a similar convexity approach, we obtain in a unified manner the optimal signal for a variety of criteria.},

Motivated by this, we give a detailed analysis of the continuity properties of various other quantum (channel) Rényi divergences, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Channel capacities quantify the optimal rates of sending information reliably over noisy channels. Usually, the study of capacities assumes that the circuits which the sender and receiver use for encoding and decoding consist of perfectly noiseless gates. In the case of communication over quantum channels, however, this assumption is widely believed to be unrealistic, even in the long-term, due to the fragility of quantum information, which is affected by the process of decoherence. Christandl and Müller-Hermes have therefore initiated the study of fault-tolerant channel coding for quantum channels, i.e. coding schemes where encoder and decoder circuits are affected by noise, and have used techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computing to establish coding theorems for sending classical and quantum information in this scenario. Here, we extend these methods to the case of entanglement-assisted communication, in particular proving that the fault-tolerant capacity approaches the usual capacity when the gate error approaches zero. A main tool, which might be of independent interest, is the introduction of fault-tolerant entanglement distillation. We furthermore focus on the modularity of the techniques used, so that they can be easily adopted in other fault-tolerant communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {For a Haar random set $\mathcal {S}\subset U(d)$ of quantum gates we consider the uniform measure $\nu_{\mathcal {S}}$ whose support is given by $\mathcal {S}$ . The measure $\nu _{\mathcal {S}}$ can be regarded as a $\delta (\nu _{\mathcal {S}},t)$ -approximate $t$ -design, $t\in \mathbb {Z}_{+}$ . We propose a random matrix model that aims to describe the probability distribution of $\delta (\nu _{\mathcal {S}},t)$ for any $t$ . Our model is given by a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are independent, given by Gaussian or Ginibre ensembles, and their number, size and type is determined by $t$ . We prove that, the operator norm of this matrix, $\delta ({t})$ , is the random variable to which $\sqrt {|\mathcal {S}|}\delta (\nu _{\mathcal {S}},t)$ converges in distribution when the number of elements in $\mathcal {S}$ grows to infinity. Moreover, we characterize our model giving explicit bounds on the tail probabilities $\mathbb {P}(\delta (t)&amp;gt;2+\epsilon)$ , for any $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ . We also show that our model satisfies the so-called spectral gap conjecture, i.e. we prove that with the probability 1 there is $t\in \mathbb {Z}_{+}$ such that $\sup _{k\in \mathbb {Z}_{+}}\delta (k)=\delta (t)$ . Numerical simulations give convincing evidence that the proposed model is actually almost exact for any cardinality of $\mathcal {S}$ . The heuristic explanation of this phenomenon, that we provide, leads us to conjecture that the tail probabilities $\mathbb {P}(\sqrt {\mathcal {S}}\delta (\nu _{\mathcal {S}},t)&amp;gt;2+\epsilon)$ are bounded from above by the tail probabilities $\mathbb {P}(\delta (t)&amp;gt;2+\epsilon)$ of our random matrix model. In particular our conjecture implies that a Haar random set $\mathcal {S}\subset U(d)$ satisfies the spectral gap conjecture with the probability 1.},

It has recently been shown that, in the asymmetric setting with asymptotically vanishing type I error probability, adaptive strategies are asymptotically not more powerful than parallel ones. We extend this result to the non-asymptotic regime with finitely many channel uses, by explicitly constructing a parallel strategy for any given adaptive strategy, and bounding the difference in their performances, measured in terms of the decay rate of the type II error probability per channel use. We further show that all parallel strategies can be optimized over in time polynomial in the number of channel uses, and hence our result can also be used to obtain a poly-time-computable asymptotically tight upper bound on the performance of general adaptive strategies.},

Earlier works either did not obtain high decoupling probability, or used provably inefficient unitaries, or required catalytic entanglement for decoupling. In contrast, our approximate unitary designs always guarantee decoupling with exponentially high probability and, under certain conditions, lead to computationally efficient unitaries. As a result we conclude that, under suitable conditions, efficiently implementable approximate unitary designs achieve relative thermalisation in quantum thermodynamics with exponentially high probability. We also show the scrambling property of black hole, when the black hole evolution is according to pseudorandom approximate unitary $t$ -design, as opposed to the Haar random evolution considered earlier by Hayden-Preskill.},

  abstract     = {A promising approach to deal with the high hardware cost and energy consumption of massive MIMO transmitters is to use low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at each antenna element. This leads to a transmission scheme where the transmitted signals are restricted to a finite set of voltage levels. This paper is concerned with the analysis and optimization of a low-cost quantized precoding strategy, referred to as linear-quantized precoding, for a downlink massive MIMO system under Rayleigh fading. In linear-quantized precoding, the signals are first processed by a linear precoding matrix and subsequently quantized component-wise by the DAC. In this paper, we analyze both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the symbol error probability (SEP) performances of such linear-quantized precoding schemes in an asymptotic framework where the number of transmit antennas and the number of users grow large with a fixed ratio. Our results provide a rigorous justification for the heuristic arguments based on the Bussgang decomposition that are commonly used in prior works. Based on the asymptotic analysis, we further derive the optimal precoder within a class of linear-quantized precoders that includes several popular precoders as special cases. Our numerical results demonstrate the excellent accuracy of the asymptotic analysis for finite systems and the optimality of the derived precoder.},

We analyze the case where there is some knowledge about such number of users (i.e., the topology) during the content placement phase. Under the assumption of regular placement and a cumulative cache size that can be optimized across the different caches, we derive the fundamental limits of performance by introducing a novel cache-size optimization and placement scheme and a novel information-theoretic converse. The converse employs new index coding techniques to bypass traditional uniformity requirements, thus finely capturing the heterogeneity of the problem, and it provides a new approach to handle asymmetric settings. The new fundamental limits reveal that heterogeneous topologies can in fact outperform their homogeneous counterparts where each cache is associated to an equal number of users. These results are extended to capture the scenario of topological uncertainty where the perceived/estimated topology does not match the true network topology. This scenario is further elevated to the stochastic setting where the user-to-cache association is random and unknown, and it is shown that the proposed scheme is robust to such noisy or inexact knowledge on the topology.},

In the delivery phase, the transmitter broadcasts a message so that the users can decode their desired files using the received signal and their cache content. The communication between the transmitter and the receivers happens over a (deterministic) time-varying erasure broadcast channel, and the channel state information is only available to the users. We characterize the maximum achievable source rate for the 2-user and the degraded $K$ -user problems. We provide an upper bound for any caching strategy’s achievable source rates. Finally, we present a linear programming formulation to show that the upper bound is not a sharp characterization. Closing the gap between the achievable rate and the optimum rate remains open.},

S-K mappings are continuous, or piecewise smooth direct source-to-channel mappings operating on amplitude-continuous and discrete-time signals, and they encompass several existing JSCC schemes as special cases. Many existing approaches to analog- or hybrid discrete-analog JSCC provide both excellent performance as well as robustness to variable noise level at both low and arbitrary complexity and delay. However, a general theory explaining their performance and behaviour, as well as guidelines on how to construct well-performing mappings, do not exist. Therefore, such mappings are often based on educated guesses inspired by configurations that are known in advance to produce good solutions through numerical optimization methods. The objective of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework for analysis of analog- or hybrid discrete-analog S-K mappings which enables calculation of distortion when applying them on point-to-point links, reveal more about their fundamental nature, and provide guidelines for their construction at low as well as arbitrary complexity and delay. Such guidelines will likely help constrain solutions to numerical approaches and help explain why deep learning approaches obtain the solutions they do. The overall task is difficult and we do not provide a complete framework at this stage: We focus on high SNR and memoryless sources with an arbitrary continuous unimodal density function and memoryless Gaussian channels. We also provide example mappings based on surfaces which are chosen, or constructed, based on the provided theory.},

In this paper, we focus on the enumerative and asymptotic combinatorics of all these objects, giving formulas for their numbers and describing their typical behavior (rather than the behavior of a single object). For example, we give a closed formula for the average weight distribution of an $\ell $ -complementary code in the Hamming metric, generalizing a result by Pless and Sloane on the aggregate weight enumerator of binary self-dual codes. Our results also show that self-orthogonal codes, despite being very sparse in the set of codes of the same dimension over a large field, asymptotically behave quite similarly to a typical, not necessarily self-orthogonal, code. In particular, we prove that most self-orthogonal codes are MDS over a large field by computing the asymptotic proportion of the non-MDS ones for growing field size.},

Next, we build efficient identifying algorithms for SCLDs with complete traceability and establish bounds on its largest possible code rate. In comparison with the existing fingerprinting codes, it is shown that SCLDs have not only much more efficient traceability than separable codes but also a much larger code rate than frameproof codes. As a byproduct, new bounds on the largest code rate of binary separable codes are established as well. Furthermore, a two-stage dynamic traitor tracing framework is proposed for multimedia fingerprinting in the dynamic scenario, which could not only efficiently achieve the complete traceability but also provide a much larger capacity than the static scenario.},

  abstract     = {Time-invariant spatially coupled low-density parity-check (TI-SC-LDPC) codes can be obtained by unwrapping quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC block codes. This results in a free distance that is lower bounded by the minimum distance of the underlying QC-LDPC block codes. By introducing some variability in the syndrome former matrix, time-varying (TV) SC-LDPC codes are obtained, which trade an improved error correction performance for an increased decoding memory requirement and decoding complexity. A family of codes able to combine the advantages of TI-SC-LDPC codes with those of TV-SC-LDPC codes is that of periodically time-varying (PTV) SC-LDPC codes, based on a finite and periodic variation of the syndrome former matrix. In this paper we focus on such codes, and derive new upper bounds on the free distance of PTV-SC-LDPC code ensembles as well as on specific codes. By using these bounds, we show that PTV-SC-LDPC codes can achieve important improvements in the free distance over TI-SC-LDPC codes even using a very small period of variability, which corresponds to a minimal increase in memory and complexity. We also validate the new upper bounds through numerical experiments and assess the error correction performance of the corresponding codes through Monte Carlo simulations.},

The binary quadratic residue codes and the punctured binary Reed-Muller codes of order $(m-1)/2$ for odd $m$ are two infinite families of binary cyclic codes with such parameters.

The binary BCH code ${\mathcal {C}}(7)$ has parameters $[{127,64,21}]$ and has the best known parameters.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates variable-length stop-feedback codes for memoryless channels in point-to-point, multiple access, and random access communication scenarios. The proposed codes employ $L$ decoding times $n_{1}, n_{2}, {\dots }, n_{L}$ for the point-to-point and multiple access channels and $KL + 1$ decoding times for the random access channel with at most $K$ active transmitters. In the point-to-point and multiple access channels, the decoder uses the observed channel outputs to decide whether to decode at each of the allowed decoding times $n_{1}, {\dots }, n_{L}$ , at each time telling the encoder whether or not to stop transmitting using a single bit of feedback. In the random access scenario, the decoder estimates the number of active transmitters at time $n_{0}$ and then chooses among decoding times $n_{k, 1}, {\dots }, n_{k, L}$ if it believes that there are $k$ active transmitters. In all cases, the choice of allowed decoding times is part of the code design; given fixed value $L$ , allowed decoding times are chosen to minimize the expected decoding time for a given codebook size and target average error probability. The number $L$ in each scenario is assumed to be constant even when the blocklength is allowed to grow; the resulting code therefore requires only sparse feedback. The central results are asymptotic approximations of achievable rates as a function of the error probability, the expected decoding time, and the number of decoding times. A converse for variable-length stop-feedback codes with uniformly-spaced decoding times is included for the point-to-point channel.},

When all users are non-adversarial, we want their messages to be decoded reliably. When a user behaves adversarially, we require that the honest users’ messages be decoded reliably. An adversarial user can mount an attack by sending any input into the channel rather than following the protocol. It turns out that the 2-user MAC capacity region follows from the point-to-point Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC) capacity. For the 3-user MAC in which at most one user may be malicious, we characterize the capacity region for deterministic codes and randomized codes (where each user shares an independent random secret key with the receiver). These results are then generalized for the $k$ -user MAC where the adversary may control all users in one out of a collection of given subsets.},

We also study the biclique rate region of the type graph, which is defined as the set of $(R_{1},R_{2})$ such that there exists a biclique of the type graph which has respectively $2^{nR_{1}}$ and $2^{nR_{2}}$ vertices on the two sides. We provide asymptotically sharp bounds for the biclique rate region as well. We then discuss the connections of these results to noninteractive simulation and hypercontractivity inequalities. Furthermore, as an application of our results, a new outer bound for the zero-error capacity region of the binary adder channel is provided, which improves the previously best known bound, due to Austrin, Kaski, Koivisto, and Nederlof.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we revisit the Rank Quasi-Cyclic (RQC) (Melchor et al., IEEE IT, 2018) encryption scheme by proposing three possible variations for its design. Our first improvement relies on the introduction of Augmented Gabidulin codes, a new family of decodable codes exploiting the concept of support erasure for the rank metric. Following the work of Melchor et al. (PQCrypto, 2022), our second improvement uses multiple syndromes to increase the weight of the error to be decoded. As pioneered in Melchor et al. (NIST PQC, 2020), our third variation considers non-homogeneous error weights in order to decrease the parameters. These improvements can be combined together to design schemes offering various trade-offs in term of security and size. Our Multi-UR-AG (multiple syndromes, unstructured, augmented Gabidulin) scheme achieves a size of 11kB (public key + ciphertext) for 128 bits of security while featuring a conservative design as it relies on pure random instances without any ideal structure. Besides, our NH- Multi-RQC-AG (non-homogeneous error, multiple syndromes, ideal structure, augmented Gabidulin) achieves a size of 2.7 kB for 128 bits of security, namely a 50 % improvement with respect to classical RQC. Our second and third variations respectively rely on the security of the $\textsf {RSL} $ and $\textsf {NHRSD} $ problems (or $\textsf {NHRSL} $ when considered together). In this paper, we also provide new security analysis and attacks for these problems. While these results are important for our new schemes, they are of independent interest as well. Our security analysis for the $\textsf {RSL} $ problem provides an improvement on the recent algebraic attacks for some instances. In addition, we show that the $\textsf {RSL} $ problem can be solved in polynomial time when $N \geq (k+1) r\frac {m}{m-r}$ , this improves the best known combinatorial attack (Gaborit et al., Crypto, 2017). We also propose the first combinatorial attack against the $\textsf {NHRSD} $ problem along with a precise complexity analysis of the algebraic attack described Melchor et al. (NIST PQC, 2020). At last, we combine these analysis to provide an attack against the $\textsf {NHRSL} $ problem.},

  abstract     = {The Permuted Kernel Problem (PKP) asks to find a permutation which maps an input matrix into the kernel of some given vector space. The literature exhibits several works studying its hardness in the case of the input matrix being mono-dimensional (i.e., a vector), while the multi-dimensional case has received much less attention and, de facto, only the case of a binary ambient finite field has been studied. The Subcode Equivalence Problem (SEP), instead, asks to find a permutation so that a given linear code becomes a subcode of another given code. At the best of our knowledge, no algorithm to solve the SEP has ever been proposed. In this paper we study the computational hardness of solving these problems. We first show that, despite going by different names, PKP and SEP are exactly the same problem. Then we consider the state-of-the-art solver for the mono-dimensional PKP (namely, the KMP algorithm, proposed by Koussa, Macario-Rat and Patarin), generalize it to the multi-dimensional case and analyze both the finite and the asymptotic regimes. We further propose a new algorithm, which can be thought of as a refinement of KMP. In the asymptotic regime our algorithm does not improve on KMP but, in the finite regime (and for parameters of practical interest), we achieve significant improvements, especially for the multi-dimensional version of PKP. As an evidence, we show that it is the fastest algorithm to attack several recommended instances of cryptosystems based on PKP. As a side-effect, given the mentioned equivalence between PKP and SEP, all the algorithms we analyze in this paper can be used to solve instances of the latter problem.},

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) employ low-correlation sequences, termed as spreading codes, to distinguish between the signals transmitted by the different satellites. The spreading codes commonly employed have period that is a multiple of 1023, as the fundamental frequency associated with the navigation signals generated onboard all of these systems is 10.23 MHz, derived using highly-stable atomic clocks. The principal contribution of the paper is the construction of a family ${\mathcal{ J}}_{{\text {NAV}}}$ , of low-correlation, binary sequences having period 10230, derived by interleaving a selected set of $5 {\textstyle \mathbb {Z}_{4}}$ -Linear sequences of period 2046 followed by flipping or complementing, a subset of the interleaved sequences. Sequence selection is based on the value of an exponential sum over a Galois ring and interleaving is carried out using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The period 10230 is of particular interest, as it is the period of the spreading codes employed by major GNSS currently in operation. The ${\mathcal{ J}}_{{\text {NAV}}}$ spreading code family turns in competitive performance when compared to existing designs including a 4.5 dB improvement in worst-case, even-correlation properties. Additional techniques are employed to ensure that Family ${\mathcal{ J}}_{{\text {NAV}}}$ has other desirable attributes of a GNSS spreading code such as low values of odd-correlation, an orthogonality property and a simple, shift-register-based implementation. The construction is shown to be a special instance of a general select, interleave and flip approach to construction that generates families of balanced, low-correlation interleaved ${\textstyle \mathbb {Z}_{4}}$ -linear sequences having period $10(2^{m}-1)$ for $m=2 \pmod {4}$ and $14(2^{m}-1)$ for $m=2,4 \pmod {6}$ . By replacing the constituent ${\textstyle \mathbb {Z}_{4}}$ -linear sequences with Family ${\mathcal{ A}}$ quaternary sequences, the same approach can be used to construct two low-correlation, interleaved quaternary sequence families having period $5(2^{m}-1)$ with $m=2 \pmod {4}$ and $7(2^{m}-1)$ with $m=2,4 \pmod {6}$ , respectively.},

Considering the other scenario, the agent has additional access to $X$ . To design the privacy mechanism, we first extend the Functional Representation Lemma and Strong Functional Representation Lemma by relaxing the independence condition and thereby allowing a certain leakage. We then find lower and upper bounds on the privacy-utility trade-offs in both scenarios. In particular, for the case where no leakage is allowed and $X$ is observable, our upper and lower bounds improve previous bounds. Considering bounded mutual information as privacy constraint and the observable private data scenario we show that if the common information and mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ are equal, then the attained upper bound is tight.

Specifically, we show that for a $T$ -step problem with Lipschitz reward of zooming dimension $d_{z}$ , our algorithm achieves theoretically optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret rate $\widetilde {\mathcal {O}}\left ({T^{\frac {d_{z}+1}{d_{z}+2}}}\right)$ using only $\mathcal {O} \left ({\log \log T}\right) $ batches.

Thus, BLiN achieves optimal regret rate (up to logarithmic factors) using minimal communication.},

In this work, we prove these conjectures for a general class of signal priors and for arbitrary rotationally-invariant designs $A$ , under a “high-temperature” condition that restricts the range of eigenvalues of $A^{\top} A$ and encompasses regimes of sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratio.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing system has emerged as an effective platform for labeling data with relatively low cost by using non-expert workers. Inferring correct labels from multiple noisy answers on data, however, has been a challenging problem, since the quality of the answers varies widely across tasks and workers. Many existing works have assumed that there is a fixed ordering of workers in terms of their skill levels, and focused on estimating worker skills to aggregate the answers from workers with different weights. In practice, however, the worker skill changes widely across tasks, especially when the tasks are heterogeneous. In this paper, we consider a new model, called $d$ -type specialization model, in which each task and worker has its own (unknown) type and the reliability of each worker can vary in the type of a given task and that of a worker. We allow that the number $d$ of types can scale in the number of tasks. In this model, we characterize the optimal sample complexity to correctly infer the labels within any given accuracy, and propose label inference algorithms achieving the order-wise optimal limit even when the types of tasks or those of workers are unknown. We conduct experiments both on synthetic and real datasets, and show that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms developed based on more strict model assumptions.},

We assume that users are categorized into clusters, each of which comprises sub-clusters (or what we call “groups”). We consider a hierarchical stochastic block model that well respects practically-relevant social graphs and follows a low-rank rating matrix model. Under this setting, we characterize the information-theoretic limit on the number of observed matrix entries (i.e., optimal sample complexity) as a function of the quality of graph side information (to be detailed) by proving sharp upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity. One important consequence of this result is that leveraging the hierarchical structure of similarity graphs yields a substantial gain in sample complexity relative to the one that simply identifies different groups without resorting to the relational structure across them. Another implication of the result is when the graph information is rich, the optimal sample complexity is proportional to the number of clusters, while it nearly stays constant as the number of groups in a cluster increases. We empirically demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity.},

This paper studies the quantization of heavy-tailed data in several fundamental statistical estimation problems where the underlying distributions have bounded moments of some order (no greater than 4). We propose to truncate and properly dither the data prior to a uniform quantization. Our major standpoint is that (near) minimax rates of estimation error could be achieved by computationally tractable estimators based on the quantized data produced by the proposed scheme. In particular, concrete results are worked out for covariance estimation, compressed sensing (also interpreted as sparse linear regression), and matrix completion, all agreeing that the quantization only slightly worsens the multiplicative factor. Additionally, while prior results focused on the quantization of responses (i.e., measurements), we study compressed sensing where the covariates (i.e., sensing vectors) are also quantized; in this case, though our recovery program is non-convex (since our covariance matrix estimator lacks positive semi-definiteness), we prove that all local minimizers enjoy near-optimal estimation error. Moreover, by the concentration inequality of the product process and a covering argument, we establish a near minimax uniform recovery guarantee for quantized compressed sensing with heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to corroborate our theoretical results.},

Our main innovation is in applying information-theoretic ideas of channel comparison leading to a new metric (degradation index) between binary-input-symmetric (BMS) channels under which the Belief Propagation (BP) operator is a strict contraction (albeit non-multiplicative). A key ingredient of our proof is a strengthening of the classical stringy tree lemma of Evans-Kenyon-Peres-Schulman (2000).

The max-linear model vastly generalizes the conventional linear model, and it can approximate any convex function to an arbitrary accuracy when the number of linear models $k$ is large enough. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the max-linear model renders the estimation of the regression parameters computationally challenging. Particularly, no estimator based on convex programming is known in the literature. We formulate and analyze a scalable convex program given by anchored regression (AR) as the estimator for the max-linear regression problem. Under the standard Gaussian observation setting, we present a non-asymptotic performance guarantee showing that the convex program recovers the parameters with high probability. When the $k$ linear components are equally likely to achieve the maximum, our result shows a sufficient number of noise-free observations for exact recovery scales as $k^{4}p$ up to a logarithmic factor. This sample complexity coincides with that by alternating minimization (Ghosh et al., 2021). Moreover, the same sample complexity applies when the observations are corrupted with arbitrary deterministic noise. We provide empirical results that show that our method performs as our theoretical result predicts, and is competitive with the alternating minimization algorithm particularly in presence of multiplicative Bernoulli noise. Furthermore, we also show empirically that a recursive application of AR can significantly improve the estimation accuracy.},

Lower bounds on sample complexity in these models were previously established via quantum state identification and Fourier analysis. In this paper, we derive optimal lower bounds for quantum sample complexity in both models via an information-theoretic approach. The proofs are arguably simpler, and the same ideas can potentially be used to derive optimal bounds for other problems in quantum learning theory. We then turn to a quantum analogue of the Coupon Collector problem, a classic problem from probability theory also of importance in the study of PAC learning. The quantum sample complexity of this problem has been characterised up to constant factors. First, we show that the information-theoretic approach mentioned above provably does not yield the optimal lower bound. As a by-product, we get a natural ensemble of pure states in arbitrarily high dimensions which are not easily (simultaneously) distinguishable, whereas the ensemble has close to maximal Holevo information. Second, we discover that the information-theoretic approach yields an asymptotically optimal bound for an approximation variant of the problem. Finally, we derive a sharper lower bound for the Quantum Coupon Collector problem via the generalised Holevo-Curlander bounds. All the aspects of the problem we study rest on properties of the spectrum of the associated Gram matrix, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {The literature provides evidence that considering signal propagation delays can significantly enhance the scheduling rate region of wireless networks. This paper focuses on the link scheduling problem in networks where signal delays between nodes are multiples of a time interval. To model such networks, a directed hypergraph is employed, along with an integer matrix that specifies the delays. The link scheduling problem is closely connected to the independent sets of the periodic hypergraph induced by the network model. However, due to the infinite number of vertices, it is impractical to enumerate the independent sets of the periodic hypergraph using generic graph algorithms. To tackle this challenge, a graphical approach is proposed in this paper. The link scheduling rate region is characterized using a finite directed graph called a scheduling graph, which is derived from the network model. A collision-free schedule of the network corresponds to a path in the scheduling graph, and the rate region is determined by the convex hull of the rate vectors associated with the cycles in the scheduling graph. Although existing cycle enumeration algorithms can be employed to calculate the rate region, their computational complexity becomes prohibitively high as the size of the scheduling graph grows exponentially with the number of network links. To address this issue, the dominance property of a special scheduling graph called the step- $T$ scheduling graph is investigated. This property allows the utilization of specific subgraphs of the step- $T$ scheduling graph to characterize the scheduling rate region, achieving a reduction in both the number of cycles and their lengths. For common problems such as calculating the rate region and maximizing a weighted sum of the scheduling rates, algorithms leveraging the dominance property are developed. These algorithms can be more efficient than using generic graph algorithms directly on the scheduling graphs.},

Specifically, in Section III , the feedback capacity is shown to correspond with the solution to a variational optimization problem. Section IV gives structural properties of the solution for this optimization problem. Among these properties, it stands out the capacity-achieving optimality of using a short-length input $V$ with arbitrarily small variance, and thus a power spectral density $S_{V}$ equal to zero. These structural properties are further developed in its sections V and VI for first- and $m$ -th-order autoregressive moving average channel noise, respectively, also showing the capacity-achieving optimality of the Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme for this scenario. In this note, we show that the proof of Corollary 4.4 in [1] (which claims that the choice $S_{V} = 0$ is capacity achieving) is erroneous.

  abstract     = {Coded caching utilizes pre-fetching during off-peak hours and multi-casting for delivery in order to balance the traffic load in communication networks. Several works have studied the achievable peak and average rates under different conditions: variable file lengths or popularities, variable cache sizes, decentralized networks, etc. However, very few have considered the possibility of heterogeneous user profiles, despite modern content providers are investing heavily in categorizing users according to their habits and preferences. This paper proposes three coded caching schemes with uncoded pre-fetching for scenarios where end users are grouped into classes with different file demand sets (FDS). One scheme ignores the difference between the classes, another ignores the similarities between them and the third decouples the delivery of files common to all FDS from those unique to a single class. The transmission rates of the three schemes are compared with a lower bound to evaluate their gap to optimality, and with each other to show that each scheme can outperform the other two when certain conditions are met.},

Moreover, by discussing the cases of simplicial complexes with one, two and three maximal elements respectively, the parameters and weight distributions of the codes are given more explicitly, which shows that the codes are at most 2-weight, 5-weight and 19-weight respectively. By studying the optimality of the codes for the three cases in detail, many infinite families of optimal linear codes with few weights over ${\mathbb F}_{q}$ are obtained, including Griesmer codes, near Griesmer codes and distance-optimal codes.},

In this paper, we first propose a novel method of constructing MDS array codes by deleting one row and one column from the circulant matrices associated to some polynomials. Several new classes of MDS array codes with flexible parameters are constructed. In particular, we give a new algebraic presentation of the Blaum-Roth codes with sparser parity-check matrices. We also obtain a family of MDS array codes over finite fields with even characteristics whose parity-check matrices have the lowest density. Furthermore, based on these new MDS array codes, we give a general construction of optimal locally repairable array codes (LRACs) achieving the Singleton-type bound. Additionally, we obtain some new optimal LRACs of long lengths. Finally, we present a scheduled algorithm for syndrome computations of binary optimal LRACs with redundancy 4, which can tolerate three failures. The number of XORs per data bit required in our algorithm approaches 2 as the length approaches infinity, which is the same as the MDS codes tolerating three failures. However, the number of nodes required during the repair of a failed node in our optimal LRACs is only about half of that in MDS array codes.},

The problem setting consists of a central server having a library of $N$ files and $C$ caches each with capacity $M$ . Each user in the system can access a unique set of $r &amp;lt; C$ caches, and there exist users corresponding to every distinct set of $r$ caches. Therefore, the number of users in the system is $\binom {C}{r}$ . For the aforementioned combinatorial multi-access setting, we propose a coded caching scheme with an MDS code-based coded placement. This novel placement technique helps to achieve a better rate in the delivery phase compared to the optimal scheme under uncoded placement when $M&amp;gt; N/C$ . For a lower memory regime, we present another scheme with coded placement, which outperforms the optimal scheme under uncoded placement if the number of files is no more than the number of users. Further, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the optimal rate-memory trade-off of the combinatorial multi-access coded caching scheme. In addition, using the derived lower bound, we show that the first scheme is optimal in the higher memory regime, and the second scheme is optimal if $N\leq \binom {C}{r}$ . Finally, we show that the performance of the first scheme is within a constant factor of the optimal performance, when $r=2$ .},

More specifically, it presents alternative proofs for the well-known exponentially-strong converse for almost lossless source-coding with side-information and for channel coding over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). These alternative proofs are solely based on a change of measure argument on the sets of conditionally or jointly-typical sequences that result in a correct decision, and on the analysis of these measures in the asymptotic regime of infinite blocklengths. The paper also presents new exponentially-strong converses for the $K$ -hop hypothesis testing against independence problem with certain Markov chains and for the two-terminal $L$ -round interactive compression problem with $J\geq 1$ distortion constraints that depend on both sources and both reconstructions. For this latter problem, the exponentially-strong converse result states that whenever the rates lie outside the vanishing-excess-distortion-probability rate-region, then the sum of the $J$ excess distortion probabilities asymptotically exceeds 1 or tends to 1 exponentially fast in the blocklength. (When the sum of the excess distortion probabilities exceeds 1, then a larger rate-distortion region is shown to be achievable.) The considered $L$ -round $J$ -distortion interactive source coding problem includes as special cases the Wyner-Ziv problem, the interactive function computation problem, and the compression with lossy common reconstruction problem. The new strong converse proofs for lossy compression and distributed hypothesis testing are derived using similar change of measure arguments as mentioned earlier and by additionally proving that certain Markov chains involving auxiliary random variables hold in the asymptotic regime of infinite blocklengths.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of coding for classical multiple-access channels (MACs) with the assistance of non-signaling correlations between parties. It is well-known that non-signaling assistance does not change the capacity of classical point-to-point channels. However, it was recently observed that one can construct MACs from two-player nonlocal games while relating the winning probability of the game to the capacity of the MAC. By considering games for which entanglement (a special kind of non-signaling correlation) increases the winning probability (e.g., the Magic Square game), this shows that for some specific kinds of channels, entanglement between the senders can increase the capacity. In this work, we make several contributions towards understanding the capacity region for MACs with the assistance of non-signaling correlations between the parties. We develop a linear program computing the optimal success probability for coding over $n$ copies of a MAC $W$ with size growing polynomially in $n$ . Solving this linear program allows us to achieve inner bounds for MACs. Applying this method to the binary adder channel, we show that using non-signaling assistance, the sum-rate $\frac {\log _{2}(72)}{4} \simeq 1.5425$ can be reached even with zero error, which beats the maximum sum-rate capacity of 1.5 in the unassisted case. For noisy channels, where the zero-error non-signaling assisted capacity region is trivial, we can use concatenated codes to obtain achievable points in the capacity region. Applied to a noisy version of the binary adder channel, we show that non-signaling assistance still improves the sum-rate capacity. Complementing these achievability results, we give an outer bound on the non-signaling assisted capacity region that has the same expression as the unassisted region except that the channel inputs are not required to be independent. Finally, we show that the capacity region with non-signaling assistance shared only between each sender and the receiver independently is the same as without assistance.},

We show that several quantitative aspects of information theory can be captured by an enriched version of Markov categories, where the spaces of morphisms are equipped with a divergence or even a metric. Following standard practices of information theory, we get measures of mutual information by quantifying, with a chosen divergence, how far a joint source is from displaying independence of its components. More strikingly, Markov categories give a notion of determinism for sources and channels, and we can define entropy exactly by quantifying how far a source or channel is from being deterministic. This recovers Shannon and Rényi entropies, as well as the Gini-Simpson index used in ecology to quantify diversity, and it can be used to give a conceptual definition of generalized entropy.

In particular, when optimized over input distributions it characterizes the capacity of general communication channels. However, analytic computation of DI is typically intractable and existing optimization techniques over discrete input alphabets require knowledge of the channel model, which renders them inapplicable when only samples are available. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel optimization framework for estimated DI over discrete spaces. We formulate DI optimization as a Markov decision process and leverage reinforcement learning techniques to optimize a deep generative model of the input process probability mass function (PMF). Combining this optimizer with the recently developed DI neural estimator, we obtain an alternating optimization algorithm which is applied to estimating the (feedforward and feedback) capacity of various discrete channels with memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to use the optimized PMF model to (i) obtain theoretical bounds on the feedback capacity of unifilar finite-state channels; and (ii) perform probabilistic shaping of constellations in the peak power-constrained additive white Gaussian noise channel.},

  abstract     = {This work considers an information-theoretic characterization of the set of achievable rates, costs, and distortions in a broad class of distributed communication and function computation scenarios with general continuous-valued sources and channels. A framework is presented which involves fine discretization of the source and channel variables followed by communication over the resulting discretized network. In order to evaluate the resulting achievable regions, convergence results for information measures are provided under the proposed discretization process. Prior works have considered such convergence results for mutual information quantities written in terms of univariate functions of random variables, and sums of independent random variables. These convergence results have been used to derive achievable regions in point-to-point communication scenarios and specific multiterminal scenarios with continuous alphabets. However, the best-known achievability results for distributed communication and function computation scenarios, which are based on structured coding strategies, involve mutual information quantities written in terms of bivariate functions of random variables, e.g., sum of two (not necessarily independent) random variables. A main contribution of this work is to show the convergence of mutual information quantities written in terms of sums of quantized random variables. This is an essential step in evaluating the achievable regions in continuous distributed computation scenarios by generalizing the structured coding strategies which have been previously used to derive the best-known achievable regions in discrete networks. The framework is used to provide achievability results for the problems of function computation over multiple-access channels, distributed source coding, function reconstruction (two-help-one), and multiple-descriptions source coding. In each scenario, discrete structured coding strategies along with the aforementioned convergence results are used to derive inner bounds to set of achievable rates, costs, and distortions. Furthermore, structured coding strategies are considered for distributed function computation scenarios involving computation of non-additive functions. The techniques are used to study an example where the objective is to compute the product of channel inputs over a multiple access channel, and an inner bound to the achievable rate region is evaluated. It is shown that, in contrast to many well-studied scenarios in multiterminal information theory, Gaussian input distribution is outperformed by the uniform input distribution.},

  abstract     = {We consider finite-state channels (FSCs) with feedback and state information known causally at the encoder. This setting is quite general and includes: a memoryless channel with i.i.d. state (the Shannon strategy), Markovian states that include look-ahead (LA) access to the state and energy harvesting. We characterize the feedback capacity of the general setting as the directed information between auxiliary random variables with memory to the channel outputs. We also propose two methods for computing the feedback capacity: (i) formulating an infinite-horizon average-reward dynamic program; and (ii) a single-letter lower bound based on auxiliary directed graphs called $Q$ -graphs. We demonstrate our computation methods on three examples. In the first example, we introduce a channel with LA and establish a closed-form, analytic lower bound on its feedback capacity. Furthermore, we extend the channel with general parameters, and derive numerical lower bounds for each parameter. In the second example, we show that the mentioned methods achieve the feedback capacity of known unifilar FSCs such as the Ising channel. Finally, in the last example, we generalize the Ising channel such that the state is stochastically dependent on the input, and investigate its feedback capacity.},

  abstract     = {The vector-valued extension of the famous Witsenhausen counterexample setup is studied where the encoder, i.e. the first decision maker, non-causally knows and encodes the i.i.d. state sequence and the decoder, i.e. the second decision maker, causally estimates the interim state. The coding scheme is transferred from the finite alphabet coordination problem, for which it is proved to be optimal. The extension to the Gaussian setup is based on a non-standard weak typicality approach and requires a careful average estimation error analysis since the interim state is estimated by the decoder. We provide a single-letter expression that characterizes the optimal trade-off between the Witsenhausen power cost and estimation cost. The two auxiliary random variables improve the communication with the decoder, while performing the dual role of the channel input, which also controls the state of the system. Interestingly, we show that a pair of discrete and continuous auxiliary random variables, outperforms both Witsenhausen two-point strategy and the best affine policies. The optimal choice of random variables remains unknown.},

  abstract     = {The rate-distortion curve captures the fundamental tradeoff between compression length and resolution in lossy data compression. However, it conceals the underlying dynamics of optimal source encodings or test channels. We argue that these typically follow a piecewise smooth trajectory as the source information is compressed. These smooth dynamics are interrupted at bifurcations, where solutions change qualitatively. Sub-optimal test channels may collide or exchange optimality there, for example. There is typically a plethora of sub-optimal solutions, which stems from restrictions of the reproduction alphabet. We devise a family of algorithms that exploits the underlying dynamics to track a given test channel along the rate-distortion curve. To that end, we express implicit derivatives at the roots of a non-linear operator by higher derivative tensors. Providing closed-form formulae for the derivative tensors of Blahut’s algorithm thus yields implicit derivatives of arbitrary order at a given test channel, thereby approximating others in its vicinity. Finally, our understanding of bifurcations guarantees the optimality of the root being traced, under mild assumptions, while allowing us to detect when our assumptions fail. Beyond the interest in rate distortion, this is an example of how understanding a problem’s bifurcations can be translated to a numerical algorithm.},

For the case of discrete memoryless sources, we establish achievable rate-distortion bounds using multi-user coding techniques, namely, superposition coding and expurgated parallel coding. We study examples where these attain the matched rate-distortion trade-off but a standard ensemble with independent codewords fails to do so. On the other hand, in contrast with the channel coding counterpart, we show that there are cases where structured random codebooks can perform worse than their unstructured counterparts. In addition, in view of the difficulties in adapting the existing and above-mentioned results to general alphabets, we consider a simpler i.i.d. random coding ensemble, and establish its achievable rate-distortion bounds for general alphabets.},

We give a generalization of the radix-2 FFT that enables $O(k\log k)$ computation of signals with homogeneous frequency support. We use homogeneous sets as building blocks to construct more complex support structures for which the complexity of $O(k\log k)$ is achievable.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the prevalent data science applications of processing large-scale graph data such as social networks and biological networks, this paper investigates lossless compression of data in the form of a labeled graph. Particularly, we consider a widely used random graph model, stochastic block model (SBM), which captures the clustering effects in social networks. An information-theoretic universal compression framework is applied, in which one aims to design a single compressor that achieves the asymptotically optimal compression rate, for every SBM distribution, without knowing the parameters of the SBM. Such a graph compressor is proposed in this paper, which universally achieves the optimal compression rate with polynomial time complexity for a wide class of SBMs. Existing universal compression techniques are developed mostly for stationary ergodic one-dimensional sequences. However, the adjacency matrix of SBM has complex two-dimensional correlations. The challenge is alleviated through a carefully designed transform that converts two-dimensional correlated data into almost i.i.d. submatrices. The sequence of submatrices is then compressed by a Krichevsky-Trofimov compressor, whose length analysis is generalized to identically distributed but arbitrarily correlated sequences. In four benchmark graph datasets, the compressed files from competing algorithms take 2.4 to 27 times the space needed by the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {One-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) is an extremely quantized signal acquisition method that has been proposed and studied rigorously in the past decade. In 1bCS, linear samples of a high dimensional signal are quantized to only one bit per sample (sign of the measurement). The extreme quantization makes it an interesting case study of the more general single-index or generalized linear models. At the same time it can also be thought of as a ‘design’ version of learning a binary linear classifier or halfspace-learning. Assuming the original signal vector to be sparse, existing results in 1bCS either aim to find the support of the vector, or approximate the signal allowing a small error. The focus of this paper is support recovery, which often also computationally facilitate approximate signal recovery. A universal measurement matrix for 1bCS refers to one set of measurements that work for all sparse signals. With universality, it is known that $\tilde {\Theta }(k^{2})~1$ bCS measurements are necessary and sufficient for support recovery (where $k$ denotes the sparsity). To improve the dependence on sparsity from quadratic to linear, in this work we propose approximate support recovery (allowing $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ proportion of errors), and superset recovery (allowing $\epsilon $ proportion of false positives). We show that the first type of recovery is possible with $\tilde {O}(k/\epsilon )$ measurements, while the later type of recovery, more challenging, is possible with $\tilde {O}(\max \{k/\epsilon ,k^{3/2}\}) ^{^{^{^{}}}}$ measurements. We also show that in both cases $\Omega (k/\epsilon )$ measurements would be necessary for universal recovery. Improved results are possible if we consider universal recovery within a restricted class of signals, such as rational signals, or signals with bounded dynamic range. In both cases superset recovery is possible with only $\tilde {O}(k/\epsilon )$ measurements. Other results on universal but approximate support recovery are also provided in this paper. All of our main recovery algorithms are simple and polynomial-time.},

We prove that the size of a 4-phase GCA pair is possible if the product of the array sizes in all dimensions is a 4-phase Golay number with an additional constraint on the factorization of the product. For 2-phase 2-D GCA quads, all sizes no greater than $78\times 78$ can be covered. For 4-phase GCA quads, all the positive integers within 1000 can be covered for the size in one dimension.

For implementation, in the tables, we list up some initial bent (0-plateaued) functions, which guarantee the maximality of algebraic degrees of plateaued functions. Furthermore, we discuss the complexities of the three algorithms, which shows the feasibility of our methods.

In the literature, many efforts have been made to construct good sequences with various lengths, where binary sequences attract great attention. As a result, various constructions of good binary sequences have been proposed. However, most of the known constructions made use of the multiplicative cyclic group structure of finite field $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ for a prime $p$ and a positive integer $n$ . In fact, all $p^{n}+1$ rational places including the place at infinity of the rational function field over $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ can form a cyclic structure under an automorphism of order $p^{n}+1$ . In this paper, we make use of this cyclic structure to provide an explicit construction of binary sequences with a low correlation of length $p^{n}+1$ via cyclotomic function fields over $\mathbb {F}_{p^{n}}$ for any odd prime $p$ . Each family of binary sequences has size $p^{n}-2$ and its correlation is upper bounded by $4+\lfloor 2\cdot p^{n/2}\rfloor $ . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of binary sequences with a low correlation of length $p^{n}+1$ for odd prime $p$ . Moreover, our sequences can be constructed explicitly and have competitive parameters.},

Previous work has shown that it is $\mathsf {NP}$ -hard to determine the minrank parameter of graphs. In this work, we study the computational complexity of the minrank parameter on perturbed instances, obtained from worst-case instances by a random extension of the side information available to the receivers. This setting is motivated by applications of index coding, in which the side information is accumulated via repeated transmissions that suffer from loss of data due to noisy communication or storage capacity. We prove that determining the minrank parameter remains computationally hard on perturbed instances. Our contribution includes an extension of several hardness results of the minrank parameter to the perturbed setting as well as a general technique for deriving the hardness of the minrank parameter on perturbed instances from its hardness on worst-case instances.},

First, we prove a folklore result for secure summation - to compute 1 bit of the sum securely, each user needs to send at least 1 bit to the server, each user needs to hold a key of at least 1 bit, and all users need to hold collectively some key variables of at least $K-1$ bits. Next, we allow any arbitrary group of users to share an independent key and any arbitrary group of users to collude with the server. For such a general groupwise key and colluding user setting, we show that secure summation is feasible if and only if the hypergraph, where each node is a user and each edge is a group of users sharing the same key, is connected after removing the nodes corresponding to any colluding set of users and their incident edges. Finally, we focus on the symmetric groupwise key setting, where every group of $G$ users share an independent key. We show that for symmetric groupwise keys with group size $G$ , if $G =1$ or $G &amp;gt; K-T$ , the secure summation problem is not feasible; else $1 &amp;lt; G \leq K-T$ , to compute 1 bit of the sum securely, each user needs to send at least 1 bit to the server and the size of each groupwise key is at least $(K-T-1)/\binom {K-T}{G}$ bits.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a gain function viewpoint of information leakage by proposing maximal $g$ -leakage, a rich class of operationally meaningful leakage measures that subsumes recently introduced leakage measures — maximal leakage and maximal $\alpha $ -leakage. In maximal $g$ -leakage, the gain of an adversary in guessing an unknown random variable is measured using a gain function applied to the probability of correctly guessing. In particular, maximal $g$ -leakage captures the multiplicative increase, upon observing $Y$ , in the expected gain of an adversary in guessing a randomized function of $X$ , maximized over all such randomized functions. We also consider the scenario where an adversary can make multiple attempts to guess the randomized function of interest. We show that maximal leakage is an upper bound on maximal $g$ -leakage under multiple guesses, for any non-negative gain function $g$ . We obtain a closed-form expression for maximal $g$ -leakage under multiple guesses for a class of concave gain functions. We also study maximal $g$ -leakage measure for a specific class of gain functions related to the $\alpha $ -loss, that interpolates log-loss ( $\alpha =1$ ) and (soft) 0–1 loss ( $\alpha =\infty $ ). In particular, we first completely characterize the minimal expected $\alpha $ -loss under multiple guesses and analyze how the corresponding leakage measure is affected with the number of guesses. We show that a new measure of divergence that belongs to the class of Bregman divergences captures the relative performance of an arbitrary adversarial strategy with respect to an optimal strategy in minimizing the expected $\alpha $ -loss. Finally, we study two variants of maximal $g$ -leakage depending on the type of adversary and obtain closed-form expressions for them, which do not depend on the particular gain function considered as long as it satisfies some mild regularity conditions. We do this by developing a variational characterization for the Rényi divergence of order infinity which naturally generalizes the definition of pointwise maximal leakage to incorporate arbitrary gain functions.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the problem of private read-update-write (PRUW) in relation to private federated submodel learning (FSL), where a machine learning model is divided into multiple submodels based on the different types of data used to train the model. In PRUW, each user downloads the required submodel without revealing its index in the reading phase, and uploads the updates of the submodel without revealing the submodel index or the values of the updates in the writing phase. In this work, we first provide a basic communication efficient PRUW scheme, and study further means of reducing the communication cost via sparsification. Gradient sparsification is a widely used concept in learning applications, where only a selected set of parameters is downloaded and updated, which significantly reduces the communication cost. In this paper, we study how the concept of sparsification can be incorporated in private FSL with the goal of reducing the communication cost, while guaranteeing information-theoretic privacy of the updated submodel index as well as the values of the updates. To this end, we introduce two schemes: PRUW with top $r$ sparsification and PRUW with random sparsification. The former communicates only the most significant parameters/updates among the servers and the users, while the latter communicates a randomly selected set of parameters/updates. The two proposed schemes introduce novel techniques such as parameter/update (noisy) permutations to handle the additional sources of information leakage in PRUW caused by sparsification. Both schemes result in significantly reduced communication costs compared to that of the basic (non-sparse) PRUW scheme.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of real-time applications has motivated extensive research on analyzing and optimizing data freshness in the context of age of information. However, classical frameworks of privacy (e.g., differential privacy (DP)) have overlooked the impact of data freshness on privacy guarantees, which may provide a new tool for time-varying databases. In this work, we introduce age-dependent DP, taking into account the underlying stochastic nature of a time-varying database. In this new framework, we assume knowledge of the data process’s statistical information and establish a connection between classical DP and age-dependent DP. We use this connection to characterize the impact of data staleness and temporal correlation on privacy guarantees. Our characterization reveals that the total variation distance is the sole essential statistical information. Moreover, we demonstrate that aging, which involves utilizing stale data inputs and/or delaying the release of outputs, can serve as a novel strategy for safeguarding data privacy, in addition to the traditional approach of injecting noise in the DP framework. Furthermore, to generalize our results to a multi-query scenario, we present a sequential composition result for age-dependent DP under any publishing and aging policies. We then characterize the optimal tradeoffs between privacy risk and utility and show how this can be achieved. Finally, case studies show that to achieve an arbitrarily small privacy risk in a single-query case, combing aging and noise injection only leads to a bounded accuracy loss, whereas using noise injection only (as in the benchmark case of DP) will lead to an unbounded accuracy loss.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial examples have recently drawn considerable attention in the field of machine learning due to the fact that small perturbations in the data can result in major performance degradation. This phenomenon is usually modeled by a malicious adversary that can apply perturbations to the data in a constrained fashion, such as being bounded in a certain norm. In this paper, we study this problem when the adversary is constrained by the $\ell _{0}$ norm; i.e., it can perturb a certain number of coordinates in the input, but has no limit on how much it can perturb those coordinates. Due to the combinatorial nature of this setting, we need to go beyond the standard techniques in robust machine learning to address this problem. We consider a binary classification scenario where $d$ noisy data samples of the true label are provided to us after adversarial perturbations. We introduce a classification method which employs a nonlinear component called truncation, and show in an asymptotic scenario, as long as the adversary is restricted to perturb no more than $\sqrt {d}$ data samples, we can almost achieve the optimal classification error in the absence of the adversary, i.e., we can completely neutralize adversary’s effect. Surprisingly, we observe a phase transition in the sense that using a converse argument, we show that if the adversary can perturb more than $\sqrt {d}$ coordinates, no classifier can do better than a random guess.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian processes provide a flexible, non-parametric framework for the approximation of functions in high-dimensional spaces. The covariance kernel is the main engine of Gaussian processes, incorporating correlations that underpin the predictive distribution. For applications with spatiotemporal datasets, suitable kernels should model joint spatial and temporal dependence. Separable space-time covariance kernels offer simplicity and computational efficiency. However, non-separable kernels include space-time interactions that better capture observed correlations. Most non-separable kernels that admit explicit expressions are based on mathematical considerations (admissibility conditions) rather than first-principles derivations. We present a hybrid spectral approach for generating covariance kernels which is based on physical arguments. We use this approach to derive a new class of physically motivated, non-separable covariance kernels which have their roots in the stochastic, linear, damped, harmonic oscillator (LDHO). The new kernels incorporate functions with both monotonic and oscillatory decay of space-time correlations. The LDHO covariance kernels involve space-time interactions which are introduced by dispersion relations that modulate the oscillator coefficients. We derive explicit relations for the spatiotemporal covariance kernels in the three oscillator regimes (underdamping, critical damping, overdamping) and investigate their properties. We further illustrate the hybrid spectral method by deriving covariance kernels that are based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.},

While there are numerous methods for estimating $f$ -divergences from data, a limit distribution theory, which quantifies fluctuations of the estimation error, is largely obscure. As limit theorems are pivotal for valid statistical inference, to close this gap, we develop a general methodology for deriving distributional limits for $f$ -divergences based on the functional delta method and Hadamard directional differentiability. Focusing on four prominent $f$ -divergences—Kullback-Leibler divergence, $\chi ^{2}$ divergence, squared Hellinger distance, and total variation distance—we identify sufficient conditions on the population distributions for the existence of distributional limits and characterize the limiting variables. These results are used to derive one- and two-sample limit theorems for Gaussian-smoothed $f$ -divergences, both under the null and the alternative. Finally, an application of the limit distribution theory to auditing differential privacy is proposed and analyzed for significance level and power against local alternatives.},

This paper develops a new variant of the classical Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm for the quickest change detection. This variant is based on Fisher divergence and the Hyvärinen score and is called the Hyvärinen score-based CUSUM (SCUSUM) algorithm. The SCUSUM algorithm allows the applications of change detection for unnormalized statistical models, i.e., models for which the probability density function contains an unknown normalization constant. The asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithm is investigated by deriving expressions for average detection delay and the mean running time to a false alarm. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

Guided by the principle of testing by betting, we reframe this task into that of selecting a sequence of payoff functions that maximize the wealth of a fictitious bettor, betting against the null in a repeated game. In this setting, the relative increase in the bettor’s wealth has a precise interpretation as the measure of evidence against the null, and thus our sequential test rejects the null when the wealth crosses an appropriate threshold. We develop a general framework for setting up the betting game for two-sample testing, in which the payoffs are selected by a prediction strategy as data-driven predictable estimates of the witness function associated with the variational representation of some statistical distance measures, such as integral probability metrics (IPMs). We then formally relate the statistical properties of the test (such as consistency, type-II error exponent and expected sample size) to the regret of the corresponding prediction strategy. We construct a practical sequential two-sample test by instantiating our general strategy with the kernel-MMD metric, and demonstrate its ability to adapt to the difficulty of the unknown alternative through theoretical and empirical results. Our framework is versatile, and easily extends to other problems; we illustrate this by applying our approach to construct consistent tests for the following problems: (i) time-varying two-sample testing with non-exchangeable observations, and (ii) an abstract class of “invariant” testing problems, including symmetry and independence testing.},

The probability law for the $i^{th}$ channel tap during time slot $t$ is supported over an interval of centre $c_{i}$ and radius $r_{i}$ . The transmitter and the receiver only know the centres $c_{i}$ and the radii $r_{i}$ . The joint distribution for the array of channel taps and their realizations are unknown to both the transmitter and the receiver. A lower bound (achievability result) is presented on the channel capacity which results in an upper bound on the capacity loss compared to when all radii are zeros. The lower bound on the channel capacity saturates at a positive value as the maximum average input power $P$ increases beyond what is referred to as the saturation power $P_{sat}$ . Roughly speaking, $P_{sat}$ is inversely proportional to the sum of the squares of the radii $r_{i}$ . It is also verified that in the presence of channel state information at the receiver, if the so-called central channel frequency response is everywhere nonzero, then the aforementioned capacity loss is bounded from above by a constant that does not depend on $P$ . A partial converse result is provided in a scenario where different channel taps vary independently of each other and each channel tap process is stationary with a finite differential entropy rate. It is shown that for every sequence of codebooks with vanishing probability of error, if the size of each symbol in every codeword is bounded away from zero by a constant that is proportional to $\sqrt {P}$ , then the rate of that sequence of codebooks does not scale with $P$ . Tools in matrix analysis such as matrix norms and Weyl’s inequality on perturbation of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices are used in order to analyze the probability of error. A result in the paper that may find other applications is a new and tight upper bound on the size of a Gaussian typical set.},

  abstract     = {A communication setup is considered where a single transmitter wishes to convey messages to one or two receivers and simultaneously estimate the states of the receivers through the backscattered signals of the emitted waveform. The scenario at hand is motivated by joint radar and communication, which aims to co-design radar sensing and communication over shared spectrum and hardware. In this paper, we model the communication channel as a simple memoryless channel with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) time-varying state sequences and we model the backscattered signals by (strictly causal) generalized feedback. For single-receiver systems of this form, we fully characterize the capacity-distortion tradeoff, defined as the largest rate at which a message can reliably be conveyed to the receiver while simultaneously allowing the transmitter to sense the state sequence with a given allowed distortion. Our results show a tradeoff between the achievable rates and distortions, and that this tradeoff only stems from a common choice of the input distribution (the waveform) but not from other properties of the utilized codes. To better illustrate the capacity-distortion tradeoff, we propose a numerical method to compute the optimal inputs (waveforms) that achieve the desired tradeoff. For two-receiver systems with two states, we characterize the capacity-distortion tradeoff region of physically degraded broadcast channels (BC) as a rather straightforward extension of the single receiver case. Here, a tradeoff not only arises between sensing and communication performances but also between the various rates and the distortions of the different states. Similarly to the single-receiver case, the optimal co-design scheme exploits the generalized feedback signals only for sensing but not for improving communication performance. This is different for general two-receiver BCs, where optimal co-design schemes exploit generalized feedback also to improve capacity. However, as we show, also for BCs the optimal sensing performance only depends on the chosen input distribution (waveform) but not on the code construction used to accomplish the communication task. For general BCs, we provide inner and outer bounds on the capacity-distortion region, as well as a sufficient condition when this capacity-distortion region is equal to the product of the capacity region and the set of achievable distortions, in which case no tradeoff between sensing and communication occurs. A number of illustrative examples demonstrate that the optimal co-design schemes outperform conventional schemes that split the resources between sensing and communication, both for single-receiver and BC systems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present an abstract framework for some algebraic error-correcting codes with the aim of capturing codes that are list-decodable to capacity, along with their decoding algorithms. In the polynomial ideal framework, a code is specified by some ideals in a polynomial ring, messages are polynomials and the encoding of a message polynomial is the collection of residues of that polynomial modulo the ideals. We present an alternate way of viewing this class of codes in terms of linear operators, and show that this alternate view makes their algorithmic list-decodability amenable to analysis. Our framework leads to a new class of codes that we call affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes (which are themselves a special case of the broader class we explore). These codes are common generalizations of the well-studied Folded Reed-Solomon codes and Univariate Multiplicity codes as well as the less-studied Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes, and lead to a large family of codes that were not previously known/studied. More significantly our framework also captures the algorithmic list-decodability of the constituent codes. Specifically, we present a unified view of the decoding algorithm for ideal-theoretic codes and show that the decodability reduces to the analysis of the distance of some related codes. We show that a good bound on this distance leads to a capacity-achieving performance of the underlying code, providing a unifying explanation of known capacity-achieving results. In the specific case of affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes, our framework shows that they are efficiently list-decodable up to capacity (for appropriate setting of the parameters), thereby unifying the previous results for Folded Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity and Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the privacy problem in coded caching. Recently, it was shown that the seminal MAN coded caching scheme leaks the demand information of each user to the other users in the system. Many works have considered coded caching with demand privacy, while every non-trivial existing coded caching scheme with private demands was built on the fact that the cache information of each user is private to the others. However, most of these schemes leak the users’ cache information. As a consequence, in most realistic settings (e.g., video streaming) where the system is used over time with multiple sequential transmission rounds, these schemes leak demand privacy beyond the first round. This observation motivates our new formulation of coded caching with simultaneously private demands and caches in this paper. For this new model, we first show that an existing coded caching scheme with private demands, referred to as the virtual users scheme, can also preserve the privacy of the users’ caches. However, this scheme suffers from its extremely high subpacketization. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction that generates private coded caching schemes by leveraging two-server private information retrieval (PIR) schemes. We show that if in the PIR scheme the demand is uniform over all files and the queries are independent, the resulting caching scheme is private on both the demands and the caches; otherwise, the resulting scheme is private only on the demands. This first result constructs coded caching schemes from a particular class of PIR schemes, which is a new “structural” result in its own merit. We then construct new two-server PIR schemes with uniform demand and independent queries, such that the resulting caching scheme has a subpacketization level that is significantly reduced compared to the virtual users scheme. Interestingly we propose a new construction of two-server PIR schemes with uniform demand and independent queries by exploiting coded caching schemes. By applying the seminal Maddah-Ali and Niesen coded caching scheme in our construction, the resulting two-server PIR scheme is proved to be order-optimal under the constraint of uniform demand and independent queries. This is a second new “structural” result that somehow closes the loop in the relationship between coded caching and PIR. As a by-product of our new construction, we obtain a new demand private that improves the load of the state-of-the-art demand private caching schemes known so far. Finally, to explore a broader tradeoff between cache privacy and transmission load, we relax the cache privacy constraint and introduce the definition of cache information leakage. Then, again as a by-product of our new construction, we propose new schemes with perfect demand privacy and imperfect cache privacy that achieve an order-gain in load with respect to the scheme with perfect privacy on both demands and caches. This also establishes a first non-trivial achievability result in the tradeoff between load and cache privacy, for demand-private caching schemes.},

  abstract     = {ABS polar codes were recently proposed to speed up polarization by swapping certain pairs of adjacent bits after each layer of polar transform. In this paper, we observe that applying the Arıkan transform $(U_{i}, U_{i+1}) \mapsto (U_{i}+U_{i+1}, U_{i+1})$ on certain pairs of adjacent bits after each polar transform layer leads to even faster polarization. In light of this, we propose ABS+ polar codes which incorporate the Arıkan transform in addition to the swapping transform in ABS polar codes. In order to efficiently construct and decode ABS+ polar codes, we derive a new recursive relation between the joint distributions of adjacent bits through different layers of polar transforms. Simulation results over a wide range of parameters show that the CRC-aided SCL decoder of ABS+ polar codes improves upon that of ABS polar codes by $0.1 \mathop {\mathrm {dB}}\nolimits $ – $0.25 \mathop {\mathrm {dB}}\nolimits $ while maintaining the same decoding time. Moreover, ABS+ polar codes improve upon standard polar codes by $0.2 \mathop {\mathrm {dB}}\nolimits $ – $0.45 \mathop {\mathrm {dB}}\nolimits $ when they both use the CRC-aided SCL decoder with list size 32. The implementations of all the algorithms in this paper are available at https://github.com/PlumJelly/ABS-Polar},

Previously, when $t = e+\ell $ and the transmitted word is long enough, the numbers of required channels were determined for $\mathcal {L}=1, 2~\text {and }~\ell +1$ . Here we determine the exact number of channels in the cases $\mathcal {L}= 3, 4, \ldots, \ell $ . This also provides the size of the largest intersection of $\mathcal {L}$ balls of radius $t$ (with respect to substitutions) centered at the words with mutual Hamming distances at least $2e+1$ . Furthermore, with the aid of covering codes, we also consider the list sizes in the cases where the length $n$ is rather small (improving previously known results). After that we study how much we can decrease the number of required channels when we use list-decoding codes. Finally, the majority algorithm is discussed for decoding in a probabilistic set-up; in particular, we show that the output word of the decoder can be verified to be the transmitted one with high probability.},

This is a natural generalization of the sphere packing problem. We study the multiple packing problem for both bounded point sets whose points have norm at most $\sqrt {nP}$ for some constant $P &amp;gt; 0$ , and unbounded point sets whose points are allowed to be anywhere in $ \mathbb {R}^{n} $ . Given a well-known connection with coding theory, multiple packings can be viewed as the Euclidean analog of list-decodable codes, which are well-studied over finite fields. We derive the best known lower bounds on the optimal multiple packing density. This is accomplished by establishing an inequality which relates the list-decoding error exponent for additive white Gaussian noise channels, a quantity of average-case nature, to the list-decoding radius, a quantity of worst-case nature. We also derive novel bounds on the list-decoding error exponent for infinite constellations and closed-form expressions for the list-decoding error exponents for the power-constrained AWGN channel, which may be of independent interest beyond multiple packing.},

When $\mathbf {P}$ is hierarchical or $\omega $ is identically 1, with some weak additional assumptions, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathbf {H}$ to satisfy MEP with respect to $(\mathbf {P},\omega)$ -weight in terms of MEP with respect to Hamming weight. With the help of these results, when $S$ is a finite field, we compare MEP with various well studied coding-theoretic properties including the property of admitting MacWilliams identity (PAMI), reflexivity of partitions, UDP, transitivity of the group of isometries and whether $(\mathbf {P},\omega)$ induces an association scheme; in particular, we show that MEP is always stronger than all the other properties.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel shift-sum decoding method for non-binary cyclic codes, which only requires finite field operations but yields advanced decoding performance. Using the cyclically different minimum-weight dual codewords (MWDCs) and their proper shifts, a frequency matrix can be obtained as a reliability metric for identifying the error positions and magnitudes. By analyzing the statistical distributions of the matrix entries, the rationale for the shift-sum decoding’s advanced error-correction capability is revealed. Based on this decoding method, a hard-decision iterative shift-sum (HISS) decoding algorithm is first proposed. It can correct errors beyond half of the code’s minimum Hamming distance. By further utilizing the reliability information obtained from the channel, a soft-decision iterative shift-sum (SISS) decoding algorithm is then proposed to improve the decoding performance. Both the HISS and the SISS algorithms are realized only with polynomial multiplications and numerical comparisons, which are hardware-friendly. To further improve the error-correction performance, the HISS and SISS algorithms can be integrated in a Chase decoding mechanism for handling the test-vectors. Simulation results on Reed-Solomon (RS) and non-binary BCH (NB-BCH) codes show that the proposed algorithms yield a competent decoding and complexity performances in comparison with the existing decoding algorithms.},

In the special case of graph entropy (i.e., unconditioned version) this was known due to Csiszár, Körner, Lovász, Marton, and Simonyi. In that case the role of the convex corner was played by the so-called vertex packing polytope. In the conditional version it is a more intricate convex body but the function to minimize is the same.

  abstract     = {Coding schemes for several problems in network information theory are constructed starting from point-to-point channel codes that are designed for symmetric channels. Given that the point-to-point codes satisfy certain properties pertaining to the rate, the error probability, and the distribution of decoded sequences, bounds on the performance of the coding schemes are derived and shown to hold irrespective of other properties of the codes. In particular, we consider the problems of lossless and lossy source coding, Slepian–Wolf coding, Wyner–Ziv coding, Berger–Tung coding, multiple description coding, asymmetric channel coding, Gelfand–Pinsker coding, coding for multiple access channels, Marton coding for broadcast channels, and coding for cloud radio access networks (C-RAN’s). We show that the coding schemes can achieve the best known inner bounds for these problems, provided that the constituent point-to-point channel codes are rate-optimal. This would allow one to leverage commercial off-the-shelf codes for point-to-point symmetric channels in the practical implementation of codes over networks. Simulation results demonstrate the gain of the proposed coding schemes compared to existing practical solutions to these problems.},

  abstract     = {Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are a fundamental class of inequalities that play an important role in information theory. They play a key role in establishing concentration inequalities and in obtaining quantitative estimates on the convergence to equilibrium of Markov processes. More recently, deep links have been established between logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and strong data processing inequalities. In this paper we study logarithmic Sobolev inequalities from a computational point of view. We describe a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations which give certified lower bounds on the logarithmic Sobolev constant of a finite Markov operator, and we prove that the optimal values of these semidefinite programs converge to the logarithmic Sobolev constant. Numerical experiments show that these relaxations are often very close to the true constant even for low levels of the hierarchy. Finally, we exploit our relaxation to obtain a sum-of-squares proof that the logarithmic Sobolev constant is equal to half the Poincaré constant for the specific case of a simple random walk on the odd $n$ -cycle, with $n\in \{5,7, {\dots },21\}$ . Previously this was known only for $n=5$ and even $n$ .},

First, we derive polynomial approximations of the conditional expectation operator. We then apply these approximations to bound the best mean-square error achieved by a polynomial estimator—referred to here as the PMMSE. In Gaussian channels, the PMMSE coincides with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) if and only if the input is either Gaussian or constant, i.e., if and only if the conditional expectation of the input of the channel given the output is a polynomial of degree at most 1. By combining the PMMSE with the I-MMSE relationship, we derive new formulas for information measures (e.g., differential entropy, mutual information) that are given in terms of the moments of the underlying random variables. As an application, we introduce estimators for information measures from data via approximating the moments in our formulas by sample moments. These estimators are shown to be asymptotically consistent and possess desirable properties, e.g., invariance to affine transformations when used to estimate mutual information.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the information freshness of finite-state Markov sources, using the uncertainty of information (UoI) as the performance metric. Measured by Shannon’s entropy, UoI can capture not only the transition dynamics of the Markov source but also the different evolutions of information quality caused by the different values of the last observation. We consider an information update system with $M$ finite-state Markov sources transmitting information to a remote monitor via $m$ communication channels ( $1\le m &amp;lt; M$ ). At each time, only $m$ Markov sources can be selected to transmit their latest information to the remote monitor. Our goal is to explore the optimal scheduling policy to minimize the sum-UoI of the Markov sources. The problem is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB). We relax the RMAB and then decouple the relaxed problem into $M$ single bandit problems. Importantly, analyzing the single bandit problem provides useful properties with which the relaxed problem reduces to maximizing a concave and piecewise linear function, allowing us to develop a gradient method to solve the relaxed problem and obtain its optimal policy. By rounding up the optimal policy for the relaxed problem, we obtain an index policy for the original RMAB problem. Notably, the proposed index policy is universal in the sense that it applies to general RMABs with bounded cost functions. Moreover, we show that our policy is asymptotically optimal as $m$ and $M$ tend to $\infty $ with $m/M$ fixed. In non-asymptotic cases, numerical results demonstrate that our index policy is near-optimal and performs as well as the celebrated Whittle index policy in the problems that are Whittle-indexable. Unlike the Whittle index policy, our index policy does not require “indexability”; the indices can be computed regardless of indexability in the Whittle’s sense. Thus, our index policy is a promising alternative method for the class of RMABs of concern: it can be used when the Whittle index policy is not viable and it performs as well as the Whittle index policy even when the Whittle index policy is viable.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we put forward secure network function computation over a directed acyclic network. In such a network, a sink node is required to compute with zero error a target function of which the inputs are generated as source messages at multiple source nodes, while a wiretapper, who can access any one but not more than one wiretap set in a given collection of wiretap sets, is not allowed to obtain any information about a security function of the source messages. The secure computing capacity for the above model is defined as the maximum average number of times that the target function can be securely computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap sets and security function for one use of the network. The characterization of this capacity is in general overwhelmingly difficult. In the current paper, we consider securely computing linear functions with a wiretapper who can eavesdrop any subset of edges up to a certain size $r$ , referred to as the security level, with the security function being the identity function. We first prove an upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. This upper bound depends on the network topology and security level. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound and a lower bound on this bound, which are both in closed form. In particular, when the security level $r$ is equal to 0, our upper bound reduces to the computing capacity without security consideration. Also, we discover the surprising fact that for some models, there is no penalty on the secure computing capacity compared with the computing capacity without security consideration. Furthermore, we obtain an equivalent expression of the upper bound by using a graph-theoretic approach, and accordingly we develop an efficient approach for computing this bound. On the other hand, we present a construction of linear function-computing secure network codes and obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity. By our code construction, for the linear function which is over a given finite field, we can always construct a (vector-) linear function-computing secure network code over the same field. We also give some sufficient conditions for the tightness of the lower bound in terms of the network topology. With this lower bound and the upper bound we have obtained, the secure computing capacity for some classes of secure models can be fully characterized. Another interesting case is that the security function is the same as the target function, which will be investigated in Part II of this paper.},

We prove that this algorithm is adaptive, i.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of any provable contextual bandit algorithm, that needs the knowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model class turns out to be only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the regret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller as the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We also show that a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains similar regret bound, despite not knowing the true model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as opposed to in ACB , as expected. Furthermore, for the special case of linear contextual bandits, we propose specialized algorithms that obtain sharper guarantees compared to the generic setup.},

Our result can be applied to tighten existing expected generalization errors and PAC-Bayesian bounds.

Our contributions include the following: generalizing Strassen’s theorem to the unbalanced optimal transport setting with applications to adversarial classification with unequal priors; showing an equivalence between adversarial robustness and robust hypothesis testing with $\infty $ -Wasserstein uncertainty sets; proving the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in the two-player game between the adversary and the algorithm; and characterizing adversarial risk by the minimum Bayes error between a pair of distributions belonging to the $\infty $ -Wasserstein uncertainty sets. Our results generalize and deepen recently discovered connections between optimal transport and adversarial robustness and reveal new connections to Choquet capacities and game theory.},

  abstract     = {Consider two populations characterized by independent random variables $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ such that $X_{i}, i=1,2$ , follows a gamma distribution with an unknown scale parameter $\theta _{i}&amp;gt;0$ , and known shape parameter $\alpha &amp;gt;0$ (the same shape parameter for both the populations). Here $(X_{1},X_{2})$ may be an appropriate minimal sufficient statistic based on independent random samples from the two populations. The population associated with the larger (smaller) Shannon entropy is referred to as the “worse” (“better”) population. For the goal of selecting the worse (better) population, a natural selection rule is the one that selects the population corresponding to $\max \{X_{1},X_{2}\} (\min \{X_{1},X_{2}\})$ as the worse (better) population. This natural selection rule is known to possess several optimum properties. We consider the problem of estimating the Shannon entropy of the population selected using the natural selection rule (to be referred to as the selected entropy) under the mean squared error criterion. In order to improve upon various naive estimators of the selected entropy, we derive a class of shrinkage estimators that shrink various naive estimators towards the central entropy. For this purpose, we first consider a class of naive estimators comprising linear, scale and permutation equivariant estimators and identify optimum estimators within this class. The class of naive estimators considered by us contains three natural plug-in estimators. To further improve upon the optimum naive estimators, we consider a general class of equivariant estimators and obtain dominating shrinkage estimators. We also present a simulation study on the performances of various competing estimators. Illustrative examples have been given using real data sets.},

In many applications, we have some level of freedom to design the sensing matrix $\boldsymbol {A}$ , and in such circumstances we could optimize $\boldsymbol {A}$ to achieve better reconstruction performance. As a first step towards optimal design, it is important to understand the impact of the sensing matrix on the difficulty of recovering $\boldsymbol {x}$ from $\boldsymbol {y}$ . In this paper, we study the performance of one of the most successful recovery methods, i.e., the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm. We define a notion of spikiness for the spectrum of $\boldsymbol {A}$ and show the importance of this measure for the performance of EP. We show that whether a spikier spectrum can hurt or help the recovery performance depends on $f$ . Based on our framework, we are able to show that, in phase-retrieval problems, matrices with spikier spectrums are better for EP, while in 1-bit compressed sensing problems, less spiky spectrums lead to better performance. Our results unify and substantially generalize existing results that compare Gaussian and orthogonal matrices, and provide a platform towards designing optimal sensing systems.},

Optimality is derived with respect to a notion of average discrepancy $P_{X} \to Q_{X}$ (averaged over $X$ space) which significantly relaxes a recent notion—termed transfer-exponent—shown to tightly capture the limits of classification under such a distribution shift.

This gives rise to the tightly connected problems of deriving concentration inequalities and confidence sequences, i.e., confidence intervals that hold uniformly over time. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to convert the regret guarantee of an online learning algorithm into concentration inequalities, but these concentration results were not tight. In this paper, we show regret guarantees of universal portfolio algorithms applied to the online learning problem of betting give rise to new implicit time-uniform concentration inequalities for bounded random variables. The key feature of our concentration results is that they are centered around the maximum log wealth of the best fixed betting strategy in hindsight. We propose numerical methods to solve these implicit inequalities, which results in confidence sequences that enjoy the empirical Bernstein rate with the optimal asymptotic behavior while being never worse than Bernoulli-KL confidence bounds. We further show that our confidence sequences are never vacuous with even one sample, for any given target failure rate $\delta \in (0,1)$ . Our empirical study shows that our confidence bounds achieve the state-of-the-art performance, especially in the small sample regime.},

We show that the sample complexity of simple binary hypothesis testing under communication constraints is at most a logarithmic factor larger than in the unconstrained setting and this bound is tight. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the aforementioned sample complexity. Our framework extends to robust hypothesis testing, where the distributions are corrupted in total variation distance. Our proofs rely on a new reverse data processing inequality and a reverse Markov inequality, which may be of independent interest.

  abstract     = {Non-malleable codes introduced by Dziembowski et al. (2018) encode a classical message $S$ in a manner such that the tampered codeword either decodes to the original message $S$ or a message that is unrelated/independent of $S$ . Constructing non-malleable codes for various tampering function families has received significant attention in the recent years. We consider the well studied (2-part) split-state model, in which the message $S$ is encoded into two parts $X$ and $Y$ , and the adversary is allowed to arbitrarily tamper with each $X$ and $Y$ individually. Non-malleable codes in the split-state model have found applications in other important security notions like non-malleable commitments and non-malleable secret sharing. Thus, it is vital to understand if such non-malleable codes are secure against quantum adversaries. We consider the security of non-malleable codes in the split-state model when the adversary is allowed to make use of arbitrary entanglement to tamper the parts $X$ and $Y$ . We construct explicit quantum secure non-malleable codes in the split-state model. Our construction of quantum secure non-malleable codes is based on the recent construction of quantum secure 2-source non-malleable extractors by Boddu et al. (2021). 1) We extend the connection of Cheraghchi and Guruswami (2016) between 2-source non-malleable extractors and non-malleable codes in the split-state model in the classical setting to the quantum setting, i.e. we show that explicit quantum secure 2-source non-malleable extractors in $(k_{1},k_{2})- \mathsf {qpa- state} $ framework of Boddu et al. (2021) give rise to explicit quantum secure non-malleable codes in the split-state model. 2) We construct the first quantum secure non-malleable code with efficient encoding and decoding procedures for message length $m=n^{\Omega (1)}$ , error $\varepsilon =2^{-n^{\Omega (1)}}$ and codeword of size $2n$ . Prior to this work, it remained open to provide such quantum secure non-malleable code even for a single bit message in the split-state model. 3) We also study its natural extension when the tampering of the codeword is performed $t$ -times. We construct quantum secure one-many non-malleable code with efficient encoding and decoding procedures for $t=n^{\Omega (1)}$ , message length $m=n^{\Omega (1)}$ , error $\varepsilon =2^{-n^{\Omega (1)}}$ and codeword of size $2n$ . 4) As an application, we also construct the first quantum secure 2-out-of-2 non-malleable secret sharing scheme for message/secret length $m=n^{\Omega (1)}$ , error $\varepsilon =2^{-n^{\Omega (1)}}$ and share of size $n$ .},

The receiver will be able to decode the messages almost perfectly, while the eavesdropper must not be able to extract information about the messages even if they have access to the quantum systems transmitted. We consider a “conditional” scenario in which a portion of the receiver’s side information is also accessible to the eavesdropper.

  abstract     = {Multi-source extractors are functions that extract uniform randomness from multiple (weak) sources of randomness. Quantum multi-source extractors were considered by Kasher and Kempe (2010) (for the quantum independent adversary and the quantum bounded storage adversary), Chung et al. (2014) (for the general entangled adversary) and Arnon-Friedman et al. (2016) (for the quantum Markov adversary). One of the main objectives of this work is to unify all the existing quantum multi-source adversary models. We propose two new models of adversaries: 1) the quantum measurement adversary ( $\mathsf {qma}$ ), which generates side information using entanglement and on post-measurement; and 2) the quantum communication adversary ( $\mathsf {qca}$ ), which generates side information using entanglement and communication between multiple sources. We show that: 1) $\mathsf {qma}$ is the strongest adversary among all the known adversaries, in the sense that the side information of all other adversaries can be generated by $\mathsf {qma}$ ; 2) The (generalized) inner-product function (in fact a general class of two-wise independent functions) continues to work as a good extractor with matching parameters as that of Chor and Goldreich (1985) against classical adversaries; 3) A non-malleable extractor proposed by Li (2012) (against classical adversaries) continues to be secure against quantum side information. This result implies a non-malleable extractor result of Aggarwal et al. (2019) with uniform seed. We strengthen their result via a completely different proof to make the non-malleable extractor of Li secure against quantum side information even when the seed is not uniform; 4) A modification (working with weak local randomness instead of uniform local randomness) of the Dodis and Wichs (2009) protocol for privacy-amplification is secure against active quantum adversaries (those who arbitrarily modify the messages exchanged in the protocol). This strengthens on a recent result due to Aggarwal et al. (2019) which uses uniform local randomness; 5) A tight efficiency lower bound for the (generalized) inner-product function (in fact a general class of two-wise independent functions).},

  abstract     = {Designing encoding and decoding circuits to reliably send messages over many uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits are affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are threshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum channel $T$ and every $\epsilon &amp;gt;0$ there exists a threshold $p(\epsilon,T)$ for the gate error probability below which rates larger than $C-\epsilon $ are fault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where $C$ denotes the usual capacity. Our results are not only relevant in communication over large distances, but also on-chip, where distant parts of a quantum computer might need to communicate under higher levels of noise than affecting the local gates.},

We derive a lower and an upper bound on the outage transmission capacity of MIMO slow fading channels for arbitrary state distribution and show that the bounds coincide except possibly at points of discontinuity of the outage transmission capacity, of which there are, at most, countably many. Such discontinuity issues might occur because the channel state distribution is arbitrary. We also establish the capacity of a specific compound MIMO Gaussian channel in order to prove the lower bound on the outage transmission capacity. Furthermore, we define the outage CR capacity for a two-source model with unidirectional communication over a MIMO slow fading channel with arbitrary state distribution and establish a lower and an upper bound on it using our bounds on the outage transmission capacity of the MIMO slow fading channel.},

  abstract     = {Geometric path-loss (GPL) in the radio propagation channel dominantly decides the signal strength and hence yields a significant and multi-faceted influence on wireless communications and networking. In this paper, the GPL is reported to be (truncated) Pareto distributed in wireless random networks, which applies to both of the two considered cases: locally random network (LRN) and homogeneous random network (HRN). Note that most literature assume (infinite) HRNs for scenarios of the fourth or earlier generation wireless communication where most base stations (BSs) have the omni-directional coverage. This might easily be violated when there exist node clusters and, more importantly, for 5G or beyond scenarios with mmWave or THz communication that are more narrow directional on the beamforming and hence coverage. However, the node clusters can reasonably be modelled by the LRNs, thus solving the above issue. To cope with that, the LRN is considered to be more generic and hence easily reduces to the HRN. Two applications on the path-loss exponent (PLE) self-estimation and the expected interference are also presented to demonstrate the significance of this contribution. The findings in this paper might cast light upon the future of random network analysis and designing new kinds of techniques.},

  abstract     = {From an information theoretic perspective, joint communication and sensing (JCAS) represents a natural generalization of communication network functionality. However, it requires the re-evaluation of network performance from a multi-objective perspective. We develop a novel mathematical framework for characterizing the sensing and communication coverage probability and ergodic rate in JCAS networks. We employ a formulation of sensing parameter estimation based on mutual information to extend the notions of coverage probability and ergodic rate to the radar setting. We define sensing coverage probability as the probability that the rate of information extracted about the parameters of interest associated with a typical radar target exceeds some threshold, and sensing ergodic rate as the spatial average of the aforementioned rate of information. Using this framework, we analyze the downlink sensing and communication coverage and rate of a mmWave JCAS network employing a shared waveform, directional beamforming, and monostatic sensing. Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry, we derive upper and lower bounds for these quantities. We also develop several general technical results including: i) a generic method for obtaining closed form upper and lower bounds on the Laplace Transform of a shot noise process, ii) a new analog of Hölder’s Inequality to the setting of harmonic means, and iii) a relation between the Laplace and Mellin Transforms of a non-negative random variable. We use the derived bounds to numerically investigate the performance of JCAS networks under varying base station and blockage density. Among several insights, our numerical analysis indicates that network densification improves sensing SINR performance – in contrast to communications.},

For all channel configurations, the rate-limited Rx help results in a (weak or strong) secrecy capacity boost equal to the help rate. This holds irrespective of whether the help is secure or not, or whether the helper is aware of the message being transmitted or not; the secrecy of help or helper’s knowledge of the message does not provide any extra capacity boost. The secrecy capacity is positive for the reversely-degraded channel (where the no-help secrecy capacity is zero) and no wiretap coding is needed to achieve it under weak secrecy. The same capacity boost also holds if non-secure help is available to the transmitter (encoder), in addition to or instead of the same Rx help, so that, in the case of the joint Tx/Rx help, one help link can be omitted without affecting the capacity. If Rx/Tx help links are independent of each other, the capacity boost is the sum of help rates and no link can be omitted without loss in the capacity. Non-singular correlation of the receiver and eavesdropper noises does not affect the secrecy capacity and non-causal help does not bring in any capacity increase over the causal one. The choice of the secrecy criterion (weak/strong) affects the complexity of implementation but not the secrecy capacity. Stronger noise at the legitimate receiver can sometimes result in higher secrecy capacity.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the information theoretic limit of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided communication scenario in which the RIS and the transmitter either jointly or independently send information to the receiver. The RIS is an emerging technology that uses a large number of passive reflective elements with adjustable phases to intelligently reflect the transmit signal to the intended receiver. While most previous studies of the RIS focus on its ability to beamform and to boost the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this paper shows that if the information data stream is also available at the RIS and can be modulated through the adjustable phases at the RIS, significant improvement in the degree-of-freedom (DoF) of the overall channel is possible. For example, for an RIS system in which the signals are reflected from a transmitter with $M$ antennas to a receiver with $K$ antennas through an RIS with $N$ reflective elements, assuming no direct path between the transmitter and the receiver, joint transmission of the transmitter and the RIS can achieve a DoF of $\min \left({M+\frac {N}{2}-\frac {1}{2},N,K}\right)$ as compared to the DoF of $\min (M,K)$ for the conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. This result is obtained by establishing a connection between the RIS system and the MIMO channel with phase noise and by using results for characterizing the information dimension under projection. The result is further extended to the case with a direct path between the transmitter and the receiver, and also to the multiple access scenario, in which the transmitter and the RIS send independent information. Finally, this paper proposes a symbol-level precoding approach for modulating data through the phases of the RIS, and provides numerical simulation results to verify the theoretical DoF results.},

  abstract     = {The multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma bounds the total multiplicity of zeroes of a multivariate polynomial on a product set. This lemma motivates the multiplicity codes of Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [J. ACM, 2014], who showed how to use this lemma to construct high-rate locally-decodable codes. However, the algorithmic results about these codes crucially rely on the fact that the polynomials are evaluated on a vector space and not an arbitrary product set. In this work, we show how to decode multivariate multiplicity codes of large multiplicities in polynomial time over finite product sets (over fields of large characteristic and zero characteristic). Previously such decoding algorithms were not known even for a positive fraction of errors. In contrast, our work goes all the way to the distance of the code and in particular exceeds both the unique-decoding bound and the Johnson radius. For errors exceeding the Johnson radius, even combinatorial list-decodablity of these codes was not known. Our algorithm is an application of the classical polynomial method directly to the multivariate setting. In particular, we do not rely on a reduction from the multivariate to the univariate case as is typical of many of the existing results on decoding codes based on multivariate polynomials. However, a vanilla application of the polynomial method in the multivariate setting does not yield a polynomial upper bound on the list size. We obtain a polynomial bound on the list size by taking an alternative view of multivariate multiplicity codes. In this view, we glue all the partial derivatives of the same order together using a fresh set $\mathbf {z}$ of variables. We then apply the polynomial method by viewing this as a problem over the field $\mathbb {F} (\mathbf {z})$ of rational functions in $\mathbf {z}$ .},

  abstract     = {BCH codes and their dual codes are two special subclasses of cyclic codes and are the best linear codes in many cases. A lot of progress on the study of BCH cyclic codes has been made, but little is known about the minimum distances of duals of BCH codes. Recently, a concept called dually-BCH code was introduced to investigate the duals of BCH codes and the lower bounds on their minimum distances in Gong et al., (2022). For a prime power $q$ and an integer $m \ge 4$ , let $n=\frac {q^{m}-1}{q+1}$ ( $m$ even), or $n=\frac {q^{m}-1}{q-1}$ ( $q&amp;gt;2$ ). In this paper, some sufficient and necessary conditions in terms of the designed distance will be given to ensure that the narrow-sense BCH codes of length $n$ are dually-BCH codes, which extended the results in Gong et al., (2022). Lower bounds on the minimum distances of their dual codes are developed for $n=\frac {q^{m}-1}{q+1}$ ( $m$ even). As byproducts, we present the largest coset leader $\delta _{1}$ modulo $n$ being of two types, which proves a conjecture in Wu et al., (2019) and partially solves an open problem in Li et al., (2017). We also investigate the parameters of narrow-sense BCH codes of length $n$ with design distance $\delta _{1}$ . The BCH codes presented in this paper have good parameters in general.},

In 1965, Levenshtein initiated the study of deletion codes by showing that, for $k\ge 1$ fixed and $n$ going to infinity, a $k$ -deletion code $C\subseteq \{0,1\}^{n}$ of maximum size satisfies $\Omega _{k}(2^{n}/n^{2k}) \leq |C| \leq O_{k}(2^{n}/n^{k})$ . We make the first asymptotic improvement to these bounds by showing that there exist $k$ -deletion codes with size at least $\Omega _{k}(2^{n} \log n/n^{2k})$ . Our proof is inspired by Jiang and Vardy’s improvement to the classical Gilbert–Varshamov bounds.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present a new enumerative formula for the code size of such CPC with all the terms being positive integers, contrasting to the previously known ones given in Allard et al.

We consider the scenario where the $rn$ -bit observation is computationally bounded – the adversary is free to choose an arbitrary observation function as long as the function can be computed using a polynomial amount of computational resources. This observation-based restriction differs from conventional channel-based computational limitations, where in the later case, the resource limitation applies to the computation of the (adversarial) channel error/corruption. For all $r \in [0,1-H(p)]$ where $H(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function and $p$ is the adversary’s error budget, we characterize the capacity of the above channel and find that the capacity is identical to the completely oblivious setting ( $r=0$ ). This result can be viewed as a generalization of known results on myopic adversaries and on channels with active eavesdroppers for which the observation process depends on a fixed distribution and fixed-linear structure, respectively, that cannot be chosen arbitrarily by the adversary.},

  abstract     = {There is a concept in graph theory known as a chord which has not been considered before in relation to trapping sets of Tanner graphs. A chord of a cycle is an edge outside the cycle which connects two vertices of that cycle. It is proved that short cycles with a chord are the root of several trapping sets and eliminating them increases the minimum distance $d_{\min }$ of a code. We provide new analytic lower bounds on $d_{\min }$ of LDPC codes with girths 6 and 8 and column weight $\gamma $ in which the short cycles are all chordless. We prove, analytically, that $d_{\min }\geq 2\gamma $ for girth 6 and $d_{\min }\geq \frac {3(\gamma -1)^{2}}{\gamma \ln \gamma -\gamma +1}$ for girth 8. Comparing these bounds with the existing bound $\gamma +1$ for girth-6 LDPC codes shows the positive and significant influence of eliminating these cycles. A method to construct protograph-based LDPC codes with different girths and free of short cycles with a chord is given which is applicable to any type of protographs, simple and multi-edge, regular and irregular. The conditions to remove small trapping sets from the Tanner graph of a multi-edge QC-LDPC code are given. Numerical results indicate that the application of our method to QC-LDPC codes improves existing results.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a novel multi-access coded caching (MACC) model in the two-dimensional (2D) topology, which is a generalization of the one-dimensional (1D) MACC model proposed by Hachem et al. The 2D MACC model is formed by a server containing $N$ files, $K_{1}\times K_{2}$ cache-nodes with $M$ files located at a grid with $K_{1}$ rows and $K_{2}$ columns, and $K_{1}\times K_{2}$ cache-less users where each user is connected to $L^{2}$ nearby cache-nodes. The server is connected to the users through an error-free shared link, while the users can retrieve the cached content of the connected cache-nodes without cost. Our objective is to minimize the worst-case transmission load over all possible users’ demands. In this paper, we first propose a grouping scheme for the case where $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ are divisible by $L$ . By partitioning the cache-nodes and users into $L^{2}$ groups such that no two users in the same group share any cache-node, we use the shared-link coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen for each group. Then for any model parameters satisfying $\min \{K_{1},K_{2}\}\geq L$ , we propose a transformation approach which constructs a 2D MACC scheme from two classes of 1D MACC schemes in vertical and horizontal projections, respectively. As a result, we can construct 2D MACC schemes that achieve maximum local caching gain and improved coded caching gain, compared to the baseline scheme by a direct extension from 1D MACC schemes. In addition, we propose new information theoretic converse bounds under the uncoded placement constraint by leveraging the network topology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs) in the presence of delayed feedback. We show that the capacity of a FSC with delayed feedback can be computed as that of a new FSC with instantaneous feedback and an extended state. Consequently, graph-based methods to obtain computable upper and lower bounds on the delayed feedback capacity of unifilar FSCs are proposed. Based on these methods, we establish that the capacity of the trapdoor channel with delayed feedback of two time instances is given by $\log _{2}\left ({\frac {3}{2}}\right )$ . In addition, we derive an analytical upper bound on the delayed feedback capacity of the binary symmetric channel with a no consecutive ones input constraint. This bound also serves as a novel upper bound on its non-feedback capacity, which outperforms all previously known bounds. Lastly, we demonstrate that feedback does improve the capacity of the dicode erasure channel.},

For a special class of stationary ergodic processes, we prove that the Rényi entropy rate always exists and can be approximated by its defining sequence at most polynomially; moreover, using the Markov approximation method, we show that the Rényi entropy rate can be exponentially approximated by that of the Markov approximating sequence, as the Markov order goes to infinity. For the general case, by constructing a counterexample, we disprove the conjecture that the Rényi entropy rate of a general stationary ergodic process always converges to its Shannon entropy rate as $\alpha $ goes to 1.},
