First, with a change in coordinates, the optimal bipartite consensus can be transformed into the optimal consensus problem, and the optimal control law is also established. Second, a distributed state observer is designed for each agent to estimate the leader&#39;s state under the cooperate/antagonistic interaction, which is used to replace the unavailable leader&#39;s signal. Then, to find the optimal control solution adaptively, two online integral reinforcement learning algorithms, i.e., on-policy and off-policy, are developed. Based on the policy iteration in the learning process, the algorithms proposed here utilize the state data of systems without requiring a complete knowledge of the leader&#39;s and agents&#39; dynamics. It is proven that the observer is exponentially convergent, which guarantees the accuracy of the solution in algorithms. Finally, two examples are given to show the validity of the proposed method.},

Due to the special nature of fractional calculus operations, the control design for FOMASs with the unknown sensitivity and attacks is more challenging. In order to solve these difficulties, some auxiliary variables are constructed deliberately with which the distributed adaptive control scheme is proposed. Meanwhile, we design a fractional-order filter to avoid the problem of “complexity explosion.” Compared with the existing filters, the proposed filter can confirm that the filter errors are asymptotically convergent and the unknown upper bound of fractional-order derivatives of virtual control signals is estimated effectively. From the rigorous theoretical analysis, it is proved that under the proposed adaptive control, the asymptotic consensus can be achieved in the presence of the sensors with unknown measurement sensitivity and actuator attacks.

This article addresses a class of constrained distributed nonconvex optimization problems involving univariate objectives, aiming to achieve global optimization without requiring local evaluations of gradients at every iteration. We propose a novel algorithm named Chebyshev-proxy-and-consensus-based algorithm, exploiting the notion of combining Chebyshev polynomial approximation, average consensus, and polynomial optimization. The proposed algorithm is able to obtain $\epsilon$-globally optimal solutions for any arbitrarily small given accuracy $\epsilon$, efficient in both zeroth-order queries (i.e., evaluations of function values) and interagent communication, and distributed terminable when the specified precision requirement is met. The key insight is to use polynomial approximations to substitute for general local objectives, distribute these approximations via average consensus, and solve an easier approximate version of the original problem. Due to the nice analytic properties of polynomials, this approximation not only facilitates efficient global optimization, but also allows the design of gradient-free iterations to reduce cumulative costs of queries and achieve geometric convergence for solving nonconvex problems. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy and complexities of the proposed algorithm.},

Under the proposed SPG algorithm, we prove that only the solutions to the minimum value of the potential game&#39;s global objective function are stochastically stable, and the covering strategies of all the players will converge with probability one to a stochastically stable state, which is beyond the general Nash equilibrium of vertex covering games in the literature. Furthermore, we estimate the convergence rate of the proposed SPG algorithm, and extensive samples with numerical examples verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SPG algorithm on a variety of representative complex networks with different scales and standard benchmarks.},

In this article, we introduce a strategy to obtain an implicit representation of a controlled invariant set for a collection of switched subsystems and construct a safety-guaranteed controller to coordinate the subsystems using the representation. Specifically, we incorporate the invariant set into a model predictive controller to guarantee safety and recursive feasibility. Since the amount of computations is independent of the number of subsystems, this approach scales to large collections of switched subsystems. We use our approach to safely control a collection of thermostatically controlled loads to provide grid balancing services. The problem includes constraints on each load&#39;s temperature and the duration it must remain in a mode after a switch and on aggregate power consumption to ensure network safety. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach outperforms benchmark strategies in terms of safety and recursive feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent decision problems are typically solved via distributed iterative algorithms, where the agents only communicate among themselves on a peer-to-peer network. Each agent usually maintains a copy of each decision variable, while agreement among the local copies is enforced via consensus protocols. Yet, each agent is often directly influenced by a small portion of the decision variables only: neglecting this sparsity results in redundancy, poor scalability with the network size, and communication and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we develop Estimation Network Design (END), a framework for the design and analysis of distributed algorithms. END algorithms can be tuned to exploit problem-specific sparsity structures, by optimally allocating copies of each variable only to a subset of agents, to improve efficiency and minimize redundancy. We illustrate the END&#39;s potential on generalized Nash equilibrium seeking under partial-decision information by designing new algorithms that can leverage the sparsity in cost functions, constraints, and aggregation values, and by relaxing the assumptions on the (directed) communication network postulated in the literature. Finally, we numerically test our methods on a unicast rate allocation problem, revealing greatly reduced communication and memory costs.},

The goal is to develop a decision-making policy for the agents that minimizes the regret, which is the expected total loss of not playing the optimal arm at each time step. Our proposed solution, restarted Bayesian online change point detection in cooperative upper confidence bound (RBO-Coop-UCB) algorithm, involves an efficient multiagent UCB algorithm as its core enhanced with a Bayesian change point detector. We also develop a simple restart decision cooperation that improves decision-making. Theoretically, we establish that the expected group regret of RBO-Coop-UCB is upper bounded by $\mathcal {O}(KNM\log T + K\sqrt{MT\log T})$, where $K$ is the number of agents, $M$ is the number of arms, and $T$ is the number of time steps.

  abstract     = {Microgrids integrated with distributed renewable energy are regarded as a crucial evolution toward economical and environmentally sustainable power systems. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading schemes are two potential strategies for mitigating carbon emissions by capturing the emitted CO$_{2}$ or trading surplus renewable energy, respectively. Hence, a collaborative energy scheduling model that combines CCU with P2P energy trading is needed under the coupling of multiple energy domains, including electricity, CO$_{2}$, and natural gas. In this article, we investigate a novel multimicrogrid framework that jointly considers CCU and P2P trading, aimed at reducing costs and mitigating carbon emissions. Correspondingly, an energy-coupled decision-interdependent multimicrogrid energy scheduling problem is developed that involves the stochastic system states, such as intermittent renewable generation and unpredictable loads. We regard each microgrid as an agent and adopt a multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm for distributing the interdependent energy scheduling actions to each agent. This algorithm can cope with the high-dimensional continuous action space and find the energy coordination policy without requiring system future statistical information. In particular, we introduce the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) mechanism, which alleviates the nonstationarity of the environment via centralized training and alleviates the curse of dimensionality via decentralized execution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint CCU-P2P energy coordination model and the CTDE-based MAPPO algorithm outperform other models in achieving economic and environmental benefits.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose the flexible subgrouping and ordering coordination (FSOC) algorithm that enables a team of robots to cooperatively convoy multiple scattered targets (MSTs) of different moving velocities, where each target is convoyed into the interior of distinct convex hulls formed by different subgroups of robots in dynamic environments. Therein, the algorithm/convoying is flexible in the sense that no specific numbers and indexes of robots are preassigned for each subgroup, and no specific spatial ordering sequences of robots are predetermined for each convex hull. To attain such a flexible convoying for scattered targets, we first encode the three subtasks of flexible subgrouping, target convergence, and neighboring collision avoidance into control barrier function constraints and then formulate the FSOC problem as a decentralized constraint-based task-execution optimization one. In particular, by embedding convoying matching conditions into hard integer constraints and soft cost functions, the robots can be divided into subgroups of flexible numbers and indexes. Then, for each subgroup of robots, the flexible-ordering convex hull for each specific target is realized through the balance between the attraction resulting from the target convergence constraints and the repulsion from time-varying collision avoidance constraints. Rigorous analysis is provided to guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop systems, which have strong nonlinear couplings due to the flexible subgrouping and ordering. Finally, extensive 2-D and 3-D simulations have been conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm across different initial positions, the robustness in the face of robot sudden breakdown and target sudden appearances, the adaptability to navigate through obstacle environments, and the scalability when accomplishing high-dimensional MST convoying missions.},

The proposed control scheme ensures that all signals within the closed-loop system remain bounded and guarantees bipartite tracking performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented approach is verified through simulation results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the constrained social cost minimization problem for heterogeneous linear multiagent systems with partial information under malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attacks for the first time. Therein, the local cost function of each agent may depend on the decision variables of all participants, and the local decision variables are constrained by the coupled constraints. Based on the output regulation technique, we design a novel distributed attack-resilient algorithm that requires only local decision and cost function information. The proposed algorithm consists of the distributed coordinators to generate the desired outputs and the reference-tracking controllers to follow the desired outputs. By means of the hybrid system method and Lyapunov stability theory, we demonstrate that with the algorithm, the outputs of agents can converge to the optimal solution when the DoS attack satisfies certain conditions. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulating a numerical example.},

Then, we tackle the problem of forcing a network of unicycles to a desired formation with the same orientation when assuming asynchronous sampled-data communication and piecewise constant controls. The design relies upon discrete-time passivity-based arguments yielding the first feedback law (within the digital literature) that employs single-rate sampling while keeping into account the effects of digital devices. The results are finally illustrated through simulations aimed at showing the benefits of the proposed controller to recover the same performance as the ones under continuous-time control law, whose performances are unavoidably lost when implemented in practice.},

Unlike the existing literature on the distributed observer, this article introduces a novel event-triggered strategy that utilizes the agents&#39; measurement error state instead of the norm of the state errors. It is theoretically and numerically demonstrated that the triggering times and communication loads among agents can be significantly reduced by using this strategy, and a positive lower bound on the triggering time interval is also computed. Furthermore, an adaptive scheme with a pinning strategy is considered to ensure output consensus with a uniform ultimate bound in the presence of false data attacks.

Compared with the existing DoS attack strategies, the increase in channel packet loss rate with the increase in energy injected by the attacker is considered. Meanwhile, the behavioral tendency of the attacker concerning the sensors with different parameters is taken into account, leveraging the additional sensing accuracy matrix. Moreover, the quantified relationship between the attacker and the remote estimator error covariance is derived, and the optimal energy allocation strategy problem is transformed into a convex optimization problem to be solved.

  abstract     = {In societal-scale infrastructures, such as electric grids or transportation networks, pricing mechanisms are often used as a way to shape users&#39; demand in order to lower operating costs and improve reliability. Existing approaches to pricing design for safety-critical networks often require that users are queried beforehand to negotiate prices, which has proven to be challenging to implement in the real world. To offer a more practical alternative, we develop learning-based pricing mechanisms that require no input from the users. These pricing mechanisms aim to maximize the utility of the users&#39; consumption by gradually estimating the users&#39; price response over a span of $T$ time steps (e.g., days) while ensuring that the infrastructure network&#39;s safety constraints that limit the users&#39; demand are satisfied at all time steps. We propose two different algorithms for the two different scenarios when: the utility function is chosen by the central coordinator to achieve a social objective, and the utility function is defined by the price response under the assumption that the users are self-interested agents. We prove that both algorithms enjoy $\tilde{\mathcal {O}} (T^{2/3})$ regret with high probability. We then apply these algorithms to demand response pricing for the smart grid and numerically demonstrate their effectiveness.},

Throughout this article, it is assumed that only a subset of subsystems can obtain information from the exosystem. First, smooth distributed observers are designed to reconstruct the system matrix and state of the exosystem, which can guarantee fixed-time convergence of the estimation errors. Then, an internal model is introduced to design a smooth distributed fixed-time observer to reconstruct the output of the exosystem, which can ensure that the estimation errors approach zero within a fixed time. Next, linearly parameterized models are utilized to model the unknown dynamics of the subsystems. A smooth observer-based adaptive controller is further developed for each subsystem using the output information from each subsystem. At the same time, fixed-time convergence of the closed-loop system is analyzed with the help of a common Lyapunov function method.

  abstract     = {This article studies cooperative control of noncooperative double-integrator multi-agent systems (MASs) with input delay on connected directed graphs in the context of a differential graphical game (DGG). In the distributed DGG, each agent seeks a distributed information control policy by optimizing an individual local performance index (PI) of distributed information from its graph neighbors. The local PI, which quadratically penalizes the agent&#39;s deviations from cooperative behavior (e.g., the consensus here), is constructed through the use of the graph Laplacian matrix. For DGGs for double-integrator MASs, the existing body of literature lacks the explicit characterization of Nash equilibrium actions and their associated state trajectories with distributed information. To address this issue, we first convert the $N$-player DGG with $m$ communication links into $m$ coupled optimal control problems, which, in turn, convert to the two-point boundary-value problem (TPBVP). We derive the explicit solutions for the TPBV that constitute the explicit distributed information expressions for Nash equilibrium actions and the state trajectories associated with them for the DGG. An illustrative example verifies the explicit solutions of local information to achieve fully distributed consensus.},

  abstract     = {Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful tool for practical network applications, including power system monitoring. Recent research works focused on developing GSP-based methods for state estimation, attack detection, and topology identification using the representation of the power system voltages as smooth graph signals. Within this framework, efficient methods have been developed for detecting false data injection (FDI) attacks, which until now were perceived as nonsmooth with respect to the graph Laplacian matrix. Consequently, these methods may not be effective against smooth FDI attacks. In this article, we propose a graph FDI (GFDI) attack that minimizes the Laplacian-based graph total variation under practical constraints. We present the GFDI attack as the solution for a nonconvex constrained optimization problem. The solution to the GFDI attack problem is obtained through approximating it using $\ell _{1}$ relaxation. A series of quadratic programming problems that are classified as convex optimization problems are solved to obtain the final solution. We then propose a protection scheme that identifies the minimal set of measurements necessary to constrain the GFDI output to a high graph TV, thereby enabling its detection by existing GSP-based detectors. Our numerical simulations on the IEEE-57 and IEEE-118 bus test cases reveal the potential threat posed by well-designed GSP-based FDI attacks. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating the proposed protection design with GSP-based detection can lead to significant hardware cost savings compared to previous designs of protection methods against FDI attacks.},

Such a problem is motivated by the fact that optimization missions are often subject to dynamical constraints and sensor malfunction. To cooperatively deal with the optimization problem for second-order multiagent systems in the absence of velocity information, we design two velocity-free distributed optimization algorithms over different communication topologies. First, for the case of the continuous communication, a fully velocity-free distributed optimization algorithm is designed by leveraging novel auxiliary dynamics, and each local cost function is just required to be convex. It is shown that all the agents are capable of achieving rendezvous on one of the optimal solutions of interest despite the absence of velocity information. Next, to relieve the communication burden, a modified velocity-free distributed optimization algorithm is designed by introducing an event-based communication mechanism, where all the local cost functions are required to be strongly convex. Particularly, a communication trigger condition is built such that the undesirable Zeno phenomenon is circumvented. Also, an adaptive gain is introduced to make the modified optimization algorithm fully distributed. Simulations are finally given to verify the optimization performance.},

In this article, we propose a mitigation approach based on authenticated network-based time synchronization. Our approach relies on the observation that a time synchronization attack can be undetectable if and only if it targets at least three time references in the power system, and such attacks need to be mitigated through appropriate security controls. We first provide a formal proof of this result, including a characterization of the degrees of freedom of the attacker in constructing an attack. We then formulate the problem of mitigating undetectable attacks at minimum cost as an integer linear program, and prove that it is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we propose two approximation algorithms based on computing shortest paths and solving a linear relaxation of the problem. Extensive simulations suggest the superiority of the proposed algorithms on IEEE benchmark power system graphs compared with baseline solutions. We report mitigation cost savings of at least 76% compared with a naive approach for mitigation and at least 30% compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

To solve the consensus problem with multiple nonconvex state constraints, we propose a distributed control algorithm for the discrete-time high-order multiagent systems and introduce time-varying scaling factors to transform the original constrained system into an equivalent time-varying one. Then, by constructing a Lyapunov function and utilizing the matrix norm of the time-varying system matrix, it is proved that consensus can be reached while the states of agents are constrained to lie in the nonconvex sets.

As such, it is possible to model the NCSs as a class of switched systems. A mode-dependent and quantization-error-dependent Lyapunov-like function is first adopted in order to conduct stability and MHP performance analysis with less conservatism. Based on the developed stability and MHP performance analysis, a set of MHP filters suitable for the controlled system is designed such that the filtering error system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable with a specified MHP performance index.

We adopt a system model that depends on the parameters through a linear fractional transformation, which can include a networked dynamic system as a special case. When an associated transfer function matrix has a full normal column rank, we establish an explicit relation between the parameters and the input–output sequence, from which a matrix rank-based necessary and sufficient condition for persistent excitation of an input sequence is derived. Based on this result, the absolute and relative sloppiness metrics that describe the sloppiness of parameter variations with frequency-domain data are extended to time-domain data, under the situation that the input sequence is persistently exciting and prescribed. Explicit formulas for computing these two metrics are also obtained. Hence, the effects of different input sequences on the sloppiness of parameter variations can be conveniently analyzed with the suggested two metrics. Finally, we illustrate our results with a discrete-time model of a typical mass-spring-damper system, where we show that the choice of input signals significantly influences the absolute and relative sloppiness metrics.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we address learning Nash equilibria in convex games under the payoff information setting. We consider the case in which the game pseudogradient is monotone but not necessarily strictly monotone. This relaxation of strict monotonicity enables application of learning algorithms to a larger class of games, such as, for example, a zero-sum game with a merely convex–concave cost function. We derive an algorithm, whose iterations provably converge to the least-norm Nash equilibrium in this setting. From the perspective of a single player using the proposed algorithm, we view the game as an instance of online optimization. Through this lens, we quantify the regret rate of the algorithm and provide an approach to choose the algorithm&#39;s parameters to minimize the regret rate.},

A channel fading model is proposed to characterize the underlying unreliable channels under the influence of signal reflection and obstacle shadows in a networked environment. Under the framework of a common sliding-mode surface, a novel sliding-mode control (SMC) mechanism is designed for the system. Subsequently, the average dwell time approach is used to construct sufficient conditions to ensure the mean-square exponential stability of networked switched system models. The state trajectory can reach the bounded sliding region and then remain unchanged. Utilizing the objective performance of optimal reachability, an effective SMC strategy is constructed by using the binary genetic algorithm, which can minimize the sliding region by identifying the ideal sliding gain.

The random switching signal of a communication topology is governed by a time-homogeneous Markov process, whose state corresponds to the possible communication topology. In addition, cooperative and antagonistic interactions among agents are considered simultaneously. First, under the assumption that the union topology of signed switching topologies contains a directed spanning tree, the observer is proposed by introducing an adaptive gain to achieve the observation of the leader&#39;s position in a fully distributed framework, which is known to only a small number of followers. Then, the fully distributed controller is designed based on the observation of the leader&#39;s position. Moreover, several mild conditions and strict proofs are given to guarantee that multiple agents can actualize and retain a predefined formation configuration, and part of the followers tracks the leader&#39;s trajectory, while the others track the leader&#39;s symmetric trajectory.

The players lack an explicit model of the game and can only learn their actions based on the sole available feedback of payoff values. In addition, they cannot directly access the aggregate term that contains global information, while each player shares information with its neighbors without revealing its own strategy. We present a novel no-regret learning algorithm named distributed online gradient descent with residual bandit. In the algorithm, each player maintains a local estimate of the aggregate and adaptively adjusts its next action through the residual bandit mechanism and the online gradient descent method. We first provide regret analysis for aggregative games where the player-specific problem is convex, showing crucial associations between the regret bound, network connectivity, and game structure. Then, we prove that when the game is also strictly monotone, the action sequence generated by the algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium almost surely.

Nodes may be both consumers and producers of sensed information. Consumers express interest in information about particular locations, e.g., obstructed regions and/or road intersections, while producers broadcast updates on what they are currently able to see. Accordingly, we introduce and explore optimizing tradeoffs between the coverage and the space-time interest weighted average “age” of the information available to consumers. We consider two settings that capture the fundamental character of the problem. The first addresses selecting a subset of producers that maximizes the coverage of the consumers preferred regions and minimizes the average age of these regions given that producers provide updates at a fixed rate. The second addresses the minimization of the interest weighted average age achieved by a fixed subset of producers with possibly overlapping coverage by optimizing their update rates. The first problem is shown to be submodular and, thus, amenable to greedy optimization, while the second has a nonconvex/nonconcave cost function, which is amenable to effective optimization using the Frank–Wolfe algorithm. Numerical results exhibit the benefits of context-dependent optimization information sharing among obstructed sensing nodes.},

  abstract     = {We analyze two locational marginal pricing schemes in electricity markets derived from an economic dispatch (ED) problem with ac power flow equations that define a nonconvex feasible set. The first among these prices called ac locational marginal prices (AC-LMPs) is derived from Lagrange multipliers that satisfy Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions for stationarity/local optimality of the nonconvex ED problem. The second, called SDP-LMPs, is derived from optimal dual multipliers of the semidefinite programming (SDP)-based convex relaxation of the ED problem. We establish that AC-LMPs and SDP-LMPs are derived from Lagrange dual-equivalent problems. Hence, they coincide under a zero duality gap but may not be equal when the gap is nonzero or when the AC-LMPs are associated with a stationary/locally optimal, but not globally optimal, dispatch. SDP-LMPs share interesting parallels with convex hull prices (CHPs), being derived from the Lagrangian dual of the nonconvex ED problem. However, there are important differences. For example, the epigraphs of the SDP relaxation of the ED problem and the latter, parameterized by the nodal power demands, may not enjoy the relationship that CHPs satisfy and derive their name from. Also, while CHPs minimize a form of side-payments, SDP-LMPs may not. We prove that AC-LMPs (and SDP-LMPs under zero duality gap) guarantee revenue adequacy under a condition that is sufficient but not necessary. Finally, the SDP-LMPs are shown to be equal to SOCP-DLMPs, which are distribution locational marginal prices derived with second-order cone programming-based relaxations of power flow equations over radial distribution networks. We illustrate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a distributed coupling chance-constraint optimization (3CO) problem under unknown uncertainty distributions is studied. An auxiliary variable is employed to assist decoupling and deterministic transformation, such that the coupling chance constraint is equivalent to a coupling equality constraint and a class of deterministic inequality constraints. Since deterministic inequality constraints are related to the inverse cumulative density functions (ICDFs) of unknown uncertainty distributions, a data-based approach is proposed for the approximations related to ICDFs by the law of large numbers. For the sake of storing sampling data, a tree-based data structure is built, in which it is convenient to insert new data, expand the depth and width, and query the corresponding approximations. Though the approximations of ICDFs are monotonous, piecewise, and globally nonconvex, there exists a locally convex property in the small enough neighborhoods of almost all the points. Thus, inspired by this perspective, a distributed optimization strategy is designed for the 3CO problem. By setting appropriate parameters, the stability and convergence of the strategy are guaranteed, and optimality is just influenced by the approximation ability of the tree-based data structure. Finally, some simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

This idea facilitates arbitrarily precise global optimization without requiring local evaluations of gradients at every iteration. Nonetheless, there remains a gap between existing guarantees and practical requirements, e.g., privacy preservation and robustness to network imperfections. To fill this gap and keep the above strengths, we propose a private and robust Chebyshev-proxy-based distributed optimization algorithm (PR-CPOA). Specifically, to ensure both the accuracy of solutions and the privacy of local objectives, we design a new privacy-preserving mechanism. This mechanism leverages the randomness in blockwise insertions of perturbed vector states and, hence, provides a stronger privacy guarantee in the scope of ( $\alpha,\beta$ )-data-privacy. Furthermore, to gain robustness against network imperfections, we use the push-sum consensus protocol as a backbone and discuss its specific enhancements. Thanks to the purely consensus-type iterations, we avoid the privacy-accuracy tradeoff and are spared from selecting proper step sizes in different settings. We rigorously analyze the accuracy, privacy, and complexity of the proposed algorithm. We show that the advantages brought by introducing polynomial approximation are maintained when all the above requirements exist.},

  abstract     = {With advances in interprocessing-unit communication technology, distributed algorithms are becoming increasingly advantageous. This article focuses on solving convex distributed optimization problems with local consensus coupling constraints via the alternating direction method of multipliers, by means of an asynchronous methodology allowing for communication delays. We use a bipartite undirected graph to denote the update structure of the processing agents that cooperatively perform the distributed algorithm without a centralized aggregator. We introduce a data server to exchange the asynchronous consensus data among the processing agents. Under certain technical assumptions that involve bounded delays, bounded step sizes, and strong convexities in parts of the local objectives, the running average of the local iterates generated by the proposed asynchronous algorithm converges to an optimal solution.},

Then, this article proves that the sensor network will be driven to a neighborhood of optimal positions if the sensors&#39; interaction ranges are larger than a given threshold.

Decentralized control systems are particularly vulnerable since they rely heavily on network communication to achieve their goals. To address network vulnerabilities, we present an event-triggered network connection and communication protocol that minimizes the amount of time agents are connected to the network, reducing the window of opportunity for attacks. This mechanism is a function of only local information and ensures stability for the overall system in attack-free scenarios. Our approach distinguishes itself from current decentralized event-triggered control strategies by considering an undirected and connected communication graph and by not assuming that agents are always connected to the network to receive critical information from other agents. An algorithm describing this network connection and communication protocol is provided, and our approach is illustrated via simulation.},

The appearance of diffusion and time delay may lead to Turing instability and Hopf bifurcation, respectively, which are two significant features for the spread of malicious viruses in CPS. Therefore, understanding the evolution mechanism of malicious virus propagation and controlling its Turing instability and Hopf bifurcation are the overriding problems of paramount importance in CPS. However, studies on control of Turing instability and Hopf bifurcation for time-delay reaction-diffusion systems have not been reported. We first propose a proportional derivative (PD) feedback control program, which provides strategic guidance for the prediction and control of malware spread. The specific conditions of Turing instability and Hopf bifurcation are constructed. The stability and direction of Hopf bifurcation are explored for the controlled malicious virus propagation model. It is proven that the objective of suppressing Turing instability and regulating Hopf bifurcation is successfully accomplished through the PD control scheme.

In this setting, a novel distributed online learning algorithm based on mirror descent and primal-dual approaches is devised to seek the generalized Nash equilibrium of the considered games.

  abstract     = {Accurate local state measurement is important to ensure the reliable operation of distributed multiagent systems (MASs). Existing fault-tolerant control strategies generally assume the sensor faults to be bounded and uncorrelated. In this article, we study the ramifications of allowing the sensor attack injections to be unbounded and correlated. These malicious sensor attacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the cooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS. Moreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and manipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient containment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of correlated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator attacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve the bounded containment performance. Compared to existing literature addressing bounded faults and/or disturbances that are unintentionally caused in the sensor and actuator channels, the proposed control protocols are resilient against unknown and unbounded attack signals simultaneously, injected into the sensor and actuator channels, and, hence, more practical in real-world security applications. A numerical example illustrates the efficacy of the proposed result by highlighting the resilience improvement over the conventional cooperative control method.},

Under this framework, augmented Markovian auxiliary system and augmented linear auxiliary system are, respectively, constructed, serving as pivotal bridges to derive the sufficient and necessary criteria for finite-time weak (respectively, strong) controllability of SLCNs with SIT-RS. Furthermore, the above criteria are optimized when considering the cases without isolated pairs. Besides, a reduced Markovian auxiliary system (RMAS) is established via deleting isolated pairs iteratively.

Considering that the communication among agents could be jammed by the DoS attacks irregularly, a novel resilient control protocol with a switching feedback gain is first developed for the structurally balanced topology, so that all agents will switch to the secure control mode when the system is attacked by DoS attacks. In order to reduce the energy consumption of the system and avoid continuous communication among agents, an event-triggered scheme based on the state estimator is also introduced in the protocol design, where the Zeno behavior is excluded naturally by setting a strictly positive minimum event interval. Based on the developed event-triggered resilient control protocol, sufficient conditions on the frequency and duration of DoS attacks are established to ensure the realization of bipartite consensus for the MASs. Furthermore, the event-triggered resilient control protocol is extended for agents to achieve bipartite consensus under the structurally unbalanced topology by introducing a pinning control strategy.

The emerging autonomous transportation technology has the potential to alleviate these issues, but the decisions of profit-maximizing operators running large autonomous fleets could negatively impact other stakeholders and the transportation system. An analysis of these tradeoffs requires modeling the modes of transportation in a unified framework. In this article, we propose such a framework, which allows us to study the interplay among mobility service providers (MSPs), public transport authorities, and customers. Our framework combines a graph-theoretic network model for the transportation system with a game-theoretic market model in which MSPs are profit maximizers while customers select individually optimal transportation options. We apply our framework to data for the city of Berlin and present sensitivity analyses to study parameters that MSPs or municipalities can strategically influence. We show that autonomous ride-hailing systems may cannibalize a public transportation system, serving between 7% and 80% of all customers, depending on market conditions and policy restrictions.},

  abstract     = {In response to newly found security vulnerabilities, or as part of a moving target defense, a fast and safe control software update scheme for networked control systems is highly desirable. We here develop such a scheme for intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) in power distribution systems, which is a solution to the so-called software update rollout problem. This problem seeks to minimize the makespan of the software rollout, while guaranteeing safety in voltage and current at all buses and lines despite possible worst case update failure, where malfunctioning IEDs may inject harmful amounts of power into the system. Based on the nonlinear DistFlow equations, we derive linear relations relating software update decisions to the worst case voltages and currents, leading to a decision model both tractable and more accurate than previous models based on the popular linearized DistFlow equations. Under reasonable protection assumptions, the rollout problem can be formulated as a vector bin-packing problem, and instances can be built and solved using scalable computations. Using realistic benchmarks including one with 10,476 buses, we demonstrate that the proposed method can generate safe and effective rollout schedules in real time.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel model-free event-triggered method considering the distributed quadratic index is proposed for the containment control problem of discrete-time linear multiagent systems (MASs). To save computational resources and improve control efficiency, a triggering threshold function is designed for each agent based on the distributed performance function. The control protocol of each agent is updated only when the Euclidean norm of the triggering error exceeds the threshold. In order to obtain the model-free event-triggered control solution, an online actor–critic framework is established to approximate the event-triggered control protocol and performance function of each agent. It is proved that the containment error of MASs is asymptotically stable under the action of the designed event-triggered condition, and the weight estimation errors of actor–critic neural networks are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, numerical simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Furthermore, the accelerated algorithm enjoys a convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{t^{2}})$ by adjusting the auxiliary parameters adaptively.

Optimal management of such fleets entails large-scale optimization problems which can be dealt with in a hierarchical manner by clustering together individual devices into fleets. Based on recent results characterizing the set of aggregate demand profiles of a heterogeneous fleet of charging devices, an exact aggregate model is proposed to achieve optimality, in a unit commitment problem, by adopting a simplified formulation with a number of constraints for the fleet that scales linearly in the number of time-slots and is independent of the size of the fleet. This is remarkable, as it shows that under suitable conditions, a heterogeneous fleet of any size can effectively be treated as a single storage unit.},

Moreover, we provide a threshold under a global DoS attack that guarantees the mean-square consensus of the NMAS under consideration, which is dependent on the topology and subsystem parameters.

First, the $AB$ /push–pull (ABPP) gradient-based algorithm is considered, which employs row- and column-stochastic weights simultaneously to track the optimal decision and the gradient of the global cost function, ensuring consensus on the optimal decision. Building on this algorithm, we then develop a general algorithm that incorporates acceleration techniques, such as heavy-ball momentum and Nesterov momentum, as well as their combination with nonidentical momentum parameters. Previous literature has established the effectiveness of acceleration methods for various gradient-based distributed algorithms and demonstrated linear convergence for static directed communication networks. In contrast, we focus on time-varying directed communication networks and establish the linear convergence of the methods to the optimal solution, when the agents&#39; cost functions are smooth and strongly convex. In addition, we provide explicit bounds for the step-size value and momentum parameters, based on the properties of the cost functions, the mixing matrices, and the graph connectivity structures. Our numerical results illustrate the benefits of the proposed acceleration techniques on the ABPP algorithm.},

Ample studies have shown that controlling a small fraction of AVs can smooth traffic flow and mitigate traffic congestion. However, deploying AVs in real-world systems poses challenges due to safety and cost concerns. A viable alternative approach that can be implemented in the near future is coarse-grained guidance , where human drivers are guided by real-time instructions, updated every $\Delta$ s, to stabilize the traffic. While previous theoretical studies consider stability analysis for continuous AV control, this article presents the first integrated theoretical analysis that directly relates the guidance provided to the human drivers to the traffic flow stability outcome. Casting the problem into the Lyapunov stability framework, this study derives sufficient conditions for coarse-grained guidance with hold length $\Delta$ to stabilize the system and provides extensions of the analysis to incorporate additional human driving behaviors, such as magnitude error and reaction delay. Numerical simulations reveal that the theoretical analysis closely matches simulated results. The analysis further offers insights into the relationship between system parameter and stability criteria and can be leveraged to design improved controllers with greater maximum hold length.},

However, its deployment in real-world power systems has been hindered by a lack of explicit stability and safety guarantees. In this article, we propose a stability-constrained RL method for real-time implementation of voltage control that guarantees system stability both during policy learning and deployment of the learned policy. The key idea underlying our approach is an explicitly constructed Lyapunov function that leads to a sufficient structural condition for stabilizing policies, i.e., monotonically decreasing policies guarantee stability. We incorporate this structural constraint with RL, by parameterizing each local voltage controller using a monotone neural network, thus ensuring the stability constraint is satisfied by design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both single-phase and three-phase IEEE test feeders, where the proposed method can reduce the transient control cost by more than 26.7% and shorten the voltage recovery time by 23.6% on average compared to the widely used linear policy, while always achieving voltage stability. In contrast, standard RL methods often fail to achieve voltage stability.},

The MG contains sources of distributed generation, such as microturbines and renewable energy sources as well as energy storage systems (ESSs). We formulate the load restoration task as a nonconvex optimization problem. This problem embodies the physics of the MG by leveraging a branch flow model while incorporating salient phenomena in islanded MGs, such as the need for internal frequency regulation and complementarity requirements arising in ESS operations. Since the formulated optimization problem is nonconvex, we introduce a convex relaxation that can be solved through model predictive control as a baseline method. However, in order to solve the problem considering its full nonconvexity, we leverage a policy-learning method called constrained policy optimization, a tailored version of which is used as our proposed algorithm.

The existing results lack systematic obstacle-avoidance trajectory planning approaches such that the robots potentially fall in the unexpected equilibriums and cannot reach the global optimal solution. To address it, a safe reference trajectory planning approach is first designed by online projecting the unsafe part of the existing distributed optimization trajectory into the peripheral boundary of the obstacle region.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the multisensor power allocation (MSPA) problem for remote state estimation in cyber-physical systems. Multiple sensors observe different linear time-invariant processes and send their estimates to the remote estimator over semi-Markov fading channels (SMFCs). The probability of successful data transmission depends on the SMFC state and the transmission power used by the sensor. We focus on how to allocate the power of sensors to tradeoff the remote estimation error and transmission cost. First, in the framework of the Markov decision process, the double-threshold structure of the optimal MSPA strategy with respect to the age-of-information state and the SMFC state is derived, which significantly reduces the computational complexity. Then, the necessary and sufficient condition of guaranteeing remote terminal stability is given from the probabilistic sense, which is related to system parameters, channel parameters, and packet dropout rate. Finally, a simulation example is provided to verify theoretical results.},

With the purpose of reducing the updating frequency of the control signal, an auxiliary dynamical variable is generated to construct the dynamic event-triggering mechanism by which the triggering instants can be delicately determined for each agent to broadcast the information to its neighbors. Under the intergroup balance condition, the distributed consensus control protocols are designed by taking advantage of the related state of the agent (in each subgroup) to its neighbors and leader. By using the Lyapunov direct approach and combining it with the properties of Caputo-type calculus, some sufficient criteria are derived in an easy-to-use form for ensuring the global Mittag–Leffler stability of the consensus error system. The Zeno phenomenon is also excluded from the proposed triggering mechanism. At last, an illustrative example and its simulations are given to show the validity of the theoretical results.},

Under the differential inclusion framework, a continuous-time distributed algorithm with a derivative feedback term is proposed. Benefiting from this algorithm, each player is assigned several auxiliary variables to share with its neighbors and estimate the aggregate function, so that the important information such as cost functions, constraints, and decisions are privatized.

This article presents two sliding mode control strategies to achieve synchronization in a complex-valued neural network (CVNN). The former simplifies an already existing technique that splits the control into real and imaginary parts. The latter extends a fully complex-valued sliding approach for generic complex-valued dynamical systems to the multi-input–multi-output case, and shows its efficiency and higher performance in terms of finite reaching time in the synchronization of CVNNs.

Specifically, a vector-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is utilized to save communication resources, and it can exclude Zeno behavior effectively. Since the effect of CF is considered, the additional controllers do not work in some time domains, thus resulting in the classical finite-time stability theorem being invalid. By developing new analysis methods and constructing novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs), some sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure the FTSyn. Note that the proposed LKFs are designed by introducing some free vectors and, as a result, the obtained criteria are termed by vector inequities, which are less conservative than the algebraic one. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and design methods is demonstrated by two simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning is an attractive approach to learn good resource allocation and scheduling policies based on data when the system model is unknown. However, the cumulative regret of most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms scales as $\tilde{O}\left(\mathsf {S} \sqrt{\mathsf {A} T}\right)$ , where $\mathsf {S}$ is the size of the state space, $\mathsf {A}$ is the size of the action space, $T$ is the horizon, and the $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ notation hides logarithmic terms. Due to the linear dependence on the size of the state space, these regret bounds are prohibitively large for resource allocation and scheduling problems. In this article, we present a model-based RL algorithm for such problems which has scalable regret. In particular, we consider a restless bandit model, and propose a Thompson-sampling-based learning algorithm which is tuned to the underlying structure of the model. We present two characterizations of the regret of the proposed algorithm with respect to the Whittle index policy. First, we show that for a restless bandit with $n$ arms and at most $m$ activations at each time, the regret scales either as $\tilde{O}\left(mn\sqrt{T}\right)$ or $\tilde{O}\left(n^{2} \sqrt{T}\right)$ depending on the reward model. Second, under an additional technical assumption, we show that the regret scales as $\tilde{O}\left(n^{1.5} \sqrt{T}\right)$ or $\tilde{O}\left(\max \lbrace m\sqrt{n}, n\rbrace \sqrt{T}\right)$ .

Switching signals governing the active subsystem (mode) are frequently changing, which brings challenges to the exact reconstruction of network sequences, since the state trajectory is generated by a number of subsystems at different time periods. By analyzing unobservable subspaces associated with each subsystem, we first establish necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the identifiability of SDNs under different levels of knowledge on the switching signal. Building on this, a sufficient identification condition is developed leveraging coupled Lyapunov-transpose matrix equations constructed by state trajectories with properly designed time offsets, which allows us to design a data-based approach that can exactly recover the whole network sequence, even if the switching signal is unknown a priori. More important, we develop sharper conditions for both identifiability and identification when there is certain prior knowledge available on networks. Numerical experiments on switching consensus networks and sparse networks are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

First, we solve a generalized covering set problem and run a combinatorial algorithm to compute an approximate solution. Then, we compute approximation bounds by solving a nonlinear set packing problem. To evaluate our solution approach, we implement two classical solution methods based on column generation and multiplicative weights updates, and test them on real-world water distribution and power systems.

  abstract     = {In the actual system, data loss is inevitable and occurs randomly due to transmission obstacles, node faults, network congestion, etc. This article mainly investigates the set stabilization of switched Boolean control networks (SBCNs) with missing data by using the semitensor product (STP) method. In order to solve the problem of random data loss, a new augmented system is constructed. Next, according to the augmented system, a sufficient and necessary condition about the set stability of switched Boolean networks (SBNs) with missing data is proposed. Then, by using the splitting technique of the matrix, the detailed design method of the event-triggered controller is given for the set stabilization of the considered SBCNs. In addition, the application in consensus of switched finite-field networks (SFFNs) with missing data is explored. Finally, two examples are provided to validate the theoretical results of this article.},

  abstract     = {Congestion pricing has long been hailed as a means to mitigate traffic congestion; however, its practical adoption has been limited due to the resulting social inequity issue, e.g., low-income users are priced out off certain roads. This issue has spurred interest in the design of equitable mechanisms that aim to refund the collected toll revenues as lump-sum transfers to users. Although revenue refunding has been extensively studied for over three decades, there has been no thorough characterization of how such schemes can be designed to simultaneously achieve system efficiency and equity objectives. In this article, we bridge this gap through the study of congestion pricing and revenue refunding (CPRR) schemes in nonatomic congestion games. We first develop CPRR schemes, which, in comparison to the untolled case, simultaneously increase system efficiency without worsening wealth inequality, while being user-favorable: irrespective of their initial wealth or values of time (which may differ across users), users would experience a lower travel cost after the implementation of the proposed scheme. We then characterize the set of optimal user-favorable CPRR schemes that simultaneously maximize system efficiency and minimize wealth inequality. Finally, we provide a concrete methodology for computing optimal CPRR schemes and also highlight additional equilibrium properties of these schemes under different models of user behavior. Overall, our work demonstrates that through appropriate refunding policies, we can design user-favorable CPRR schemes that maximize system efficiency while reducing wealth inequality.},

Assuming that the network is comprised of nearly homogeneous subsystems, each subcontroller is trained by the local state and input information from its corresponding subsystem and filtered information from its neighbors. Thus, the costs of both learning and control become independent of the number of subsystems. We show the optimality and convergence of the algorithm for the case when the individual subsystems are identical, based on an algebraic property of such networks. Thereafter, we show the robustness of the algorithm when applied to general heterogeneous networks. The effectiveness of the design is investigated through numerical simulations.},

The restriction on the domain of mild solution is removed, which also makes the contraction coefficient less conservative due to the use of mild Itô’s formula. Then, the criteria for achieving exponential synchronization of infinite-dimensional stochastic systems are obtained with the assistance of graph theory and the Lyapunov method. These criteria are related to a network topology and an average impulsive interval. Finally, the theoretical results are applied to a class of multilink bidirectional associative memory neural networks with reaction–diffusion, and several numerical simulations are given.},

The attackers are assumed to adversely impact data integrity and privacy by: 1) injecting unknown bounded exogenous signals to actuators and 2) eavesdropping on the physical states of followers. To mitigate the adverse effects of such attacks on the consensus, privacy, and stability of leader–follower systems, we develop a resilient cooperative control system by introducing virtual states interconnected with the physical states in such a way that the leader–follower consensus is guaranteed under unknown false data injection cyber-attacks. The dynamics of the virtual states act as a dynamical output mask, which maps the physical states of followers to some virtual states that are exchanged via a communication network. A Lyapunov-based design framework is proposed to guarantee stability and the leader–follower consensus against cyber-attacks. The decentralized design of the control variables in the proposed resilient cooperative control approach facilitates creating a plug-and-play environment, where follower nodes can easily be plugged in/out. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is evaluated using several numerical examples and implementation on a planar robot experimental testbed.},

We thus characterize the notion of coevolution of the market and the network dynamics and derive dissipativity-based conditions leading to a pertinent notion of equilibrium. We then focus on the control design and adopt the light-touch policy to incentivize or penalize the service providers as little as possible , while steering the networked system to a desirable outcome.

When each follower cannot unilaterally change its state to reduce the objective function, the followers reach the dynamic Nash equilibrium, and the formation is achieved in the meantime. Specifically, the resulting formation geometry depends on the dynamic Nash equilibrium. Considering the single- and double-integrator dynamics in the form of Newton&#39;s second law, some strategies are proposed to seek the dynamic Nash equilibrium. Based on the Lyapunov analysis technique, it is proved that the states of all followers converge exponentially to the dynamic Nash equilibrium point.

It can be phrased as the absence of so-called dilations in the directed graph representing the system. Starting from dilations in the graph of a system without control, input vertices and edges can be added such that these dilations are removed. Their presence can be investigated by searching for minimal dilations, and by combining them into larger ones, leading to the recently introduced notion of dilation choice set. However, from a computational point of view, this searching for minimal dilations is not efficient as their number may grow rapidly. For this reason, in this article, first a fundamental decomposition of the related bipartite graph is recalled. The decomposition, called the Dumage–Mendelsohn decomposition, can be obtained by well-known and efficient methods. With the decomposition, the dilations can be found and removed in a straightforward way, making sure that the rank condition for structural controllability is fulfilled. Using a refined version of the decomposition, this process can even be refined. Finally, the relevance of vertices and edges for the removal of dilations can be characterized.},

It is well known that adding physical watermarks into cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is an effective way to combat malicious attacks. However, the classical ways to adding physical watermarks are based on time, which leads to great decreases in linear–quadratic Gaussian (LQG) performances while increasing detection rates. To deal with the performance loss after adding physical watermarks, an event-based physical watermark is designed to detect replay attacks. A stochastic event scheduler based on the innovation sequence is constructed to indicate adding physical watermarks or not. It is shown that the probability of adding physical watermarks will rise if the system is under attacks. Based on the frequency of adding watermarks, a count detector is proposed, which provides lower memory and computational cost. LQG performance and detection rates of a $\chi ^{2}$ detector are further characterized. Herein, it is formally proved that the event-based independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) watermark is more efficient than the time-based i.i.d. watermark. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal parameters to enlarge detection performance in certain conditions. Finally, some simulations are given to show the superiority of our proposed event-based physical watermark.},

Then, a novel dual-rate-sampled AET scheme is adopted to orchestrate individual transmitting order of slow and fast TCs, respectively, by which we, as the first attempt, construct the AET security control framework. An $\varepsilon$ -dependent switched Lyapunov function is designed to accomplish the security control task for the specified TTSCPSs, such that the closed-loop system acquires a prescribed $H_{\infty }$ index in the simultaneous existence of external disturbances and hybrid attacks. Furthermore, within the established design framework, the desired switched observer gain is quantized by solving the proposed criteria in the form of linear matrix inequalities, while the possible numerical stiffness is also averted.

In comparison with existing works, we solve the event-triggered output regulation problem exactly instead of practically, that is, the tracking error of the system tends to zero asymptotically instead of some neighborhood of the origin. To solve the problem, based on the internal model, we convert the exact event-triggered robust output regulation problem into an event-triggered robust stabilization problem. We further develop an output-based dynamic event-triggered control law and a dynamic triggering mechanism. Then, a rigorous proof is provided to show that the exact robust output regulation problem can be solved by the proposed event-triggered control law, and the Zeno behavior can be excluded strictly. Finally, our main result is illustrated by providing a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Interarea oscillation is a major problem in modern interconnected power systems (ICPSs). It can be eliminated using a wide-area damping controller (WADC). It is well known that a wide-area signal is very effective as a feedback signal for the WADC to mitigate the interarea oscillation of an interconnected power system. Wide-area measurement systems (WAMS) are very useful to collect the wide-area signal, but communication delay and communication failure can occur at any time in WAMS using communication channels and can deteriorate the effectiveness of the WADC. A WADC that is resilient to communication failure is demonstrated in this work, contemplating transmission latency in the communication network and saturation of the actuator. The control action is developed using state feedback action, and a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based condition is derived as the necessary condition to achieve stability in the power system. A supplementary damping controller (SDC) is used as the controller of a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC). The role of the actuator and WADC is taken by TCSC and SDC, respectively. The control algorithm ensures that the SDC supplies sufficient damping to enhance the small signal stability of the power system. The efficacy of the developed control algorithm is tested using an 11-bus system and an IEEE 39-bus power system.},

The model shows that the evolution of human beliefs can be approximated by a nonlinear diffusion–drift equation, in which systematic psychological biases contribute to drift , whereas other random influences contribute to diffusion . The nonlinear formulation predicts a growth in polarization that is attributable to increasing information production and sharing . While the core contribution is analytical, an anecdotal model parameter fitting empirical data is also presented. Specifically, we show that our model closely predicts the changing and increasingly polarized distribution of ideology of members of the US congress over the last quarter century (taken as an approximate proxy for shifts in the US population ideology), when we take the mobile-phone penetration curve as a proxy for the democratization of information access. The model suggests that escaping the polarizing forces in the age of information access may be an uphill battle.},

To simultaneously achieve formation configuration for leaders and accomplish containment behavior for followers, adaptive distributed formation and containment control schemes are developed. In the control framework design, the neural-network control technique is utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics. The update frequency and computation resources of the controllers are reduced by dynamic triggering mechanisms. It is proved that no agent exhibits the Zeno behavior on the time-varying asymmetric communication topology. Moreover, no prior knowledge of global information is needed in controller and triggering mechanism implementations. All system parameters can be easily and flexibly chosen.

First of all, combined with information fusion, in terms of collision avoidance and communication restrictions between robots, the source localization issue can be addressed by solving a path planning one with constraints for cooperative swarm robots, which is transformed into an unconstrained one by an information penalty policy. Second, after a quantum potential well is coupled, two pairs of average estimators and minimum estimators are introduced into swarm evolutionary mechanisms with a knowledge-driven protocol and an adjustable oscillation weight, and the distributed quantum-inspired guidance (DQIG) strategy as a guidance scheme is proposed to drive the robots toward the plume source. Subsequently, we put forth a formation behavior consisting of leader–follower mechanisms, obstacle avoidance mechanisms, motion optimization mechanisms and target encircling mechanisms, which not only provides a practical collision/obstacle measure, but also increases the coverage area for the target. Afterward, a performance analysis for the proposed policy is executed on the convergence and computational complexity, which ensures the accuracy and timeliness of the source localization in theory. Ultimately, simulation verification is carried out, and the results validate the practicability and effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant economic and ecological effects, a higher level of renewable energy generation leads to increased uncertainty and variability in power injections, thus compromising grid reliability. To improve power grid security, we investigate a joint chance-constrained (CC) dc approximation of the ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The problem aims to find economically optimal power generation while guaranteeing that all power generation, line flows, and voltages remain within their bounds at the same time with a predefined probability. Unfortunately, the CC-dc-OPF problem is computationally intractable even if the distribution of renewables&#39; fluctuations is specified. Moreover, existing approximate solutions to the joint CC OPF problem are overly conservative and computationally demanding and, therefore, have less value for the operational practice. This article proposes an importance sampling approach for constructing an efficient and reliable scenario approximation for CC-dc-OPF with theoretical guarantees on the number of samples required, which yields better sample complexity and accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm efficiently reduces the number of scenarios by generating and using only a few most important, thus enabling real-time solutions for test cases with up to several hundred buses.},

In this model, because the feasible strategy set is composed of infinite-dimensional functions and is not compact, it is hard to seek a BNE in a noncompact set and convey such complex strategies in network communication. To this end, we give a two-step design. One is a discretization step, where we discretize continuous types and prove that the BNE of the discretized model is an approximate BNE of the continuous model with an explicit error bound. The other is a communication step, where we adopt a novel compression scheme with a designed sparsification rule and prove that agents can obtain unbiased estimations through the compressed communication. Based on the two steps, we propose a distributed communication-efficient algorithm to practically seek an approximate BNE, and further provide the convergence analysis and explicit error bounds.},

The topology switching law obeys a Markovian stochastic process, where the transition probability is not totally known. To save limited communication resources, a novel adaptive smoothing event-triggered mechanism (ASETM) is proposed to manage data transmission in sensor networks that contain smooth-processed historical data and a dynamic triggering threshold. The developed ASETM benefits from smoothing the transmitted data to avoid certain unexpected triggering events, such as system jitter and large random noise. The sufficient conditions for the existence of the estimator are given in terms of recursive matrix inequalities, which guarantee that the filter error system meets both ${H_\infty }$ performance and envelope constraints. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed estimation approach.},

However, most of the existing works focus on the deterministic networked systems. Because of the highly hybrid dynamic nature of the stochastic networked control systems (NCSs) under coordinated DoS and FDI attacks, it is a very challenging problem to consider FDI attack estimation and DoS-resilience control of the stochastic NCSs simultaneously. To tackle this issue, this article presents a piecewise extended observer-based control framework of stochastic NCSs subject to both DoS and FDI attacks. This simplifies the observer error system modeling of the attacked stochastic NCSs with immeasurable states in the presence of DoS attacks and FDI attacks, thus reducing the difficulty of observer-based resilient controller design. An attack-parameter-dependent time-varying stochastic Lyapunov function is introduced to analyze the mean square exponential stability of the resultant error system, and a codesign method of a piecewise extended observer gain and $L_{2}$ controller gain is proposed as well. Finally, simulation studies on an aircraft system are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The QTS is constructed to preserve the complete probabilistic transition information of the original SFFN and has a comparatively smaller network scale. First, with respect to the initial partition of the state set, we obtain the smallest QTS by calculating the coarsest equivalence relation. Then, the stability relationship between SFFN and its corresponding QTS is explored. In particular, the smallest QTS corresponding to a synchronous $n$ -node SFFN has no greater than $n+1$ nodes. This formal simplicity gives a solid foundation for the subsequent research. Moreover, we establish a visualization interface “quotient generator” to obtain the quotients for any SFFN. After that, we explore the necessary and sufficient conditions for the set stability in distribution and the finite-time set stability with probability one of the SFFNs based on the QTS. Finally, an example concerning a 27-state SFFN is presented to demonstrate the theoretical results, indicating that its synchronization analysis can be completely characterized by the stability of a 4-node QTS. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among the number of iterations to obtain the smallest QTS, the number of nodes in the obtained QTS, and the types of SFFNs.},

In this article, we study the problem of safety verification of UAM schedules in the face of vertiport closures. We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a given UAM schedule to be safe in the sense that if a vertiport closure occurs, then all UAVs will be able to safely land at a backup landing site. We then extend these results to the scenario of multiple vertiport closures. Next, we convert these conditions into an efficient algorithm for verifying the safety of a UAM schedule via a linear program by using the properties of totally unimodular matrices. Our algorithm allows for uncertain travel time between UAM vertiports and scales quadratically with the number of scheduled UAVs. We demonstrate our algorithm on a UAM network with up to 1000 UAVs.},

We then focus on (strategic form) games and propose a concept of separability for a game with respect to a forward directed hypergraph (FDH-graph). This notion refines and generalizes that of the graphical game and is invariant with respect to strategic equivalence. We show that every game is separable with respect to a minimal FDH-graph.

The proposed algorithm and the derived stability results outperform the previous related works in two aspects. First, while previous works consider the additive noise on the measured edge weight as the perturbation, in this article, we consider a general perturbation such that the edge weight is bounded and time-varying. Moreover, we consider quantization effects on the communication channels. Second, by using a Lyapunov-based small-gain theorem, we prove the global exponential input-to-state stability of the proposed algorithm under perturbations, implying its global exponential stability without perturbations and quantization effects while previous works only give global asymptotic stability or regional exponential stability results of theirs. Simulations are provided to verify the validity of our results.},

In the proposed game-theoretic setting, individuals choose whether to adopt protection or not based on the tradeoff between the cost of adopting protection and the risk of infection; the latter depends on the current epidemic prevalence and the fraction of individuals who adopt protection in the population. We define the coupled epidemic-behavioral dynamics by modeling the evolution of individual protection adoption behavior according to the replicator dynamics. For the SIS epidemic, we fully characterize the equilibria and their stability properties. We further analyze the coupled dynamics under timescale separation when individual behavior evolves faster than the epidemic, and characterize the equilibria of the resulting discontinuous hybrid system for both SIS and SIRI models. Numerical results illustrate how the coupled dynamics exhibits oscillatory behavior and convergence to sliding mode solutions in suitable parameter regimes.},

We define the upper bound on all possible languages that can be generated by the supervised system to investigate the safety supervisory control problem under cyberattacks. After introducing CA-controllability and CA-observability, we prove that the supervisory control problem under cyberattacks is solvable if and only if the given specification language is CA-controllable and CA-observable. Furthermore, we obtain methods to calculate the state estimates under sensor attacks and to synthesize a state-estimate-based supervisor to achieve a given safety specification under cyberattacks.

Then, for the case of linear MASs, we derive a new sufficient and necessary consensus criterion in terms of the concept of decentralized fixed modes and also present a design procedure of the protocol gains in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Next, a sufficient consensus condition is derived in terms of LMIs for the nonlinear MAS with local proportional–integral (PI) observers. Furthermore, to reduce the complexity of the condition verification, we introduce a graph representation of the fundamental edge states dynamic system and decompose it into strongly connected components and, thus, reorganize the condition in a decentralized form. On this basis, we present a hierarchical method to design the consensus protocols and PI observers based on the information of the subsystem itself only.

Sufficient conditions under which the trajectory of agents&#39; state converges toward the group Nash equilibrium are derived for the proposed update rules.

As a result, traditional continuous linear control schemes require significant modification before application. To address this problem, a new class of distributed robust PWM controllers is proposed, ensuring that each PWM-controlled agent asymptotically converges to the desired position and velocity. In addition, an invariant set-like method is presented that restricts the states of each subsystem to a chosen closed set by analyzing the dynamic relationship between the interactions, as long as the information exchange topology satisfies a mild restriction. Finally, it is demonstrated that by analyzing the dynamic relationship between the interactions of different agents, the closed-loop system converges in the sense of input-to-state stability (ISS).

When moving obstacles block the encircling motion, the enclosing formation contracts toward the target with a precise spacing pattern. Without a priori knowledge of environmental information, the mobile robot group can track and enclose a moving target while guaranteeing limited sensing requirements and collision avoidance with the target, neighboring robots, and obstacles. Under the precision constraint, with an encircling speed assigned to only one robot, the mobile robots are driven by their neighbors until all robots enclose the target as a whole. With the help of velocity observers, the robot group can converge to a small neighborhood of the desired enclosing formation without knowing the target&#39;s velocity.

As a consequence, we derive concentration inequalities to bound the estimation error covariance of the Kalman filter in the semidefinite sense. Concentration inequalities provide a framework for deriving semidefinite bounds that hold in a probabilistic sense. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, we develop algorithmic tools to aid in the implementation of a matrix concentration inequality. Second, we derive concentration-based bounds for three types of stochastic selections.

The core idea of this algorithm is to exchange encrypted random values between cooperative agents before an information iterative update, and then agents construct false initial states based on these random values to replace the original initial states for transmission.

Our interaction-free setup between nodes renders decentralized scheduling challenging, with most existing results focusing on centralized or static solutions. Inspired by congestion control, we propose a new average-based additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) admission control policy, which requires minimal communication between individual nodes and an aggregator. The proposed admission policy infers a discrete-event model expressed as a positive, constrained switching system that is triggered whenever the queue of the aggregation point of requests vanishes. We show convergence of the proposed AIMD system under unknown, peak-bounded workload profiles by analyzing the spectrum of rank-one perturbations of symmetric matrices and the boundedness of the joint spectral radius of sets of symmetric matrices. Contrary to methods that address scheduling and resource allocation asynchronously or via a two-step approach, our AIMD-based scheme can tackle both tasks simultaneously. This is illustrated by proposing a decentralized resource allocation controller coupled with the scheduling scheme leading to a stable closed-loop control system that is guaranteed to avoid underutilization of resources and is tunable via the sets of AIMD parameters.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the multiple dynamic targets formation tracking (MDTFT) problem is studied for multiagent systems. The objective is to drive locally connected agents to form the predefined time-varying formation while tracking the convex hull spanned by multiple targets. In existing results, agents are divided into well-informed and uninformed ones, where it is assumed that the well-informed agents must obtain the information of all the targets. However, in large-scale deployment scenarios, exploring all the targets is a daunting task for well-informed agents. To handle this problem, a new framework is designed to solve the MDTFT problems without a well-informed agent. Each agent is allowed to explore any number of targets depending on its own capability, namely, the general exploring relationship . Then, by using the adaptive mechanism and boundary layer technique, a fully distributed MDTFT algorithm with adaptive gains is constructed to avoid global information and control chattering. Further, a stochastic event-triggered MDTFT algorithm is specifically conceived, in which the continuous communication among agents can be avoided. Compared with the existing event-triggered schemes, the stochastic event-triggered scheme can significantly reduce the triggering times. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MDTFT algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a secure interval estimation method for nonlinear cyber-physical systems (CPSs) suffering from adversary stealthy attacks. A dynamic event-triggered scheme (DETS) is deployed in the estimation framework to reduce the unnecessary waste of limited communication resources. Considering the cases of system information fully/partially known by an adversary, a state estimator is constructed based on the event-triggered system output contained by an adversary. A linear parameter-varying-based (LPV-based) technique is adopted to transform the augmented error dynamic with nonlinearities into an LPV form. By considering the property of stealthy attacks, the amplitude-boundedness of attack signal is deduced, based on which a coordinated design criterion of DETS and observer is presented such that the augmented error dynamic is input-to-state stable with prescribed $\ell _{\infty }$ performance. Then, a zonotope-based secure interval estimation algorithm is designed by considering the uncertainties induced by process disturbance, measurement noise, nonlinearities, DETS protocol, as well as malicious attacks. Finally, simulation results on a vehicle lateral dynamic system show the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed interval estimation method.},

The current work employs those past developments toward the development of a heuristic algorithm able to address larger problem instances that are not amenable to the previous methods. An accompanying set of numerical experiments demonstrates and assesses the computational advantages of this new method.

First, the negative correlation between the model errors and the stealthiness of traditional covert attacks (TCAs) is quantitatively analyzed, where bigger errors bring worse stealthiness. Second, the subspace identification method is used to obtain the identified model of the plant. Furthermore, a novel identification and adaptive compensation-based covert attacks (IACCAs) method is proposed, which can adaptively compensate the attack signals by adaptive law. Although the identification errors exist, the stealthiness of IACCAs is proven to be similar to TCAs with a known model. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed IACCAs method, which can achieve covert attacks with an unknown model.},

In the proposed method, a group of agents cooperatively minimizes a dynamic regret, which is a cumulative loss for estimations of agents against an optimal strategy. The adaptive learning rate of the online algorithm is adjusted using the second moment of the gradient. We consider an event-triggered approach to reduce unnecessary communication. The local communication between agents is performed when the error between the last triggered estimation and the current estimation exceeds a trigger threshold. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves a sublinear regret bound if a path variation of the dynamic optimal strategy is sufficiently small. We also show that the convergence performance is comparable to the time-triggered case while the number of communications is effectively reduced by appropriately setting the threshold for the event-triggered communication.},

A distributed algorithm is proposed via a single-layered grid network, in which each agent only needs to control three scalar states. Second, we consider the case of heterogeneous partitions of linear equations. Two distributed algorithms with a doubled-layered network are developed, which allow each agent&#39;s states to have different dimensions and can be applied to heterogeneous agents with different storage and computation capabilities. Rigorous proofs show that the proposed distributed algorithms collaboratively obtain an LS solution with exponential convergence and also own a solvability verification property, i.e., a criterion to verify whether the obtained solution is an exact solution.

These transitions, which may stem from failures, degradation, or adversarial actions, have been attributed to bifurcations in the nonlinear dynamics. Their approach was built upon the phenomenon of critical slowing down , i.e., slow recovery in response to small perturbations near bifurcations. We extend their approach to detect and localize critical transitions in nonlinear networks. By introducing the notion of network critical slowing down , the objective of this article is to detect that the network is undergoing a bifurcation only by analyzing its signatures from measurement data. We focus on two classes of widely used nonlinear networks: Kuramoto model for the synchronization of coupled oscillators, and attraction–repulsion dynamics in swarms, each of which presents a specific type of bifurcation. Based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down , we study the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed system away and close to the bifurcation and leverage this fact to develop a deterministic method to detect and identify critical transitions in nonlinear networks. Furthermore, we study the state covariance matrix subject to a stochastic noise process away and close to the bifurcation and use it to develop a stochastic framework for detecting critical transitions. Our simulation results show the strengths and limitations of the methods.},

An eavesdropper is an agent inside or outside the network that has access to some subset of the interagent communication messages, and its knowledge set also includes the network topology. Rather than focusing on using a zero-sum and vanishing additive signal, our work determines the necessary and sufficient conditions that define the set of admissible obfuscation signals that do not perturb the convergence point of the algorithm from the average of the reference values of the agents. Of theoretical interest, our results show that this class includes nonvanishing signals as well. Given this broader class of admissible obfuscation signals, we define a deterministic notion of privacy preservation. In this definition, privacy preservation for an agent means that neither the private reference value nor a finite set of values to which the private reference value of the agent belongs to can be obtained.

  abstract     = {In this article, two types of problems: 1) unconstrained and 2) constrained optimization are solved by developing a class of distributed predefined-time algorithms under dynamic event triggered (DET). First, under the zero-gradient-sum framework and DET-called one-to-one type, the distributed predefined-time algorithm, which contains two time-varying functions, is designed to deal with the unconstrained optimization problem in an initialization-free manner. Furthermore, it is proved in detail that the applied DET function can well exclude Zeno behavior through dynamic threshold variable. Second, the DET-based distributed predefined-time algorithm is applied to the optimization problem with supply–demand balance constraint by introducing an auxiliary variable, in which the algorithm can eliminate the disadvantage that the initial state must meet certain conditions, that is, the initial state can be selected arbitrarily. Different from many existing optimization algorithms, the developed two kinds of algorithms in this work exhibit excellent performance in terms of energy saving, convergence time, and initialization free. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms are verified by three numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a differential game-based control scheme to address an attitude takeover control problem via microsatellites attached to the surface of target spacecraft. First, the attitude dynamics of combined spacecraft is reformulated as a general form so as to apply the reinforcement learning framework. Then, quadratic and Arctanh-type performance indices are designed in two cases of free input and input saturation, respectively. Accordingly, optimal control policy of each microsatellite is obtained and is dependent on value functions, which are solutions of a set of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations. Single layer neural networks are employed to approximate value functions by policy iteration and the weights vectors are updated with the help of the concurrent learning algorithm so that the persistent excitation condition of control errors is loosened. Moreover, the necessity of interaction among microsatellites is eliminated by using a tracking differentiator technique to estimate angular accelerations which are not available directly through onboard devices. Stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov method. Three cases of simulation are carried out to demonstrate the robustness and optimality of the proposed control scheme and to validate the effectiveness of the controller in the presence of actuators saturation.},

Particularly, both sampled state and switching signals are included in the controller, which complicates the system analysis and synthesis. An auxiliary system approach is proposed to deal with the above problems and results in a novel system model with a delayed exponential matrix. It is proven that the original system stability could be guaranteed by the constructed auxiliary system. Several stabilization results, whose controller is added in the drift section, are developed to deeply depend on the sampling interval. More extensions are further applied to a stochastic stabilization problem, whose controller is actually added in the diffusion part and act as Brownian noise.

We consider a potential threat to this mechanism, and investigate a time-stamp attack, where a malicious adversary manipulates data packets to degrade the estimation performance of the remote estimator. In particular, we assume that the attacker can alter the time-stamps of any two packets. We consider two types of sensor transmission—namely, innovation and local estimation, respectively, and analyze the evolution of the remote estimation error covariance for both cases. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal attack strategy that maximizes the estimation error covariance from the attacker&#39;s point of view.

The obtained control law guarantees exponential convergence of tracking errors and maintains the solution trajectory of converted states in an invariant set. More important, the original pose error between each unicycle and the leader is proven exponentially convergent to zero, whether or not the leader satisfies persistency of excitation conditions. The extension of the proposed control algorithm to leader-following formation control is also illustrated. Numerical simulations validate the control design.},

It is well known that the negative impedance characteristics of a constant power load (CPL) adversely affect the stability of the network and can cause problems, such as voltage collapse or damage the electronic components. To mitigate this, we propose a two-layer control structure, where at the inner layer, the proposed controller achieves fast tracking of the supplied reference points and ultimate boundedness of the trajectories in a desired set. The outer layer generates the inner-layer reference points, accounts for system constraints, and introduces robustness of the voltage dynamics to unknown perturbations of the CPL demand. For the first time, an investigation of the nonlinear geometric behavior of the CPL is carried out to derive necessary conditions that ensure the boundedness of the network dynamics and feasible regulation to a desired equilibrium set. Finally, control Lyapunov functions are formulated to prove the stability and estimate the region of attraction of the closed-loop dynamics. A simulated scenario of a meshed MG network is presented to confirm the validity of the results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider the periodic event-triggered consensus problem for single-integrator multiagent systems. In existing approaches, consensus is typically achieved by trigger schemes enforcing a monotone decrease of a Lyapunov function. Such trigger schemes may, however, result in more transmissions than are actually required to ensure consensus or meet certain performance specifications. This is because a monotone decrease may be a rather conservative condition for a given Lyapunov function in an event-triggered setting. To overcome the conservativity, we propose a novel window-based trigger scheme, which allows us to leverage existing trigger schemes from the literature to derive less conservative ones. This is achieved by taking the past system behavior into account and allowing a temporary increase of the Lyapunov function as long as a decreasing tendency is still guaranteed. For that, information from previous time steps within certain time windows is considered. We provide an explicit bound on the evolution of the Lyapunov function that is the same for the window-based scheme and the (monotone) original trigger schemes. To illustrate the benefits of the window-based scheme, we validate its efficacy through a comprehensive simulation study and demonstrate that the scheme typically reduces the average update rate of the underlying communication structure in comparison to the original trigger schemes.},

The minimum ZFS problem has numerous applications; for instance, it relates to the minimum leader selection problem for the strong structural controllability of networks defined over graphs. Computing a minimum ZFS is an NP-hard problem in general. We show that the greedy heuristic for the ZFS computation, though it typically performs well, could give arbitrarily bad solutions for some graphs. We provide a linear-time algorithm to compute a minimum ZFS in trees and a complete characterization of the minimum ZFS in the clique chain graphs. We also present a game-theoretic solution for general graphs by formalizing the minimum ZFS problem as a potential game. In addition, we consider the effect of edge augmentation on the size of the ZFS. Adding edges could improve network robustness; however, it could increase the size of the ZFS. We show that adding a set of carefully selected missing edges to a graph may actually reduce the size of the minimum ZFS. Finally, we numerically evaluate our results on random graphs.},

This impedes the optimal resource allocation for high-order MASs, as resulting the discontinuous control signal yields challenges in the explicit controller design. To overcome this problem, a novel integrated event-triggered distributed control strategy is proposed in this article. It achieves the optimal outputs of the MAS under local feasibility constraints. Moreover, the communication burden is significantly reduced. On one hand, only one variable needs to be broadcasted between the neighboring agents. On the other hand, the frequency of data transmission is curtailed by the event-triggered communication protocol. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The communication channel has limited bandwidth and hence the transmitted signals over the network are subject to quantization. To deal with the agent&#39;s output, an observer is implemented at each node. The state of the observer is quantized by a finite-level quantizer and then transmitted over the network. To solve the problem of quantizer overflow under malicious packet losses, a zooming-in and out dynamic quantization mechanism is designed. By the new quantized controller proposed in the article, the zooming-out factor is lower bounded by the spectral radius of the agent&#39;s dynamic matrix. A sufficient condition of quantization range is provided under which the finite-level quantizer is free of overflow. A sufficient condition of tolerable DoS attacks for achieving consensus is also provided. At last, we study scalar dynamical agents as a special case and further tighten the zooming-out factor to a value smaller than the agent&#39;s dynamic parameter. Under such a zooming-out factor, it is possible to recover the level of tolerable DoS attacks to that of unquantized consensus, and the quantizer is free of overflow},

Moreover, by properly setting the threshold function of the event-triggered communication scheme, the CO-DSA maintains the same convergence rate as the algorithm without event-triggered communication. This means the CO-DSA theoretically yields communication efficiency for free. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical findings and also show the excellent communication saving effect of the CO-DSA in large distributed networks.},

Considering the presence of noise, the algorithm is designed to be gradient-free. In addition, an inherent connection is established between the selection of control parameters and the convergence property of the sign gradient-free algorithm, as well as signal strength, noisy intensity, formation radius, and the number of informed robots.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the leader-following formation control problem of nonholonomic agents with a persistently exciting leader based on bearing measurements. A follower needs to maintain a desired relative position to the leader in its local coordinate frame using bearing measurements. An integrated method consisting of a bearing-based estimator and a tracking controller is proposed to achieve the leader-following control objective. The estimator is designed to estimate the relative position to the leader in the follower&#39;s local coordinate frame. Based on the estimated relative position, the controller is proposed to drive the follower to achieve the desired formation. Different from existing integrated methods, our method does not require any conditions on the relative bearing between the leader and the follower in the global frame, which are difficult to guarantee. We characterize the conditions locally on the leader only, namely, conditions on the leader&#39;s linear and angular velocities with persistently exciting steering speed, such that the overall system is asymptotically stable with our integrated method. Besides, the proposed method is extended to the multiagent formation control problem. A reasonable solution is proposed to the multiagent case with a minimal leader–follower structure. Simulations prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods in both cases.},

This article presents a novel controller representation based on input–output history data to implement an encrypted dynamic controller that operates without destabilization and performance degradation. Implementation of this encrypted dynamic controller representation can be optimized via batching techniques to reduce the time and space complexities.

An improved coding–decoding procedure with state-dependent adaptive quantization parameters is established to enable the controller to decode state and mode information from the system and the detector, respectively. Based on this procedure, a decoded-data-based asynchronous SMC strategy is provided, and sufficient conditions are developed to ensure that the closed-loop dynamics are exponentially ultimately bounded and the system state is driven onto a sliding region simultaneously in the sense of mean square. The desired parameters of the quantizer and controller are obtained by solving an optimization problem, in which the objective function is constructed by using the tradeoff between the ultimate state bound and the decay rate. Moreover, the integrative design of the bit rate allocation protocol and quantizer as well as control parameters are converted into a nonlinear programming problem with integer constraint, which is solved by means of an improved sparrow search algorithm. Finally, a direct current motor system is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the present approach under three different cases.},

In this article, we first introduce a new framework for supervisory control of networked DESs. Under the introduced framework, we address the state estimation problem for supervisor synthesis of networked DESs with both communication delays and losses. The estimation algorithm considers the effect of the controls imposed on the system. In addition, the estimation algorithm is based on the control decisions available up to the moment, and all future control decisions are assumed to be unknowable. Two notions, called “observation channel configuration” for tracking observation delays and losses and “control channel configuration” for tracking control delays and losses, are defined. Then, we introduce an online approach for state estimation of the controlled system. Compared with the existing approach, the proposed approach under the introduced framework can estimate the states of the controlled system more accurately. As an application of the proposed approach, we finally show that the existing methods can be applied to synthesize maximally permissible and safe networked supervisors.},

This combinatorial problem is often solved through heuristic centralized methods. In this article, we propose instead a distributed online algorithm through which nodes can migrate among islands, self-organizing the network into a suitable partition. We prove that under a set of appropriate assumptions, the proposed solution yields a partition, whose absolute power imbalance falls within a given bound of the optimal solution.

  abstract     = {The General Lotto game is a well-studied model where two opposing players strategically allocate a limited amount of resources to multiple contests. In the classic setup, each contest represents an individual battlefield with an associated value, and the objective is to maximize the accumulated value by winning individual battlefields. In this article, we consider scenarios beyond the classic setup, where: 1) the notion of a battlefield is generalized to individual contests; 2) success in a contest can depend on securing subsets of battlefields; and 3) the winner of a battlefield can be based on alternate winning rules other than the classic winner-take-all rule. Our main results demonstrate that having an equilibrium solution to a single contest scenario can provide immediate equilibrium characterizations for two important generalizations: 1) The linear-count extension , where performance is measured by the cumulative weight of the contests that are won and 2) the weakest-link extension (best-shot), where one player must win all (at least one) of the constituent contests in order to earn any value. We demonstrate the applicability of these extensions to a general class of network path defense problems. In particular, our results can generate exact solutions to series-parallel networks, as well as provide bounds on equilibrium payoffs bounds for arbitrary networks. To conclude, we provide equilibrium solutions to a novel class of contests with nonlinear favoritism winning rules.},

In addition to the optimal allocation of limited security resources, we analyze the impact of an orthogonal set of defense strategies in the form of network design interventions in the CPS to protect it against the attacker. We first propose an algorithm to simplify the CPS attack graph to an equivalent form, which reduces the computational requirements for characterizing the defender&#39;s optimal security investments. We then evaluate four types of design interventions in the network in the form of adding nodes in the attack graph, interpreted as: 1) introducing additional safeguards; 2) introducing structural redundancies; 3) introducing functional redundancies; and 4) introducing new functionalities. We identify scenarios in which interventions that strengthen internal components of the CPS may be more beneficial than traditional approaches, such as perimeter defense. We showcase our proposed approach in two practical use cases: 1) a remote attack on an industrial CPS and 2) a remote attack on an automotive system. We highlight how our results closely match recommendations made by security organizations and discuss the implications of our findings for CPS design.},

In such a framework, original constrained states of agents are first transformed into free states in a transformed state space. To deal with switching directed graphs, we drive agents toward consensus in the transformed space by leveraging a model reference control scheme, and it is sufficient that the original states reach consensus strictly subject to the time-varying constraints under mild assumptions. A single-layer neural network with weights adapted online is leveraged to approximate the uncertainties in agent dynamics. For external disturbances and reconstruction errors in the approximation, we introduce a robust term with an adaptive gain for compensation. Distributed consensus algorithms are proposed, respectively, for MASs with first- or second-order dynamics. We prove convergence to consensus via Lyapunov analysis and study the proposed algorithms&#39; performance using numerical simulations.},

To describe complex switching phenomenon between different forms of attacks that the adversary may launch on communication channels, the semi-Markov chain (SMC) is introduced. DoS attacks with a stealth characteristic are analyzed from a hidden semi-Markov jump systems perspective by constructing a double-layer stochastic process consisting of an SMC and an observed mode sequence. With the aid of emission probability, an observed-mode-dependent nonfragile controller is designed, which can still stabilize the system even if actual attack modes are unavailable. By utilizing the Lyapunov function that depends on actual attack modes and observed ones, sufficient conditions to ensure the $\delta$ -error mean square stability of the closed-loop system is deduced. Eventually, a simulation related to the mass-spring-damper system with a single channel and an example of the unmanned ground vehicle with two channels are studied, both of which demonstrate the feasibility and validity.},

Despite the presence of adversarial agents, the normal followers not suffering from cyber-attacks seek to achieve a desired formation configuration and track a safe trajectory generated by normal leaders&#39; outputs simultaneously. To this end, a resilient time-varying output formation (RTVOF) tracking scheme is presented in this work. First, to counteract the effect of adversarial agents, a safety strategy is proposed for general linear heterogeneous systems, which is a synthesis of the mean-subsequence-reduced family algorithms and an attack detection procedure. Second, using the neighboring interaction, a resilient distributed observer and a local formation controller are designed for each normal follower to estimate the state and track the output of the safe formation reference. Then, it is proved that the heterogeneous multiagent system with multiple dynamic leaders and time-varying topologies can accomplish the RTVOF tracking if specific graph-theoretic properties and formation feasibility conditions are satisfied.

To this end, we propose a new event-triggering approach for scheduling networked guidance data transmissions between the operator and the controlled dynamical system. The proposed approach utilizes a reference model available to the operator and we explore three event-triggering rules based on an error signal, which is a function of the state of this reference model and the guidance commands. Specifically, the first rule is a standard one in the literature and it is predicated on exchanging sampled guidance commands with the controlled dynamical system. Unlike existing results in the literature, the second and the third rules are, respectively, predicated on exchanging approximated curve-fitted guidance command functions, which are estimated using the current guidance command value and future waypoints, and exact guidance command functions, which are valid over a time-interval. We further generalize our results to address the presence of system uncertainties using adaptive control theory. In addition to providing detailed stability analysis, a numerical example is also given to show that the second and the third rules achieve less guidance data transmissions (i.e., events) between the operator and the controlled dynamical system.},

Then, the bounded consensus tracking performance of disturbed linear MASs with unavailable states is well realized by devising a distributed robust control protocol in terms of the SMO state and event-triggered communication mechanism.

  abstract     = {This article is intended to solve the synchronization control problem for a group of agents with two-timescale characteristic, described by singularly perturbed systems (SPSs) with a small singular perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$ . Three fundamental and yet challenging questions are addressed: 1) how to design a distributed controller to guarantee synchronization of coupled two-timescale agents for $\varepsilon \in (0,\varepsilon ^{*})$ , where the stability bound $\varepsilon ^{*}$ has to be determined?; 2) how to enlarge the stability bound $\varepsilon ^{*}$ for a given feedback gain matrix?; and 3) how to cope with the situation when the singular perturbation parameter exceeds the prescribed stability bound $\varepsilon ^{*}$ ? First, a decoupled method is applied to transfer the synchronization problem of networked two-timescale dynamic agents to the stability problem of SPSs associated with the eigenvalues of the network Laplacian matrix. Second, based on a specially constructed Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions are derived for simultaneously stabilizing the decoupled systems and computing $\varepsilon ^{*}$ by utilizing a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-assisted method. Third, with the derived feedback gain matrix, some criteria are established to further enlarge the stability bound $\varepsilon ^{*}$ . Then, an integrated algorithm is developed to design a distributed controller with an even larger stability bound $\varepsilon ^{*}$ . Fourth, a novel network design method, incorporated with the concept of synchronization region, is proposed as a powerful solution to deal with the case when the feedback gain matrix is incapable of stabilizing the system. Finally, three examples are given to verify the theoretical results.},
