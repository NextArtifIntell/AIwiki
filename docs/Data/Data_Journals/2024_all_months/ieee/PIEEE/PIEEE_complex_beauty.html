  abstract     = {With the exponential surge in diverse multimodal data, traditional unimodal retrieval methods struggle to meet the needs of users seeking access to data across various modalities. To address this, cross-modal retrieval has emerged, enabling interaction across modalities, facilitating semantic matching, and leveraging complementarity and consistency between heterogeneous data. Although prior literature has reviewed the field of cross-modal retrieval, it suffers from numerous deficiencies in terms of timeliness, taxonomy, and comprehensiveness. This article conducts a comprehensive review of cross-modal retrieval’s evolution, spanning from shallow statistical analysis techniques to vision-language pretraining (VLP) models. Commencing with a comprehensive taxonomy grounded in machine learning paradigms, mechanisms, and models, this article delves deeply into the principles and architectures underpinning existing cross-modal retrieval methods. Furthermore, it offers an overview of widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances. Lastly, this article probes the prospects and challenges that confront contemporary cross-modal retrieval, while engaging in a discourse on potential directions for further progress in the field. To facilitate the ongoing research on cross-modal retrieval, we develop a user-friendly toolbox and an open-source repository at https://cross-modal-retrieval.github.io.},

  abstract     = {Web 3.0 pursues the establishment of decentralized ecosystems through blockchain technologies, driving digital transformation in commerce and governance. With consensus algorithms and smart contracts grounded in cryptographic technologies, Web 3.0 enables secure and transparent digital services, such as digital identity, asset management, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and decentralized finance (DeFi), fostering integration between digital and physical economies. As quantum devices rapidly advance, Web 3.0 is being developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the original cryptographic systems that protect data security while reshaping modern cryptography with enhanced quantum computing and communication capabilities. This article provides a comprehensive overview of blockchain-based Web 3.0, examining its quantum and postquantum advancements from two key perspectives. On the one hand, postquantum migration methods and quantum-resistant signatures offer robust solutions to safeguard blockchain against quantum threats. On the other hand, quantum and postquantum encryption and verification algorithms boost blockchain performance, creating a decentralized, secure, and value-driven system. Additionally, we outline potential applications of quantum blockchain and offer guidance for implementation within the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Finally, we discuss future directions for developing a provably secure and decentralized digital ecosystem.},

To alleviate these challenges, a deep learning (DL)-enabled semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising 6G technology enabler, which embodies a paradigm shift that can change the status quo viewpoint that wireless connectivity is an opaque data pipe carrying messages whose context-dependent meanings have been ignored. Since 6G is also critical for the materialization of major SemCom use cases, the paradigms of 6G for SemCom and SemCom for 6G call for a tighter integration of 6G and SemCom. For this purpose, this comprehensive article provides the fundamentals of semantic information, semantic representation, and semantic entropy; details the state-of-the-art SemCom research landscape; presents the major SemCom trends and use cases; discusses current SemCom theories; exposes the fundamental and major challenges of SemCom; and offers future research directions for SemCom.

  abstract     = {Metal-insulator–metal (MIM) capacitors are inevitable and critical passive components in analog, mixed-signal, and memory applications. These capacitors occupy nearly 40% of circuit area among other passive and active components of the integrated circuit (IC). Considering this fact, the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) recognized and recommended the miniaturization of MIM capacitors with high permittivity dielectric materials. For future analog and radio frequency (RF) applications, the IRDS has predicted that MIM capacitors should hold a high capacitance density of $\gt {10}~\text {fF}/\mu \text {m}^{{2}}$ , a low voltage linearity of $\lt {100}~\text {ppm}/\text {V}^{{2}}$ , and a low leakage current density of $\lt {10}~\text {nA}/\text {cm}^{{2}}$ . In this regard, many research works have been carried out over the last few decades with various high-k dielectrics to achieve “low voltage linearity.” However, many of them are facing problems with structural defects, interface traps, and poor polarization process due to limitations of fabrication processes. This article attempts to review the challenges and opportunities involved in the reduction of voltage linearity and leakage of MIM capacitors. Also, this article presents the physical limits and challenges involved in MIM capacitor integration with back end of line (BEOL) process of recent complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Using physical modeling, the design formula for low voltage linearity coefficient was derived, which helps IC developers in the design and implementation of highly linear RF-analog and mixed-signal (AMS) systems.},

However, deploying DL models for MedIA in real-world situations remains challenging due to their failure to generalize across the distributional gap between training and testing samples—a problem known as domain shift. Researchers have dedicated their efforts to developing various DL methods to adapt and perform robustly on unknown and out-of-distribution (OOD) data distributions. This article comprehensively reviews domain generalization (DG) studies specifically tailored for MedIA. We provide a holistic view of how DG techniques interact within the broader MedIA system, going beyond methodologies to consider the operational implications on the entire MedIA workflow. Specifically, we categorize DG methods into data-level, feature-level, model-level, and analysis-level methods. We show how those methods can be used in various stages of the MedIA workflow with DL equipped from data acquisition to model prediction and analysis. Furthermore, we critically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various methods, unveiling future research opportunities.},

In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: 1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions; 2) building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of the sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios; and 3) a detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.},

Given the prominent feature of achieving a 360° smart radio environment, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (STARS) are emerging as one key enabling technology among the family of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for NGMA. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent research progress of STARS, focusing on fundamentals, performance analysis, and full-space beamforming design, as well as promising employments of STARS in NGMA. In particular, we first introduce the basics of STARS by elaborating on the foundational principles and operating protocols as well as discussing different STARS categories and prototypes. Moreover, we systematically survey the existing performance analysis and beamforming design for STARS-aided wireless communications in terms of diverse objectives and different mathematical approaches. Given the superiority of STARS, we further discuss advanced STARS applications as well as the attractive interplay between STARS and other emerging techniques to motivate future works for realizing efficient NGMA.},

On the other hand, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges as a promising candidate for the next-generation multiple access (NGMA), designed to enable massive connectivity and improve spectral efficiency. In this article, we investigate the synergy between NTN and NOMA [power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA)], which are integral in addressing the connectivity challenges of 6G. First, we present an overview of NTN, detailing their types, unique characteristics, and the challenges they face. Then, we explain the foundational principles of NOMA, such as power allocation and access strategies. We, then, argue the suitability of NOMA as an NGMA technology for 6G and how it addresses the specific challenges associated with NTN. Furthermore, we explore the integration and the interplay of NTN and NOMA with emerging technologies such as millimeter-wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz) frequencies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. These advancements are critical in meeting the 6G requirements for extremely high data rates and improved spectral efficiency, enhancing the overall functionality of NTN and NOMA. We, then, examine how NTN using NOMA can use different architectural frameworks, including cellular, cell-free (CF), ad hoc, and integrated access and backhaul (IAB) systems, and detailed several use cases where the integration of NTN and NOMA could have a significant impact, such as in vehicular communications, the Internet of Things (IoT), urban air mobility (UAM), and achieving global connectivity. To optimize NTN using NOMA, we present a comprehensive overview of the mathematical optimization algorithms and machine learning tools. Finally, we elaborate on the primary challenges associated with merging NTN with NOMA and propose relevant future research avenues.},

Traditional MA design and optimization methods are gradually losing ground to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that have proven their superiority in handling complexity. AI-empowered MA and its optimization strategies aimed at achieving high quality-of-service (QoS) are attracting more attention, especially in the area of latency-sensitive applications in 6G systems. In this work, we aim to: 1) present the development and comparative evaluation of AI-enabled MA; 2) provide a timely survey focusing on spectrum sensing, protocol design, and optimization for AI-empowered MA; and 3) explore the potential use cases of AI-empowered MA in the typical application scenarios within 6G systems. Specifically, we first present a unified framework of AI-empowered MA for 6G systems by incorporating various promising machine learning (ML) techniques in spectrum sensing, resource allocation, MA protocol design, and optimization. We then introduce AI-empowered MA spectrum sensing related to spectrum sharing and spectrum interference management. Next, we discuss the AI-empowered MA protocol designs and implementation methods by reviewing and comparing the state of the art and further explore the optimization algorithms related to dynamic resource management, parameter adjustment, and access scheme switching. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, point out open issues, and outline potential future research directions in this field.},

  abstract     = {Multiple access is the cornerstone technology for each generation of wireless cellular networks, which fundamentally determines the method of radio resource sharing and significantly influences both the system performance and transceiver complexity. Meanwhile, resource allocation (RA) design plays a crucial role in multiple access, as it can manage both encompassing radio resources and interference, and it is critical for providing high-speed and reliable communication services to multiple users. Given that the RA design is intrinsically scenario-specific and the optimization tools for RA design are typically varied, in this article, we present a comprehensive tutorial overview for junior researchers in this field, aiming to offer a foundational guide for RA design in the context of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). Our discussion spans a broad range of fundamental topics: from typical system models, through intriguing problem formulation in RA design, to the exploration of various potential optimization solution methodologies. Initially, we identify three types of channels in future wireless cellular networks over which NGMA will be implemented, namely, natural channels, reconfigurable channels, and functional channels. Natural channels are traditional uplink and downlink communication channels; reconfigurable channels are defined as channels that can be proactively reshaped via emerging platforms or techniques, such as intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and movable/fluid antenna (M/FA); and functional channels support not only communication but also other functionalities simultaneously, with typical examples, including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and joint computing and communication (JCAC) channels. Then, we introduce NGMA models applicable to these three types of channels that cover most of the practical communication scenarios of future wireless communications. Subsequently, we articulate the key optimization technical challenges inherent in the RA design for NGMA, categorizing them into rate-, power-, and reliability-oriented RA designs. The corresponding optimization approaches for solving the formulated RA design problems are then presented. Finally, the simulation results are presented and discussed to elucidate the practical implications and insights derived from RA designs in NGMA.},

We first provide a historical survey of the evolution of random access protocols, focusing specifically on the case in which uncoordinated users share a wireless broadcasting medium. Next, we highlight the change of perspective originated by the UMAC model, in which the physical and medium access layer’s protocols cooperate, thus reframing random access as a novel coding-theoretic problem. By now, a large variety of UMAC protocols (codes) emerged, necessitating a certain classification that we indeed propose here. Although some random access schemes require a radical change of the physical layer, others can be implemented with minimal changes to existing industry standards. As an example, we discuss a simple modification to the 5G New Radio (5GNR) Release 16 random access channel that builds on the UMAC theory and that dramatically improves energy efficiency for systems with even moderate number of simultaneous users (e.g., 5–10-dB gain for 10–50 users) and also enables handling of high number of users, something completely out of reach of the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {The next-generation multiple access (NGMA) serves as an umbrella term encompassing transmission schemes distinct from conventional orthogonal methods. As a prominent candidate of NGMA, nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) emerges as a promising solution, enhancing connectivity by allowing multiple users to concurrently share time, frequency, and space. However, NOMA faces challenges in practical implementation, particularly in canceling interuser interference (IUI). In this article, first, we discuss the principles behind NOMA and review the conventional NOMA methods and results. Then, to address the above challenges, we present asynchronous transmission and interference-aware modulation techniques, leading to decoding free from successive interference cancellation (SIC). The goal is to design constellations that dynamically adapt to interference, minimizing bit error rates (BERs) and enhancing user throughput in the presence of IUI, intercarrier interference, and intercell interference (ICI). The traditional linkage between minimizing BER and increasing spectral efficiency is addressed, with the exploration of deep autoencoders (AEs) for end-to-end (E2E) communication as a new concept with significant potential for improving BERs. Interference-aware modulation techniques can revolutionize constellation design and communication over nonorthogonal channels. rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is another promising interference management technique in multiuser systems. Beyond addressing existing challenges and misconceptions in finite-alphabet NOMA, this article offers fresh insights into the field and provides an overview of code-domain NOMA (C-NOMA) schemes, trellis-coded NOMA (TC-NOMA), and RSMA as other potential candidates for NGMA. Additionally, we discuss the evolution of channel coding toward low-latency communication and examine the modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) in fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks. Finally, we examine future research avenues and challenges, highlighting the importance of addressing them for the practical realization of NOMA from a theoretical concept to a functional technology.},

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current set of network architectures for wireless access together with next-generation multiple access technologies. It starts with the classical models for multiple access channel (MAC), broadcast channel (BC), and interference channel (IC) from network information theory and derives the fundamental results on capacity regions and their coding and signal processing schemes. Extensions to multicarrier, multiantenna, and multicell scenarios are discussed. The evolution from orthogonal to spatial-division multiple access (SDMA), nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) techniques and their performance guarantees are carefully explained. Recent advances toward multiconnectivity, cloud-RAN (C-RAN), and cell-free multiple access (CFMA) are explained. The data rate benefits of an anecdotal open RAN network are developed and the corresponding user data rates are calculated. Massive random and grant-free access schemes are also discussed.

  abstract     = {Cellular communication standards have been established to ensure connectivity across most urban environments, complemented by deployment hardware and facilities tailored for city life. At the same time, numerous initiatives seek to broaden connectivity to rural and developing areas. However, with nearly half the global population still offline, there is an urgent need to drive research toward enhancing connectivity in areas and conditions that deviate from the norm. This article delves into innovative communication solutions not only for hard-to-reach and extreme environments but also introduces “hard-to-serve” areas as a crucial, yet underexplored, category within the broader spectrum of connectivity challenges. We explore the latest advancements in communication systems designed for environments subject to extreme temperatures, harsh weather, excessive dust, or even disasters such as fires. Our exploration spans the entire communication stack, covering communications on isolated islands, sparsely populated regions, mountainous terrains, and even underwater and underground settings. We highlight system architectures, hardware, materials, algorithms, and other pivotal technologies that promise to connect these challenging areas. Through case studies, we explore the application of 5G for innovative research, long range (LoRa) for audio messages and emails, LoRa wireless connections, free-space optics, communications in underwater and underground scenarios, delay-tolerant networks, satellite links, and the strategic use of shared spectrum and TV white space (TVWS) to improve mobile connectivity in secluded and remote regions. These studies also touch on prevalent challenges such as power outages, regulatory gaps, technological availability, and human resource constraints, where we introduce the concept of peri-urban hard-to-serve areas where populations might struggle with affordability or lack the skills for traditional connectivity solutions. This article provides an exhaustive summary of our research, showcasing how 6G and future networks will play a crucial role in delivering connectivity to areas that are hard-to-reach, hard-to-serve, or subject to extreme conditions (ECs).},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have emerged as pivotal enablers across a multitude of industries, including consumer electronics, healthcare, and manufacturing, largely due to their significant resurgence over the past decade. The transformative power of AI is primarily derived from the utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs), which require extensive data for training and substantial computational resources for processing. Consequently, DNN models are typically trained and deployed on resource-rich cloud servers. However, due to potential latency issues associated with cloud communications, deep learning (DL) workflows (e.g., DNN training and inference) are increasingly being transitioned to wireless edge networks in proximity to end-user devices (EUDs). This shift is designed to support latency-sensitive applications and has given rise to a new paradigm of edge AI, which will play a critical role in upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks to support ubiquitous AI applications. Despite its considerable potential, edge AI faces substantial challenges, mostly due to the dichotomy between the resource limitations of wireless edge networks and the resource-intensive nature of DL. Specifically, the acquisition of large-scale data, as well as the training and inference processes of DNNs, can rapidly deplete the battery energy of EUDs. This necessitates an energy-conscious approach to edge AI to ensure both optimal and sustainable performance. In this article, we present a contemporary survey on green edge AI. We commence by analyzing the principal energy consumption components of edge AI systems to identify the fundamental design principles of green edge AI. Guided by these principles, we then explore energy-efficient design methodologies for the three critical tasks in edge AI systems, including training data acquisition, edge training, and edge inference. Finally, we underscore potential future research directions to further enhance the energy efficiency (EE) of edge AI.},

Given the increasing need of multifunctional wireless networks for integrated communications, sensing, localization, and computing, coupled with the surge of machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) in wireless networks, MA techniques are expected to experience a paradigm shift in 6G and beyond. In this article, we provide a tutorial, survey, and outlook on past, emerging, and future MA techniques and pay particular attention to how wireless network intelligence and multifunctionality will lead to a rethinking of those techniques. This article starts with an overview of orthogonal, physical-layer multicasting, space domain, power domain (PD), rate-splitting, code-domain MAs, MAs in other domains, and random access (RA), and highlights the importance of conducting research in universal MA (UMA) to shrink instead of grow the knowledge tree of MA schemes by providing a unified understanding of MA schemes across all resource dimensions. It then jumps into rethinking MA schemes in the era of wireless network intelligence, covering AI for MA such as AI-empowered resource allocation, optimization, channel estimation, and receiver designs, for different MA schemes, and MA for AI such as federated learning (FL)/edge intelligence and over-the-air computation (AirComp). We then discuss MA for network multifunctionality and the interplay between MA and integrated sensing, localization, and communications, covering MA for joint sensing and communications, multimodal sensing-aided communications, multimodal sensing and digital twin-assisted communications, and communication-aided sensing/localization systems. We finish with studying MA for emerging intelligent applications such as semantic communications (SeComs), virtual reality (VR), and smart radio and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), before presenting a roadmap toward 6G standardization. Throughout the text, we also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.},

  abstract     = {Wireless information and energy transfer (WIET) represents an emerging paradigm that employs controllable transmission of radio frequency signals for the dual purpose of data communication and wireless charging. As such, WIET is widely regarded as an enabler of envisioned sixth-generation (6G) use cases that rely on energy-sustainable Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, such as smart cities and smart grids. Meeting the quality-of-service demands of WIET, in terms of both data transfer and power delivery, requires effective codesign of the information and energy signals. In this article, we present the main principles and design aspects of WIET, focusing on its integration in 6G networks. First, we discuss how conventional communication notions, such as resource allocation and waveform design, need to be revisited in the context of WIET. Next, we consider various candidate 6G technologies that can boost WIET efficiency, namely, holographic multiple-input multiple-output, near-field beamforming, terahertz communication, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), and reconfigurable (fluid) antenna arrays. We introduce respective WIET design methods, analyze the promising performance gains of these WIET systems, and discuss challenges, open issues, and future research directions. Finally, a near-field energy beamforming scheme and a power-based IRS beamforming algorithm are experimentally validated using a wireless energy transfer testbed. The vision of WIET in communication systems has been gaining momentum in recent years, with constant progress with respect to theoretical and also practical aspects. The comprehensive overview of the state of the art of WIET presented in this article highlights the potential of WIET systems and their overall benefits in 6G networks.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid dynamical systems, i.e., systems that have both continuous and discrete states, are ubiquitous in engineering but are difficult to work with due to their discontinuous transitions. For example, a robot leg is able to exert very little control effort, while it is in the air compared to when it is on the ground. When the leg hits the ground, the penetrating velocity instantaneously collapses to zero. These instantaneous changes in dynamics and discontinuities (or jumps) in state make standard smooth tools for planning, estimation, control, and learning difficult for hybrid systems. One of the key tools for accounting for these jumps is called the saltation matrix. The saltation matrix is the sensitivity update when a hybrid jump occurs and has been used in a variety of fields, including robotics, power circuits, and computational neuroscience. This article presents an intuitive derivation of the saltation matrix and discusses what it captures, where it has been used in the past, how it is used for linear and quadratic forms, how it is computed for rigid body systems with unilateral constraints, and some of the structural properties of the saltation matrix in these cases.},

  abstract     = {Brain-inspired computing (BIC) is an emerging research field that aims to build fundamental theories, models, hardware architectures, and application systems toward more general artificial intelligence (AI) by learning from the information processing mechanisms or structures/functions of biological nervous systems. It is regarded as one of the most promising research directions for future intelligent computing in the post-Moore era. In the past few years, various new schemes in this field have sprung up to explore more general AI. These works are quite divergent in the aspects of modeling/algorithm, software tool, hardware platform, and benchmark data since BIC is an interdisciplinary field that consists of many different domains, including computational neuroscience, AI, computer science, statistical physics, material science, and microelectronics. This situation greatly impedes researchers from obtaining a clear picture and getting started in the right way. Hence, there is an urgent requirement to do a comprehensive survey in this field to help correctly recognize and analyze such bewildering methodologies. What are the key issues to enhance the development of BIC? What roles do the current mainstream technologies play in the general framework of BIC? Which techniques are truly useful in real-world applications? These questions largely remain open. To address the above issues, in this survey, we first clarify the biggest challenge of BIC: how can AI models benefit from the recent advancements in computational neuroscience? With this challenge in mind, we will focus on discussing the concept of BIC and summarize four components of BIC infrastructure development: 1) modeling/algorithm; 2) hardware platform; 3) software tool; and 4) benchmark data. For each component, we will summarize its recent progress, main challenges to resolve, and future trends. Based on these studies, we present a general framework for the real-world applications of BIC systems, which is promising to benefit both AI and brain science. Finally, we claim that it is extremely important to build a research ecology to promote prosperity continuously in this field.},

  abstract     = {Multitask learning (MTL) aims to learn multiple tasks simultaneously while exploiting their mutual relationships. By using shared resources to simultaneously calculate multiple outputs, this learning paradigm has the potential to have lower memory requirements and inference times compared to the traditional approach of using separate methods for each task. Previous work in MTL has mainly focused on fully supervised methods, as task relationships (TRs) can not only be leveraged to lower the level of data dependency of those methods but also improve the performance. However, MTL introduces a set of challenges due to a complex optimization scheme and a higher labeling requirement. This article focuses on how MTL could be utilized under different partial supervision settings to address these challenges. First, this article analyses how MTL traditionally uses different parameter sharing techniques to transfer knowledge in between tasks. Second, it presents different challenges arising from such a multiobjective optimization (MOO) scheme. Third, it introduces how task groupings (TGs) can be achieved by analyzing TRs. Fourth, it focuses on how partially supervised methods applied to MTL can tackle the aforementioned challenges. Lastly, this article presents the available datasets, tools, and benchmarking results of such methods.

  abstract     = {Time-division duplex (TDD) and frequency-division duplex (FDD) are mainly used in commercial new radio (NR) deployments, where the time- or frequency-domain resources are split between downlink (DL) and uplink (UL). Full duplex (FD) will enable 5G-advanced and 6G systems to go beyond TDD and FDD operation into a new duplexing mode that leverages the benefits of both TDD/FDD deployments. It achieves higher throughput and lower latency while enabling flexible UL/DL scheduling. However, there are several challenges that need to be overcome to enable FD operation in large-scale system deployment, including intranode and internode [user equipment (UE) and next-generation node B (5G base station)] interference along with intercarrier interference. In this article, we present solutions to mitigate self-interference (SI) and cross-link interference (CLI) in 5G-advanced/6G systems, provide system-level evaluations, and discuss the outcome of Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) study item on duplexing evolution. We introduce the concept of subband FD (SBFD) as an effective solution for a macro network to achieve the key features of FD, such as latency reduction and UL link budget improvement. Finally, we present the field test results for the performance of world-first SBFD prototype of high transmit power massive-multi-input-multioutput (MIMO) macro network.},

  abstract     = {Full-duplex (FD) technology is gaining popularity for integration into a wide range of wireless networks due to its demonstrated potential in recent studies. In contrast to half-duplex (HD) technology, the implementation of FD in networks necessitates considering internode interference (INI) from various network perspectives. When deploying FD technology in networks, several critical factors must be taken into account. These include self-interference (SI) and the requisite SI cancellation (SIC) processes, as well as the selection of multiple user equipment (UE) per time slot. In addition, INI, including cross-link interference (CLI) and intercell interference (ICI), becomes a crucial issue during concurrent uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission and reception, similar to SI. Since most INIs are challenging to eliminate, a comprehensive investigation that covers radio resource control (RRC), medium access control (MAC), and the physical (PHY) layer is essential in the context of FD network design, rather than focusing on individual network layers and types. This article covers state-of-the-art studies, including protocols and documents from the third-generation partnership project (3GPP) for FD, MAC protocol, user scheduling, and CLI handling. The methods are also compared through a network-level system simulation based on 3-D ray tracing.},

One of the fundamental challenges in realizing IBFD is self-interference that can be up to 100 dB stronger than signals of interest. Thus, we start by reviewing state-of-the-art research in self-interference cancellation, addressing both model-based and emerging machine learning-based methods. Then, we turn our attention to new wireless systems with many degrees of freedom for which the traditional IBFD designs do not gracefully scale and, hence, require many innovations to enable IBFD. We provide an extensive review of basic concepts and state of the art in massive multiple-input–multiple-output IBFD. Then, we consider the mmWave band IBFD and review advanced physical-layer architectures. The above review provides the proper context to discuss IBFD innovations and new challenges for sixth-generation networks and beyond, where wireless networks are envisioned to be multifunctional, combining communications with functions such as sensing, cognitive radios, physical-layer security, and wireless power transfer. We conclude this article with a status update on the adoption of IBFD in communication standards.},

  abstract     = {The relentless demand for data in our society has driven the continuous evolution of wireless technologies to enhance network capacity. While current deployments of 5G have made strides in this direction using massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands, all existing wireless systems operate in a half-duplex (HD) mode. Full-duplex (FD) wireless communication, on the other hand, enables simultaneous transmission and reception (STAR) of signals at the same frequency, offering advantages such as enhanced spectrum efficiency, improved data rates, and reduced latency. This article presents a comprehensive review of FD wireless systems, with a focus on hardware design, implementation, cross-layered considerations, and applications. The major bottleneck in achieving FD communication is the presence of self-interference (SI) signals from the transmitter (TX) to the receiver, and achieving SI cancellation (SIC) with real-time adaption is critical for FD deployment. The review starts by establishing a system-level understanding of FD wireless systems, followed by a review of the architectures of antenna interfaces and integrated RF and baseband (BB) SI cancellers, which show promise in enabling low-cost, small-form-factor, portable FD systems. We then discuss digital cancellation techniques, including digital signal processing (DSP)- and learning-based algorithms. The challenges presented by FD phased-array and MIMO systems are discussed, followed by system-level aspects, including optimization algorithms, opportunities in the higher layers of the networking protocol stack, and testbed integration. Finally, the relevance of FD systems in applications such as next-generation (xG) wireless, mmWave repeaters, radars, and noncommunication domains is highlighted. Overall, this comprehensive review provides valuable insights into the design, implementation, and applications of FD wireless systems while opening up new directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {Modern power systems are the backbone of our society, supplying electric energy for daily activities. With the integration of communication networks and high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs), modern power systems have evolved into a cross-domain multilayer complex system of systems with improved efficiency, controllability, and sustainability. However, increasing numbers of unexpected events, including natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyberattacks, are compromising the functionality of modern power systems and causing tremendous societal and economic losses. Resilience, a desirable property, is needed in modern power systems to ensure their capability to withstand all kinds of hazards while maintaining their functions. This article presents a systematic review of recent power system resilience enhancement techniques and proposes new directions for enhancing modern power systems’ resilience considering their cross-domain multilayer features. We first answer the question, “what is power system resilience?” from the perspectives of its definition, constituents, and categorization. It is important to recognize that power system resilience depends on two interdependent factors: network design and system operation. Following that, we present a review of articles published since 2016 that have developed innovative methodologies to improve power system resilience and categorize them into infrastructural resilience enhancement and operational resilience enhancement. We discuss their problem formulations and proposed quantifiable resilience measures, as well as point out their merits and limitations. Finally, we argue that it is paramount to leverage higher order subgraph studies and scientific machine learning (SciML) for modern power systems to capture the interdependence and interactions across heterogeneous networks and data for holistically enhancing their infrastructural and operational resilience.},

Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), also called intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), are two promising technologies for coping with these unprecedented demands. Given their distinct capabilities, integrating the two technologies to further enhance wireless network performances has received great research and development attention.

We first introduce system models focusing on system architecture and application scenarios, channel models, and communication protocols. Subsequently, we summarize the relevant studies on system operation and resource allocation, providing in-depth analyses and discussions. Following this, we present practical challenges faced by RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, particularly those introduced by RIS, such as hardware impairments (HIs) and electromagnetic interference (EMI). We summarize the corresponding analyses and solutions to further facilitate the implementation of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems. Furthermore, we explore an interplay between RIS-aided CF mMIMO and other emerging 6G technologies, such as millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), next-generation multiple access (NGMA), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

  abstract     = {Bitcoin’s success as a global cryptocurrency has paved the way for the emergence of blockchain, a revolutionary category of distributed systems. However, the growing popularity of blockchain has led to a significant divergence from its core principles in many systems labeled as “blockchain.” This divergence has introduced complexity into the blockchain ecosystem, exacerbated by a lack of comprehensive reviews on blockchain and its variants. Consequently, gaining a clear and updated understanding of the diverse spectrum of current blockchain and blockchain-like systems has become challenging. This situation underscores the necessity for an extensive literature review and the development of thematic taxonomies. This survey seeks to offer a comprehensive and current assessment of existing blockchains and their variations while delineating the boundaries between blockchain and blockchain-like systems. To achieve this objective, we propose a holistic reference model for conceptualizing and analyzing these systems. Our layer-wise framework envisions all distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) as composed of four principal layers: data, consensus, execution, and application (DCEA). In addition, we introduce a new taxonomy that enhances the classification of blockchain and blockchain-like systems, offering a more useful perspective than existing works. Furthermore, we conduct a state-of-the-art review from a layered perspective, employing 23 evaluative criteria predefined by our framework. We perform a qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis of 44 DLT solutions and 26 consensus mechanisms while discussing differences and boundaries between blockchain and blockchain-like systems. We emphasize the significant challenges and tradeoffs encountered by distributed ledger designers, decision-makers, and project managers during the design or adoption of a DLT solution. Finally, we outline crucial research challenges and directions in the field of DLTs.},

In this article, we aim to understand and explain this phenomenon by investigating the root cause of the problem. To this end, we examine Internet-based SE attacks and defenses through a unique lens based on psychological factors (PFs) and psychological techniques (PTs). We find that there is a key discrepancy between attacks and defenses: SE attacks have deliberately exploited 46 PFs and 16 PTs in total, but existing defenses have only leveraged 16 PFs and seven PTs in total. This discrepancy may explain why existing defenses have achieved limited success and prompt us to propose a systematic roadmap for future research.},

  abstract     = {The importance of ground mobile robots (MRs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within the research community, industry, and society is growing fast. Nowadays, many of these agents are equipped with communication systems that are, in some cases, essential to successfully achieve certain tasks. In this context, we have begun to witness the development of a new interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of robotics and communications. This research field has been boosted by the intention of integrating UAVs within the 5G and 6G communication networks and will undoubtedly lead to many important applications in the near future. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles to the development of this research area is that most researchers address these problems by oversimplifying either the robotics or the communications aspects. Doing so impedes the ability to reach the full potential of this new interdisciplinary research area. In this tutorial, we present some of the modeling tools necessary to address problems involving both robotics and communication from an interdisciplinary perspective. As an illustrative example of such problems, we focus on the issue of communication-aware trajectory planning in this tutorial.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a series of competent graph learning methods for diverse real-world scenarios, ranging from daily applications such as recommendation systems and question answering to cutting-edge technologies such as drug discovery in life sciences and n-body simulation in astrophysics. However, task performance is not the only requirement for GNNs. Performance-oriented GNNs have exhibited potential adverse effects, such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, unexplainable discrimination against disadvantaged groups, or excessive resource consumption in edge computing environments. To avoid these unintentional harms, it is necessary to build competent GNNs characterized by trustworthiness. To this end, we propose a comprehensive roadmap to build trustworthy GNNs from the view of the various computing technologies involved. In this survey, we introduce basic concepts and comprehensively summarize existing efforts for trustworthy GNNs from six aspects, including robustness, explainability, privacy, fairness, accountability, and environmental well-being. In addition, we highlight the intricate cross-aspect relations between the above six aspects of trustworthy GNNs. Finally, we present a thorough overview of trending directions for facilitating the research and industrialization of trustworthy GNNs.},

  abstract     = {Gustav Fechner’s 1860 delineation of psychophysics, the measurement of sensation in relation to its stimulus, is widely considered to be the advent of modern psychological science. In psychophysics, a researcher parametrically varies some aspects of a stimulus and measures the resulting changes in a human subject’s experience of that stimulus; doing so gives insight into the determining relationship between a sensation and the physical input that evoked it. This approach is used heavily in perceptual domains, including signal detection, threshold measurement, and ideal observer analysis. Scientific fields, such as vision science, have always leaned heavily on the methods and procedures of psychophysics, but there is now growing appreciation of them by machine learning researchers, sparked by widening overlap between biological and artificial perception [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] . Machine perception that is guided by behavioral measurements, as opposed to guidance restricted to arbitrarily assigned human labels, has significant potential to fuel further progress in artificial intelligence (AI).},

  abstract     = {Physical layer covert communication is a crucial secure communication technology that enables a transmitter to convey information covertly to a recipient without being detected by adversaries. Unlike typical cryptography and physical layer security systems that concentrate on protecting the sent signal content, covert communications seek to conceal the existence of legitimate transmission. Thus, with beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communications, covert communications can operate in tandem or as a supplement to conventional security techniques. We provide an extensive overview of the basic theories and several strategies in physical layer covert communications in this article. In particular, we go into great detail about the basic theories of physical layer covert communications, such as channel models, codes, secret keys, and covertness metrics, as well as various covert schemes in progressively more complicated scenarios, such as covert communications in single-antenna and multiantenna three-node systems and covert communications in jammer- and relay-aided systems. In addition, we identify the challenges and future directions for research on covert communications in B5G wireless networks.},

Cloud-native computing, as the most influential development principle for web applications, has already attracted increasingly more attention in both industry and academia. Despite the momentum in the cloud-native industrial community, a clear research roadmap on this topic is still missing. As a contribution to this knowledge, this article surveys key issues during the life cycle of cloud-native applications, from the perspective of services. Specifically, we elaborate on the research domains by decoupling the life cycle of cloud-native applications into four states: building, orchestration, operation, and maintenance. We also discuss the fundamental necessities and summarize the key performance metrics that play critical roles during the development and management of cloud-native applications. We highlight the key implications and limitations of existing works in each state. The challenges, future directions, and research opportunities are also discussed.},
